        Lai Siu Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal by Ching Mun Fong
                    (“the plaintiff”) in Registrar’s Appeal No 236 of 2011
                    (“the Appeal”) against the decision of the Assistant Registrar
                    dismissing her application for pre-action discovery. I dismissed the Appeal. As
                    the plaintiff has appealed (in Civil Appeal No 120 of 2011) against my decision,
                    I shall now set out the grounds for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff is a private banking client of
                    Standard Chartered Bank (“the defendant”). She opened an account
                    with the defendant on 4 August 2009 by signing an Account Opening
                    Application Form (“account opening form”). This account opening
                    form was made subject to the Standard Chartered Private Bank General Terms and
                    Conditions (“SCPB General Terms”). Over the course of the banking
                    relationship between the parties, the defendant was instructed by the plaintiff
                    to enter into two Commodity-Linked Premium Currency Investments
                    (“CPCI”) deals. This was an investment involving currency options
                    which gave the defendant the right to repay the plaintiff her principal
                    investment sum in either XAU (a unit of measurement for gold) or US Dollars upon
                    the maturity of the CPCI. On 11and 14 September 2009, the defendant
                    exercised the currency options such that US Dollars (and not gold) was credited
                    into the plaintiff’s account. The defendant’s entitlement to do this
                    was disputed by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The present originating summons was thus filed
                    by the plaintiff, seeking pre-action discovery of the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     A complete set/s of account opening
                        forms including the terms and conditions thereof, which the plaintiff has or
                        may have had with the defendant;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     All records, including mechanical, audio, written and
                        computer records of the purported trades effected by the defendant in
                        respect of any or all of the plaintiff’s accounts with the defendant
                        for the dates 29 June 2010, 1 July 2010, and 2 July 2010;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_c"></a>(c)     All records,
                        documents, memos and correspondence related to the two CPCI
                    deals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Eventually, the plaintiff decided only to
                    proceed with items (b) and (c) above – specifically, she was seeking
                    pre-action discovery of the voice logs of the communications which she had with
                    the defendant’s representatives in relation to the two CPCI
                deals.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       As indicated by the plaintiff’s affidavit,
                    her contemplated claims are in contract and tort. She alleged that the defendant
                    had breached its contractual obligations to her, and further that the
                    defendant’s failure to properly advise her was a breach of duty giving
                    rise to a claim in the tort of negligence. However, the plaintiff submitted that
                    she would not be able to plead a case against the defendant without the
                    voice-logs. In particular, she argued that pre-action discovery of the
                    voice-logs will enable her to evaluate whether she has a good cause of action
                    (under contract and/or tort) against the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       As for the defendant, its position was that the
                    plaintiff was not at all constrained from starting proceedings or pleading her
                    case without the voice-logs. The defendant contended that the documentary
                    records it had already provided gave the plaintiff sufficient information to
                    institute proceedings and plead her case. Pre-action discovery should
                    accordingly be refused.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law on pre-action discovery</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The power of the court to order pre-action
                    discovery is found under O 24 r 6(1) of the Rules of Court
                    (Cap 332, R5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”). As per
                    any application for discovery, the test of necessity defines the scope of the
                    court’s discretion in deciding whether or not pre-action discovery is
                    appropriate (see O 24 r 7 of the Rules of Court). In the context of
                    pre-action discovery however, the test of necessity must be understood in the
                    light of the purpose for which pre-action discovery is sought (see <em>Singapore Court Practice 2009</em> (Jeffrey Pinsler gen ed)
                    (LexisNexis, 2009) [“<em>Singapore Court
                        Practice</em>”] at para 24/6/2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       What then is the purpose of pre-action
                    discovery? In <em>Kuah Kok Kim v Ernst &amp; Young</em>
                    [1996] 3 SLR(R) 485 (“<em>Kuah Kok
                        Kim</em>”) at [31], the Court of Appeal explained that
                    pre-action discovery is to assist a plaintiff who “does not yet know
                    whether he has a viable claim against the defendant, and the rule is there to
                    assist him in his search for the answer”. The word “viable”
                    must not be understood to mean that the plaintiff is entitled to pre-action
                    discovery for the purposes of augmenting his case or to ‘complete his
                    entire picture of the case’. If that was the case, the ordinary processes
                    of general and specific discovery under O 24 r 1 and r 5
                    respectively would be subverted (see <em>Singapore Court
                        Practice</em> at para 24/6/2). Instead, pre-action discovery
                    serves a somewhat more modest purpose: it is merely to allow the plaintiff who
                    suspects he has a case to obtain the necessary information to allow him to
                    commence proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In <em>Bayerische Hypo-und
                        Vereinsbank AG v Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2004] 4 SLR(R) 39 (“<em>Asia Pacific
                        Breweries</em>)”, the finance manager of the defendant, one
                    Mr Chia, had deceived the plaintiff banks into thinking the defendant was
                    borrowing money from them by forging the signatures of the defendant’s
                    directors on various resolutions. Mr Chia eventually pleaded guilty to
                    forgery and cheating. In an attempt to sue the defendant itself for return of
                    the money, the plaintiff banks sought pre-action discovery of documents relating
                    to Mr Chia’s circumstances of employment and responsibility to show
                    that, in spite of Mr Chia’s fraud, a banker-customer relationship
                    nevertheless existed between the plaintiff banks and the defendant. The High
                    Court explained at [25] that pre-action discovery should only be allowed if the
                    potential plaintiff is unable to initiate a case without the desired
                    information: the purpose of pre-action discovery is simply to fill the voids or
                    gaps in his knowledge which otherwise prevent him from pleading a
                case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The High Court in <em>Asia
                        Pacific Breweries</em> at [26] also stressed that the court will not
                    allow pre-action discovery simply because the potential plaintiff disputed the
                    defendant’s version of events, for it would otherwise lead to pre-action
                    discovery being granted in every dispute:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my judgment, a disbelief of APBS's position itself cannot be a
                        sufficient reason for seeking pre-action discovery. Otherwise, it will
                        result in pre-action disclosure being applied for as a matter of course.
                        That is not what the procedure is intended for. Invariably, cases that make
                        their way to court are founded on a mutual disbelief of each other's
                        perception of things, and a face-off is a situation common in any dispute
                        before the commencement of proceedings. I have already pointed out in
                            [4] that the criterion of
                        O 24 r 6(3) is intended to ensure that the application for
                        pre-action discovery is not brought frivolously or without
                        justification.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As it was clear that the banks knew their causes of action and were
                    not otherwise constrained from commencing proceedings, the court declined to
                    grant pre-action discovery. <em>Asia Pacific Breweries</em>
                    thus illustrates that pre-action discovery would be flatly refused by the court
                    if instead of seeking to ascertain whether there was any basis for bringing a
                    claim, the purpose of the application was in reality to enable the potential
                    plaintiff to either assess or augment the strength of his claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     
          <em>Ng Giok Oh v Sajjad
                        </em>
<em>Akhtar</em> [2003]
                    1 SLR(R) 375 (“<em>Ng Giok
                    Oh</em>”) involved applicants claiming to have a cause of action in
                    negligence against certain court assessors in relation to the valuation of
                    properties done by the latter. As the applicants were in a position to commence
                    proceedings, the court ruled that they ought to commence discovery in the usual
                    course, instead of applying for pre-action discovery in order to uncover further
                    causes of action against the assessors. The court stated at [7] that pre-action discovery “is not an
                    instrument for private detectives snooping for action”. This must be
                    correct as pre-action discovery exists only for the limited purpose of allowing
                    potential plaintiffs to obtain the evidence needed to mount a claim, and not to
                    fish for additional evidence to ground further causes of action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The two cases discussed above may be
                    contrasted with the case of <em>Beckkett Pte Ltd v Deutsche Bank
                        AG Singapore Branch</em> [2003] SLR(R) 321
                        (“<em>Beckkett</em>”). In <em>Beckkett</em>, the defendant bank (<em>qua</em> pledgee) had sold certain shares belonging to the plaintiff
                        (<em>qua</em> pledgor). The plaintiff sought pre-action
                    discovery of documents relating to the “details of the manner of sale of
                    the pledged shares (whether by private treaty or auction)”. Pre-action
                    discovery was granted as without the information sought, the plaintiff would
                    have no idea whether it had a basis to bring a claim against the defendant for
                    failing to take reasonable steps to obtain the best sale price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Rules of Court exists to provide a
                    systematic and orderly process for the discovery of evidence leading to trial.
                    The rule allowing for pre-action discovery complements this by helping potential
                    plaintiffs to ascertain if they are in a position to commence proceedings: by
                    virtue of the disclosed documents the potential plaintiff will be able to decide
                    if he has a cause of action against the defendant. It is in this sense that the
                    procedure for pre-action discovery helps “to encourage the quick
                    settlement of disputes by early and full disclosure of relevant
                    documents” (see <em>Kuah Kok Kim</em> at [40]).
                    However, in the event that the plaintiff is already in a position to commence
                    proceedings, he must not be allowed to take advantage of the rules to jump-start
                    the ordinary process of discovery of evidence in order to gain a tactical
                    advantage, harass his opponent, or to ‘snoop for action’. To allow
                    that would be to subvert the regime for discovery of evidence put in place by
                    the Rules of Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In the light of the principles elucidated
                    above, it became immediately apparent that the plaintiff’s application for
                    pre-action discovery of the voice-logs was without justification. Unlike the
                    pledgor in <em>Beckkett</em>, the plaintiff was not in a
                    position in which she required the voice-logs in order to determine if she had a
                    claim against the defendant. The dispute here centred on what took place during
                    the conversations between the plaintiff and the defendant’s
                    representatives. Both parties did not dispute that the conversations took place.
                    The gravamen of the plaintiff’s complaint was simply that the
                    defendant’s representatives had failed to properly advise her before
                    exercising the currency options. The defendant argued that it did. Based on the
                    contract between the parties and the plaintiff’s own personal knowledge of
                    what transpired during those conversations, the plaintiff was more than able to
                    plead her case for breach of contract and/or the tort of negligence; more so
                    when the plaintiff also had in her possession the relevant bank statements
                    provided by the defendant evidencing the CPCI transactions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Like the plaintiff banks in <em>Asia Pacific Breweries</em>, the plaintiff was trying to bolster her
                    contemplated claim(s). By her own admission in her skeletal submissions, she
                    sought pre-action discovery of the voice-logs in order to evaluate whether the
                    defendant had discharged its duty of care in contract and tort. She was seeking
                    pre-action discovery of the voice-logs in order to determine whether she had a
                    “good cause of action” as opposed to “a cause of
                    action”. As explained above, that plainly is not the purpose of O 24
                    r 6(1). The proper course of action was for the plaintiff to commence
                    proceedings and avail herself of the ordinary processes of general and specific
                    discovery under O24 r 1 and r 5 respectively. Since the defendant was
                    asserting positively that it did discharge its duty of care towards the
                    plaintiff, the likelihood is that it must necessarily produce the voice-logs.
                    That however was ultimately a matter for post-action and not pre-action
                    discovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Is there anything in the SCPB General Terms and/or the Banking Act
                that would otherwise entitle the plaintiff to pre-action discovery?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     For completeness, it ought to be pointed out
                    that the plaintiff also sought to rely on cl 9.1 of the SCPB General Terms
                    read with s 47 of the Banking Act (Cap 19, 2008 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Banking Act”). In so far as the plaintiff was arguing that
                    the cl 9.1 and/or s 47 of the Banking Act entitled her to pre-action
                    discovery, despite her failure to meet the test of necessity under O 24
                    r 6(1), my view was that this argument was wholly misguided and without
                    merit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Clause 9.1 of the SCPB General Terms
                    reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Telephone Recordings:</b> The Client consents to
                        the Bank recording or memorialising telephone and oral conversations with
                        the Client by audio recording devices...and the Client agrees that any such
                        notes and records of the Bank will constitute conclusive evidence as against
                        the Client of the fact and content of the instructions and verbal
                        communications, and the Client consents to the production of such written,
                        audio or electronic recordings (and transcripts of such recordings) as
                        evidence in any legal or other proceedings...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is evident from a plain reading of the clause that it is of no
                    assistance to the plaintiff, as it only states that the defendant can use such
                    recordings as evidence in proceedings. In the light of this, the plaintiff
                    sought to further rely on s 47 (read with the Third Schedule) of the
                    Banking Act to argue that it obliges the court to grant pre-action discovery
                    even when it would otherwise be disallowed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Section 47 of the Banking Act was enacted to
                    stipulate a wider set of circumstances under which banks can disclose customer
                    information, and the terms of such disclosure. The stated object of the change
                    was to strike a better balance between operational requirements of banks and the
                    need to preserve customer confidentiality. In other words, the enactment of
                    s 47 sought to loosen the hitherto tight banking secrecy laws in order to
                    benefit banks seeking to take advantage of potential operational benefits and
                    savings by for example, securitising mortgage loans or outsourcing data
                    processing to third parties (see the Second Reading of the Banking (Amendment)
                    Bill, <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em> (16 May
                    2001) vol 73 at col 1689). There was nothing here to suggest that s 47 of
                    the Banking Act even remotely supported the plaintiff’s submission that it
                    buttressed her claim for pre-action discovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     As explained above, the Rules of Court is the
                    port of call for a party seeking either pre-action or post-action discovery. In
                    the event that a party fails to meet the requirements for the granting of
                    pre-action discovery, s 47 of the Banking Act can provide no relief. The
                    plaintiff’s attempt to rely on cl 9.1 and s 47 of the Banking
                    Act was therefore an exercise in futility.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In the final analysis, I saw no basis to allow
                    the plaintiff’s application for pre-action discovery. I therefore
                    dismissed the Appeal and fixed costs at $4,500 on an indemnity basis to the
                    defendant in accordance with its contractual entitlement from the
                    plaintiff.</p>
