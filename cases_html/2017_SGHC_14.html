text-justify">1 The six plaintiff companies (referred to as the “Plaintiff Companies”) bring this action to recover large sums of money, said to be around US$600m to US$800m, which were transferred out of their bank accounts by the defendant, Ernest Ferdinand Perez De La Sala (“Ernest”), who is a director of the Plaintiff Companies, into his personal bank accounts. Ernest claims that the monies are all his and that he set up the Plaintiff Companies (as well as other companies) as nominees or “envelopes” or “pockets” to hold these monies and other assets belonging to him.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Ernest has in turn sued his co-directors: his nephew, Edward De La Sala (“Edward”), his niece, Christina Copinger-Symes nee De La Sala (“Christina”), and Christina’s husband, James Copinger-Symes (“James”), collectively referred to as “ECJ”, for breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duties and knowing assistance in the Plaintiff Companies’ breach of trust, and conspiracy to injure by lawful and unlawful means. ECJ denies these allegations and counterclaims against Ernest for misrepresentation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Whilst ownership of companies do not normally cause difficulties as one traces its registered shareholders, the Plaintiff Companies have been structured as an “orphan” or “circular” structure, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the 1st Plaintiff, Compania De Navegacion Palomar SA (“PAL”), a company incorporated in Panama, owns all the shares in the 2nd Plaintiff, Cosmopolitan Finance Corporation (“CFC”), a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”), and CFC owns all the shares in the 5th Plaintiff, Peninsula Navigation Company Private Limited (“PEN”), a company also incorporated in the BVI, and PEN owns all the shares of PAL. This orphan structure is legal under Panamanian and BVI law but not under Singapore law. However, nothing turns on that.       </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The 3rd Plaintiff, Dominion Corporation SA (“DOM”), a company incorporated in Panama, is owned by Summit Finance Corporation SA (“Summit Corp”), which is in turn owned by PAL. The 4th Plaintiff, John Manners &amp; Co (Malaya) Ltd (“JMM”), a company incorporated in Singapore, is owned by Cambay Prince Steamship Co Ltd (BVI) (“Cambay BVI”), which is in turned owned by PEN. PEN also owns the 6th Plaintiff, Straits Marine Company Private Limited (“SMC”), a company incorporated in the BVI. In addition, there are quite a number of companies that will be mentioned in this judgment, many of which have similar or very similar names, but are now of little relevance to the issues in this case, save for context.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 At the commencement of this action, the corporate structure of the six Plaintiff Companies was as follows:</div><div class="Judg-1

style="width:379.45pt; height:280.95pt"/></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 These claims arise out of a long and complex set of facts which stretch back to the 1950s. It begins with a remarkable person, Robert Perez De La Sala, (“Robert Sr”) and his incorporation in April 1939 of a company in Hong Kong called Lasala Investments Limited (“LIL”), which was later renamed Northern Enterprises Limited (“NEL”) in 1959. I start with the members of the De La Sala family.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The De La Sala family</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Robert Sr, the son of a British master mariner of Spanish descent, was born in Manila on 2 October 1908. He moved to Hong Kong and joined John Manners &amp; Co Limited (“JMC”), a company incorporated in Hong Kong in 1916, as an apprentice or clerk on 22 July 1922, when he was not quite fourteen. He was a remarkable person and an astute entrepreneur with an insatiable appetite for work and languages. He worked his way up and by 1 January 1940 became the Chairman as well as the majority shareholder of JMC. He built up a sizeable fleet of vessels in JMC and a stable of companies engaged in all kinds of businesses. The coat of arms on his stationery is no pretension – it is listed in Heraldica and his grandfather was a Spanish general who fought in the Carlist Wars and sought refuge in England after its collapse in the 1870s. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Robert Sr married Camila Vasquez De La Sala (“Camila”) and they have four children: Jerome Anthony Perez De La Sala (“Tony”), who was born on 16 December 1931, Ernest, who was born on 31 January 1933, Robert Perez De La Sala (“Bobby”), who was born on 17 October 1935, and Isabel Brenda Koutsos (“Isabel”), who was born on 10 March 1943 (there was another son, Eddy, who died of some illness sometime around 1950 or 1951). Robert Sr and Camila had all of their children educated in Australia. For ease of reference, I shall refer to Camila and the four children collectively as “JERIC”, an acronym used by Robert Sr, his family and counsel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Tony moved to Hong Kong after his schooling to work at JMC, but returned to Australia a few years later, married one Ann in 1956, and settled down in Sydney.

</div> Although Robert Sr had hoped that Tony would work in JMC in Hong Kong after his studies, Tony did not have any interest in shipping and business. Tony eventually ended up working in JMC’s Australian subsidiary and other businesses in Australia in which Robert Sr had an interest.

If he did, then the Plaintiff Companies and the assets therein would be held on trust for the De La Sala family (as asserted by ECJ).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If Robert Sr did not set up such a family trust, does all the money in the Plaintiff Companies belong to Ernest (as asserted by Ernest)?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Unfortunately a very large number of factual contentions were put in issue. There were numerous interlocutory applications, including those for discovery during the course of the trial. Many objections were taken which required submissions and rulings and the trial was, unsurprisingly, a very hard fought process. A large number of witnesses were called.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Plaintiff Companies called ECJ as factual witnesses and three experts, Mr Owain Rhys Stone (“Mr Stone”), an accounting expert, Mr Richard Alphonse Ballard Vargas (“Mr Ballard”), a Panamanian law expert and Mr Anthony Thomas Pursall (“Mr Pursall”), a BVI law expert;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Besides giving evidence, Ernest called Tony, Isabel, Nicole, Elena and Christian William Ostenfeld (“Ostenfeld”) as factual witnesses and three experts, Mr Timothy James Reid (“Mr Reid”), an accounting expert, Mr Arturo Hoyos (“Mr Hoyos”), a Panamanian law expert and Mr Kenneth Walter MacLean (“Mr MacLean”), a BVI law expert;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Besides giving evidence themselves, ECJ called Bobby, Terrill, Teresa, Richard, Maria-Isabel and Hannelore;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Other witnesses were subpoenaed, Mr Chan Leng Sun SC and Mr Ian Winter QC, but after the clamour of battle subsided, they hardly featured in anyone’s submissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Upon an application by the Plaintiff Companies which was supported by ECJ, and after hearing submissions, I ruled that Ernest should start the case as, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, on the pleadings, money had been taken out of the Plaintiff Companies and the ownership of the companies was uncertain due to the “orphan” or “circular” structure. The initial burden of proof therefore fell on Ernest, in that if no evidence was called, judgment would be entered for the Plaintiff Companies. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The “legacy” of Robert Sr and whether he set up a trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Six people know the truth to the underlying issue. Two of them, Robert Sr and Camila, died in May 1967 and July 2005 respectively. Today, we are left with the four other people who know the truth: Tony, Ernest, Bobby and Isabel. Ernest says there is no family trust and that he bought out everyone’s share in the businesses (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, NEL and JMC) in the 1960s and 1970s. Tony and Isabel agree with him. Bobby says there was a trust set up by his father, which he refers to as the “tree”, that he and his siblings partook of its fruits but the tree remained to provide for subsequent generations of De La Salas. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Their children have no personal knowledge of the underlying question; they can only tell us what they understand the position to be or what they were told by their parents. Ernest’s two sons have been disowned and disinherited by him a long time ago and would know even less. In any case, they did not give evidence before me. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Robert Sr’s letters </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Unlike many other trust cases, where the alleged settlor’s voice has long fallen silent, Robert Sr, who was a prolific letter writer, speaks through his many letters written over the years to his children. Many of these letters, starting from 8 January 1947, were put in evidence before me. They provide a valuable insight into Robert Sr’s shipping and other not inconsequential businesses, the business climate of the times, his hopes and aspirations for his children, how his children went to Australia for their education, his fatherly assessments of their progress and advice to them, how his family came to move from Hong Kong to Australia, what his various concerns were over the years and his plans for his family and for his retirement. These letters also chronicle the events that took place up to Robert Sr’s death and act as a good guide to tracing the history of his legacy. I will therefore have to go through some of these letters in some detail.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 I begin by setting out a brief factual sketch, derived mainly from his letters and which is not really in dispute, and where they are, I so find.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) As noted above, Robert Sr joined JMC Hong Kong as an apprentice when he was not quite 14 in 1922 and by 1 January 1940 had become Chairman and majority shareholder of JMC. He worked tirelessly through the years, wrote often to his family and built up a leading shipping and business empire with its headquarters in Hong Kong. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Robert Sr had great hopes that his sons would follow in his footsteps, join JMC and take over the reins from him. Robert Sr planned and worked towards launching his first two sons, Tony and Ernest, into the business, teach them the ropes and when they attained majority, he would make them directors in JMC.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Tony started work at JMC after he finished schooling. However, he decided sometime before May 1952 (when he would have been about seven months short of turning 21 on 16 December 1952) that business was not for him and wanted to return to settle down in Australia. Robert Sr’s hopes then turned to Ernest and Bobby to carry on the business; Robert Sr would install Ernest as a director (Ernest would have turned 21 on 31 January 1954) and would also train Bobby once he reached 18 in October 1953.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) On 1 July 1952, Robert Sr expressed the hope that Ernest would complete his public company secretarial course after which he intended to take Ernest on a tour of their offices in the beginning of 1953 and then install him in Hong Kong.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Robert Sr originally planned to semi-retire on 30 June 1952 by making two of his lieutenants, Bertram Peter Charles Fletcher (“BPC Fletcher”) and one Nissen, joint managing directors, whilst he stayed on as Chairman of the Board and Governing Director. He would then retire fully on 30 June 1958. This would give him the time to train his sons and bring them on board. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Robert Sr’s plans to semi-retire on 30 June 1952 and retire on 30 June 1958 were pushed back to 31 December 1958 by circumstances and the shipping business climate which had turned adverse by 1952/1953. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) However, despite Robert Sr laying his plans to semi-retire or retire and preparing to do so, the downturn in the shipping industry and disagreements with Ernest over the running of the businesses in the late 1950s and early 1960s caused him to continue to stay at the helm a little longer. His plans to retire were later pushed back further to 1962.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) In February 1964 he expressed the view that JMC’s net worth was under par and he wanted to see it increased threefold (as he had done around 1952 and 1953) and for LIL (by then renamed NEL) to be completely out of shipping before his “swansong”. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) In his letters of 10 and 11 February 1964, he expressed his firm intention to finally retire on 30 June 1967, after completing 45 years at JMC and shipping. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(j) However a ruptured blood vessel sometime before 7 November 1964 and his impaired health thereafter saw Ernest back at the helm in Hong Kong after that date. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(k) Robert Sr died rather unexpectedly in his sleep of a heart attack on 27 May 1967 at the age of 59. He was well known in Australia and several newspapers ran obituaries and articles on his life. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Five things stand out from these letters:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, Robert Sr had built up, amongst many other businesses, a considerable shipping business, owning and chartering out ships, headquartered in Hong Kong, but with offices and businesses around the world, including Australia, Singapore, London, New York, Japan, Indonesia, Portuguese East Timor, Papua New Guinea and far flung places like Brazil and Alaska; his flagship, JMC, was a leading shipping and business company in Hong Kong and this part of the world;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, Robert Sr was a man with a very great love for his family, as a husband and a father, who did not see his children through rose-tinted glasses but knew them well, knew their faults but also believed strongly in their potential. He attributes his modest lifestyle as an education from Camila and together they taught their children their values. His letters also show an unwavering goal, right from his earlier years, of providing for his family so that they would never be in want. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, consistent with these tenets, in all his business endeavours Robert Sr never referred to his companies and businesses as <span class="font-italic">his</span> but were always referred to as belonging to the family with words like “their”, “our”, “we” and phrases like “the family’s”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourthly, Robert Sr had a great aversion to having estate duty levied in the event of his death; this was a very big concern of his – that his hard-earned wealth should never be whittled down by hefty estate duty and should be preserved as far as possible for his family; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Fifthly, Robert Sr, not surprisingly, also had a healthy aversion to having to pay more tax than was absolutely necessary and he sought professional advice from various sources, especially when the family began having plans to settle down in Australia, to ensure he paid as little tax as possible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I now turn to his letters as well as the existing corporate records and other documents where available to answer the first part of the underlying issue: did Robert Sr set up a trust in his lifetime?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 LIL featured prominently in Robert Sr’s letters. LIL was renamed NEL in 1959 for tax reasons. According to the corporate documents, Robert Sr incorporated LIL in Hong Kong on 11 April 1939. When Robert Sr incorporated LIL, he was around 31 years of age (he assumed the Chairmanship of JMC in January 1940) and he had three young children then – Tony (aged about 7 years old), Ernest (aged about 6 years old) and Bobby (aged about 3½ years old). Isabel was only born in 1943. LIL had two shareholders, Robert Sr and Camilla, from 1939 to 1947 with one share each. The corporate documents show that in 1947, the share capital was increased to $500,000 with Robert Sr and Camila holding 250 shares each. Over the years, Robert Sr put assets into LIL and this included subsidiary companies engaged in ship-owning and shipping.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In the first relevant letter, dated 2 November 1950 (by which time Isabel had been born and when Robert Sr was around 42 years of age), Robert Sr wrote to Ernest, who was then 17 years old: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Yesterday, I transferred from [LIL] the 40% holdings of MANNERS GODOWNS, LTD, to [JMC] and shortly I shall transfer 25% of CAMBAY PRINCE STEAMSHIP CO. LTD. At the same time I have transferred 40% of [JMC] shares to [LIL] so that if anything ever happened to me nobody can force the 40% out of <span class="font-italic">[LIL], which will remain in the Lasala family until doom’s day</span> <span class="font-italic">if my sons and sons’ sons so desire it</span> even if they do not choose to actively work in JMC. With this arrangement I am left with 30% in JMC., in my own name and this I intend should go to such of my sons as choose to take an active part in the affairs of JMC. When Wallace kicks the bucket, his 10% will come to me and so there will be 10% for each of you if you all decide that you will be become part of JMC.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I am giving you these details as you are now fast growing to be of age and you must now what I am planning for you just in case St. Peter calls me before my time.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(emphasis added)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 This letter shows three things. First, Robert Sr had set up companies under LIL which he was transferring to JMC in exchange for JMC shares. Secondly, it can be seen that Robert Sr was implementing a scheme to provide for his wife and children in case anything untoward happened to him. Thirdly (and significantly say ECJ), <span class="font-italic">his plan</span> was that even if anything happened to him, no one could force LIL’s 40% shareholding in JMC out of LIL, which <span class="font-italic">would remain in</span> the <span class="font-italic">Lasala family </span><span class="font-italic">until “doom’s day”</span>. However, I note that the language used in this letter by itself does not evidence a trust and the expressed plan for LIL to remain in the Lasala family until “doom’s day” has an important proviso tagged onto that expression, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, “<span class="font-italic">if</span> my sons and sons’ sons so desire it” (emphasis added). This clearly implies that the decision was not his to make.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The next relevant letter is dated 1 September 1951 and it shows Robert Sr actively working towards “launching’ his sons Tony and Ernest into business. It also records his concerns over being subject to tax as a “resident” because the family was thinking of settling in Australia. Robert Sr outlined his plans for the next few years to rotate between Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo so as not to be a resident of Australia for tax purposes.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 On 11 September 1951, Robert Sr wrote to his family from Manly, NSW, setting out his plans to avoid paying more tax than was necessary:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Yesterday I had a long conference with Mr G.A.L. Gunn the expert on Income Tax and got from him the low-down of what I shall have to do. Fortunately in [1939] I established [LIL] and just before I left Hongkong I arranged with Ritchie to have all my shares transferred to the name of [LIL], with the exception of 30% in JMC., which are still held in my name and Camila should also transfer the 100 shares Banks and 100 shares Unions from her name to [LIL]. In this manner if and when I take up domicile in Australia, I shall only be taxable on personal exertion income besides dividends from investments which I might have in Australia. The profit which [LIL] make[s] is not taxable so long as no dividend is declared. This is the only way to beat the Tax people and when I incorporated [LIL] in 1939 I did so with a view to minimizing death duties.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">According to Mr Gunn, LIL must not invest anything in Australia and so long as I do not slip up on this, after transferring the 30% of JMC shares to LIL, I shall be only liable to very little tax except on what I will earn in this country.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I should like to point out that the Tax on unearned income is at present 15s/- to the pound after a certain level is reached and I am certainly in no mood to hand out this kind of money for no good reason.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This letter and the other evidence show that Camila took no active part in the running of Robert Sr’s businesses. She was the dutiful and supportive home-maker and mother who brought up the children and this letter shows that although shares were put in her name, Robert Sr felt free to direct how they were to be dealt with. The few letters from Robert Sr to Camila show that she was not <span class="font-italic">au fait</span> with matters like business, corporations, taxation and death duties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Robert Sr’s letter of 16 December 1951 shows Robert Sr’s varied business activities in Australia. By this time, Ernest had joined the family’s Australian company, JMC(A). The letter also mentions the incorporation of an Australian holding company, Delasala Pty Ltd, with Robert Sr and JERIC as directors together with one Mr Westgarth (who appears to be a solicitor or accountant) for financing various ventures which “<span class="font-italic">we </span>decide to go into such as Mining etc” (emphasis added). Robert Sr’s letter of 9 May 1952 to Ernest and Bobby records, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) he has transferred all his shares in JMC to LIL; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) after he goes into semi-retirement, it is important that LIL should always have an active director in JMC stationed at “headoffice” to “keep a tab on things” and prevent “unpleasant surprises”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In his letter of 13 May 1952 to Ernest, Robert Sr states that JMC owes him a “whack” of money and that he would like to see most of it paid up before he goes into semi-retirement. This letter also records:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) his worry that Tony did not want to carry on in JMC and that it was up to Ernest to take an active hand in it; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) his last job was to train Bobby up in business once he finished schooling and then install him as a director at JMC upon Bobby attaining 21 years of age. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">Robert Sr then states, towards the end of this letter, that all his shares are now in LIL: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… so that the remuneration to each one of you will depend on the actual work you do <span class="font-italic">as PROFITS all go to LIL., which </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">belongs to the family</span>. … [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In Robert Sr’s mind, LIL “belong[ed] to the family”. In 1952, LIL’s share capital had increased to $1,000,000 with 1,000 shares issued; 473 shares were held by Robert Sr, 475 shares were held by Camila, 27 shares were held by Benita, Camila’s sister, and 25 shares were held by Tony, who was by 13 May 1952, almost 20 years and 5 months old.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Robert Sr made Ernest a director of JMC on 14 May 1953. On 15 July 1953, Robert Sr writes to Ernest stating that Ernest had “a life ahead of [him] to build <span class="font-italic">the family fortune</span> to greater heights” (emphasis added). On 16 July 1953, Robert Sr added a three-page addendum to his 15 July 1953 letter, repeating the same theme and said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… when you have gathered sufficient experience I would be only too pleased to shift the burden of responsibilities on your shoulders insofar as JMC is concerned <span class="font-italic">but we must keep our personal stake outside of JMC, separate and sacred as this represents the “guarantee” to the whole family.</span> [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 On 20 September 1953, Robert Sr writes to Ernest on JMC(A) letterhead and instructs that: “As regards [LIL], any decisions must follow ‘suggestions’ which I make from here and the management should be left in the hands of Lowe, Bingham &amp; Matthews [public accountants and tax advisers]”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Robert Sr emphasized this again to Ernest in his letter of 31 January 1954: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…I have had my fill of work and am prepared to hand over to you the job of protecting <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">our</span><span class="font-italic"> investments in JMC</span>. <span class="font-italic">Other investments in </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">[LIL] will be handled by me</span><span class="font-italic"> or rather I shall direct you on what we want done</span>. [emphasis in italics and bold-italics added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In 1954, LIL’s share capital was $10,000,000 with 6,000 shares issued. Robert Sr held 3,083 shares, Camila held 2,865 shares, Tony held 25 shares on trust for Robert Sr, and Ernest held 27 shares on trust for Robert Sr. Benita had dropped out as a shareholder. In 1954, Tony would have been around 22 or 23 years old and Ernest would have been around 21 years old.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Sometime between 1954 and 1955, Robert Sr received advice from Lowe, Bingham &amp; Matthews that he should spread out the shareholding in LIL to as many people as possible to avoid heavy death duties. Robert Sr explains this in a letter to Camila dated 30 May 1956, and in that letter he also explains the strong financial position of China Shipping Co Ltd (“China Shipping”), another of his companies, and his moving it under LIL’s ownership. Furthermore, from around 1955, LIL’s shareholding changed to Robert Sr holding only 600 shares, Camila holding 3,000 shares and each of his children, Tony, Ernest, Bobby and Isabel (collectively referred to as “JERI”) holding 600 shares each. On advice of Lowe, Bingham &amp; Matthews, Robert Sr also wrote an official letter, thereby creating a paper trail for the corporate records, that the transfer of most of his shares to his children were irrevocable gifts and that JERIC were not holding the shares on trust for him. This letter was clearly written to avoid estate duty because despite this transfer, we see Robert Sr repeating again and again in his letters to Ernest and others that he is in control of LIL and its subsidiaries, especially China Shipping, and that all decisions in respect of those companies and their businesses would be made by him and no one else.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 A letter dated 29 August 1955 from Robert Sr to Ernest chronicles a serious clash between father and son in the running of JMC. Ernest had committed JMC to sell two ships, without checking with Robert Sr or the other two directors, BPC Fletcher and Nissen, on what Robert Sr thought were very disadvantageous terms. He sent a furious telegram to Ernest, in which he also stated: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…I was hopeful that you might have taken over at least part of the cloak of responsibility but I am afraid I have been too optimistic.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In fairness <span class="font-italic">to the family</span> I would be foolish to allow you to manage <span class="font-italic">their fortunes</span> at this stage and I have therefore to consider all the others in any decision which I am forced to make.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In response, Ernest humbly apologised in writing and said he would accept any punishment Robert Sr meted out. Robert Sr relented and forgave Ernest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 On 18 March 1956, Robert Sr writes and records that he made Ernest a Managing Director of JMC but reminded Ernest that this was mainly “a cover” for Robert Sr to be able to say (to the Australian tax authorities) that Ernest was managing JMC and he, Robert Sr, was semi-retired and went to Hong Kong only as adviser. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 As noted at [81] above, Robert Sr made sure Ernest and his fellow directors at JMC knew he would control and make all business decisions for LIL, and now that China Shipping was a subsidiary of LIL, the same would apply. He wrote on 9 June 1956 that “[n]aturally as regards CHINA SHIPPING CO LTD, <span class="font-italic">all decisions</span><span class="font-italic"> should have my approval first</span>” (emphasis added). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The next relevant letter is from Robert Sr to Ernest dated 5 October 1956 and it is important for three reasons. First, it can be seen that Robert Sr was preoccupied with avoiding hefty death duties. He enclosed a long letter to Bobby (which he had also sent to Ernest) explaining his plans to avoid estate duty. He also enclosed a copy of his will, which he was of the view could be relied on as “supporting evidence regarding [his] gifts to [JERI] of shares in LIL” as part of his plan to avoid estate duty. He further asked them all to keep copies of this letter safely locked away. Secondly, Robert Sr mentions a principle of distributing money from LIL to his children which emanated from Ernest and which Robert Sr thought was a good idea and adopted. I should also mention that each of his four children, on reaching 21 years of age, received a lumpsum from Robert Sr to enable them to be “independent”, but there is no mention of what this sum is in the evidence before me. With regard to the LIL dividend, Robert Sr writes:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I think you will agree that Ernest’s suggestion regarding the dividends you all derive from LIL., is a good one. You will thus have $90,000.- for the year ending 31st March 1958 and you can do what you please with this which will be paid into your current a/c with JMC., or to the Chartered Bank if you prefer. <span class="font-italic">As regards the remaining $180,000.- this together with the shares from the others will be paid to Swiss Banking Corporation, A/c H.S. 91,735, Geneva </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">for investment elsewhere. Myself and Mummy can operate this account singly or any two of you children</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As I have explained to Bobby, in the future you children will have funds of your own coming from dividends which LIL., will be paying so that any time you want to go for a holiday or buy anything for yourselves, <span class="font-italic">you can use the 1/3</span><span class="font-italic">rd dividend without being questioned as it is your own money</span>. Since you are domiciled in Australia, you will have to <span class="font-italic">take special care</span> whenever any <span class="font-italic">funds are remitted to you</span> there as you might be liable to Income Tax.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold-italics]      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Thirdly, Robert Sr gives his contemporaneous thoughts on the treatment of LIL:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There is always the possibility of [LIL] liquidating in which case substantial funds will be available from <span class="font-italic">redistribution of Capital and assets and you children will then have to decide what to do with your share</span>. There is time enough to decide on this issue.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">One thing <span class="font-italic">I am determined</span> and that is that <span class="font-italic">none of you should be deprived of the shares you legally own, as a result of my death</span> and this might well mean that Mummy, Isabel and myself might have to take up residence in some other country outside the British Commonwealth but this will not stop us from visiting you all for periods up to six months in any one year.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I pause to make a few observations from the letters examined thus far:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, a principle that 1/3 of the dividends from LIL could be used by the children for whatever they chose to do and the balance 2/3 would have to go back into investment elsewhere was enunciated and was later adopted. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) It should be remembered that all the “investments elsewhere” were controlled by Robert Sr irrespective of the shareholding in LIL. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) The signing authority of those accounts show the same control; whereas Robert Sr and Camila had sole signing authority, the children could only operate the account with signatures from any two of them. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, and significantly, Robert Sr does not seem to treat LIL as a “sacred trust” for the De La Sala family which will last until “doom’s day”. He clearly countenanced having to liquidate LIL <span class="font-italic">in which case each child</span> would have to decide <span class="font-italic">what to do with his or her share</span> of LIL’s liquidation proceeds. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, an important characteristic of the person running LIL or the JMC business appears to be that that person was to remain outside of Australia for tax and estate duty purposes. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) In the letters, the phrase “tax exile” is commonly used. That person may also have to reside in a jurisdiction where the levying of estate duty can be minimised or better still avoided altogether. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Subsequent letters show that Robert Sr was even thinking of moving to Brazil if Hong Kong levied heavy death duties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In a letter dated 2 January 1957 to Ernest (and BPC Fletcher, who was the husband of Camila’s sister, Benita), Robert Sr records that by the middle of 1958, China Shipping would no longer owe any money to banks and all earnings could be reinvested in other schemes in Australia. In his letter to his sons dated 10 March 1957, Robert Sr notes that by the end of 1958, China Shipping would owe nothing to the banks, own six ships, and having earnings of US$1m per month. This placed LIL, which owned 95% of China Shipping and 60% of JMC, in a strong position. Robert Sr stated he was thus “very well satisfied” having “fulfilled” his life’s work, and <span class="font-italic">should he pass away suddenly</span>, he would be content having carved a name for the family in Hong Kong and that his family<span class="font-italic"> </span>“<span class="font-italic">will all be left well provided for</span>” (emphasis added). This is consistent with the idea of Robert Sr treating LIL and its investments like a life insurance policy for his family.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 This theme is repeated in two letters. In a letter dated 28 June 1957 to Ernest, Robert Sr after talking about business, states on the third page:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I do not mind JMC., owing the Bank a substantial overdraft but not so with CHINA SHIPPING <span class="font-italic">as this is LIL’s egg-nest and our retirement fund</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In a letter dated 6 July 1957 to Ernest, Robert Sr writes:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I am glad we have sorted out China Shipping’s affairs in a satisfactory manner <span class="font-italic">as after all </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">THIS is LIL’s egg-nest</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>[<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]<span class="font-italic"> and </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">retirement fund</span>.

This three-page letter, written by Robert Sr on John Manners’ Tokyo office letterhead on a hot, sultry afternoon on 7 July 1957, was addressed to his children; it came to be held with special regard by the De La Sala family (“Avarice Letter”). Copies of this treasured document were kept and circulated by his children and also given to Robert Sr’s grandchildren. Robert Sr himself said in this letter: “I hope you will treasure this letter and read it from time to time when you feel bored with the way things are going” and again at the end “which I trust you will have occasion to read over from time to time.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Robert Sr’s thoughtful and reflective letter expounds his views on life and values as well as some views on the businesses.

LTD., should be free from any indebtedness to the Bank and the Company’s position should be as solid as the “Rock of Gibraltar” with or without the famous monkeys. <span class="font-italic">This is LIL’s biggest single investment and must therefore be well nursed</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics, bold-italics, and underlined bold-italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 To show that Robert Sr instituted a family trust, ECJ rely heavily on the underlined words in the quote in the previous paragraph. I make the following observations of the words leading up to this phrase:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Robert Sr “expounds” his <span class="font-italic">views</span> on the <span class="font-italic">objectives</span> of LIL.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) LIL came into being because in 1938 when he sought additional <span class="font-italic">life insurance</span> for the protection of Camila and his children, he was informed his premium would be significantly loaded (rated up by eight years); he therefore decided to be his own insurer and incorporated LIL in April 1939; at that time, the family he wanted to protect would have consisted of Camila and three of his children, Tony (about 7½ years old), Ernest (about 5¼ years old) and Bobby (about 3½ years old).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Robert Sr’s fixed intention was to build up funds in LIL so that his family would be protected in the event of his untimely death.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) By 7 July 1957, he had “<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">now</span><span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">more than achieved</span>” (emphasis added) this. This meant that LIL’s assets or net worth must have been very substantial, that there was more than enough to provide for his family in the event of his untimely death, <span class="font-italic">and</span> that he had divested himself of 90% of his shares in LIL so that the value of LIL would only be decreased by estate duty on 10% of his shares in the event of his death (presumably because the family would have drawn on the resources of LIL to pay estate duty).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 From this, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, having more than achieved the purpose of providing for his family in LIL, Robert Sr immediately follows up with the underlined words quoted above at [92]. On a first, and perhaps even a second, reading, it does seem that Robert Sr intended to set up a family trust in LIL which was to remain a family company, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, run, controlled and owned by the De La Sala family which was firstly to guarantee the “livelihood” and “well-being” (both these words being fairly clear and not given to ambiguity) of all his descendants and then, other deserving relatives. The distribution to beneficiaries by payment of minimum dividends, <span class="font-italic">if</span> and when they are paid, is clear, as is the object thereby of conserving capital for investment and growing LIL in financial strength over time. I pause to note that if there was a family trust, whilst the ascertainment of the former class of beneficiaries does not give rise to any difficulties, the second class of beneficiaries does give rise to questions of exactly who are “deserving” relatives and what criteria are used for deciding whether they are deserving or not. If indeed there was a trust, then the trust in relation to the latter class of beneficiaries would fail as the objects of the trust would be uncertain. That, however, does not arise on the facts here.       </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 On reflection and a closer reading of the words used, however, it will be noticed that Robert Sr uses the words “it is my wish”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, his desire or what he would like or what he hopes for. He is no stranger to the English language and he does not use words to the effect that this <span class="font-italic">was</span><span class="font-italic"> what was to be done </span>or what he wanted done or what he would be doing. There can be little doubt if that was what Robert Sr wanted to do, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, set up a family trust, he could do so and no one would have opposed that, even if 90% of the shares in LIL were held by his wife and children, among whom Tony, Ernest and Bobby had all attained majority. It bears mentioning that the words used do not indicate that a trust or similar structure had already been set up by then. Indeed, to find the existence of a trust, it must be certain that the settlor intended to create a trust rather than to impose a <span class="font-italic">mere moral obligation</span> or to make a gift or to do some other act which was not a trust (Alastair Hudson, <span class="font-italic">Equity and Trusts</span> (Routledge, 7th Ed, 2013). As Judith Prakash J, as she then was, held in <span class="font-italic">Guy Neale and others v Nine Squares Pty Ltd</span> [2013] SGHC 249 (at [69]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">For there to be certainty of intention, a careful inquiry of the facts must show that the settlor clearly intended to subject the trust property to a trust obligation. This can be discerned from the language used in a trust document, or, where the language used is found to be inadequate, <span class="font-italic">a settlor’s intention</span> deduced as a matter of “business common sense” may even be sufficient. … The settlor’s intention must be clear on two fronts: that the <span class="font-italic">trustee’s duties are to be legally enforceable</span> <span class="font-italic">rather than merely social or moral</span>, and that it would involve <span class="font-italic">trust</span> duties as distinct from other legal relationships such as that between debtor and creditor. … [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 From Robert Sr’s letters dated 21 July 1957 (to Bobby) and 15 October 1957 (to Ernest), Robert Sr writes of his plans for the family. Tony should take charge of Delasala Pty Ltd and “our” interest in Australia as Tony intends to stay in Australia “for keeps”. Ernest would stay in JMC and Bobby would be Robert Sr’s assistant and look after the affairs of LIL and China Shipping. We see Robert Sr proudly setting out the record profits of China Shipping at $15,289,812 and JMC (with its 14 subsidiaries) at $18,783,163.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Robert Sr’s letters in 1958 evidence his alarm at and preoccupation with the Hong Kong government’s proposals at that time to make changes to estate duty legislation. It appears that the government was intent on being able to levy estate duty on individuals who used private investment companies, like LIL, to hold their assets, and to lengthen the gift period upon which estate duty could be levied from three years to five years. Robert Sr’s big concern was that although his “gifts” to his children had crossed the three year mark (which was then in force), Camila’s gifts through the re-distribution of shares had not. His letters in 1958 tell of his efforts at lobbying against these changes.       </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In his letter from Hong Kong dated 3 October 1958 to Camila, Robert Sr said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the proposed Bill is adopted without amendments, then we shall probably have to eventually liquidate LIL., distribute the assets and settle down somewhere else. I shall be able to explain the position more fully to you when I see you and in the meantime Smith of Lowe, Bingham &amp; Matthews is obtaining legal opinion from England. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I told Ernest that I should not have to worry about this matter as it concerns duty payable on my estate after my death but just the same I hate to think that after all my work for the family, Government should come in and deprive them. The Estate Duty on over $30,000,000.- is 52% which means that Government take $18.- Million but a forced sale of assets might not realise as much as the value the Estate Commissioner places. Perhaps Fletcher could explain things to you in the meantime.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 In his letter dated 4 October 1958 to Bobby, Robert Sr talks about the proposed legislation on Estate Duty and said:

As a first step, LIL would declare a dividend of $350 per share, totalling $21,000,000, to enable his wife and children to buy his 10% in LIL and their shares in JMC. These shares in JMC would be placed in trust with Strath Nominees Ltd which was operated by Lowe, Bingham &amp; Matthews, who will then collect dividends from JMC and carry out their individual instructions. I pause to note that this step, to use a nominee company to hold their shares, was obviously to mask the true shareholders of JMC.

These words appear clear and are consistent with the fact that although the shares in LIL were no longer in Robert Sr’s name, he continued to have sole management and control of its businesses and brooked no interference with his decisions in relation to LIL and its subsidiaries. This is emphasized repeatedly in his letters. This letter also sets out how the surplus monies will be deposited in the Swiss Bank account “H.S.91,735” to escape death duties and money for investments in Australia will be made through “loans”, obviously to avoid questions and tracing to the said Swiss Bank account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Robert Sr’s letter dated 28 May 1959 to Ernest is a comprehensive letter of his meeting with a tax consultant.

Robert Sr also passes on the advice that the majority of directors of any Hong Kong company should not be residing in Australia and his view that Bobby and BPC Fletcher should resign as directors of JMC now that they were no longer in Hong Kong. He further suggests a change of name for LIL to something more “neutral”. Robert Sr lastly points out that whilst his estate was “in the clear” as far as JMC and LIL were concerned, “any snag could only crop up if any of [his children] should die whilst domiciled in Australia.” In a subsequent letter dated 19 June 1959 to Ernest,

Robert Sr also mentions selling four new ships at a handsome profit so that he does not have to think about “ships and personnel”. This is repeated in a letter dated 6 July 1961 to Ernest,

The letter further records his relief that Ernest was back to take charge in Hong Kong as things would be in a mess if he had suddenly passed away when Ernest was not there. Robert Sr leaves Ernest to make decisions on the investments in Alaska and Brazil; he opines that Alaska is a good investment although it will be his grandchildren who will reap the benefit.

</div> Robert Sr reminisces about his life in shipping, his attempt at retirement on 30 June 1952 and his return to full service in 1954 through to 27 December 1966 when he officially announced his retirement set for 30 June 1967 upon completion of 45 years of service. He notes he never worked harder in his life in 1964 to combat the bad times for shipping, but his achievements, reflected in the balance sheet for 1966, made him feel more than satisfied. As we know, Robert Sr did not make it to 30 June 1967. He passed away unexpectedly in his sleep on 27 May 1967.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 It is apposite to mention at this point that in so far as ECJ assert that a trust had been instituted by Robert Sr, they bear the burden of proving their claim beyond the balance of probabilities (<span class="font-italic">Tee Yok Kiat v Pang Min Seng</span> [2013] SGCA 9 and <span class="font-italic">Low Ah Cheow and others v Ng Hock Guan</span> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 1079). Should ECJ fail to discharge this burden, the transfer of the shares from Robert Sr to JERIC would have resulted in the full legal and beneficial ownership in LIL being transferred to JERIC since there was no trust created over the shares, This is consistent with the position espoused in <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> (John McGee gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 32nd Ed, 2010) (“<span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span>”) at para 22-025 which states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…If that asset is sufficiently identified but the settlor’s intention to create a trust over it is uncertain, then the person entitled to the asset holds it beneficially for himself and free of any trust. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 An express trust is created by the actual intention of the settlor and such an intention may be apparent from the express use of the word “trust” in the relevant instrument or inferred from the settlor’s words or conduct (see <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> at para 21-019). In this inquiry, the “[t]hree certainties <span class="font-italic">must</span> be present for the creation of an express trust: certainty of intention; certainty of subject matter; and certainty of the objects of the trust” [emphasis added] (per Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">Guy Neale and others v Nine Squares Pty Ltd</span> [2015] 1 SLR 1097 (“<span class="font-italic">Guy Neale</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>”) at [51]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 To establish the certainty of intention, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Guy Neale</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> noted that a claimant must show “proof that a trust was intended by the settlor”. It explained at [52]–[53] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">52     The first certainty, that of intention, requires proof that a trust was intended by the settlor. The principle is that in what was said or done by the settlor, there must be clear evidence of an intention to create a trust (see <span class="font-italic">Paul v Constance</span> [1977] 1 WLR 527 at 531). No particular form of expression is necessary. In particular, [<span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span>] notes that it is unnecessary for the settlor to use the word “trust” before such an intention can be found (at para 22-013), and goes on to say in the same paragraph:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he court construes the substance and effect of the words used, against the background of any relevant surrounding circumstances … [T]he settlor need not even understand that his words or conduct have created a trust if they have this effect on their proper legal construction. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">53     The same point was also made in <span class="font-italic">Tito v Waddell</span> (No 2) [1977] Ch 106 by Megarry VC at 211:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [I]t can hardly be disputed that a trust may be created without using the word ‘trust.’ In every case one has to look to see whether in the circumstances of the case, and on the true construction of what was said and written, a sufficient intention to create a true trust has been manifested.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Therefore, there have been cases where an express trust was created by means of an informal declaration (as in <span class="font-italic">Paul v Constance</span>), or inferred from the acts of the settlor or the circumstances of the case (see Geraint Thomas &amp; Alastair Hudson, <span class="font-italic">The Law on Trusts</span> (Oxford, 2nd Ed, 2010) at para 2.04; Alastair Hudson, Equity and Trusts (Routledge, 7th Ed, 2013) at pp 94–95)…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The principles elucidated above are relevant to this case given the absence of a written trust deed or instrument from Robert Sr expressly creating a trust. Thus, in examining this issue, I consider the contemporaneous correspondence from Robert Sr as well as the surrounding circumstances at the material time to determine his intentions and whether an express trust was created therefrom. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 With respect to the certainty of subject matter and the certainty of objects, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Guy Neale</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> succinctly stated the following at [59]–[60]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">59     The second certainty required for the creation of an express trust is certainty of subject matter. The trust must define with sufficient certainty the assets which are to be held on trust and the kind of interest that the beneficiaries are to take in them. The definition will be sufficiently certain if it enables the trustee or the court to execute the trust according to the settlor’s intention (see <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> ([50] supra) at para 22-016).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">60     The third certainty is certainty in the definition of the objects of the trust. The intended beneficiaries must be identifiable so that it is possible to ascertain those who have the standing to enforce the trustee’s duties under the trust (see <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> at para 22-021).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 In this respect, ECJ’s case does not expressly identify certain <span class="font-italic">basic</span> features of this “family trust”. For example, when was the “family trust” constituted – was LIL a trust company upon its incorporation, or did it subsequently declare a trust over its assets? Who were the exact objects of the trust – was it limited to JERIC and their successors in title or extended to other relatives of the family? These questions have not been satisfactorily answered by ECJ. Notwithstanding ECJ’s lack of specificity, I give my preliminary conclusions from Robert Sr’s letters.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Preliminary conclusions from Robert Sr’s letters</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The following emphasized words in Robert Sr’s below-mentioned letters written over the years, when looked at in isolation and bearing in mind that this was something that was said not once but over a considerable period of time, would <span class="font-italic">suggest</span> that Robert Sr had set up a family trust. This trust was probably something that he had thought of by 1950 but which crystallized or came into being only sometime after 7 July 1957:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) 2 November 1950: “so that if anything happened to me nobody can force the 40% out of [LIL], <span class="font-italic">which </span><span class="font-italic">will remain in the Lasala family until doom’s day</span>” (emphasis added).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) 13 May 1952: “as PROFITS all go to <span class="font-italic">LIL </span><span class="font-italic">which belongs to the family</span>” (emphasis added).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) 16 July 1953: “but we<span class="font-italic"> must keep our personal stake outside of JMC, </span><span class="font-italic">separate and sacred as this represents the “guarantee” to the whole family</span>” (emphasis added).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) 7 July 1957: “<span class="font-italic">It is my wish that [LIL] should always remain a FAMILY undertaking and guarantee for the livelihood and well-being firstly of ALL my descendants and then other deserving relatives</span>” (emphasis added).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) 18 May 1959: “I thank you for <span class="font-italic">your reassurance</span> that <span class="font-italic">LIL., will be kept </span><span class="font-italic">‘sacred’</span>” (emphasis added).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) 22 May 1959: “<span class="font-italic">LI</span><span class="font-italic">L. – This is a sacred trust for the sole benefit of the family and something to fall back on if everything else turns sour</span>” (emphasis added).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) 5 November 1959: “Since the Bank know[s] the <span class="font-italic">inside story regarding NELLY beneficial ownership</span>” (emphasis added).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 Indeed, it should first be noted that the word “sacred” is used in three letters: a three-page addendum in 16 July 1953 and two letters in May 1959, after his Avarice Letter dated 7 July 1957. “Sacred” is a strong word and it means or refers to something that is set apart or dedicated for, in this case, a special purpose, and that is not to be violated. Secondly, consistent with this, we see Robert Sr’s consistent and constant reminder that <span class="font-italic">all</span> decisions in relation to LIL and its subsidiaries were to be made by him, down to the appointment of officers for their vessels. Thirdly, we see Robert Sr’s constant references to the fact that LIL belongs to the family, and this was irrespective of LIL’s actual shareholding which, as noted above, changed over time. Fourthly, we see that Robert Sr adopted Ernest’s suggestion and implemented the idea of individual shareholders getting 1/3 of their dividends to spend as they wish and 2/3 going back into a pool for joint investments (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, letters of 5 October 1956, 7 July 1957 (the Avarice Letter), 4 October 1958 and 3 May 1960). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Notwithstanding the above, I am unable to find on a balance of probabilities that Robert Sr had instituted a family trust. Despite what the phrases in [130] above, taken by themselves, suggest, there are other statements or views expressed by Robert Sr which do not comport with the conclusion, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, that Robert Sr had created a family trust for all his descendants:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) As noted above at [71], in the 2 November 1950 letter, Robert Sr sets a proviso or condition to his pronouncement that LIL will remain in the De La Sala family until “doom’s day” with the words: “if my sons and sons’ sons so desire”. The words of the proviso are clear and unambiguous and the decision whether LIL remains in the De La Sala family, at least to Robert Sr in November 1950, depended on the decision of his sons and their sons and not him.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) There are also letters where Robert Sr talks about distributing the capital and assets of LIL amongst his family, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, in his letter dated 5 October 1956 to Ernest, he states: “There is always the possibility of<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">LIL., liquidating </span>in which case substantial funds will be available from<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">redistribution of Capital and assets and you children will then have to decide what to do with your share</span>” (emphasis added). The letter also refers to Camila and his children as the legal owners of the LIL shares: “One thing I am determined and that is that<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">none of you should be deprived of the shares you legally own</span>, as a result of my death” (emphasis added). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In his 17 October 1958 letter to Tony, Robert Sr emphasises that the LIL shares were <span class="font-italic">gifted</span> to JERIC: “I am pleased to note that you appreciate the fight I have on my hands to protect you children in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">the gifts I made to you all </span>those years ago” (emphasis added).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Significantly, on 10 February 1964, well after the 7 July 1957 Avarice Letter and use of the words “sacred” and “trust” in the May 1959 letters, Robert Sr writes to Ernest saying that he fully intended to retire on or after 30 June 1967 and then states: “By then I will concentrate on liquidating Nelly’s interest in SHIPPING <span class="font-italic">so that I can divide the Cash between Mummy and you four children so that each can do what they please with the money</span>” (emphasis added).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 There are also letters where Robert Sr used words or phrases or expressed views that do not sit comfortably with the existence of or the intention to form a family trust. However, I note these letters could be construed in a way that was not necessarily inconsistent with the idea or existence of a family trust. The degree of inconsistency of these excerpts are lower than those cited in the paragraph above and I do not find them to be determinative either way:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In Robert Sr’s 1 September 1951 letter to his family, which demonstrates his preoccupation with taxes, he expresses a different reason why LIL was incorporated: “when I incorporated LIL., in 1939 <span class="font-italic">I did so with a view to minimizing death duties</span>” (emphasis added). This idea was mentioned in a slightly different context in his letter dated 30 May 1956 to Camila, where he stated that he was, on Lowe, Bingham &amp; Matthew’s advice, splitting his shares to as many people as possible to avoid “death dues”. It is possible that LIL could fulfil more than one purpose and I am prepared to consider this not being entirely inconsistent with the existence of a family trust.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) There are also letters where Robert Sr refers to LIL as a family “nest egg” and a “retirement fund”: see his letters of 28 June 1957 and 6 July 1957, and his letter of 10 March 1957 to his sons where he says that should he pass away suddenly, “you will all be left well provided for”. Although it is possible to read the use of these phrases as consistent with a family trust, it must be remembered that Robert Sr was no stranger to the English language and was well-versed with various business and corporate structures. I find it odd that other than on one occasion, he never described LIL as a family trust. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) When there were concerns in 1958 over the Hong Kong government making changes to estate duty provisions, we see Robert Sr calling for a family meeting in Hong Kong at the end of November 1958 “to decide the future of LIL” (see Robert Sr’s letter dated 17 October 1958). I also find it pertinent that at no point in time did Robert Sr consider the impact these proposed legislative changes would have on a trust. It is clear from Robert Sr’s letters that his concern was directed solely at whether his and Camila’s <span class="font-italic">gifts</span> of LIL shares to their children would be caught by the legislative changes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 I pause to mention that I do not think Robert Sr’s letter written on 4 February 1955 (and similarly Camila’s letter written on 11 July 1956)

</div>
</div> stating that in making the transfer of his shares in LIL to his children, he was making irrevocable gifts and that the transferees were not holding the shares on trust for him (see above at [81]), bears any weight either way on this issue. This letter was clearly written on the advice of Lowe, Bingham &amp; Matthews to create a “paper trail” to ensure death duties were avoided. This is also evident from and borne out by later correspondence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 The letters of Robert Sr set out in [130] above are on balance unclear as to whether he had established a trust. Given his knowledge and acumen as a businessman, and his ready resort to legal, tax and accounting advisers, I find it strange that if he intended to set up a trust, he did not do so in clearer language in his letters. Indeed, his letter of 22 May 1959 to Ernest was the <span class="font-italic">first and only time </span>Robert Sr used the word “trust” to describe LIL. Also, being fluent in the English language (as we see in the clear and direct language used in his letters) and meticulous by nature (as in his keeping and numbering of his correspondence), I also find it odd, if Robert Sr did indeed set up a family trust for all his descendants, that he would talk about liquidating LIL and dividing the funds amongst his children and wife so that they could do as they pleased with their share (see above at [132(b)] and [132(d)]).  I also note fluidity in NEL’s assets in that over the years, assets were transferred out and others transferred into NEL.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Furthermore, I am unable to ascertain from Robert Sr’s letters alone when this “family trust” and guarantee for the livelihood and well-being of all Robert Sr’s descendants was created. As noted above at [119], Robert Sr’s letter of 10 February 1964 (written just over five-and-a-half years <span class="font-italic">after</span> his 7 July 1957 Avarice Letter), where he writes about liquidating LIL’s (by then re-named NEL) interest in shipping and dividing the cash between his wife and four children, does not seem to evidence a trust that had been created before February 1964. His subsequent letters to the time of his death on 27 May 1967 are silent on whether any trust had been created by him.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Taking his letters as a whole, I find on balance that they do not constitute evidence that a family trust had been created by Robert Sr for all his descendants, nor do they evince an intention of his to create one. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 I do, however, draw the following preliminary conclusions from his letters, which of course remains to be tested against other objective evidence and the oral evidence of witnesses. It is fairly clear to me that Robert Sr, having a strong aversion to paying more taxes than was absolutely necessary and avoiding estate duty where possible, did the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) He started off with LIL as a means to self-insure his life, so that if anything untoward happened to him, his wife and children would be protected by having funds available for their livelihood and well-being.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) He strongly and unselfishly believed in the family and consistently treated all the wealth that his hard work produced as belonging to the family and not to him.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) When he had accumulated more than what was necessary, by way of a “life-insurance fund” to protect his family in the event of his untimely death, he clearly expressed his wish that LIL was to remain a family company and its assets and wealth were to remain within the family; this was to run until “doom’s day” <span class="font-italic">if</span> his sons and sons’ sons so desire it.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) I find that Robert Sr’s relaxed approach to operating his companies in his early years (as witnessed by the way Robert Sr swopped his companies around and reorganised them as it suited him), saw a change in 1958 when the Hong Kong Government attempted to amend estate duty legislation and look behind private family investment companies. Robert Sr’s hitherto leisurely planning of divestment in LIL became suddenly threatened in 1958 by the proposed legislative changes, and his letters in 1958 clearly show him trying to quickly undo these strictures by declaring dividends to lower cash surpluses in companies and cashing in on his assets into liquid cash. After 1958, Robert Sr learnt to avoid corporate structures that were unwieldy and that could not be undone easily, ensuring opacity in the ownership of companies as well as the benefits of liquid funds that could be moved around quickly to avoid taxes and death duties.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Setting up a formal trust meant a fixed structure, something that would have been more transparent and more rigid, its assets could not be taken away and taxation in its domicile would have to be paid; hence Robert Sr dealt with his wealth, residing in his companies, as something belonging to the family (and not himself), keeping assets securely in one company which was segregated from the operational businesses, but while he was alive, he considered himself the “trustee” (in a colloquial and non-legal sense of the word) of the family wealth and no one could question what he spent, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, on his breeding of race horses. He ran the businesses and placed assets in LIL over the years and separated LIL from JMC. LIL could in a loose manner of speaking be considered the ‘trust’, or his ‘life insurance policy’, but unlike a true trust or a trust in the legal sense, Robert Sr had an absolute say in the running of LIL and its businesses, the distribution of proceeds and the retention of capital of the funds in LIL. He further had a free hand in deciding what assets went into or be taken out of LIL and what remained in JMC. Over time, LIL’s assets were more than what was required as a “life insurance fund” for his family in the event of his untimely death.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Robert Sr, being the savvy businessman that he was, wanted flexibility to structure his companies and wealth in a way that avoided taxes, estate duty and prying eyes (as he describes in one of his letters: “what anybody else does not know will not hurt anyone”). This approach was implemented by him in his lifetime – despite divesting himself of all his shares in LIL and writing letters to evidence that they were outright gifts and not held on trust for him, he retained absolute control of LIL and its subsidiaries. This was followed through when he created Strath Nominees to hold Tony’s and Bobby’s shares enabling them to avoid having to declare too much in their Australian tax returns.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) This was clearly set out by his scheme that any money to be used for their investments in Australia was to be by way of loans from and routed through their banks in Switzerland and Canada, so as to avoid questions on the origin of the funds and enable opaque “repayment” therefor.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) When he passed on, it would fall on his sons to decide whether to continue this or not. However, while he was alive, he always inculcated in them that everything he had “belonged to the family” and that was clearly how he would like them to treat his wealth when he was gone.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) On 7 July 1957, when he wrote his Avarice Letter, he said that having achieved <span class="font-italic">more</span> than providing for his family by way of insurance, it was <span class="font-italic">his wish</span> that LIL would always continue as a family undertaking to guarantee the livelihood and well-being of all his descendants and then to deserving relatives. As noted above at [92], he used the word “wish” which I believe was a deliberate choice on his part.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(j) Robert Sr’s “wish” can clearly be seen in his exhortations to Ernest to build and raise the family fortunes to greater heights.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(k) It was a “wish” because it was up to his sons to decide if they would want to continue this “family” legacy of keeping the wealth in companies, keeping one or more of the companies holding assets securely segregated from the operational businesses, running them for the benefit of the family and consistent with this, he did not set up a formal trust because he knew laws could change in the different jurisdictions they operated in and flexibility coupled with an opaque structure which also avoided taxation were key elements in his mind.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(l) It is for this same reason that Robert Sr, at times, talked about dividing up all the money between his wife and children and they could decide what they wanted to do with their shares of the money. This is something that is contrary to the idea of a family trust that was to last for the well-being of all his descendants, and as noted above at [132(d)], this was last expressed in a letter in February 1964.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(m) It was also clear that all the wealth he had accumulated was for his wife and children in equal shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Having come to the preliminary conclusion (from Robert Sr’s letters) that Robert Sr did not set up a family trust, I now turn to the oral evidence and the other documentary evidence that post-dated Robert Sr’s death to test my conclusion. While examining this evidence, I will also make findings as to the second part of the underlying issue, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>whether the Plaintiff Companies and their assets belong to Ernest. Before doing so, I briefly set out some of the events that took place after Robert Sr’s death in order lay the context within which the evidence is to be examined.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Events after Robert Sr’s death</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 When Robert Sr passed away unexpectedly, Ernest was the obvious person to take over the mantle from him. Ernest had already been a director of JMC since May 1953, a joint managing director with Robert Sr since 1957 and had taken over the reins in JMC after Robert Sr’s health deteriorated in November 1964. Tony had long disavowed any interest in business and shipping and was comfortably settled in Australia. There is little mention of Bobby’s training in the business or of his business acumen. If I had to make the finding, he probably was not as astute a businessman as Ernest was. Bobby eventually also settled in Australia, assisting Robert Sr in running the Australian business as “private secretary” to Robert Sr. It was natural therefore for Ernest to take charge of the “family’s businesses” after his father passed away, especially given Robert Sr’s apparent practice that whoever runs LIL or the JMC business must remain outside Australia for purposes of tax and estate duty (see [72] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Camila was the sole beneficiary under Robert Sr’s will. Given Robert Sr’s aversion to estate duty and his careful planning over the years, there was probably nothing substantial in his estate. As noted above, LIL’s shareholders, at the time of Robert Sr’s death, were JERIC and this has been set out at [113] above. Robert Sr had long divested himself of any shareholding in LIL or JMC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Movement of NEL and JMC shares after Robert Sr’s death</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Robert Sr’s company structures were relatively straightforward and perhaps reflected the simplicity of his time. The only opacity deployed was the use of Strath Nominees to hold Tony and Bobby’s shares in NEL when their residence in Australia would have caused tax exposures. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 When Ernest took full charge of NEL after Robert Sr’s death, he very swiftly engaged in a complex re-structuring of the companies and shareholdings. Although NEL was a Hong Kong corporation, he moved the “ownership” of NEL out of Hong Kong by the use of BVI, Panamanian, as well as Liberian corporations. Within three months of Robert Sr’s death, the following took place:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On 1 and 12 August 1967, the board of directors of JMC resolved to sell its dormant subsidiaries, SR, Pan-Pacific Navigation Company (“Pan Pac”), and SM to “a party represented by Mr. E. F. De Lasala, Mr. S. B. Mitford, Mr. A. Vasquez and Mr. E. S. Velasquez”.

</div> but this is of course a matter of much contention. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 The complexity of these corporate structures and restructuring have given rise to multiple facets to this dispute and complicated the picture beyond measure. I pause to note that this was probably the underlying intent in any case – to create an opacity that could not be pierced – but it has given rise to difficulties of new dimensions in this case. For a start the corporate records are incomplete and there are no ledgers or financial statements or other documents that are necessary to answer the rival contentions.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Evidence of the main witnesses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 I now turn to the evidence of the main witnesses, Ernest, Tony, Bobby and Isabel, and my assessment of their veracity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 For reasons that I shall come to, I have formed the view that Ernest, Tony and Isabel, who know the answer to the underlying issue, have not told me the truth. I find Bobby to be the most reliable witness of the four, but he could not give me the necessary details as he left everything to Ernest. Ernest, Tony and Isabel, (with Bobby to a very much lesser extent), are probably united in one reason for not telling me everything – their respective exposures to queries from tax authorities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 Another difficulty I faced was the incomplete and fragmented documents placed before me. They came from various periods over the decades; some were in manuscript which was decipherable only with great difficulty, some were undated, others were obviously apocryphally dated, and some were written by authors who were no longer able to give evidence, like Bertram Stanley Mitford (“Mitford”), an accountant and/or comptroller of the “JMC Group” and Matthew Ku Yun Ting (“Matthew Ku”), an accountant who succeeded Mitford and was company secretary and director of JMC as well. Many of these important documents were cryptic and raised more questions than they answered, and varying interpretations were placed on them by the witnesses. A number of these documents were given in discovery over the course of the trial, some of which came in only after a relevant witness had completed his or her evidence and there was no recall of witnesses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 The Agreed Bundles were admitted without formal proof but not necessarily as to contents. At the beginning of trial, I informed counsel that if the content of any of these documents were important or relevant to their case, I expected them to put it to the witnesses in the way they deemed fit. If they did not, and I came across these documents after submissions, then I was entitled to draw what conclusions I saw fit, although I would remind myself that they have not been tested in cross-examination. All counsel agreed. I therefore had to do the best I could from these documents, many of which were from long ago.        </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161  I should also note that all the three brothers had hearing defects to varying degrees. Many a time questions had to be repeated. This was despite counsel arranging for a computer displaying the Live-note so that the witnesses could read the question off the computer screen. However, every now and then they would get caught-up with the question-and-answer sequence and fail to look at the computer. This hearing impairment was a factor I had to keep in mind when assessing their evidence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Ernest’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 I found Ernest to be a larger than life character; he has a strong mind, a domineering will, and is as forceful as he is stubborn. He often refused to answer questions that he did not want to answer or when he found them to be awkward. He was quick-thinking and sharp, but unfortunately for him, he was met by pointed and searching cross-examination from two Senior Counsel on the glaring inconsistencies in his evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 However, to give Ernest his due, it is clear to me that Ernest is, if not more, as extraordinarily astute as a businessman and investor as his father, and the family is very fortunate he was there to take over from Robert Sr when death intervened.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 Ernest’s case is simple, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, all the money was his. He had bought out everyone and he had set up the Plaintiff Companies and other corporate structures as “pockets” or “envelopes” to hold <span class="font-italic">his</span> assets and monies. There was neither an intermediate position with his assertions and claims nor an alternative case that perhaps <span class="font-italic">some</span> of those monies belonged to others.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 I do not accept his evidence or his claims for quite a number of objective reasons and my subjective assessment of his evidence under cross-examination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 First, Ernest has sworn affidavits and filed pleadings and further and better particulars with changing versions as to how he bought everyone out. They are not simply different versions with various amendments to a central core or theme but completely different stories. I accept that as one ages, events that occurred five to six decades ago can grow dim and mistakes can occur, <span class="font-italic">eg</span> whether Ernest bought out his mother or siblings in 1957 or 1958 or 1964. However certain events, like whether he bought everyone out <span class="font-italic">before</span> or <span class="font-italic">after</span> his father died, are not things which one would make a mistake about. This is especially so given that: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) all the children adored and loved their father;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Robert Sr’s passing was unexpected;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Isabel’s wedding had to be postponed as a result of Robert Sr’s sudden demise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Indeed, Ernest’s siblings had no difficulty recalling the latter two events during cross-examination, which Isabel described as “significant”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 I accept the submissions of the counsel for the Plaintiff Companies and ECJ, Mr Thio Shen Yi SC (“Mr Thio SC”) and Mr Bull SC respectively, that Ernest had to keep changing stories as and when documents were produced which showed that material parts of affidavits he had just sworn were wrong or untrue. As noted above, these changes were anything but minor. Ernest really had no answer when these changes were put to him to explain. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168   Secondly, there were also pieces of evidence, some emanating from Ernest himself, written long after he claims he bought everyone out, unequivocally telling his mother and siblings of their 20% share. It defies belief that someone as astute and sharp as Ernest could have forgotten all this and swear to facts that he bought everyone out when he claimed he did. He never counted on ECJ laying their hands on such documents. The fact that these documents were discovered at different times caught him out with each round of affidavits. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 Thirdly, Ernest was embroiled in legal proceedings with his second wife, Hannelore in 1970. He was also sued in 1976 by Mitford, along with 22 other corporate entities including NEL, JMC, CE, SM and SR, in the Superior Court of Alaska. In the former, he caused affidavits to be sworn on his behalf and in the latter, he gave evidence in depositions. On both occasions he stated on oath that he was managing the family business and he only owned a share in it. The evidence from these two cases, which I shall come to in greater detail, were also unearthed by ECJ fairly late in the day.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 I now turn to deal with the changes in Ernest’s evidence and storyline.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Ernest’s first story </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 When the Plaintiff Companies filed an affidavit in support of the Injunction Application on 5 March 2012, Ernest filed an affidavit in response one month later (“Ernest’s Injunction Affidavit”). In this Affidavit, Ernest claimed that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) He bought out JRIC’s interests in NEL in the late 1950s or early 1960s, <span class="font-italic">before</span> Robert Sr died;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) He did so by purchasing NEL’s shareholding in JMC, which according to Ernest was NEL’s sole remaining asset at that time; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) He was the only family member with any interest in JMC, unlike JRIC, who were never involved in running JMC’s business and were never shareholders in JMC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Ernest’s Injunction Affidavit stated as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14. …<span class="font-italic">NEL was essentially a family owned company</span>, with the shareholders being myself, my siblings and my parents. It was set up to hold the assets of my late father, for the benefit of my family. <span class="font-italic">In contrast, JMC was always intended to be a business, where those running the company </span><span class="font-italic">(i.e. the directors) were also the shareholders.

As Edward observes in paragraph 16 of his affidavit, my father divested himself of his stake in NEL by transferring his shareholding in NEL to my mother and his four children equally in or after 1957. <span class="font-italic">By or around the late 1950s or early 1960s, there was a distribution of funds within NEL whereby NEL’s assets (save for certain shares which NEL owned in JMC) were sold, and the cash proceeds from this sale were distributed among its shareholdings, including my siblings (i.e. Tony, Isabel and Bobby) and I. Sometime after this distribution of funds, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">I then proceeded to purchase from NEL its shares in JMC. </span><span class="font-italic">These shares were NEL’s only remaining asset at that time. I executed this purchase by making payment for these JMC shares to the other NEFL shareholders, i.e. my mother and siblings. </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">From that point on, as far as my mother, siblings and I were concerned, their shares/interest in NEL had been bought by me.</span><span class="font-italic"> Accordingly, they no longer held any interest in NEL, JMC and/or the John Manners Group.

It was Robert Sr.’s policy to allocate shares in JMC to trusted employees for their hard work, whom he also made directors. <span class="font-italic">At all material times, JMC was not a family owned company and therefore did not belong to the de La Sala family.

</div> There is also an undated typewritten note on a writing pad from Savoy Hotel London (“the Savoy Note”) suggesting that JRIC’s shares in JMC be placed in trust with Strath Nominees. The evidence shows that in 1961, 3,840 JMC shares were held in the name of Strath Nominees Ltd. These correspond to four parcels of 960 shares each for JRIC, as per the Savoy Note and Robert Sr’s letter dated 23 November 1958. Accordingly Ernest’s claim that he “was and remained” the only member of JERIC to hold any interest in JMC was not true;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) JMC’s Annual Returns in 1966 and a Memorandum of Strath Nominees dated 10 June 1964 show that JRIC’s shareholding in JMC through Strath Nominees Ltd was reduced from 3,840 shares to 3,600 shares and transferred to and held by Overseas Nominees Ltd. The balance 240 shares were transferred to Ostenfeld. This corresponds to the JMC 1969 Note, where Ernest stated that JRIC held 900 shares each in JMC and 0.75% of the JMC shares (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 60 shares) each had been transferred to Ostenfeld.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) By 1 September 1970, the 3,600 JMC shares held through Overseas Nominees Ltd were transferred to CE, which was part of the first triangular structure created by Ernest (see [146] above) and according to JMC’s Annual Return dated 27 December 2011, CE is still the registered shareholder of 3,600 shares in JMC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Ernest’s second story</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 On 8 April 2013, Ernest filed further and better particulars to his original defence. In these particulars, Ernest claimed, <span class="font-italic">for the first time</span>, that he bought out JRIC’s shares in NEL in or around August 1967 through his nominee SR, <span class="font-italic">after </span>his father passed away.

Ernest deleted the portions in his original defence and counterclaim which pleaded that “[a]t all material times, JMC was not a family owned company and therefore did not belong to the de La Sala family [and] its shareholders were also its directors”, and which gave rise to the further and better particulars referred to above, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that he acquired JMC shares from previous directors/shareholders and not JRIC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 In his amended defence and counterclaim, Ernest now told a new story that was completely inconsistent with his earlier story in two major respects:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) JRIC <span class="font-italic">had owned shares in JMC</span>; he even provided a background story as to JRIC’s shareholdings in JMC, pleading that JRIC had acquired their shares in JMC from LIL by the end of the 1950s; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Ernest allegedly<span class="font-italic"> purchased JRIC’s shares in JMC </span>in 1970 through his nominee company CE – a transaction that <span class="font-italic">could not</span> have co-existed with Ernest’s story in his Injunction Affidavit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 I accept Mr Bull SC’s submissions that Ernest’s new story of purchasing JRIC’s shares in JMC enabled him to now ignore clearly contrary evidence brought up by Edward’s 2nd Injunction Affidavit, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, Ernest’s JMC 1969 Note which plainly contradicted his earlier story that he was the only De La Sala family member who owned an interest in JMC. It is also clear that Ernest did not provide any explanation or reasons as to why there were such fundamental changes to his story, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that he acquired JRIC’s interest in NEL in August 1967 and that he acquired JRIC’s shares in JMC in 1970.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Ernest’s AEIC</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 In Ernest’s Affidavit of Evidence in Chief (“AEIC”), I find elements of reconstruction and embellishment. Ernest is now able to provide details and new allegations that I find surprising were never raised before:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Ernest now claims that JRIC were happy to sell their shares to him because they:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) had no experience of the shipping business;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) did not want to be subject to the vagaries and risks of the shipping business; and </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) held a minority position which made if difficult, if not impossible, to sell their shares in the open market.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) JRIC sold their shares to Ernest in accordance with an alleged  convention established by Robert Sr – the price of shares reflected shareholder funds as at the end of the preceding year and they were not paid for immediately, but over time from future dividends – described by Ernest as “vendor financing”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) NEL’s shareholder funds as at 31 March 1967 were at a record high of HK$50,932,890 and that was the basis of valuing NEL shares at US$10 million.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) JMC’s shareholder fund had grown to HK$33,515,422 in 1970. As JRIC held 45% of JMC, their shares were sold to Ernest for HK$15,081,940 or about US$2,488,769.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Ernest says he bought JRIC’s NEL and JMC shares through a “round tripping” exercise (“the Round Trip Transaction”) – he acquired two redundant JMC subsidiaries, SR and SM (referred to in two JMC minutes dated 1 August 1967 and 12 August 1967). He then organised a “circular” structure with shares in SR owned by SM and the shares in SM owned by SR, both as his nominees. He obtained a loan of US$10m from HKSBC, San Francisco which he lent to SM, which in turn deposited US$1.5m with HKSBC and lent SR US$8.5m. SR took a loan from Lloyds Bank of US$1.5m and combining the two, enabled SR to pay JERIC US$10m for their shares in NEL. JERIC then lent US$10m to SM which was used to repay its debt to Ernest and then his debt to HKSBC – Ernest therefore became the beneficial owner of NEL and the obligation to pay US$8.5 million to JRIC was his because SR and SM participated in these transactions solely as his nominees. JRIC were to be paid from future dividends of NEL. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) As for JMC, Ernest acquired JRIC’s shares in JMC through his nominee company CE which he incorporated in August 1969. Ernest then personally owed JRIC the purchase price, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, approximately US$2.5m. Like the NEL shares purchase, the purchase price for the JMC shares was to be paid from the future dividends of JMC.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Tony and Bobby had been fully paid out for their NEL and JMC shares in 1987 after an alleged request by Bobby. Ernest claimed for the first time that Tony and Bobby had signed a Memorandum (“the 1987 Memorandum”) to acknowledge full payment for their shares.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) Camila’s expenditures over the years and her periodic gifts to her grandchildren had reached her full entitlement coincidentally by the time of her death in 2005.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) I note there was no mention when Isabel was paid out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Assessment of Ernest’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 One of the significant problems with Ernest’s evidence is his total lack of an explanation in his affidavits for the many fundamental changes in his stories, the later versions of which as noted above are inconsistent with his earlier versions. It is not surprising that he was unable to explain these inconsistencies under cross-examination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 A typical example of his refusal to answer a question on or acknowledge his change of his story in his affidavits can be seen below:

However his story at trial was that JRIC were paid some 20 years later.

</div>
</div> The progress of his cross-examination and his evasive responses on this subject from “I am now recalling what I think actually happened” to “I’m trying to recall” to “I can’t really recall” bears reading to see what kind of unbelievable evidence Ernest gives on the witness stand. When I finally intervened to get some progress, Ernest first tried the same evasive answers and vague recollections, but when I stopped him and asked him to read the question on the computer screen, so that there could be no misunderstanding by him as to what the question was and to answer the same, Ernest admitted that he could not understand his statement in para 15 of his Injunction Affidavit and he could not remember why he made that statement. To counsel he admitted he did not understand para 15 of his Injunction Affidavit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 Ernest could not explain these fundamental changes in his story-lines and evidence. The fundamentally inconsistent story-lines, which I summarise below, show how totally unreliable Ernest’s evidence is:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, Ernest’s Injunction Affidavit claimed he had acquired all of JRIC’s shares in NEL in the late 1950s or early 1960s and many years before Robert Sr’s death. At trial, he had a totally different time-line – he only acquired JRIC’s interests in NEL and JMC soon after Robert Sr’s death.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, Ernest’s Injunction Affidavit specifically described his acquisition of JRIC’s interests based on a single transaction, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, his alleged purchase of NEL’s shares in JMC in the late 1950s or early 1960s which he claimed was NEL’s sole remaining asset at that time. After this key transaction, JRIC allegedly treated their shares and interest in NEL as having been bought out by Ernest. At trial, Ernest’s story was that there were two separate transactions – JRIC first sold their shares in NEL to Ernest in 1967 shortly after Robert Sr’s death, and then subsequently sold their shares in JMC to Ernest three years later in 1970.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, Ernest’s Injunction Affidavit claimed that he had purchased NEL’s shareholding in JMC thereby effectively acquiring JRIC’s interest in NEL. At trial, his story was that he purchased JRIC’s shareholding in NEL in 1967 and JRIC’s shareholding in JMC in 1970.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourthly, in his Injunction Affidavit, it was a necessary feature of his story that NEL owned shares in JMC at the time of or just prior to Ernest’s acquisition of NEL from JRIC, since it was through Ernest’s acquisition of JMC from NEL that he claimed to have effectively acquired JRIC’s interests in NEL. At trial, in his new story where he claimed to have purchased JRIC’s NEL shares in 1967, NEL had ceased to own any shares in JMC for almost nine years before Ernest allegedly acquired NEL from JRIC (see [182] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Fifthly, in his Injunction Affidavit, Ernest’s story was that he had bought NEL’s JMC shares <span class="font-italic">before</span> he acquired JRIC’s NEL shares and transferred the latter to his nominee companies. In his AIEC, this changed to a suggestion that JRIC had agreed to sell their NEL and JMC shares to Ernest at the same time.

</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Sixthly, Ernest’s Injunction Affidavit alleged that JRIC were paid at the time when Ernest purchased NEL’s shares in JMC (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in the late 1950s or early 1960s) and that he subsequently proceeded to transfer JRIC’s shareholdings in NEL to his nominee companies. At trial, Ernest’s story completely changed the timing of Ernest’s payment to JRIC. His story was that JRIC were only paid many years after their shares in NEL and JMC were transferred to Ernest’s nominee companies in accordance with an alleged convention whereby the purchase price was paid by instalments to the seller out of future dividends declared by NEL and JMC.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Seventhly, Ernest’s Injunction Affidavit set out facts leading to his alleged purchase of NEL’s “only remaining asset” which consisted of its shares in JMC. Ernest’s Injunction Affidavit attested to the sale of all NEL’s assets (except for its JMC shares) and a distribution of the cash proceeds from the sale amongst NEL’s shareholders in the late 1950s or early 1960s. These significant facts on which his Injunction Affidavit story-line rested simply dropped out of sight from his new story at trial. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) Eighthly, Ernest’s Injunction Affidavit alleged that he had bought <span class="font-italic">all</span> of NEL’s JMC shares in the late 1950s or early 1960s. In contrast, his story at trial was that he had bought only 20% of NEL’s shares in JMC in 1958.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Ninthly, Ernest’s new story of acquiring both NEL and JMC shares through his “nominee companies” are not at all mentioned or even alluded to in his Injunction Affidavits. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 On top of these inconsistencies, there were other aspects of Ernest’s version of his case at trial which could and should have been raised in his Injunction Affidavit, but were instead conspicuously missing therefrom. They include the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The alleged reasons why JRIC sold their shares in NEL and JMC to Ernest, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to escape the vagaries of shipping and the difficulty in selling the shares in the open market.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The prices which JRIC obtained for their shares in NEL and JMC and how those prices, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, US$8m and US$2m respectively, were determined via Robert Sr’s convention of pegging the purchase price to the shareholder funds as at the end of the preceding financial year.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The structure of the alleged purchases, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Roundtrip Transaction referred to at [184(e)] above.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The purchase price of the NEL and JMC shares was to be paid via “vendor financing”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, via the future dividends declared by NEL and JMC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 As stated above, I have no doubt that one of the drivers for Ernest’s need to change his story from time to time was due to the various stages of discovery of documents which showed his prior versions to be untrue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 The only conclusion I can draw from this, coupled with the following facts: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) that Ernest has not produced a single piece of paper evidencing these buy-outs of his family;  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) that Ernest had himself sent documents, letters, micro-cassettes, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>, evidencing the 20% shares JRIC had in the funds and business ventures he managed; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the large sums of money Ernest kept sending to his siblings and siblings’ children,</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">is, to borrow the description of Gloster J of a litigant in <span class="font-italic">Boris Abramovich Berezovsky v Roman Arkadievich Abramovich</span> [2012] EWHC 2463 (Comm) at [100], that Ernest is an “unimpressive, and inherently unreliable, witness, who regarded truth as a transitory, flexible concept, which could be moulded to suit his current purposes.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 As if this was not enough, I now turn to two court proceedings: one in Hong Kong in 1970 where Ernest adopted the position that most of his wealth did not belong to him but to the De La Sala family, and another in Alaska in 1977–1984 where he said in depositions that he was a trustee of family assets held in companies which included NEL, JMC, SR, SM, CE and JMC’s subsidiaries.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Hannelore 1969/1970 divorce proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 Ernest became embroiled in divorce proceedings with his second wife, Hannelore, in November 1969 with the filing of her petition for a divorce. They were divorced in 1970. Hannelore was contacted by James around July 2012. Hannelore says James informed her of the position that Ernest has taken in these Singapore proceedings, which is quite the opposite to the position he took in their divorce proceedings in Hong Kong over 49 years ago. She filed her AEIC on 3 January 2014 and gave evidence before me. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 I found her to be a truthful witness and accept her evidence. Her evidence was backed up by contemporaneous documents and affidavits filed in their divorce proceedings. It included an affidavit by Ernest’s then-solicitor, Mr Raymond Edward Moore (“Mr Moore”), a partner in the Hong Kong law firm, Deacons, dated 5 January 1970, where he deposed, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1. I am a partner in the firm of Messrs Deacons, Solicitors and Notaries and have the conduct of these proceedings on behalf of [Ernest].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. [Ernest] is at present in Australia on business and I have his express authority by long distance telephone to make and file this Affidavit in these proceedings.   </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4. I have been given by [Ernest] details of his assets and means and <span class="font-italic">on the facts and circumstances of this case known to me, I verily believe</span> that <span class="font-italic">the amounts offered</span> by [Ernest] to the [Hannelore] for the child of the marriage as set forth in the letter written by me to [Hannelore’s] Solicitors … are <span class="font-italic">no less than this Honourable Court would properly order if </span><span class="font-italic">[Hannelore] were to succeed in contested proceedings</span> against [Ernest] for dissolution of marriage and maintenance.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 Deacons was a leading law firm in Hong Kong at that time. Letters from Robert Sr show that he too had consulted the firm of Deacons (see [100] above), and it is telling that Mr Moore is prepared to swear an affidavit on the reasonableness of Ernest’s offer to Hannelore based on Mr Moore’s personal knowledge of the “facts and circumstances of this case known to [him]”. I do not believe a partner from such a law firm would have sworn such an affidavit if he had reason to believe otherwise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 In her divorce petition, Hannelore had estimated Ernest’s personal assets, as at 1 November 1969, to be in excess of HK$50m, and that his income to be in excess of HK$250,000 per annum.

</div> Hannelore explains that although the De La Sala family was worth a lot more, she understood from Ernest that the vast majority of this sum belonged to the family rather than Ernest alone. She also had this understanding because in a conversation with Robert Sr one evening, he told her that he had taken steps to provide for the whole family and not just Ernest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 Ernest took the position in the divorce proceedings in 1969/1970 that he was only a custodian, and not the owner, of the De La Sala family assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 Hannelore states that Ernest represented to her during the divorce proceedings that he personally owned assets worth much less than the HK$50m figure she and her lawyers had originally estimated. He also allegedly told her at that time that he was in financial difficulties and she should take what he offered quickly instead of running the risk of getting nothing. He offered to: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) pay her HK$850,000 as settlement for all her claims, including her claim for maintenance;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) settle, upon trust for their son, HK$500,000 contingent upon their son reaching 25 years of age with power to the independent trustee to pay income and/or capital for the advancement, benefit or education as they think fit;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) provide a suitably furnished residence for Hannelore during her life, purchased in the names of independent trustees in trust for her life and thereafter to their child, contingent upon his attaining the age of 25, after which the property will revert to Ernest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 Hannelore had no reason to doubt Ernest because, as noted above, his solicitor filed an affidavit on his behalf (as Ernest was, rather strategically I venture to think, in Australia) confirming to the court that the amounts offered by Ernest were <span class="font-italic">no less than</span> what the Hong Kong Supreme Court would have awarded in contested proceedings. Apparently, Hannelore’s lawyer agreed and advised her to accept the offer as he too had over-estimated Ernest’s personal wealth.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 There can be no two ways about Ernest’s position in 1969/1970. He was either lying through the affidavits filed by his solicitor on his behalf in the divorce proceedings in 1969/1970, or he is lying now that he bought out his mother and siblings’ interests in LIL/NEL (either in the late 1950s or early 1960s (as alleged in his Injunction Affidavit) or in 1967 (as alleged in his AEIC)). If it was true that he was in dire financial straits in late 1969 and January 1970, then one wonders how he could have afforded to purchase JRIC’s shares in JMC through CE, which would have occurred on 1 September 1970, the date CE became the registered shareholder of JMC shares as reflected in JMC’s Annual Returns of 17 May 1971. The documentary evidence of JMC’s record of dividend payments shows that in 1970, JMC had shareholder funds of HK$36m and paid an annual dividend of HK$8m. It was financially able to pay a further HK$37.6m in dividends over the next four years. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 Under cross-examination it was pointed out to Ernest that his offer to Hannelore in the divorce proceedings was less than US$300,000. This represented less than 3% of the value of NEL and JMC shares which Ernest had allegedly acquired from JRIC by 1970. Ernest’s only explanation was that the figure was arrived after consultation between lawyers and accountants and his assets had to be off-set against liabilities.

As will become clear below, when Ernest referred to securing “[his] assets” in his letter dated 8 November 1969, he was referring to his portion of the family’s assets.

</div> Mr Johnson’s Affidavit is in support of an application that the matter proceed by way of writ action.

First, under para 11(a), Ernest disputes Hannelore’s allegation that Robert Sr divested himself of all of his shares in NEL to his wife and children on 24 November 1958. However, Ernest’s AEIC exhibits a set of minutes of a LIL board meeting dated 24 November 1958 which records the board approving Robert Sr’s transfer of his remaining 599 LIL shares to JERIC.

</div> Secondly, under para 11(c) above, he disputes Hannelore’s allegation that all of JERIC’s shareholding in NEL was transferred to SR for US$10m on 8 August 1967. Ernest makes a contrary allegation in these proceedings before me that such a transfer did take place (although on 21 August 1967) and that SR acted as his nominee.

</div> Thirdly, at para 12, Ernest alleges through Mr Johnson that he is not aware of any document that records such issue of SM shares to JERIC. Yet, in the evidence before me, there is a memorandum dated 15 December 1967 drawn up by Ernest himself (“the 1967 Memo”) exhibited in his AEIC which states “SM shares to be issued equally to JERIC as per minutes 12/8/67”. I am cognisant of the fact that in his AEIC, Ernest for the first time put forth his explanation that this reference to SM shares being issued to JERIC was part of his “estate plan”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that it would allow his family members to gain control of his assets without having to obtain probate in the event of Ernest’s sudden demise.

I am of the view that he does this deliberately because he knows the consequences of perjury.

In his deposition, Mitford stated his understanding that the John Manners Group was in the control of the De La Sala family known as the “San Miguel Partnership” or the “Jerrick (ph) Partnership”, which was obviously JERIC as Mitford later went on to name the individuals represented by the acronym.

The ownership of the companies was a “triangular situation” and the family controlled them through their directorship. Ultimately, he deposed, it was the Board of Directors of CE who could draw out the profits and the Board was JERIC and himself.

First, Ernest expressly denied any interest in the “Family Companies” named by Mitford, which as noted above include CE, SM, JMC, SR and NEL. In Mitford’s Second Amended Complaint, he pleaded at para II that the “defendant [Ernest] controls or has interest in and directs defendant corporations, [Australaska], [CDC] and Alaska Enterprises Limited and their affiliated corporations”.

She is also canny enough to know when not to admit something that will be very damaging by retreating behind that screen of absent-mindedness and unfamiliarity with business. A good example of this was brought out during Mr Thio SC’s cross-examination regarding Ernest paying her for her NEL and JMC shares but characterising it as a gift from him.

</div> She accepted Ernest kept doing that whenever he paid her or Bobby, but she refused to accept that that was an incorrect characterisation, insisting that since she was happy to get paid, it did not matter what Ernest called it. For example, she stated: “It’s his way of doing it, I don’t know”; “[a]s long as we know he gave it to us, our money, and he knows it, it doesn’t really matter how you say it”; “[w]ell it’s not a lie to me because I think that’s wonderful, he’s given me my money back”; and “[l]isten, it wasn’t a gift, but he gave me back my money, and to me that’s more important than anything else.” She only accepted it was an incorrect characterisation when I finally intervened.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">241 I find that Isabel’s fencing with counsel is because she<span class="font-italic"> knows</span> why Ernest did that and why she, Tony and Bobby went along with it. It was because the Australian Tax Office (“ATO”) would be very interested to know if they had funds offshore which belonged to them and which had not been declared in their income tax returns. Isabel got rather hot under the collar when Mr Thio SC linked this mischaracterisation with a letter she had written on 26 August 2011 where she wrote: “Furthermore, it might wrongly lead others, including the ATO to believe that we have an interest in the funds/money in the accounts which belongs entirely to Ernest”.

One of these is that just as her father looked after her financially, provided for and protected her, Ernest had done the same and she is immensely grateful and indebted to him for that. Another reason is that Ernest is a source of huge sums of money.

When Isabel was cross-examined on this, she introduced, for the first time, that she was paid for her NEL and JMC shares in dribs and drabs from 1978 until she was fully paid out in 2005.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) 6 March 2012 (1 day after the writ of summons was filed and the day the Plaintiff Companies filed their application for an injunctions) – US$50m;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) 30 April 2012 (approximately 3 weeks after Isabel files her 1st Injunction Affidavit on 5 April 2012) – US$200,000;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) 9 August 2012 – US$250,000;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) 5 December 2012 – US$1m;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) 8 January 2013 – US$300,000;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) 17 January 2013 – US$1m; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) In or around 20 February 2013 (the exact date of transfer is not known) – proceeds of sale from 1,700,000 CapitaLand shares (approximate value S$6,791,500 or US$5,489,855 based on historical average share price on 20 February 2013).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">By the time these documents were disclosed, Isabel and Ernest had completed their evidence and were released. I find it inconceivable that Isabel could have forgotten about these payments. These payments also explain why she tried to throw me off by answering me in the way she did (at [245] above), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, prefacing her answer with the transfer of properties before mentioning the sum of money transferred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">248 I therefore do not accept Isabel’s evidence. I do not find her a truthful witness at all and I cannot rely on anything that she says. After admitting she was not thinking straight when she signed her AEIC, she at least had the grace to admit as much under cross-examination by Mr Bull SC:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q: Mrs Koutsos, I’ll only ask it once more. Would it be fair to say that this court cannot rely on anything that’s stated in your affidavit of evidence-in-chief?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: No.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Tony’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">249 I also find Tony’s evidence equally unreliable. I accept Mr Bull SC’s submission that: “Isabel was not alone when it came to dishonestly tailoring evidence to suit Ernest’s case”. In my view, this was more than made out in the case of Tony’s evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">250 During the time of the injunction proceedings, Tony swore an affidavit making a similar “error” as Isabel in support of Ernest’s Injunction Affidavit:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5.   The money that I received from the sale of the NEL shares which my father divested to me was paid to me by Ernest <span class="font-italic">when</span> Ernest bought my shares in NEL.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">251 By the time it came to his AEIC, Tony told quite a different story. He claimed there was a practice of “vendor finance” set up by Robert Sr, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, when a shareholder bought shares from another, the buyer need not pay the seller immediately but would use the dividends that were declared from time to time to pay the seller. Accordingly, Tony was only paid off in 1987:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">17. My father’s practice for the sale of shares between insiders required the seller to provide vendor finance to the buyer in that payment would come from the dividends that the buyer would receive in the future. In my case, payments were not made to me physically but credited to my running account in Hong Kong. I had no need for funds as my assets and income in Australia more than satisfied all my needs. I believe that it was the same for Isabel, and my mother wanted for nothing.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">18. I have been shown a Memorandum dated 6 April 1987 (attached as “JAPDLS-11”) bearing my signature among others. My recollection is that as Bobby was being paid out, Ernest decided to pay me also. However, I did not assume control of the funds but left them were Ernest had put them. On an occasion when I was in Europe on holiday, I decided to put faces to the bankers that Ernest had talked about and called into their office. I became friendly with one of them, and when he contacted me later to say that he was working at another bank, I transferred the funds to that bank.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">252 Tony tried to “correct” his Injunction Affidavit in his AEIC by explaining that he did not use “when” in a temporal sense in his Injunction Affidavit dated 4 April 2012:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">27. … I also said that the money I received from the sale of my NEL shares was paid to me by Ernest, when he bought my shares in NEL. I did not use “when” in a temporal sense – that Ernest paid me for my NEL shares at the very time he bought them. I meant that Ernest paid me for my NEL share because he had bought them.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Tony was cross-examined and got tied up in knots over this unconvincing explanation. Tony showed he was not even familiar with the excuse given in his AEIC. For example, when he was asked what he meant by the word “temporal”, his answer was that he did not “understand it very much”. He then said it was “legal language to mean what I understood it to be”. When he was then asked whether he understood the word “temporal”, his answer was: “It’s a word I don’t use”.

However, claiming that he was confused, he reverted to the sale in 1967 to match Ernest’s story at trial, and Ernest would pay him when he could afford to:

This was consistent with Ernest’s first story at the Injunction Application that JRIC never held any interest in JMC in the first place. However, Ernest then changed his story to JRIC having owned shares in JMC which Ernest allegedly bought in 1970 (see [171(c)] and [182] above). Tony in his AEIC also suddenly recalled the alleged sale of JMC shares to Ernest in 1970. Under cross-examination, however, Tony completely forgot about his evidence relating to JMC in his AEIC; it was revealed that Tony had no recollection whatsoever of any sale of JMC shares to Ernest:

He was then asked by Mr Thio SC who owned 27 Carrington Avenue in 1987:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: In 1987, ’87, it was -- well, ’80 -- let’s have a look.

Can I look at my notes here, my notebook.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I allowed him to do so, subject to Mr Thio SC’s reservation to look at the “notebook”.

He insisted he did not have to buy her share because she willed her shares to him. When Mr Thio SC asked Tony to confirm Camila owned shares in De La Sala Pty Ltd and JERIC Consolidated Pty Ltd, another Australian company, until the day she died, he refused to let Mr Thio SC finish his question and said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q: So I’ll ask this one last time.

And that’s all I know about it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">261 I digress at this point to note that it is clear to me, and I so find, that Tony had no knowledge of how he allegedly paid off Bobby and Isabel for the Australian properties or how much he paid them. It is important to note that it was <span class="font-italic">not that he could not remember</span>. What is clear from his evidence, and I so find, is that Ernest decided on how much should be paid, how that should be paid for, and “settled” the accounts between the siblings. This was, in essence, what Tony said:

There were growing differences between Tony and Ernest over the years as to how De La Sala Pty Ltd, JMC(A), JERIC Consolidated Pty Ltd (collectively, “the DLS Australian Companies”) were run and how the Australian assets were being managed by Tony. This resulted in a big quarrel between Tony and Ernest in 2003 and their relationship deteriorated badly after that. According to Tony, they had very little contact thereafter.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Tony was “fed up” with being told by Ernest what he should be doing and how he should be managing the Australian businesses and wanted his freedom from interference. This latter part surfaced in Tony’s evidence (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, see [260] above). I also accept Bobby’s evidence that Tony was always complaining about Bobby and his family staying with Robert Sr and Camila “rent free”, and that Camila was tired of this bickering and asked Ernest to settle this with the division of the Australian assets, which Ernest proceeded to do (examined in greater detail below at [448]–[451]) . There is evidence of Ernest making some tallies of properties and values in his handwriting but those notes are undated. What is clear to me, and I so find, is that Ernest proceeded to carve out a large part of the Australian properties to Tony and he “settled” the payment to the other family members.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">263 Mr Thio SC brought Tony to his earlier evidence, given the day before, where he clearly said he bought out Bobby and Isabel and bought the Australian properties <span class="font-italic">after</span> his mother died. However, Tony now claimed he bought over the Australian properties in 1993:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q: So today, Mr De La Sala, you changed your story. Yesterday you said that you bought out the Australian properties after you mother died. Today you even have a date, 1993. You bought them up before your mother died. Which of your two versions is correct, Mr De La Sala?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: Your Honour, yesterday I was tired and confused. I went home, back to check up the record. I found out I -- I found out I may -- I found out I bought the assets in ’93, before my mother, before my mother died, the property -- the assets -- her shares is not mine until she died.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">264 Mr Thio SC pointed out to Tony that his “story” was given at 11.49am in the morning, but Tony insisted he was tired and confused. Mr Thio SC then shifted his questions to what were the “notes” Tony was looking at. As alluded to at [258] above, it was a post-it on his notebook. After Mr Singh SC cleared it, it was passed around. The post-it merely noted: “Hong Kong assets 1987” and “Australian Assets 1993”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">265 Mr Thio SC pressed on with his cross-examination and it is important to note what Tony said he had looked at when making the notes on the post-it. His attempts to fudge his answers clearly showed to me that he knew he was entering into deep water:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q: Mr De La Sala, where did you refresh your memory from to get those dates?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: These dates -- I <span class="font-italic">looked at</span> <span class="font-italic">my documents</span>, I looked at <span class="font-italic">my files</span>.

These are the dates I bought the shopping centre and the other date, that’s the date was – the date that the Hong Kong asset – the Hong Kong -- the Nellie shares were fully paid for.

I ordered that they be produced and Mr Singh SC said he would take instructions over the weekend.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">266 On the Monday following, Mr Singh SC asserted that the document Tony had used to refresh his memory was privileged. It was prepared about two to three weeks ago in the run-up to trial and the document captured communications between solicitors of his firm and Tony at the time. These were allegedly materials prepared by Tony in aid of this litigation. Mr Bull SC and Mr Thio SC objected strongly to this claim of privilege given Tony’s description of what he had referred on the Friday before. After hearing the submissions from counsel, I gave some indications as to what redactions could be made for the alleged privileged portions. Mr Singh SC then asked for and was given a short recess to take instructions. When we resumed, Mr Singh SC told the court he would be producing the whole document without redaction, but his client maintained his position that the notes were in fact privileged. I told Mr Singh SC that was not an acceptable condition. If his client maintained privilege, I would proceed to make a ruling. Mr Singh SC then withdrew that condition and handed copies to the court, Mr Thio SC and Mr Bull SC.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">267 The document was marked “D-3”, It comprised 14 pages of questions and answers and was headed “Possible Questions”. When I went through “D-3”, it certainly did not appear to be much of an aide memoire; there was little reference to events, dates and source documents. Many of the questions and answers were <span class="font-italic">in the nature of a script</span>, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, a question as to why Tony was giving evidence at the trial and an answer like “I am here to tell the truth” is hardly something someone needs to be reminded of. A sample of some of these questions and answers are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q: You have travelled a long way to be here to support Ernest.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: I am doing what is right.

I meant that he bought them, as opposed to me giving them to him. He would pay me when he had the funds. I trusted him. I knew he would pay when he could.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">268 I could find nothing in “D-3” that could be construed as being covered by litigation privilege or by way of communications passing between solicitor and client. I however gave the benefit of the doubt to Mr Singh SC that it was his clients who instructed him to make that claim. I also have little doubt that “D-3” was more than just an embarrassment to Ernest’s legal team; it went to the very veracity of their witnesses and the evidential value of their evidence.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Witness coaching</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">269 From questions that followed to Tony and the other witnesses, it transpired that about three weeks before the start of the trial, there were group “training sessions” for some of the important witnesses in Clifford Chance’s Sydney offices over five days. This involved Tony, Isabel, Nicole (Isabel’s daughter), Suzanne and Elena (Tony’s daughters) and sometimes Ernest. They were typically for about four hours each morning, then a break for lunch and another hour after that. Elena, who was one of Ernest’s witnesses, alleged that “D-3” was created pursuant to these training sessions. Elena would make notes during the “training sessions”, and after the sessions, she and Tony would attempt to recall the questions and answers Tony had given and record them in “D-3”. On top of that, Elena and Tony also purported, out of their own accord they say, to come up with other potential questions that might be asked of Tony and what Tony’s answers to those questions would be. This was how the 14-page document, which set out certain “possible questions” Tony could be asked and the corresponding “correct” responses to those questions, came about. Elena further alleged that during the relevant training session, no documents were shown to jog Tony’s memory; the documents were shown at other sessions. This was why “D-3” did not contain references to documents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">270 From the evidence it is clear, and I so find, that Tony was not shown any documents to assist or jog his memory at the relevant training session even though Elena admitted that her father’s memory needed some assistance.

</div> It is also noteworthy that others who were not called as witnesses, Suzanne, Tony’s daughter, and Frankie Fletcher, a retired lawyer and Ernest’s cousin, (see [312] below) were also present at parts of these training sessions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The law on witness coaching</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">272 In my view, and this is something basic that every advocate worth his salt knows, witness familiarisation is perfectly legitimate. Except for a few lucky individuals, our memories are not infallible and dim with age. Generally speaking, the further one goes back in time, the older the witness is, the more inaccurate his recall will be. This means it is permissible to take the witness through his AEIC and then to assist <span class="font-italic">his</span> recollection of the facts by referring him to the key documents so that he is able to refresh his memory from these documents and their contents. That is also why the drafting of an AEIC is such an important exercise and it is the solicitor’s duty to ensure that what goes into that AIEC, or any affidavit for that matter, is the witness’s own “uncontaminated evidence” (see <span class="font-italic">R v Momodou</span> [2005] 2 All ER 571 at [62] (“<span class="font-italic">Momodou</span>”)). Lawyers should <span class="font-italic">never </span>put words into the witness’s mouth and should refrain from language that is not that of the witness. Neither should they put in events or matters that the deponent cannot recall. Time and again we see words and elegant phrases that a particular witness deposes to in his affidavits, but when cross-examination ensues, it is obvious that the words and language used are not familiar to the witness. The lawyer then exposes his client and his client’s witnesses to confusion and great uncertainty in the hands of a competent cross-examiner, all of which is to the detriment of his client’s case. This also happens when two or more witnesses use exactly the same words as each other in describing an event or a fact so that when one affidavit is found to be untrue or not quite true, it affects the credibility of the other deponents. This clearly happened when Isabel and Tony aligned their initial stories with Ernest’s at the injunction stage without adequate checking of the facts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">273 What is equally clear is that witness “coaching” is not permissible. Guidance and familiarisation by reference to documents becomes coaching when it seeks to supplement or supplant the witnesses’ true recollection with another version of events. This includes giving advice to a witness to move away from his original answer to one which favours his case or the person calling him as a witness. It is also wrong to allow witnesses to collaborate on their answers so as to provide a version that is favourable to a party’s case instead of relying on their honest recollection of what actually happened. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">274 The Plaintiff Companies and ECJ both refer to <span class="font-italic">Momodou</span> to support their arguments. In <span class="font-italic">Momodou</span>, the defendants were charged with violent disorder and arson at an immigration detention centre ran by a private company. Concerned that its employees might be involved in other criminal and civil proceedings, the company arranged for witness training for some of its employees, two of whom became significant witnesses in the prosecution against the defendants. In considering the effect of the witness training on the safety of the conviction of the defendants, Judge LJ, as he then was, held as follows (at [61]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">61 There is a dramatic distinction between witness training or coaching, and witness familiarisation. Training or coaching for witnesses in criminal proceedings (whether for prosecution or defence) is not permitted. This is the logical consequence of the well-known principle that discussions between witnesses should not take place, and that the statements and proofs of one witness should not be disclosed to any other witness … The witness should give his or her own evidence, so far as practicable uninfluenced by what anyone else has said, whether in formal discussions or informal conversations. The rule reduces, indeed hopefully avoids, any possibility that one witness may tailor his evidence in the light of what anyone else said, and equally, avoids any unfounded perception that he may have done so. These risks are inherent in witness training. Even if the training takes place one-to-one with someone completely remote from the facts of the case itself, the witness may come, even unconsciously, to appreciate which aspects of his evidence are perhaps not quite consistent with what others are saying, or indeed not quite what is required of him. An honest witness may alter the emphasis of his evidence to accommodate what he thinks may be a different, more accurate, or simply better remembered perception of events. A dishonest witness will very rapidly calculate how his testimony may be “improved”. These dangers are present in one-to-one witness training. <span class="font-italic">Where however the witness is jointly train with other witnesses to the same events, the dangers dramatically increase. Recollections change. Memories are contaminated</span>. Witnesses may bring their respective accounts into what they believe to be better alignment with others. They may be encouraged to do so, consciously or unconsciously. They may collude deliberately. They may be inadvertently contaminated. Whether deliberately or inadvertently, the evidence may no longer be their own. Although none of this is inevitable, the risk that training or coaching may adversely affect the accuracy of the evidence of the individual witness is constant. So we repeat, witness training for criminal trials is prohibited.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">275 Judge LJ’s guidance was of course given in the context of a criminal case. The extent to which the guidance in <span class="font-italic">Momodou</span> should apply in a civil case, and in particular, a complex civil case such as the present, was answered in <span class="font-italic">Ultraframe (UK) Ltd v Gary Fielding and others</span> [2005] EWHC 1638 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">Ultraframe</span>”). Lewison J considered the application of <span class="font-italic">Momodou</span> in civil cases and gave the following view (at [25]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There are, of course, significant differences between civil and criminal procedure. Not least, in civil cases evidence in chief generally takes the form of a pre-prepared witness statement, whereas in criminal cases it is elicited by (non-leading) question and answer; and in civil cases witnesses are normally permitted to sit in court while other witnesses are giving evidence, whereas in criminal trials this does not happen until the witness has given his own evidence; and even then it is unusual. In criminal cases witnesses do not see each other’s statements or depositions; whereas in civil cases it is common for witnesses to see and respond to the statements of other witnesses. <span class="font-italic">Nevertheless, the principle that a witness’ evidence should be his honest and independent recollection, expressed in his own words, remains at the heart of civil litigation too</span>. In the light of the disappearance of oral evidence in chief from civil cases, it may be thought that the importance of the witness’s own independent recollection in giving his evidence under cross-examination is all the greater.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">276 However, Lewison J ultimately held that it was unnecessary on the facts before him to decide on the permissible limits of witness familiarisation in civil cases. He was of the view that that question raised very difficult issues which must be the subject of wide consultation before any conclusions could be reached (at [31]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">277 Indeed, whether and to what extent the principles in <span class="font-italic">Momodou</span> apply in civil cases is currently the matter of some debate in the United Kingdom (see Charles Hollander QC, <span class="font-italic">Documentary Evidence</span> (Thomson Reuters, 12th Ed, 2015) at para 29-10). In fact, Hollander QC goes further to question the desirability of extending <span class="font-italic">Momodou</span> to civil cases on the basis that these principles are not applied in practice and it would be unrealistic to apply these principles to witnesses in civil cases. He contends that group discussion of key issues is inevitable, and if handled responsibly, can actually improve the quality of the witness’ evidence rather than detract from it (at para 29-09 and 29-10). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">278 With respect, I am not sure I entirely agree with that view. The core principles of <span class="font-italic">Momod</span><span class="font-italic">ou</span> are integral to the adversarial process in the reception of evidence leading to the finding of facts in civil proceedings and I do not think it unrealistic to apply them to civil cases; on the contrary I think they equally should apply (see <span class="font-italic">Ultraframe</span> at [25] cited above). What I can agree with is that with more complex civil cases, <span class="font-italic">some</span> group discussion early on in evidence gathering is inevitable but it always depends on the integrity of the lawyers to ensure it is handled responsibly and to remind potential witnesses of the dangers of coming to a common advantageous view when that is <span class="font-italic">not</span> the recollection of some of them. A good example occurs when the chief executive, who is a witness, insists on a version and his subordinates all fall in line, whether it is the truth or not. When the chain of consistency is broken at the weakest link, or one of the witnesses has an attack of conscience, the edifice collapses spectacularly. So the experienced lawyer knows that he does not take the chief executive’s proof of evidence in front of the chief executive’s subordinates. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">279 In the more complex cases, there are usually documents that can correct faulty memories and I can see nothing wrong if A were to say a meeting took place on a particular date and another witness, B, says that cannot be correct because a document or documents points to another date – that is entirely in the realm of accurate recall and in that context, I agree with Hollander QC that that is likely to improve the quality of the witnesses’ evidence. In the Singapore practice, counsel would sometime ask a witness if he had discussed his evidence with anyone else and such questions are perfectly legitimate in cross-examination. Responsible and experienced counsel know the risks they expose their witnesses to if they allow witness training and coaching. There is also nothing wrong with a lawyer asking questions of his witness as the witness might face in cross-examination but it would be wrong to start coaching him on what is the “right” answer to be given. It is important that the answer is his own. Neither is there anything wrong in showing the witness the court room so that he can familiarise himself with his surroundings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">280 In <span class="font-italic">HKSAR v Tse Tat Fung</span> [2010] HKCA 156 (“<span class="font-italic">Tse Tat Fung</span>”) (like <span class="font-italic">Momodou</span>, this involved a criminal matter), the Hong Kong Court of Appeal agreed with the principle set out in <span class="font-italic">Momodou</span> and stated, at [73]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The facts of <span class="font-italic">Momodou’s </span>case differ significantly from the facts in the present case, where no group discussion sessions took place. Nevertheless the principle applied: the danger in discussing with a witness his evidence prior to trial is that the witness’s recollection of events will either consciously or unconsciously alter so as to accommodate what the witness perceives as a better, for whatever reason, version of events. Obviously this is a matter of degree. A brief discussion with a witness of his proposed evidence to clarify some point of ambiguity or uncertainty may be perfectly sensible and desirable in promoting the integrity and accuracy of the trial process. <span class="font-italic">On the other hand, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the rep</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">etitive “drilling” of a witness to a degree where his true recollection of events is supplanted by another version suggested to him by an interviewer or other party</span><span class="font-italic"> may be of a sort which justifies a </span><span class="font-italic">judge giving the witness’s evidence no weight or in extreme cases, exercising his discretion to exclude that evidence on the basis that it is more prejudicial than probative, or is in some other way, such as to preclude the defendant from receiving a fair trial. </span>[emphasis in italics and bold-italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">281 Elena says that although they were witnesses to the session, they were not allowed to join in. Even if that was true, the passage in <span class="font-italic">Tse Tat Fung</span> cited above aptly warns of what can happen; there is a conscious or unconscious shaping of the observer’s own evidence as to what is the correct or better answer. Elena, who obviously had a good command of English, was asked whether this was a “rehearsal” and her answer was: “No, it was a training session.”

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">282 In the NSW Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Day v Perisher Blue Pty Ltd</span> [2005] NSWCA 110 (“<span class="font-italic">Day v Perisher Blue</span>”), it emerged during the course of the trial that witnesses for the defendant-tortfeasor, prior to the trial, had communications (via teleconference) with each other and other persons, including the solicitors for the defendant, with respect to the form and content of the evidence they were to provide. The defendant’s solicitors had also prepared an extensive document for the defendant outlining “possible areas of questioning (to be passed on to the respective witnesses)” and included suggestions as to the appropriate responses which would be in line with the defendant’s case (at [22]). The trial judge did not address the plaintiff’s attack on the credibility of these witnesses, whose evidence the trial judge accepted. On appeal, the issue was whether the trial judge erred in accepting the evidence of the defendant’s witnesses in the light of the conduct of the witnesses and solicitors. The court held as follows (at [30]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">30 It has long been regarded as proper practice for legal practitioners to take proofs of evidence from lay witnesses separately and to encourage such witnesses not to discuss their evidence with others and particularly not with other potential witnesses. For various reasons, witnesses do not always abide by those instructions and their credibility suffers accordingly. In the present case, it is hard to see that the intention of the teleconference with witnesses discussing amongst themselves the evidence that they would give was for any reason other than to ensure, so far as possible, that in giving evidence the defendant’s witnesses would all speak with one voice about the events that occurred. Thus, the evidence of one about a particular matter which was in fact true might be overborne by what that witness heard several others say which, as it happened, was not true. This seriously undermines the process by which evidence is taken. What was done was improper. The process adopted was more concerned with ensuring that all the witnesses gave evidence which would best serve their employer’s case. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The trial judge’s judgment was eventually set aside and a new trial ordered. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">283 The extent to which witnesses in a civil case may properly discuss their evidence with one another or the solicitors of the party that had called them as witnesses before it amounts to impermissible preparation has not been directly addressed by the Singapore courts. In my judgment, the matter is obviously one of degree and very fact sensitive and I should not lay down any hard and fast rules other than to adopt the principles espoused in the English and Australian authorities referred to above. I accept that the line between witness coaching and training and permissible witness familiarisation can be a very fine one, but that should not prevent a court from making that call and sort the wheat from the chaff. Even though that may be a judgment call, I think there must be very few and rare cases indeed where one can say the line has disappeared. Few will argue with the principle that a witness’ evidence should be his honest and independent recollection, expressed in his own words. This remains at the heart of civil litigation (see <span class="font-italic">Ultraframe</span> at [25]). If, like in <span class="font-italic">Day v Perisher </span><span class="font-italic">Blue</span>, it became apparent that the intention of the witnesses discussing their evidence amongst themselves was to ensure that they would all “speak with one voice” such that their evidence best served one party’s case, then the court is entitled to find that the credibility of the witnesses have suffered as a result. In my view, this must be correct in principle and in law.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Application of law to facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">284 In addition to his inability to give <span class="font-italic">any</span> details on when he sold his shares to Ernest, how much he was paid or when he was paid, and the many inconsistencies in his evidence, which I have set out above, I find that a large part of Tony’s evidence should also be accorded negligible weight due to his witness “training sessions” in Sydney before the trial. There were clearly group “training sessions” and at this advanced stage when several rounds of affidavits and AEICs have been filed,  I cannot see any reason for others being present in Tony’s or Isabel’s or Ernest’s “training” sessions except to ensure they all sang the same tune. Those who were not called as witnesses, like Suzanne and Frankie Fletcher, were also present (see also [312] below). There was the clear risk, recognised in the authorities cited above, that consciously or unconsciously, the witnesses would alter their evidence to take into account the evidence of others, whether or not that was his or her recollection. Although there may have been a reason for this, which was not articulated before me, I can see little justification for these group sessions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">285 Whilst I accept that Mr Singh SC would not have allowed the correction of witness’s evidence, he would not have been present all of the time. In my view, and especially on this very fact-dependant case, the consciously silent or unconscious alteration of evidence could very well have occurred. If witness A had one recollection of an incident and saw witness B being “corrected” when expressing a similar recollection, given the facts and stakes in this case, I find it more likely than not that A will change his or her perspective and answer. The same would go when A, who would have given the same answer to a question, saw that such an answer by B was problematic or would give rise to further probing questions in an undesirable direction. I say this because Ernest has a domineering personality and condones no resistance to his wishes and views on what he thinks are important issues. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">286 Ernest owns or is in control of huge sums of money. He is estranged from his two ex-wives and has disinherited his two sons. Tony and his children were not listed as beneficiaries when ECJ were drafting the trust documents on instructions from Ernest, and they stood to gain enormously if they gained Ernest’s favour. The same goes for Isabel and her only child, Nicole. I have already referred to the large sums of money Isabel received even after she claimed she had been paid in full for her NEL and JMC shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">287 Tony’s reliance on “D-3” is also a serious, probably irremediable, breach of his credibility. His initially evasive answers on what he looked at to refresh his memory informs me that he <span class="font-italic">knows</span> “D-3” would be very damaging to his credibility: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, it is clear that some of the questions and answers were Tony’s own opinion and/or position and/or belief. These surely could not be “facts” for which Tony needed to “refresh” his memory. To be kind, this can be viewed as a “model” answer, but to be more direct and candid, and this is probably the case, “D-3” was more of a scripted answer and position he should take. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, “D-3” did not contain any references to documents to show dates and/or events which could have helped jog Tony’s memory. So his use of “D-3” as an aide memoire is untrue. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, there were several answers like “I don’t know” or “I can’t remember”. It does seem counter-intuitive to remind oneself that one does not know something or can’t remember something. I accept Mr Bull SC’s submission that these were put in to stonewall a problematic line of questions or to cut off questions with “I don’t know”. This is clearly shown where “D-3” indicates that if he was asked about the number of shares he had in LIL, he was to say he could not remember. But in his AEIC, filed just three months before the trial, Tony deposes that he owned 1,200 shares in LIL in 1958.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourthly, some of Tony’s evidence on the stand bore remarkable resemblance to the answers to like or similar questions in “D-3”, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, on the sale of his shares to Ernest. When asked about the price Ernest bought his NEL shares, he repeated the answers set out in “D-3” at page 5, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, he was happy for Ernest to buy his shares, that he trusted Ernest and that he did not need the money. Similarly when asked if he and Ernest had a conversation about the sale of his NEL shares, his answer was that it was a long time ago and he could not recall the details (similar to the proposed answer in “D-3”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">288 Eventually Tony was forced to admit that his initial claim that “D-3” was created for the purposes of refreshing his memory was not true. Tony was unable to come up with an answer as to why “D-3” was created, and like Isabel, retreated to incomprehensibility:

He was very emotional when he spoke of his father’s love for the family and what a principled and upright man he was. His evidence also suffered somewhat from recall of all the details and from his impaired hearing, especially when he answered questions, which he thought were being asked, without looking at the computer screen. However, his main evidence was clear and unwavering, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, he did not sell his NEL and JMC shares to Ernest, he did not recall any discussions or meetings with Ernest, his other siblings or his mother relating to a sale of their interests in NEL to Ernest, his father had set up a guarantee for the De La Sala family in NEL and his father retained <span class="font-italic">full</span> control of NEL in his lifetime even though he held no shares in NEL. He was very clear that the “tree” that his father had established was always there. They partook of its fruit, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the dividends, but the tree was to remain for future generations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">292 Bobby also held his father’s 7 July 1957 Avarice Letter in the highest regard and made sure his children read it. He deposed that it remained an important guidance for the De La Sala family even decades after his father passed away. He said that JERIC continued to refer to that letter to remind themselves of their father’s philosophy, his guidance and objectives regarding his legacy for his descendants. Bobby then gave instances of this letter’s subsequent circulation:

</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In a fax dated 18 April 1998, Ernest sent a copy of this letter to Isabel and copied it to Bobby, saying “if you, Tony and Bobby have lost your copies, I shall fax you a copy”;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In an email dated 6 May 2007, Ernest said he wanted to send a copy of this letter to James and Christina and that they could send a copy to Edward and his family;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In an email from Ernest to Isabel and Cecil dated 7 May 2007, entitled “RPL Treasured Letter on Avarice 07.07.57.pdf”, Ernest sent a copy of that letter to Isabel for her and her family’s “perusal and guidance”;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Bobby also spoke to his children about this letter and in his letter to Ernest thanking him for remitting US$2,669,500 to him and Terrill on 25 March 2008, Bobby referred to the letter and its missal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">293 Bobby’s evidence that he was Robert Sr’s <span class="font-italic">aide-de-camp</span> and personal secretary was not challenged. I accept his evidence that he was very close to his father and stayed with his father and mother at 27 Carrington Avenue in Sydney. As noted above, although Robert Sr’s letters mention plans to launch Bobby into the business when he comes of age, as well as sending Bobby to various places to familiarise him with the family business and to meet with bankers, there is no mention of how he fared. It is more likely than not that Robert Sr found that Bobby was not as astute in business as Ernest was and found him a role instead as his personal secretary. I also accept that Bobby gave Ernest a power of attorney and signed many documents when the latter requested that of him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">294 Given my preliminary conclusions from Robert Sr’s letters (above at [130]–[139]), Bobby may have been mistaken that his father had actually set up a trust in the full legal sense of the word and on the terms of the Avarice Letter. But that is not a fatal flaw in his evidence. His AEIC explains why he held this view. He cited the many letters where his father expressed the fact that LIL/NEL was the family’s guarantee, and the many instances where it was clear that although he did not own any shares, Robert Sr had absolute control over LIL/NEL. There is ample evidence of this fact. Robert Sr must also have articulated those very same sentiments and plans that are found in his letters to his children in his lifetime. It should also be borne in mind that Camila, who of all persons would know what her husband wished and wanted, was around for some 38 years after he died. She only passed on in July 2005. The evidence shows that although Ernest ran all the businesses, she remained the matriarch of the family. I have also referred elsewhere to objective evidence of Ernest’s love for his mother. What Bobby did not realise was the legal significance of those letters where Robert Sr spoke of liquidating NEL and distributing the proceeds (see above at [132(b)] and [132(d)]). Hence, no amount of cross-examination could shake Bobby from his evidence that his father had planted a tree in his lifetime that bore fruit for his descendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">295 I also note that by the time Robert Sr passed away, certain practices had already been set in place. When dividends were declared, they had one-third of the dividend to spend as they wished and two-thirds went back into a pool for family investment, hence the reference to the “tree”. Swiss Bank accounts had been opened in each of their names and JERIC each held 20% of NEL. There was also a set practice for money to be remitted into Australia either by way of loans for purchases of, <span class="font-italic">eg, </span>real property, or by way of “gifts”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">296 As noted above, when Robert Sr passed away, Ernest naturally slipped into the driver’s seat and took over his father’s role in looking after <span class="font-italic">the family’s</span> as well as his own assets and businesses. He remained the tax exile to be “bullet proof” from the Australian tax authorities. Ernest sent back “scorecards” to his siblings to inform them how their investments were doing. I have elsewhere in this judgment referred to the not insignificant number of documents spread over the years which shows Ernest managing the businesses, assets and investments of JRIC. Ernest carried on the practice of paying out only a part of the dividends or income in each year whilst ploughing back the larger portion for re-investment. Not being legally trained, Bobby used terms like “family legacy” to describe this state of affairs and compared that to a tree and the fruit that it produced. To him that was a trust or “legacy” established by his father and Ernest had taken the place of his father as the custodian. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">297 In the essential facts, Bobby never wavered even under prolonged cross-examination. Bobby held firmly to his evidence that Ernest continued to manage assets on behalf of the family after his father’s death. Bobby referred to the numerous times he asked for and received sums from “his” monies, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the fruit in his Swiss bank account; he was clear that this was only the “fruit” and the tree always remained. His evidence was also very clear that he would never have sold the “tree” as his father’s wish was that the “tree” was not to be touched. He testified: “And the tree had trustees … which Ernest claimed to have purchased, which I would never have done because my father said it’s not to be touched”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">298 I also accept Bobby’s evidence that it was Ernest who started creating all the complex corporate structures so that it would be difficult for anyone to identify the beneficial owners of the family assets. There is also incontrovertible evidence of Ernest sending a tape dated 5 March 1969 to Bobby explaining the structures and investments and “scorecards” of his 20%, Bobby trying to understand the intricacies of what Ernest had done, Bobby writing back to Ernest to seek clarification and Bobby’s own sketch of the companies and the bank signatories. Ernest was still sending ‘scorecards’ to Bobby on 14 August 1975 and 24 October 1975. These will be examined in greater detail below (at [416]–[418]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">299 It is also clear, and I so find, that <span class="font-italic">all</span> of the family members, including Bobby, trusted Ernest, as they trusted their father, to take complete charge of the “family’s” businesses, assets and investments. We see that Ernest carefully kept “scorecards” in the decades following Robert Sr’s death. Like his father, Ernest was akin to the captain of the ship and no one questioned him. I would add that I am sure Ernest relished that role. Ernest had the absolute discretion when to advance monies for investment, whether an investment would be made or not and he did turn down the grandchildren’s request for funds in various ventures which he did not approve. When the grandchildren were older, they could bring “worthy” investments or projects to the “friendly banker”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">300 It was never put to Bobby that he sold his NEL and JMC shares for the specific reasons alleged in Ernest’s AEIC, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, that Bobby did not want to be subject to the vagaries and risks of the shipping business, in which he had no experience in, that Bobby had a minority interest which would have made it difficult, if not impossible, to sell the shares on the open market or that Bobby was willing to sell his NEL/JMC shares to Ernest due to Ernest’s commitment to follow an alleged “convention” established by Robert Sr. It was also not put to Bobby that Ernest had bought NEL from JRIC using the convoluted series of back-to-back loans described in Ernest’s AEIC or that Ernest bought JMC through a purchase by his nominee, CE, in 1970. I accept Mr Bull SC’s submission that the foregoing reasons were only introduced for the first time in Ernest’s AEIC and Bobby had no opportunity to rebut the same. All these were matters that <span class="font-italic">should have been put</span> to Bobby (see <span class="font-italic">Browne v Dunn</span> (1893) 6 R 67; and <span class="font-italic">Ong Jane Rebecca v Lim Lie Hoe and Ors</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2005] SGCA 4 at [70]), and Mr Singh SC’s formulaic recitation of Ernest’s case with an invitation to agree or disagree is not fairly putting the case to Bobby as required under the rule in <span class="font-italic">Browne v Dunn</span> (see <span class="font-italic">H</span><span class="font-italic">ong Leong Finance v United Overseas Bank </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 292 at [42]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">301 On 14 December 2011, Ernest called without prior warning at Bobby’s house. This was after ECJ had revoked his signing authority on 8 August 2011 and then reinstated it on 9 August 2011. Bobby had been asleep and was woken up. Ernest wanted to have a one-to-one talk with Bobby. Unknown to them, Terrill taped part of the conversation. A transcript was produced in the evidence. Ernest says the transcript is not complete but accepted that it contained the “gist” of their conversation. This evidence is of some importance because neither Ernest nor Bobby knew their conversation was being taped. What appears quite clearly is that the two old men were talking over each other quite often. It is also clear that their hearing affected the two-way flow in that at times they were talking at cross-purposes and were quite excited and heated at times. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">302 Ernest says the transcript clearly shows there was no family trust. It shows Ernest expressing the view that Edward was the only one who was sincere in saying sorry to Ernest. The relevant portion of the transcript reads:

And you were doing that. They were going to have to be trained under your – you were the mentor and you would train them, you would do all those things. They were there seven years; they should be well trained by you, because they should be. …<span class="font-italic"> </span> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">303 Mr Singh SC submits that when Ernest said the “family heritage” is “a lot of all hogwash”, Ernest is specifically stating that there was no family heritage <span class="font-italic">and </span>Bobby <span class="font-italic">did </span><span class="font-italic">not</span> contradict him. However, I think Mr Singh SC makes too much of the use of this phrase and it must be taken in its proper context.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">304 First, these are two old men who are hard of hearing, are excited and emotional and are speaking over each other. While I accept that in the passage quoted above, they do seem to understand what the other is saying, Bobby’s immediate response to Ernest is, and this is a pertinent point to note, “unclear”. I have listened to the recording a number of times, but like the transcribers, I cannot make out what was said. Bobby obviously said something and that caused Ernest to stop, and repeat “This situation goes beyond”, and then ask “what?” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">305 Secondly, Bobby immediately goes on to refer to Ernest’s talk about “family heritage” and says to Ernest: “<span class="font-italic">You just told me before, I asked you, are we going to have a family trust</span>” [emphasis added]. This is significant because Bobby’s response to Ernest’s claim that the “family heritage” was all “hogwash” is a reference to a family trust that they had spoken about earlier, and that time must have been before ECJ fetched up in Singapore because Bobby states that they were there – to be trained by Ernest to “look after the tree so it will go on and on and on”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">306 Thirdly, whilst the foregoing does seem to indicate that there was no trust as such set up, it must be taken in context with what Bobby says immediately after that: “you [meaning Ernest] said no, all these family trusts, <span class="font-italic">I don’t trust the banks [with]</span>. <span class="font-italic">We’ve got to form it ourselves</span>” [emphasis added]. This plainly shows Ernest does not want to have the family trust run by banks because he does not trust them to do so. And it is of significance that Bobby immediately continues: “we’re <span class="font-italic">going to have a [tree], all the same thing, where they’re going to look after the tree</span> so that it will go on and on and on” [emphasis added]. Ernest’s reply, as I find his usual evasive character coming to the fore when he is faced with something he does not like to hear, was that there was no training and that ECJ went to Singapore and were doing their own visits. This was clearly untrue. What is significant is that <span class="font-italic">Ernest </span><span class="font-italic">did not challenge</span> Bobby’s statement that the “tree” must be looked after “so it will go on and on and on”.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">307 The transcript must also be read fairly in the context of the overall history of the family. When Robert Sr died, everything he had went to his widow and four children in equal shares. Ernest took over running the businesses and NEL and soon thereafter, had it hidden behind an orphan structure. He invested the money and assets on behalf of JRIC, paid out part of the dividend or income in each year whilst retaining the larger portion for re-investment and appeared to give them periodic reports on how their share of the investment was doing. At the time of Robert Sr’s death, the main business was still shipping and Ernest was already running the shipping business. However, by this stage in December 2011, the businesses had been largely liquidated into funds and Ernest was investing the assets, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, these funds. There was no clear successor to do what he was doing. Edward and Christina were the most qualified and suitable of Robert Sr’s grandchildren and Ernest had initially, so I find, taken a liking to James. He was training them as the future custodians. Ernest and Bobby were in the process of carrying out Robert Sr’s “<span class="font-italic">wishes</span><span class="font-italic">”</span> that had been expressed in his Avarice Letter and in an earlier letter dated 2 November 1950<span class="font-italic">,</span> <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, “[LIL] which will remain in the Lasala family until doom’s day <span class="font-italic">if my sons and sons’ sons so desire it</span>” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">308 The transcript of that meeting between the two brothers reveals more than the short exchange that Ernest has picked out to support his case, which as I have found above, does not quite do that. It is very clear from this transcript that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The funds that ECJ had interfered with in Singapore were allegedly Ernest’s funds, but very <span class="font-italic">significantly</span>, Ernest whilst emphasizing that point, never said, expressly or impliedly, that everything held in the Plaintiff Companies belonged solely to him.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Bobby was upset, not so much with ECJ revoking Ernest’s signing authority but for making him, Bobby, sign papers when he never wanted to sign any more things for Ernest after their differences over some business deals in the past.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Bobby (and later Terrill who joined them near the end), was very annoyed that when he wanted some of his funds to be transferred to him in Australia, Ernest sent it to him from Bobby’s own account and in his name. This was denied by Ernest who insisted it was routed through Vancouver so it could not be traced to Bobby and said it was given as a “gift” to protect Bobby.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) What really upset Bobby, Terrill and the children was that when Bobby wanted to bring back US$20 million of “his inheritance”, with US$5 million for each of his four children, Ernest kept claiming to the children that it was his (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Ernest’s) money:

The fact remains that Ernest was looking after, investing and managing JRIC’s shares of the assets and funds left to them by Robert Sr. Ernest was paying out the “fruit” over the years but retained part of the “dividends” to reinvest. In doing so, Ernest did likewise for his own assets and monies outside of JERIC. Bobby understood the principle, which he thought always existed, that they would only partake of the fruit of the tree that his father had planted, but that tree was not to be touched so that it wold go on and on, producing fruit for future generations, and it was looked after by custodians like Ernest, and in time, with Ernest’s training, ECJ.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Evidence of the secondary witnesses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">310 I now turn to the evidence of the secondary witnesses and that of ECJ. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Elena’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">311 Elena, who gave evidence on behalf of Ernest, is the daughter of Tony.

When Mr Bull SC refused to do so and asked: “No, Mrs Thasler, I’m asking you, have you seen a 1957 letter written by your grandfather?” Elena’s response was: “There’s only one 1957 letter I recall.” When she eventually admitted having seen that 1957 letter written by her grandfather, Mr Bull SC asked her: “Just from your memory -- and I’ll show you the letter in a moment -- would this be the one that he wrote when he was in Tokyo?” She answered with little hesitation: “Yes”. She knew all along about the Avarice Letter and what counsel was asking her, but she feigned uncertainty as to which letter it was. When she could no longer pretend, she could recall details.

Mr Bull SC asked Elena whether Frankie Fletcher knew Elena was sending him documents from her father’s files. Elena was quick to evasively answer: “I don’t know what Frankie [Fletcher] knew.” Mr Bull SC then asked: “Did you tell Frankie Fletcher where the documents [that you were sending him] came from …?” Elena then said “Yes” and to a follow-up question confirmed that she told Frankie Fletcher that the documents had come from her father’s files; but then she added gratuitously “also from my aunty Isabel’s files”. Mr Bull SC then asked: “So you do know that Frankie Fletcher knew that these came from your father’s files because you told him, right?” She had no other alternative but to admit it with a: “Yes”.

He appears to be (and it matters not for the purposes of this judgment if he is not) the son of BPC Fletcher who married Benita, Camila’s sister and who was for some time, Robert Sr’s personal secretary. Ernest states that Frankie Fletcher is his cousin. Frankie Fletcher was first practising as a solicitor and then a barrister in NSW. At the time of these proceedings he had retired. He is someone whom Ernest involved quite intimately in the De La Sala businesses over the years. He was listed as a director of JMC in its prospectus for its proposed listing (which did not materialise). He also served as a director of COM Inc, DOM Inc and SOV Inc and assisted Ernest in his divorce with Hannelore back in 1969/1970. He is also mentioned in Ernest’s audio recording of 8 November 1969 where he says: “If there is any legal jargon which you don’t understand I suggest … you solicit the assistance of Frankie”. Frankie Fletcher is also mentioned in Tony’s letter to Ernest dated 11 October 1978 during Ernest’s divorce hearing before the Privy Council. Ernest admitted in cross-examination that Frankie Fletcher assisted him in those divorce proceedings. Mr Singh SC also stated: “Frankie Fletcher has been acting on behalf of and assisting our client to communications for the sole purpose of this litigation”.

</div> I also believe that Frankie Fletcher was overseeing the search for documents and not just a “co-ordinator” as Elena would have me believe. He is clearly the legal “advisor” in the background assisting and advising Ernest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">313 I have referred to parts of Elena’s evidence on the creation of “D-3” and how this document came into being above; the answers also had to be painstakingly drawn out from her and I should add that I do not accept some of her answers as to how these questions came to be put down on paper. There is a clear inconsistency when she claimed the questions and answers on “D-3” came from the “training sessions” but later admitted some of them were typed up subsequently with her father after they had left Clifford Chance’s office. She is clearly partisan and was behind her father’s decision to support Ernest’s side in this dispute. In my view, this is clearly because of the large potential benefit that she in particular, and Tony’s offspring in general, will stand to gain if Ernest, who seems to have excluded Tony’s offspring from his estate after Ernest’s quarrel with Tony in 2003, were to succeed in these proceedings. I have also noted Elena’s answer that the house she is currently staying in is in the name of her parents, that it was bought from Isabel and that she does not know how they paid Isabel.

</div> She was subsequently caught out in further cross-examination when Mr Thio SC showed her documents which recorded her as the owner of her house. Having painted herself into a corner, she then claimed that her parents lent her the money to buy the house and she mortgaged it to them, but she considered them to be the owners.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">314 Elena acknowledged that she received fairly sizeable sums of money from Camila on the latter’s birthdays – US$57,339.45 in July 2000, US$128,512.25 in July 2001, US$116,279.07 on 16 July 2002, US$100,000 on 15 July 2003 and US$100,000 on 15 July 2004. There was one final “birthday gift” to the grandchildren in 2005 after Camila’s passing, but this came from Tony. Elena pretended that she did not notice that the sums of money came from CFC. Given her alertness and the nature of her work, including preparing financial documents for her father, I cannot believe she did not notice this or that the funds came through a SWIFT payment. She steadfastly maintained that it was from her grandmother during her cross-examination on 10 March 2014. Elena was also aware that Camila’s other grandchildren received similar gifts on Camila’s birthday.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">315 I should mention that Ernest, in his eagerness to show that all the money was his (and no doubt to also bolster his claim that Camila’s estate had no more money in it), claimed in his affidavit that he occasionally told the grandchildren that the money from Camila’s birthday gifts actually came from his funds (however, I note Nicole’s testimony was that Ernest had never informed her of this).

</div> This occurred when Tony and Ernest had their big quarrel in 2003 and Ernest said, in relation to Camila’s money gifts to her grandchildren on her birthday, “This is my money”. Elena claimed she had no idea why Ernest said this and that she was “shocked” (she repeated this twice). She asked her father if this was true and she claimed Tony said he did not know. Mr Thio SC then referred her to an email dated 18 July 2004 from Ernest to Elena’s sister, Suzanne (or Suzy), where Ernest writes: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Greetings Suzy, </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">For you information the present you received from Grandma are from my personal funds.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">You and the others benefit from my birthday present to grandma.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">That email was copied to Elena, but she claimed to have forgotten it.

To explain this inconsistency: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Elena said she was shocked when she heard for the first time in 2003 that the funds were from Ernest and not Camila. However, this does not answer why she sent the thank you cards to Ernest in the years before 2003.

This begs the question of why Ernest had to “authorise” the payment if the money belonged to Camila. With Nicole’s command of the language, she would know the different nuances in the meanings of “arrange” and “authorise”. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) I have no doubt that Nicole and Elena would have seen, over the years, how much Camila loved Ernest and how appreciative she was of his role in the De La Sala family. So between mother and son, why was there a need to “authorise” the gifts unless it was not Camila’s money or that Ernest was holding and having control of Camila’s money? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">321 Bobby’s children, on the other hand, accepted that there was this practice and it would have been consistent with their view that there was a family trust and Camila had a beneficiary’s share in that trust. At the very least, it would have meant that Ernest had some “control” over Camila’s monies and Ernest’s consent was needed to make those gifts. I note that <span class="font-italic">none</span> of the grandchildren who gave evidence before me said this practice was to ensure the money they received was seen as “gifts” from someone, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Ernest, who was not a tax resident in Australia, as compared to Camila, who was and subject to taxation on her income outside Australia as well.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">322 Nicole’s house was also bought with funds from her parents. She said she was an estate agent by occupation but inexplicably said, at the beginning, that her house was mortgaged back to her parents. She claimed that this was to protect her in the event of a divorce. Later, when she was asked whether she made payments to repay her “mortgage”, she quickly changed her story to there only being a caveat registered against the property and that she did not have to pay her parents back. Nicole is far too sharp, and especially since she is an estate agent, to make such an error over a mortgage and a caveat. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">323 On balance, I too do not accept the evidence of Nicole. She clearly was out to tell a story consistent with that of her mother. I also cannot help but think that Elena and Nicole know there is a lot of money at stake, <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span>, in the case of Elena for reasons I have stated elsewhere in this judgment. In saying so I have not failed to take into account that Nicole is the only child of Isabel.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Ostenfeld’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">324 Ostenfeld, called by Ernest as a witness, started off in JMC in 1955 as a first mate and later became a master of JMC’s vessels. He took on a shore job at the behest of Robert Sr around 1956 or 1957; he later became a director in 1958. Robert Sr made him a Deputy Managing Director of JMC in 1964. In accepting Robert Sr’s offer of 12 August 1956 to take on a “landlubber’s” appointment as Marine Superintendent, Ostenfeld replied on 18 August 1956, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, and pledged: “I will endeavour to be a useful and loyal lieutenant to your son Ernest.” Unsurprisingly, his AEIC supported Ernest’s case. There is evidence and I find, that Ostenfeld was and remained very loyal to Ernest over the years to the point of doing whatever Ernest requested him to do, especially in signing corporate documents and saying that he never heard of any family trust in all the years he was with the JMC group.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">325 In his AEIC, Ostenfeld deposed to the JMC practice of retiring directors selling their shares to the remaining directors and if the purchaser-director did not have sufficient funds to pay the outgoing director, the company would extend him a loan with 6% interest. That loan would be settled out of subsequent dividends declared on the purchaser-director’s shareholding in JMC. Unfortunately for Ernest, his reference to this convention that he allegedly used to purchase JRIC’s NEL and JMC shares was different in a very material respect. Ernest said <span class="font-italic">the seller</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, JRIC was paid over time by the declaration of dividends. Ostenfeld’s “practice” was that the seller got paid immediately through the company’s loan to the buyer and it was the buyer who paid off the JMC loan over time. Under cross-examination, Ernest was forced to concede that Ostenfeld’s description of this “practice” was different from Ernest’s “vendor finance”.

</div> This was not true because on Ernest’s case, JRIC had sold their shares in NEL to Ernest in one go in 1967 and there was nothing before 1967 to establish any “practice” for the De La Sala family. Eventually, Ostenfeld admitted that in the case of the De La Sala family, there was no convention and it was a “one-off case”.

Ostenfeld then categorically states that Edward did not at any time mention to him or assert that there was a “family legacy or trust” over the John Manners Group. He asserted: “I would have been very surprised by, and would certainly have remembered, any such statement.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">328 However, there was a note made by Ostenfeld of a telephone call from Ernest in the morning of 4 December 1997.

</div>
</div> There was a reference to Ernest flying in and out of Melbourne on the same day to attend Edward’s wedding and also the following: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Question of making Edward a JMC director, immediately or from beginning January? Ernest favours 1 January 1998.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Edward to stop procrastinating. Some shares given to him earlier have been left in nominee account instead of transferring to his own account. If he cannot look after his own assets <span class="font-italic">how can EFL trust him to look after </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">family assets</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold-italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The emphasized words above are clear and telling. They speak plainly and unambiguously of looking after “family assets”, not Ernest’s assets. The contents of this paragraph was, in all probability, a reference back to Ernest’s Memo dated 21 June 1995 to Isabel, Tony and Bobby where Ernest states that he has transferred Compania Nueva Oriente S.A. to Edward to familiarise him with the operation of the Panamanian, Liberian and BVI companies (see [360] below). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">329 In Ostenfeld’s own AEIC, he admits that his meetings with Ernest’s siblings occurred when they visited the Hong Kong office where he would see one or more of them on average once or twice a year. It was less frequent when Ostenfeld was in Singapore and none at all when he was posted to Jakarta. Ostenfeld has <span class="font-italic">never</span> met Camila even though he worked in the JMC Hong Kong office from around 1957. His knowledge of the De La Sala family and its affairs is neither extensive nor deep, confined to the office and the businesses of JMC and what he knows comes from Ernest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">330 I therefore do not accept Ostenfeld’s evidence supporting Ernest’s claim that all the assets in the Plaintiff Companies belong to Ernest nor his evidence that he had never heard of a family legacy or trust over all his years of service to Ernest.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Terrill’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">331 Terrill, Bobby’s wife and Edward and Christina’s mother, also gave evidence. She married Bobby in 1966. I accept her evidence as it was not strongly challenged and remained unshaken during cross-examination. She was straightforward and I found her to be an honest witness. It is telling that she was made a signatory of DOM’s (the 3rd Plaintiff) bank accounts in CIBC Bank and UBS Bank. This is consistent with the evidence that Bobby’s assets, whether all or only the 1/3 dividend according to the “practice” I have referred to above (at [86(a)]), were put into DOM.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">332 Whilst Terrill would not have been privy to the private discussions that appeared to have taken place between Robert Sr and his children and later between Camila and her children, she nonetheless was witness to the little incidents and instances that would lead her to the conclusion that Robert Sr had provided for the entire family and that Ernest was managing the family businesses by taking over when Robert Sr died. Terrill and Bobby lived in the same house as Robert Sr and Camila and still live there today. I accept her evidence of what Camila said to her over the years, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, that “poor Ernest” bore the heavy responsibility of looking after the family’s interests, that Ernest was all by himself overseas to protect the family and everyone should appreciate what Ernest was doing for the family, as well as her own daily observations of the behaviour of the family and what was said between them. This is also consistent with the evidence of some of the witnesses hearing the terms “tax exile” and “bullet-proof” being used. Terrill would have lived and dealt with as well as provided care to Camila and see to her day-to-day needs and there is no evidence that their relationship was other than close albeit not as close as between Camila and her children. I accept the evidence shows that every so often, especially when Ernest visited Sydney, the siblings would gather with Camila privately without their spouses to discuss De La Sala family matters.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">333 I also accept her evidence that ECJ went to Singapore to help Ernest with managing the businesses and companies owned by the <span class="font-italic">family</span>, and not to manage <span class="font-italic">Ernest’s</span> assets, businesses and companies. Hence, she was shocked to hear from ECJ in August 2011 that Ernest claimed all the funds and companies belonged to him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">334 Terrill also intervened when Ernest called on Bobby unexpectedly on 14 December 2011 and the transcript of the tape shows her indignation over Ernest’s claims that the funds repatriated to Bobby and his children were <span class="font-italic">Ernest’s</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> As usual, Ernest responded by changing the subject. This exchange is reproduced above at [308(d)]. Terrill, like Bobby, was extremely annoyed that Ernest had called their children “criminals”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">335 I accept the evidence of Terrill. I also found her to be straightforward and honest. Her evidence was not compromised by cross-examination.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Maria-Isabel’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">336 Maria-Isabel is the daughter of Bobby and Terrill and the sister of Edward and Christina. She lives in Sydney and is a director of Lloyd Investments (AUS) Pty Ltd. She is married to Richard and they have four children. Her evidence is much along the same lines as her siblings and I need not repeat them.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">337 Maria-Isabel was employed by JMA from 1991 to 1999 and she did work for CDC in Sydney. She assisted Ernest as his personal assistant in Australia and performed administrative tasks such as bookkeeping, secretarial work, arranging interest payments and repaying loans that had been granted by the Plaintiff Companies via UBS Canada to JMC(A) and CDC. All her faxes and letters are kept in storage in Isabel’s house to which she no longer has access. She also deposes how Ernest told her parents how astute he had been in selling off the ships which the family companies had previously owned and investing in stocks and bonds thus enabling the De La Sala family to be so wealthy today.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">338 In February 2003, Ernest asked Maria-Isabel and her husband Richard to relocate to Singapore and copied them in many of the emails Ernest had sent to Christina and James. This included the phrases: “TO PICK UP THE BALL” and “MY HOPE IS THAT I CAN SECURE WORTHY AND CAPABLE SUCCESSORS TO CARRY THE BURDEN”. However, as Richard was establishing himself in the industrial property market and they had young children and their education to consider, they decided against relocation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">339 Although not a crucial piece of evidence, but nonetheless another link in the chain, Maria-Isabel tells of her son Luke who did very well in school and obtained a scholarship for his secondary education. She proudly told Ernest of her son’s achievements and Ernest’s reply was that when he was next in Sydney, he would take Luke for a “sail &amp; chat, as [his] <span class="font-italic">team needs suitable recruits for the future</span>” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">340 Maria-Isabel also tells of a family tradition where Ernest was known as the “friendly banker” to whom members could bring worthwhile projects for funding. When Maria-Isabel and Richard approached Ernest in 2005 for their first big project, a working cattle and sheep station just outside Canberra known as the “Gidleigh” farm (which also had a longer term “property play” based on the assumed growth and expansion of Canberra), Ernest did not think it was viable or a good idea and declined to advance any funds. Bobby was approached and decided to make <span class="font-italic">his</span> funds available and asked Ernest to make the arrangements and transfers. Ernest subsequently arranged for S$6,443,537.57 to be transferred to Maria-Isabel and Teresa (who joined in as a business partner for the project). In 2008, they approached Ernest regarding another opportunity to purchase an adjoining hotel and public bar known as the “Harp Inn”, but Ernest did not think it was a good move either. So they shelved their plans to purchase the same. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">341 Maria-Isabel also deposes to further sums of money drawn down from Bobby’s funds which were given to his children (as set out in Bobby’s AEIC). Each time, however, they had to either write “thank you” notes or letters to Ernest or Ernest would send them letters recording that he was making these “unsolicited” gifts. He further required their signature on a copy of those letters “for the sake of good order.” Maria-Isabel says they always had to do that despite knowing the money was from their father because the letters would be recorded “for income tax purposes”. As the “transfers were indeed gifts, and therefore were not subject to taxation”, Maria-Isabel says she was “happy enough to comply with the request”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">342 Maria-Isabel also exhibited her previous signing authority for the 1st, 2nd and 5th Plaintiffs as well as Cambay HK which owns 1,999 shares in the 4th Plaintiff and which itself is wholly owned by the 5th Plaintiff. She makes the point that signatories were typically other De La Sala family members such as Bobby and Isabel.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">343 I accept Maria-Isabel’s evidence. She too came across as a straightforward and truthful witness and her credibility remained intact despite cross-examination.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Richard’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">344 Richard is Maria-Isabel’s husband. He is the Group General Manager, Business Development at Goodman Limited, a listed Real-Estate Investment Trust which builds, owns and manages industrial and business space globally. Like the children of Bobby, from his communications and interactions over the years with his wife and other De La Sala family members, including Isabel, Camila, his parents-in-law and his wife’s siblings, he was given to understand that Robert Sr established a family legacy that could provide for future generations of the De La Sala family. As far as he was aware, Ernest managed the family businesses ever since Robert Sr’s passing. All the businesses and assets were kept offshore in tax-friendly jurisdictions to protect these investments and assets from heavy taxation in Australia. Ernest was made the “gate-keeper” or custodian because he was the only one prepared to make the necessary personal sacrifices to live overseas to protect the family’s wealth. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">345 Richard also tells of Ernest being the “friendly banker” who members of the De La Sala family could approach for funding for worthy investments and endeavours. Richard also says that over all the years, he never heard Ernest refer to the assets and businesses managed by him as other than “ours” or something “we” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the family) owned. He was also familiar with the use of the phrase “tree” which was to be managed for future generations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">346 Richard confirms Maria-Isabel’s recount of their “Gidleigh” farm project as well as the “Harp Inn” project. Consistent with this background, when Ernest asked for more information on the “Gidleigh” farm project, he copied his email to Isabel, Cecil and “Centre JMC” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, ECJ in Singapore) as they were seeking to draw funds from the family legacy or tree.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">347 Richard also confirms Ernest making an offer to them by email on 5 February 2003 to join as part of his team in Singapore. As he did to the other children of Bobby’s, he said they would only ever earn a “pile of beans” by working for a salary and his “very exclusive offer” was the opportunity of a lifetime and something the multitude could only dream of. This was reinforced by telephone conversations Ernest had with them as the “next generation” to manage the De La Sala family assets and they could learn from his years of experience. Richard confirms that during this time Ernest never said his offer was to manage <span class="font-italic">his</span> own assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">348 Richard also came across as a forthright and honest witness whose evidence remained intact after cross-examination.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Teresa’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">349 Teresa is the daughter of Bobby and Terrill and sister of Edward, Christina and Maria-Isabel. She is presently living in Sydney and the owner of The Book Mistress Pty Ltd. Her evidence was that from conversations with her grandmother, she learnt of her grandfather’s successes as a businessman and that Ernest took over after his death. Her grandmother told her that Ernest had made sacrifices for the De La Sala by remaining in Hong Kong to manage the family’s businesses and investments which future generations of the De La Sala family could benefit from. Her grandmother also told her how pleased she was that Edward and Christina had relocated to Singapore to help Ernest manage the family assets “offshore” and to be trained by him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">350 Ernest involved Teresa in the businesses somewhat and took her to Switzerland in 1994, promising that she would meet up with some Swiss bankers. However, he gave her administrative and secretarial tasks and whilst she was on one of these tasks (obtaining visas for their pending visit to Hungary and Poland), Ernest met the bankers with Christina. Teresa states that this was typical of Ernest’s divisory tactics. Teresa said Ernest told her he had arranged the companies in a triangular structure and many companies had similar sounding names to maintain a high level of privacy such that it was not possible to identify the individual owners. During these conversations, Ernest told Teresa that he had to manage these investments “offshore” to avoid attracting tax obligations for the companies that owned the assets. Over all the years, Teresa says Ernest never said the companies were <span class="font-italic">his</span> assets and always referred to them as “our” assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">351 Teresa says that although she was not involved in managing these investments or made a director of any of the companies, she was made a joint signatory for bank accounts held by the 1st Plaintiff and 3rd Plaintiff. From her interactions with Camila, her parents, her siblings, Isabel and Ernest, she understood this was to ensure that the De La Sala family could still maintain control of these companies and their accounts even if Ernest was incapacitated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">352 Teresa also deposed about the gifts from her grandmother around the latter’s birthday in July 2000 to 2004. She said she and her cousins, including Nicole and Elena, all knew that these funds were paid out on their grandmother’s instructions from her monies held by the Plaintiff Companies and the payments were arranged by Ernest from the 2nd Plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">353 It was obvious that Teresa felt she was treated as “second class” by Ernest and complained to her grandmother. Her grandmother would make excuses for Ernest by saying “that was his way” and that he had sacrificed a lot for the family. Ernest also told Teresa in the year prior to her grandmother’s death that the payments from her had to stop so as not to attract the attention of the ATO, though they had the potential to resume in future. Teresa further recounts the remittance of monies from funds of the family companies set aside for her father. These payments enabled her to buy properties with her siblings and each time she had to write an appropriate letter of thanks to Ernest to ensure the paper trail evidencing “gifts”. These letters were passed to Bobby for safekeeping. Teresa exhibited the appropriate documents for these sums in her AEIC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">354 I accept the evidence of Teresa as I also found her to be an honest and forthright witness. She also recounts instances of conversations with Nicole and Elena and, as expected, there were differing views with Nicole and Elena denying they spoke to Teresa about such matters. I need not make any findings in respect of these differences as they prove little but if I had to make a choice and finding, I would prefer the evidence of Teresa over that of her cousins, Nicole and Elena.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">355 As I have noted above, the grandchildren derive their knowledge from what others had told them or said or how they had behaved over the disputed issues. At most their evidence lies on the periphery of the central issues and mainly as corroboration in a sense of consistency. Three individuals, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Edward, James and Christina, however, have played a more involved role in this dispute and the events leading up to it. It must also be remembered that Ernest has filed a counterclaim against ECJ, and ECJ themselves have filed a counterclaim against Ernest. I therefore turn to their evidence and examine it in greater detail. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">ECJ’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Edward’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">356 Edward, the eldest child of Bobby and Terrill, is one of two nephews of Ernest (the other being Tony’s son, Pastor, whose interests I am told by Edward lay in studying French and Latin and playing ecclesiastical period music). Edward, who stayed in the same house as Camila, was encouraged by her to study accounting so that he could “help her” and “help the family”. To obtain work experience, Edward worked for a stockbroker in Sydney after his High School and in 1988 enrolled for a two year Associate Diploma in Accounting course at a technical college to enhance his prospects for university. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">357 In 1989, whilst he was in the second year of his course, Ernest arranged for Edward to start working in JMM in Singapore under Ostenfeld to get to know the shipping, ship agency and marine safety business during his vacations. In 1990, after successfully completing his Associate Diploma in Accounting course, he gained admission to Griffith University in Brisbane for his Bachelor of Commerce course. He worked in Singapore between late 1990 and early 1991 to build up his knowledge of the business being run by Ernest. In 1991, Edward transferred to the University of Technology, Sydney, and he continued to work in Singapore during his vacations under Ostenfeld. He graduated in 1993 and arrived in Singapore on 23 October 1993 to officially begin working for JMM as an Administrative Manager under an employment pass. Edward stayed at a JMM apartment at Balmoral Park. Whilst working at JMM, Edward completed a Master of Arts in Marketing Management through the Macquarie Graduate School of Management in 1996 and in 1998 added a major in accounting through the Victoria University of Technology to his Bachelor of Commerce degree.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">358 I find Edward to be a straightforward and truthful witness. He had a quiet, steady and earnest demeanour and answered questions directly. Despite prolonged cross-examination, his evidence remained intact. One of the important issues that arose was his (together with Christina and James) speedy reversal of the resolutions removing Ernest’s signatory rights to the Plaintiff Companies’ bank accounts in August 2011 and his email of apology dated 9 August 2011 to Ernest. Having watched him closely and considered his answers, I am satisfied that he did that not because he had a guilty conscience or that he knew he had done something wrong with regard to Ernest or that his livelihood had been removed, but because of some very deeply ingrained beliefs and De La Sala family values inculcated in him from the time he was very young, and this would also be true for Christina:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the De La Sala family was very strongly hierarchical; respect for your elders was deeply ingrained and familial ties were paramount. Edward would have witnessed from a young age how even his father, uncles and aunt deferred to Camila. Edward would have been taught to respect and obey his grandmother, then his father and mother, uncles and aunt and never to be rude or insouciant towards them, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the older generation. Ernest acknowledges this in Edward. This is clear even with Ernest as a young man. When Robert Sr chastised him over his business decisions and his lack of decorum in making decisions without checking with Robert Sr and his co-directors, he immediately ate humble pie, apologised in writing and said he would accept any punishment Robert Sr decided upon, including being relegated to a far-flung minor business outpost. When there were differences between Robert Sr and Ernest over the handling of the businesses, Robert Sr sent Ernest packing to Brazil. I see Edward’s apology to Ernest in a similar vein. I also see Ernest adopting a softer attitude to Edward when talking to Bobby in the taped conversation. He had felt Edward’s apology was sincere.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, their action provoked a storm of huge proportions within the family. His own father, Bobby, was furious, albeit for the different reason of having his signature tied up with Ernest again, something that had been a sore point between Ernest and Bobby in the past. Their aunt Isabel was all over them panicking over the possible reactions from Ernest and at the same time trying to placate her nephew and niece. His first instinctive reaction when the older generation reacted in this manner would therefore be to back down.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, I find that Edward was indeed sorry that he had caused so much disagreement and strife in the family and that was another trait of the De La Sala family. They may have their differences, but it was kept within the family. This is clear to me when Ernest, who took over his father’s role, wrote to his siblings chastising them not to quarrel “in public” and lecturing them to stick together and sort things out. If all else failed, Camila would be approached for the final decision.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourthly, it was only when Edward and Christina sat back to consider Ernest’s shocking claim that all the assets were his, that they took action months later. I have borne in mind that they would have gone back to check with their parents about this claim of Ernest’s, which was against everything they had been brought up to believe, before deciding what to do. Bobby’s clear and unwavering evidence in court and also in his private conversation with Ernest referred to above about the “tree” his father had planted would have been the same factual context to Edward and Christina and it is only then that they would have come to the view that something had to be done about this untrue claim by Ernest.         </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">359 I accept the evidence of Edward that he was considered a “male heir” of the De La Sala family and that Camila and Ernest took a special interest in him. Pastor’s interests showed a disinclination towards business, perhaps like his father, because no mention is made of him by anyone of his interest or role in the family companies. Edward tells of his trips with Ernest to buy a sailing boat, Ernest spending time with him at home and giving Edward bundles of reading and reams of bond quotes on telexes. Ernest also told Edward, and I believe him, that Ernest protected everyone in the family because of his offshore status, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, by being “bullet-proof” and being manifested as the account holder of overseas bank accounts holding family assets in order to deflect any enquiries by the ATO or those trying to find out about the De La Sala family wealth. Ernest showed Edward his notebook where he kept a record of “days in Australia” so that he would never exceed his 183 days, and once Edward started working for JMM in the mid-1990s, Ernest would often tell Edward to do the same. Ernest took Edward on business trips and introduced him to several UBS bankers and an economist with Goldman Sachs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">360 I also accept that Ernest familiarised Edward with his operations, especially that shipping matters were no longer worthwhile businesses to pursue and that investment activities brought far better returns. It appears that the 1990s was the period when Ernest was selling off company assets and winding down the shipping business so that he could concentrate on such investment activities. I also accept Edward’s claim that he was the “heir apparent” and was being groomed by Ernest to take over from him as custodian and manager of the family assets. Ernest sent a fax to Ostenfeld dated 25 July 1993 in relation to his employment pass where he said: “It may be prudent to stress that … [Edward] … is the designated heir apparent and nephew of our group chairman and major shareholders”. Ernest also sent a fax to Edward on 18 September 1997 reminding him that: “I again reiterate it must be your paramount objective to understand your priorities and to know the primary purpose of your being in Singapore”. Edward also tells of Ernest transferring a dormant Panamanian company, Compania de Nueva Oriente SA, to hold his assets and investments so that he could familiarise himself with such companies. This is also reflected in a note by Ernest to his siblings referred to above (at [328]). Ernest taught Edward that a company was a valise which could be made in Panama or Liberia, but it was not necessary to keep its assets there.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">361 Edward also visited Hong Kong and Ernest asked him to acquaint himself with the confidential corporate files maintained by his secretary, Margaret Kan (“Ms Kan”). Ms Kan prided herself in a blue loose leaf A5 folder in which she recorded and updated all matters pertaining to the offshore companies and referred to it as “her brain”. It was a record of all the companies of the De La Sala family and that family members were predominantly appointed as directors of these companies and were the principal authorised signatories on the companies’ bank accounts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">362 By 1999, however, Edward felt he was learning nothing under Ostenfeld. Further, Edward felt that Ostenfeld had fed misinformation about Edward to Ernest. Ernest in turn appeared to have passed negative comments about Edward’s performance to other members of the family without giving Edward an opportunity to defend himself. So in 1999, feeling that his relationship with Ernest had become fractious, Edward left and moved back to Australia with Lyndel to a new beginning and to start a family. It is interesting to note that Ernest sent an email to Edward on 1 January 2002 with the subject: “Wishing the 3 of you the Nth degree for 2002”. Ernest spoke kindly of Edward’s daughter, Olivia’s allergy and about a leading New York dermatologist he had met on a ship who would be pleased to examine Olivia when she was in Melbourne on a lecture. Ernest also mentioned articles on the economy including AMP’s Chief Economist’s “Ten Possible Wealth Hazards in 2002”. The 5th paragraph read:

IF YOU NOW DESIRED [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>], YOU MAY CONFIDENTIALLY FAX &amp;/OR EMAIL ME WHAT YOU WANTED TO TELL ME ABOUT CHRIS OSTENFELD AND SINGAPORE.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">At the top of that fax, Ernest had tellingly written: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">CONFIDENTIAL COPY TO BOBBY &amp; TERRILL, EDWARD HAS NOT YET RESPONDED. WHEN IS HE GOING TO SINGAPORE.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">363 Ernest, as the egotistical rich and “powerful” uncle, expected Edward to come running back to him but Edward appears not to have taken the bait. Instead he moved on and became a financial controller of Toll Holdings Ltd (“Toll Holdings”). His role as Toll Holding’s divisional financial controller provided the means for him to advance himself to full CPA professional status by completing the CPA program in 2004. He was promoted to system accountant in 2003 and worked across several divisions of Toll Holdings across Australia and, from 2004, New Zealand, each division having its own business units. He was earning AU$75,000 a year and I accept that his prospects within that expanding group were bright.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">364 However, as was the case with Christina and James and Maria-Isabel and Richard, Ernest started sending emails (referred to above) to Edward. Many of his emails to Christina, James, Maria-Isabel and Richard were also copied to Edward. Edward says, and I accept his evidence, that Ernest made the following representations to him:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) If they agreed to assist Ernest, they would eventually take over his role as custodian of the De La Sala family legacy which comprised the assets held by the “family” companies;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Those who assisted Ernest could expect to be well rewarded financially; this financial reward would be substantially more than the “pile of beans” they could expect to earn in their present jobs;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) By relocating to Singapore to assist Ernest in the management of the family assets, they would be increasing the value of the De La Sala family’s assets and this would benefit all the De La Sala family members; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The couples and their children would directly benefit from their management and enhancement of the De La Sala family’s assets, as they were all descendants of Robert Sr and Camila and were beneficiaries of the De La Sala family legacy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">365 Edward met up with Ernest on 26 February 2004 in Melbourne when Ernest attended the Australian Formula One Grand Prix. Ernest told Edward that the shipping businesses had completely ceased and that if Edward joined him in Singapore, he would be managing financial investment portfolios which were held by the family companies. Ernest managed to persuade Edward to relocate to Singapore once more to join him. I note Ernest’s email to Christina, copied to Edward, where Ernest says that Edward and Lyndel “expressed a desire to return to Singapore” during his recent meeting with them in Melbourne. However, all the evidence points to Ernest courting Edward, Lyndel, Christina and James (and even Maria-Isabel and Richard) to join “his team” in Singapore. I find this email to be in Ernest’s character to pen such remarks to paper over his ego or as a means of masking his true intentions and for future use as a fall-back should he need it, calculating on his nephew and niece not bothering to respond on an inconsequential inaccuracy or who might consider it rude to remind their Uncle that he was the one urging them to come to Singapore by dangling carrots before them. On 21 and 24 March 2004, Ernest got in touch with one Jenny Wong, who was retained on a “stipend” to keep the companies current, informing her not to sell the Balmoral apartment and to look into obtaining Singapore permanent residence status for ECJ. I accept Edward’s evidence that it was Ernest who was pushing for the three of them to start working in Singapore as soon as possible in the new roles.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">366 I also accept the evidence of Edward and Christina that Camila was very supportive of the idea that they move to Singapore to help Ernest. She told them that she was so glad they were going to do so because they would all be there together to support one another. I also accept Edward’s evidence that one of the reasons for Camila’s concerns was that Ernest’s health was deteriorating. Edward was with Ernest in Hong Kong in 1992 when Ernest started suffering an irregular heartbeat resulting in their immediate flight to Sydney and which culminated in Ernest’s heart by-pass operation. By 2004, this had multiplied into abdominal growths, stenosis of the spine, which resulted in Ernest appearing before me in a wheelchair. Ernest also suffered from a hearing impairment, tinnitus, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, more heart problems resulting in angioplasty in 2010, fluid retention, catching double pneumonia as well as insomnia and gout.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">367 Once in Singapore, ECJ learnt progressively more about Ernest’s <span class="font-italic">modus operandi</span>. This included JMC being run as a “private company to [the] point of secrecy”, JMC and JMM providing facades to create legitimate offshore presence in Singapore and Hong Kong, as well as having companies with similar names and bearer shares to prevent others finding out about ownership and sending inquisitors “barking up the wrong tree”. To name a few, there were, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, Dominion Corp SA of Panama and Dominion Inc of Liberia; Sovereign Corp SA of Panama and Sovereign Inc of Liberia, Cambay Prince Steamship Co Limited (HK) and Cambay Prince Steamship Co Limited (BVI), Cosmopolitan Finance Corporation of Liberia and Cosmopolitan Finance Corporation of BVI.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">368 Edward deposes that from his numerous discussions with Ernest, the “capital” base of the family assets was held within the “orphan structure” – this was strongly disputed by Ernest, who says they are all his assets and money. Edward also deposes that money and assets allocated to Tony, Bobby and Isabel are held by different offshore companies within the “orphan structure”. Assets and money ring-fenced for Tony were held by SOV, those for Bobby were in DOM and those for Isabel were with COM. Edward also deposes that these companies used to maintain accounts with Lloyds Bank Switzerland until they were forced to close for failure to comply with the bank’s “Know Your Client” guidelines.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">369 It should be noted that ECJ spent over seven years in Singapore working with Ernest (nine years if the period up to the commencement of proceedings is taken into account). The work that they did is set out in Edward’s AEIC and corroborated by Christina and James, <span class="font-italic">viz, </span>settling in their families, getting to know what was going on in the companies, attending meetings with bankers, attending seminars on handling family companies and a UBS three-day “Next Generation” course, analysing financial data and communicating with Ernest over investments, double-checking on taxation and clearing some slight misconceptions that Ernest had over corporate taxes and the criteria for determining the residence and domicile of corporations, explaining the subtle distinction between corporations trading in shares and corporations that bought and sold shares under a long term portfolio of assets and the differing taxation of such activities, making investments on their respective portfolios and drafting trust concepts, possible structures and safeguards as well as draft documents therefor. That included seeing first-hand how Ernest transferred funds to his siblings or their children.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">370 Edward further gave evidence that working in Singapore with Ernest was “a step backwards in [his] professional development and financial status”. He was paid a meagre salary of S$2,500 per month, and while he was entitled to 10% of the profits he, Christina and James made on the portfolios they managed, this did not amount to much (approximately S$90,000 per annum), in large part due to the “trading bans” and “limitations” imposed by Ernest. Edward deposed, and I so find, that he would have been better off financially and professionally had he stayed in Australia, but he relocated and remained in Singapore out of a sense of familial duty because he knew that he would be managing and growing assets that belonged to the family, which his own family and children would benefit from one day.

She enrolled at the London School of Economics (“LSE”) but failed to obtain her Masters in Economics because she was insufficiently focused and failed some of her exams. Ernest had arranged for her to gain some work experience at Lloyd’s Bank, Madrid before her last term at university.

</div> When Christina complained to Camila, she made the excuse that that was Ernest’s nature and that it was all right for her to work elsewhere as she could always join Ernest later on.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">374 Christina moved to London and worked for a music management outfit who were the European managers for an internationally acclaimed rock band. She then moved to a music sales promotion consultancy before she got married to James in Sydney in October 1998. After their marriage, Christina and James moved to Oman where she set up a ladies’ clothing company. James retired from his military career in 2001 and they moved back to London.

I accept her evidence that Camila favoured Ernest above the rest. From a letter dated 20 July 1962 from Ernest to his parents after Robert Sr had a big quarrel with Ernest, I find that Ernest too loved Camila very much.

But more importantly, Christina’s case on Ernest’s representations was borne out by objective evidence and facts. She had worked with Ernest before and she parted from him on unpleasant terms; she had voiced her frustrations to Ernest that he was giving her mundane office work and she wanted more challenges to test herself. Ernest’s curt response was that she was free to offer her talents elsewhere. Hence, she left and struck out on her own. The same thing happened to Edward who worked in JMC with Ernest and Ostenfeld in the 1990s before parting company with Ernest, also on not the most amicable terms. I have no doubt that <span class="font-italic">both</span> Edward and Christina had their measure of Ernest and found that Ernest was a difficult person to work with or for. They both went on to have their own careers and I find that their father had provided more than enough for them to lead very comfortable lives in Australia. I find that it would be very unlikely they would have left their jobs and relocate to Singapore if they were told it would be to manage Ernest’s own monies, given his overbearing character and not being able to let go, and not that of the family’s. I also believe Christina that Ernest’s terms were not overly generous and I accept her evidence that to the contrary, what she earned from Ernest was insufficient to support them and she spent part of her savings for her family’s stint in Singapore. There was a net deficit from what she earned managing the US$10 million Ernest made available to James and her for the eight to nine years they were with Ernest before the August 2011 blow-up.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">378 I therefore accept her evidence that Ernest represented to them that they would eventually take over as custodians of the De La Sala family business, they were the next generation custodians, they would perpetuate the “legacy” of Robert Sr, they would be enhancing the family wealth as he had done, the benefit would be for the whole De La Sala family, and the descendants of Robert Sr and Camila and themselves could expect to be well rewarded financially. As for proof of that, Ernest was not slow to show them how he lived – there is an email dated 3 February 2003 where he said he was on a private floating condominium of 1,500 square feet where the rooms were very expensive (“for those with more money than sense”) just to watch the America Cup races.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">James’ evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">379 James graduated from Bristol University and obtained his degree in Mathematics and Economics in 1988. He joined the Parachute Regiment and then enrolled with 35 officers and 150 other ranks in the gruelling selection course for the elite British special forces unit, the SAS. He was among the two officers and ten other ranks selected for the SAS. He served with distinction, including a stint in Northern Ireland with all the difficulties that entailed, and retired a Major in 2001. His testimonials bear witness to his “Excellent” rating by his reporting officers: “[A] highly successful tour not least because of the trust and confidence he inspired form the outset in senior police and military officers … Across UKSF [UK Special Forces] he is now one of the top 2 Staff Candidates”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">380 James met Christina in 1997 in London whilst he was still in the SAS. Christina was then, as noted above, a manager for a rock band. James met Bobby and Terrill in London and they were married in Sydney in October 1998. James was introduced to the De La Sala family, including Ernest, who Christina told James was an important person in the family who “ran everything” in the family business and who took over from Robert Sr after he passed away in 1967. James tells me, and I have no reason to disbelieve him, that Ernest took a liking to him as they had common interests in history, politics, geography and economics and Ernest was interested in the places James had been during his time in the British army and SAS.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">381 James enrolled at INSEAD for his MBA course; prior to that, James had scored exceptionally well at the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), being placed at the top 0.5% percentile of the applicants to business schools. By 2003, James was involved in the maritime security business with a maritime security firm, Hudson Trident, and given his SAS background and rank, I have no doubt that James was set on the course of a promising career and business in that line. I have no reason to disbelieve his claim to being well paid, was in charge and had a healthy share in the profits at a time when there were very few outfits such as his with a track record and reputation. I can take judicial notice that threats from Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden region to merchant vessels was on the rise from about that time because there were international organisations like the International Maritime Organisation expressing concern over the rising acts of piracy by 2005. James also says that his parent company in the UK had just won a US$400 million US Government contract for security in Iraq. He handed over his maritime security business to his “number two” and suggested he teamed up with another friend from the SAS. That business grew to sales revenues in 2011 of €30,182,414 and in 2012 of €36,185,084, with earnings of €5,517,718 and €3,006,641 respectively. None of this was challenged.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">382 I also found James to be a straightforward and honest witness and his evidence was steady and forthright. He was a highly intelligent person and was at times, understandably irritated with the cross-examination especially when it cast aspersions on his character. But in my view, he emerged unscathed in all material aspects from his prolonged cross-examination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">383 From his SAS testimonials about his capabilities, I note that he was praised for his ability to plan operations, gather intelligence and arrest terrorists, with an ample effective blend of tactical awareness, initiative, briefing ability and balanced perspective on the political realities of covert operations in Northern Ireland. He was therefore adept at observing and reading people and remembering the things he had heard and noted.  I accept the evidence of James that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) James and Ernest used to go sailing on Ernest’s yacht and had long chats;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Ernest told James of Robert Sr’s life, that Ernest obviously held Robert Sr in very high regard and that Robert Sr had built up everything the family had;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In referring to the assets and companies under Ernest’s control, Ernest would always refer to these with words like “we” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the De La Sala family) and “ours” when describing the companies and assets;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Isabel professed to love her brother Ernest but she was often edgy and nervous around him; her husband Cecil was quite liked by Ernest but Ernest did not think too highly of his business acumen;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) When James commented that Cecil had done quite well in his property business, Ernest passed the sarcastic remark that it was easy to achieve good results when his capital was subsidised, which James took to mean that Ernest had used “family” money to subsidise Cecil’s property business capital; Ernest had further referred to Cecil’s boathouse as the “De La Sala boathouse” and told James he should feel free to use it any time without the need to check with Cecil;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) From his observations, James said that Tony clearly did not like Ernest but was afraid to voice that openly to James;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Bobby and Ernest irritated each other and simply tried their best to stay out of each other’s way; I note that this was backed up by the transcript of the tape recording made when Ernest called on Bobby at his home without a prior appointment (Bobby made pointed references to instances in the past where they had clashed); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) James observed that Camila loved Ernest as a mother would; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Like the children of Bobby and their spouses, he came to firmly believe that Ernest was managing the family assets and that: </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) He did it at a great personal sacrifice of having to be resident outside Australia;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) The other members of the De La Sala family did not sufficiently appreciate the sacrifices he had made for them; and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Most of the younger generation of the De La Sala family were unmotivated and waited around for “things to fall from the sky” and into their laps, and he feared that they would come to simply expect “hand outs” without having to work for it; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(j) It was Ernest who approached Christina and James to come and join him in the management of the family assets; this started from 2001 when he found James and Christina’s interest in financial management and investments and their enrolment in INSEAD for the MBAs; James also set out the emails, mostly already referred to above in my assessment of Christina’s evidence, that Ernest sent to them both as well as Ernest’s emails to bankers and analysts asking them to copy James and Christina with their replies for their review. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">384 I am therefore more than satisfied that Ernest represented to James, as well as Christina and Edward, that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Ernest was the custodian and managing the De La Sala Family businesses, which was couched as Robert Sr’s “legacy” or the “family” legacy and Ernest characterised his role as a “burden”;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If they agreed to assist Ernest, they would eventually take over his role as custodian of the De La Sala family legacy which comprised the assets held by the “family” companies and which they had to safeguard and invest wisely to enhance these assets over time, just as Ernest had done over the years;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Those who assisted Ernest could expect to be well rewarded financially; this financial reward would be substantially more than the “pile of beans” they could expect to earn in their present jobs;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) By relocating to Singapore to assist Ernest in the management of the family assets, they would be increasing the value of the De La Sala family’s assets and this would benefit all the De La Sala family members; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The couples and their children would directly benefit from their management and enhancement of the De La Sala family’s assets, as they were all descendants of Robert Sr and Camila and were beneficiaries of the De La Sala family legacy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">385 I also accept James’ evidence that his terms from Ernest were not generous by any means. He arrived in Singapore to find an empty, unfurnished apartment which they had to furnish at their own cost. They had to sell their house in France and ship the furniture over at their own cost. I therefore find it unbelievable that they would relocate to Singapore, knowing Ernest’s egotistical and overbearing nature, suffer these losses and expenses, just to manage Ernest’s own funds and assets. I have also noted the evidence that Christina and Edward’s earlier working stints with Ernest both ended less than salubriously. I find they did so because they fully believed they were to be the next generation of custodians of the De La Sala family assets under the family legacy instituted by Robert Sr.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Assessment of the evidence of the foregoing witnesses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">386 As I have stated above, the four people today who know the truth are Robert Sr’s four children. The children’s spouses, the grandchildren and their spouses can only tell me what they were told over the years and the nature of their interactions and conversations with Camila and her children. Their conclusions are inferences from what they were told, the conversations that took place from time to time between various family members and what they observed over a considerable period of time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">387 On the one hand, I have the evidence of Nicole and Elena. On the other, I have the evidence of Bobby’s children and their spouses. I have no doubt, weighing their evidence and having observed their cross-examination, that the latter group are the ones who are telling me the truth for the reasons I have set out above. However, it is equally important to note that it is the truth as they perceived it to be – inferences and conclusions they drew from what others said and how others behaved. It does not conclusively prove that a trust had been set up although that is what they believed was in existence and why Ernest came to recruit ECJ to work in Singapore but failed to convince Maria-Isabel and Richard to do the same.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">388 My conclusions (which should be read together with my preliminary conclusions and views set out above, including [138] and below at [464]), having heard the oral evidence from the witnesses, and I so find, are that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) All the children of Robert Sr <span class="font-italic">knew</span> it was the wish of their father that NEL would remain a guarantee for the well-being of all his descendants. This was made clear in his letters and I have no doubt orally in his lifetime, and especially by his 7 July 1957 Avarice Letter. This was admitted and clearly accepted by all his children:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Tony:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q: Sorry, your father had actually told you that he wanted LIL to be like an insurance policy for the De La Sala family; isn’t that right?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: Yes.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q: Thank you.

So Ernest was -- they had – this is the tree that is not to be touched. It is to stay there and grow for the family, his descendants and deserving relatives, and that was very clear, absolutely clear. That was my father’s intention of LIL, which he stated so many different times in different words. He just never, never said I’m going to talk – my father I’m talking about – he never said to me “I’m now talking about the tree”. Ernest was -- all of us entrusted Ernest to handle that. We trusted – I trusted him.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) All the children of Robert Sr loved and honoured him very much, held him in the highest esteem and would never have disobeyed him in his lifetime and would have carried out his wishes after his passing.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) All the children of Robert Sr were brought up to have great respect for their father <span class="font-italic">and mother</span>, and of all people, their mother would be the one who knew best what her husband would have wanted or wished. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Camila lived on as matriarch of the family until she passed away in July 2005 and given (a) to (c) above, the children would have honoured and respected their father’s wishes, especially as their mother was still there to witness all that was going on in the family for the next 38 years following Robert Sr’s death.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Camila had the final say in family matters in this highly hierarchical family, although Ernest now ran all the businesses and invested all the assets. Her children and her grandchildren had all been brought up to respect the older generation.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Camila and her children were very secretive and the evidence shows that when Ernest returned, they would often meet with Camila in her private area without any spouses or others around. They were also secretive because they all knew they had to be careful about taxes and death duties since all of them, save for Ernest, were Australian residents for tax purposes.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) As far as the other members were concerned, there was this very large family business and assets, and everyone, including Camila and her children, referred to it as such in deference to Robert Sr’s wishes and his memory and that Ernest had stepped into the shoes of Robert Sr in managing the family businesses and assets, see [296].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) Not only were the spouses and grandchildren given to understand this state of affairs, whenever they received funds, they knew they had to and did write “thank you” letters to Ernest for “tax purposes” and not because of some quirk or eccentricity of Ernest.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) They were all told that they had to be appreciative of Ernest, who had made great personal sacrifices to live off-shore alone as a tax exile for the sake of the family; Ernest himself had described it in writing as a “burden”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(j) The spouses and grandchildren would have seen, first hand, the millions that were available for “investment” into Australia and the real estate the family companies in Australia owned and which came from off-shore sources.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(k) The grandchildren would know that they could and did purchase their respective houses with money from their parents, who got it from sources outside Australia.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(l) Although Robert Sr had <span class="font-italic">not</span> set up a formal and legal trust in his lifetime, his wishes were known and a corporate structure in LIL/NEL and its shareholders was in place when he died. As he wrote on 2 November 1950, LIL/NEL’s then 40% in JMC, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, LIL/NEL’s assets “will remain in the Lasala family until doom’s day <span class="font-italic">if my sons and sons’ sons so desire it</span>”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(m) When Robert Sr passed away unexpectedly, all that he had went to his wife and children in equal shares. Ernest stepped into his shoes and carried on his father’s role in managing the businesses and multiplying the family money <span class="font-italic">for</span> <span class="font-italic">the family</span>. Ernest carried on a modified model by managing JRIC’s and his own share of the businesses like his father, but did it in another dimension by hiding it behind opaque “orphan” corporate structures that he established in lax and almost non-regulated jurisdictions like Panama, Liberia and BVI.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(n) As custodian, like his father before him, he had absolute say in how the businesses were run, how much was paid out to JRIC and/or their families and how much was retained for further investment. Like his father before him, Ernest was not accountable to anyone for his expenditure and given the millions that he made for JRIC and his having to be a tax exile, that was accepted by JRIC, just as JERIC had accepted Robert Sr’s analogous position in his lifetime, and no one asked any questions on that score (see [138] and [296]).  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(o) The foregoing façade is what the spouses and grandchildren of Robert Sr witnessed, heard and were given to understand. As I have noted above, Camila survived Robert Sr for 38 years and until she passed away in July 2005, she was the matriarch of the family and a living witness to the carrying out of Robert Sr’s “wishes”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">389 The other De La Sala family members were not privy to the inner workings of the family businesses and assets. Like Robert Sr, Ernest preferred the flexibility to handle the family businesses and assets through opaque corporate structures rather than a formal and legal trust which would have been unwieldy and entail unnecessarily onerous concomitant duties and formalities. Ernest did better than his father in that he had the foresight to cash out of physical ship owning and various businesses through the 1990s and thereafter had the freedom of liquid cash to invest in, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, stocks, other financial instruments, currencies, precious metals and the like. His exceptional business acumen can be seen in his reading of the markets. He was extraordinarily accurate in foreseeing the September 2008 global financial crash coming and that Australia could not continue indefinitely living off the mineral and mining boom fuelled by China.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">390 As Ernest aged and physical infirmities (like spinal stenosis and tinnitus) and medical interventions (like a bypass operation) cropped up, Ernest <span class="font-italic">knew</span> he had to get someone else to carry on his custodianship role. Unfortunately, he saw no one individual from the family like himself carrying on that important role. He distrusted trust corporations run by banks, whom he felt would live off the funds and assets. He seemed to have liked the way Bobby’s children (except perhaps for Teresa) had been brought up, had tertiary education and with post graduate business and other professional degrees. He accordingly picked them to help him with his work and train them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">391 Unfortunately, they did not appear to have the same acumen and ability and/or Ernest was not ready to let go (which one it is does not matter for the issues before me, although it is likely to be a combination of both), and just as Ernest chafed at the bit held tightly by his father (the contemporaneous letters between Robert Sr and Ernest show this very clearly), Ernest continued to hold on very tightly to the reins.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The documentary evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">392 I now turn to consider the documentary evidence in the light of the evidence of the witnesses and my assessment of their evidence. It must be remembered that it is Ernest’s case that after Robert Sr died, he had purchased his mother’s and siblings’ shares in NEL and JMC through two transactions involving SR, SM and CE in 21 August 1967 and 1 September 1970 respectively. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">393 As a preliminary observation, I note that there is no written sale agreement and/or written record or even a note evidencing a sale and purchase between JRIC and Ernest for the NEL and JMC shares. Ernest asserts that this is unsurprising given that the transactions were not between commercial parties but between family members. Nonetheless, Ernest argues that the alleged transactions are amply documented. In my view, however, Ernest’s case is not borne out on the documentary evidence. While the documentary evidence show Ernest running NEL, JMC and the other businesses including those in Australia (as Robert Sr did when he was alive), they indicate that he, like Robert Sr, was doing so <span class="font-italic">on behalf of the family</span>. I now turn to this evidence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The company documents</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">394 As mentioned above at [143], it is undisputed between the parties that JERIC transferred their NEL shares to SR in August 1967.

</div> To prove this, Ernest relied on two JMC minute sheets dated 1 August 1967 and 12 August 1967. The first minute sheet stated as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It was resolved to transfer [JMC’s] share holdings in the said [SR], i.e. 100 shares of US$100.00 each fully paid at par together with a premium of HK$24,000.00 <span class="font-italic">to a party represented by Mr. E.

</div> I am unable to accept this. First, it makes no sense for Ernest to be represented by himself. Secondly, the reason he gave for allegedly hiding his identity was because he did not want his name to be manifested. However, by representing himself, his name nevertheless appeared on the minute sheet. Thirdly, Ostenfeld was present at the meeting. However, in his AEIC, he stated that he had no personal knowledge of the identity of this “party represented by [Ernest]” and others. Although Ostenfeld stated on the stand that he knew the undisclosed party was Ernest, he also stated that he only found out “subsequently”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, after the meetings in August 1967. Nonetheless, the question of the identities of the undisclosed parties that JMC transferred its SR and SM shares to remains unanswered.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">397 In this regard, the 1967 Memo may shed some light. The 1967 Memo stated that SM acquired all of SR’s shares and “<span class="font-italic">SM shares to be issued equally to JERIC</span> as per minutes 12/8/67” (emphasis added). Both the Plaintiff Companies and ECJ argue that this showed that at that time, SM, SR and NEL were owned in a linear structure (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, SM owned SR which owned NEL), with JERIC as the ultimate shareholders of SM in equal proportions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">398 On the other hand, Ernest alleges that the above statement in the 1967 Memo was simply part of his “estate plan”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the SM shares were “to be issued” to JERIC if he were to pass away.

In Ernest’s view, this arrangement allowed JRIC “to succeed to SM, SR and NEL automatically without having to obtain Probate ... or be troubled by any other formalities” and thus ensuring his debt to JRIC (from the sale of the shares) was paid.

If Ernest were to pass away, this arrangement would have resulted in 20% of SM’s shares being issued to Ernest’s estate and thus subject to probate. This contradicts his alleged reason for wanting to obviate the need for his family to obtain probate or comply with other formalities. Ernest could not give a satisfactory answer to this contradiction on the stand. Thirdly, on Ernest’s alleged version of the purchase, JRIC ultimately became creditors of SM (see [184(e)] above). If Ernest were to unexpectedly pass, JRIC would still be able to claim their sale proceeds as creditors of SM. It made no sense for him to have created this arrangement to ensure that his alleged debt to JRIC was paid. Lastly, Ernest adduced no evidence to show that SR and SM were placed into a circular structure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">400 To the contrary, there appears to be evidence that JERIC continued to have an interest in SR and SM, and therefore NEL, at that point in time. To begin with, there was a special meeting of the board of directors of CE on 22 December 1969 (“the 22 December 1969 CE Minutes”) shortly after CE was incorporated on 19 December 1969 (as mentioned above at [144], CE was wholly owned by SR).

</div> I do not agree. The Mitford Note is equally consistent with Ernest purchasing SR and SM <span class="font-italic">on behalf of JERIC</span>.

As mentioned above at [400], Ernest proceeded to exercise that power and nominate JERIC to be transferred 20 shares each, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, JERIC would each hold 20% of SM.

</div> However, in my view, the 1967 Memo, the 22 December 1969 CE Minutes and the Mitford Note, when taken together, strongly suggests that JERIC was supposed to have an equal interest in SM. It is thus likely that the “undisclosed party” that Ernest was representing in the acquisition of SM was actually JERIC. In essence, SM was merely JERIC’s vehicle to hold their NEL shares for them. For reasons already set out, Ernest, or JERIC for that matter, saw it fit to hide their interest in SM (and therefore NEL). Hence the confusion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">403  Ernest argues that these documents do not reflect a “continued JERIC shareholding interest in SM”.

</div> He argues that JERIC’s interest was a contingent one, either upon his death or his nomination. I have already rejected Ernest’s argument that the sentence “SM shares to be issued equally to JERIC” in the 1967 Memo was part of his estate plan (see above at [399]). In relation to the Mitford Note, although it stated that Ernest arranged for an <span class="font-italic">option</span> in favour of JERIC to claim 20% of SM, it was clear that JERIC could exercise that option “as and when they wished”. This is more consistent with JERIC having an equal interest in SM rather than Ernest owning SM solely. It is true that the 22 December 1969 CE Minutes show that Ernest had the sole discretion to nominate who the SM shares were to be transferred to. However, it must be borne in mind that at that point in time, JRIC trusted Ernest with their affairs. Robert Sr had passed away recently and Ernest was the only person who knew the business well enough to run it.

</div> It was not inconceivable that JRIC would be content leaving the power to nominate in Ernest’s sole discretion with the expectation that Ernest would exercise it in their best interests just as Robert Sr had done. Indeed, the 22 December 1969 CE Minutes reflect Ernest ultimately nominating JERIC as the transferees of the SM shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">404 This appears to be corroborated by the company particulars of SR and SM.

</div> The SR company particulars recorded SM as its sole shareholder. It also recorded SR as owning 100% of NEL. Although the SR company particulars was undated, it can be concluded that it was created on or after 26 August 1967 because SR only came to own 100% of NEL on that date. Turning to the SM company particulars, it recorded <span class="font-italic">JERIC</span> as being its shareholders in equal proportions. It also recorded SM as owning 100% of SR, which occurred only after 26 August 1967. Likewise, although the SM company particulars was undated, it can be concluded that it was created on or after 26 August 1967 since SM only came to own SR on that date (see above at [394]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">405 With respect to JRIC’s stake in JMC (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 45%) held by Overseas Nominees Ltd, it was transferred to CE on 1 September 1970. Ernest alleges that CE was his nominee and this transaction was his purchase of his mother’s and siblings’ JMC shares. However, it must be remembered that in 1970, CE, SR and SM were held in an orphan structure, with SR owning CE, CE owning SM and SM owning SR (see above at [144]). I have already found that JERIC had an equal interest in SM at that time, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, they were the beneficial owners of SM (see above at [402]). Having found that one entity in the orphan structure was beneficially owned by JERIC, it must follow that JERIC owned the beneficial interest in the other two entities, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, SR and CE as well. This is supported by the fact that JRIC were active directors in CE as of September 1970.

</div> I do not accept Ernest’s explanation that the JMC dividends were his payments to JRIC for the purchase of their JMC shares pursuant to Robert Sr’s alleged convention of “vendor financing”. Such an arrangement stands in direct contradiction to the very reason Ernest alleges why JRIC desired to sell their JMC shares in the first place. Ernest alleges that JRIC sold their JMC shares because they did not want to be exposed to the vagaries of shipping. However, if the purchase price of JRIC’s JMC shares were to be paid out from JMC’s dividends, this meant that JRIC’s repayment would be dependent upon the performance of JMC and, consequently, the shipping industry. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Ernest’s letters and tapes to his siblings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">407 In keeping with Robert Sr’s tradition, Ernest continued to send letters and tape-recordings to JRIC after Robert Sr’s demise.

There is no mention in Bobby’s letter dated 11 February 1969 or Ernest’s tape recording dated 5 March 1969 of JRIC’s interest in SM being contingent upon the passing of Ernest. In fact, a plain reading of both pieces of correspondence indicates that JRIC had an interest in SM at that time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">412 As mentioned above at [152], there was a further restructuring of the businesses in 1995 and the second orphan structure of PAL-CFC-PEN was created.

</div> This was to ensure that the family assets would not be subject to heavy tax in Australia as Ernest was the “tax exile”. This practice was maintained even for internal letters to the family, as seen from how Ernest would in his other letters describe remittances to Bobby and his children as gifts from Ernest, when they were in fact Bobby’s funds, and would even remind them to write him an “appropriate letter of thanks” for his “personal gifts” (see below at [444]). There were numerous documents of this nature in the evidence before me with their rather stilted wording. These included those from Ernest to his siblings with elaborate recitation of divesting his personal wealth and the making of “gifts”. According to Edward, this practice of Ernest was widely known in the family and there was therefore no need to have “challenged” what Ernest was stating in these 1995–1996 letters. That the companies were family assets is consistent with a telephone memo (referred to above), by Ostenfeld recording his conversation with Ernest dated 4 December 1997:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5) Attending Edward’s wedding Saturday.

</div> Ernest also alleged that there were times where he employed the NEL dividends which JRIC were entitled to receive “to work in various investments and ventures” instead of crediting them into these accounts. He would then credit the gains from these reinvestments into JRIC’s current accounts with SM. I do not accept Ernest’s explanation. As the Plaintiff Companies point out, NEL declared more than US$13m in dividends from 1967 to 1974.

</div> By 1974, the amount of dividends declared by NEL should have amply covered the alleged US$10m purchase price for the NEL shares (even factoring a 6% per annum interest that Ernest alleges was agreed upon by the parties). However, Ernest claims that Tony and Bobby were only paid out in 1987, and Isabel claimed that she was fully paid out in 2005.

</div> When CE came into the picture, the three companies (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, SR, SM and CE) were put into a circular structure with CE owning SM (see above at [144]). But it must be remembered that pursuant to the 22 December 1969 CE Minutes (and consistent with the Mitford Note), Ernest had the authority to transfer any number of SM shares to any person, and he nominated JERIC in equal proportions. This is consistent with JERIC continuing to possess an interest in SM, SR and NEL. The fact that some of the credits to JERIC’s current accounts with SM were distributions from individual investments instead of dividends declared by SM is not inconsistent with JERIC being the beneficial shareholders of SM. In fact, some of the credits were actually distributions from NEL, which suggest that JERIC benefited from the profits of NEL.

Any alleged purchase of NEL shares shortly thereafter must have been from JERIC rather than Ernest.

</div> If both Ernest and JERIC had separately lent SM US$10m, then the HKSBC., SF ledger should have recorded <span class="font-italic">two</span> debits of US$10m, one with the contra account “[Ernest] Current Account”, and the other with the contra account “[Ernest] Representing ‘JERIC Syndicate’”. However, only the former was recorded on the HKSBC., SF ledger. Furthermore, the “[Ernest] Current Account” ledgers that were available only recorded transactions beginning from 1 March 1968 and there is no way of confirming whether there were ledgers which recorded transactions before that. In fact, the second page of the ledgers was numbered as “Card No. 2”, which suggests that the first page, which only recorded transactions from 1 March 1968 onwards, was “Card No. 1”.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Mr Reid’s 1st Affidavit at pp 51 to 52. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The inference that may be drawn is that there were no ledgers recording transactions prior to 1 March 1968. This is supported by the fact that the first transaction on the first page of the “[Ernest] Current Account” ledgers recorded a credit of US$72,663.02, and a balance of “US$72,663.02 [Credit]”. This meant that if there were ledgers recording transactions prior to 1 March 1968, those transactions must have a net balance of zero. I find that to be unlikely. The more likely explanation is that there were no ledgers recording transactions prior to 1 March 1968.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">427 Mr Stone was also of the view that it was unlikely that there was an earlier page of the HKSBC., SF ledger that recorded a separate debit amount of US$10m. This was because the first page of the HKSBC., SF ledger was unnumbered (like the “[Ernest] Current Account” ledgers), but the second page was numbered as “Card No. 2”, suggesting that the first page was “Card No. 1”. Furthermore, the HKSBC., SF ledger recorded three transactions on 21 August 1967 – a debit of US$10m, a credit of US$8.5m (Transaction D), and a credit of US$1.5m (Transaction C). This was followed by two transactions on 23 August 1967 – a debit of US$250,000 and a credit of US$250,000. The net value of the debits and credits between 21 and 23 August 1967 was zero and the balance recorded on the ledger was “Nil” at the end of 23 August 1967. This meant that the balance immediately prior to these transactions was also “Nil”. Mr Stone thus concluded that for there to be an earlier page showing a separate debit of US$10m on 21 August 1967, there would either have to be a negative balance of exactly US$10m prior to that debit, or another credit for exactly US$10m on 21 August 1967 after the debit was recorded. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">428 In Mr Stone’s view, the more likely explanation was that the entry in the HKSBC., SF ledger which indicated a loan received from [Ernest] (reproduced at [424] above) was a recording error. The words “Representing the ‘JERIC Syndicate’” was left out in the description of the contra account of that transaction. The result was that there was only <span class="font-italic">one</span> transaction involving US$10m, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a loan of US$10m from JERIC to SM, and this transaction was reflected via a US$10m debit in the SM HKSBC., SF ledger and a US$10m credit in the “[Ernest] Representing the ‘JERIC Syndicate’” ledger. I agree with Mr Stone. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">429 First, a similar error had been made before in the recording of Transaction F. SR’s purchase of NEL shares was recorded as “from [Ernest]” when in actual fact, it was from JERIC (see above at [143]). It is not unlikely that such a recording error would be repeated in a different ledger. Secondly, adopting Mr Reid’s analysis would require the court to assume that there were missing ledgers for <span class="font-italic">both </span>the HKSBC., SF account and the “[Ernest] Current Account”. The court would also have to assume that these missing ledgers of the former recorded a debit of US$10m from JERIC and a credit of US$10m on 21 August 1967 (with, according to Ernest’s case, the contra account being Ernest’s, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Transaction G Part 2), and the missing ledgers of the latter recorded a credit of US$10m on 21 August 1967. However, there is simply no evidence other than the two ledger entries that Mr Reid relies on (at [424] and [425] above) that suggests this. Thirdly, Mr Stone’s explanation is strongly supported by a letter written by Ernest to Mitford dated 26 January 1968 where he instructed Mitford as follows:

Ernest has therefore failed to show that both these transactions had occurred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">431 In sum, I prefer Mr Stone’s evidence for two reasons. First, I found Mr Stone’s reasons to be more sound and cogent. Further, many of Mr Reid’s conclusions were <span class="font-italic">premised</span> upon Ernest’s instructions to him, the content of which are hotly disputed between the parties. Secondly, and more importantly, I find that the ledgers do not prove that Transactions A, B and G Part 2(a) and Part 2(b) had occurred. They do, however, indicate that Transactions C, D, E, F and G Part 1 had occurred. Accordingly, I am of the view that the ledgers show that JERIC lent SM US$10m (Transaction G Part 1), which was then loaned to SR (Transaction C, D and E) which used it to purchase the NEL shares from JERIC (Transaction F). I agree with the Plaintiff Companies that this was simply a restructuring exercise by JERIC to have SR, which was incorporated in Panama, hold JERIC’s NEL shares. The loan of US$10m from JERIC to SM/SR which was then used to buy JERIC’s own NEL shares was to create the appearance that JERIC had “sold” their NEL shares to SR, and that they did not hold any beneficial interest in NEL. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">432 The Round Trip Transaction and the accompanying documents put before me therefore do not show that Ernest bought out JRIC as alleged by him. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The 1987 Memorandum</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">433 The 1987 Memorandum (referred to at [184(g)] above) was a document heavily relied upon by Ernest to show that he had purchased JRIC’s share in NEL and JMC after Robert Sr’s death.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">436 In my view, the 1987 Memorandum does not contradict my finding that the alleged NEL and JMC sale from JRIC to Ernest never took place. If the 1987 Memorandum, as Ernest claims, was drafted by Matthew Ku in order to record that Bobby and Tony have been paid in full for the sale of their NEL and JMC shares, I find it strange that the 1987 Memorandum makes no reference to NEL, JMC and/or to any purchase or sale of the shares of those companies. It might be the case that it was understood among the parties that the assets of “5-Stars” referred to the sale proceeds of the NEL and JMC shares that Ernest had been managing on behalf of JRIC, and therefore there was no need to explicitly mention NEL and/or JMC. However, there is no evidence apart from Ernest’s assertion to show that the assets of “5-Stars” comprised JRIC’s proceeds from the NEL and JMC sale. I have already mentioned that Tony and Isabel’s evidence with respect to the alleged NEL/JMC sale is unreliable (above at [235]–[290]). Furthermore, while Tony alleged that he was paid out along with Bobby, he maintained that he did not assume control of the funds but left them with Ernest.

</div> If this were truly the case, it made no sense for Tony to have signed the 1987 Memorandum. Tony also could not adequately explain why he had been paid out when it was only Bobby who allegedly wanted his NEL/JMC sale proceeds. More importantly, both of them admitted that they did not have personal knowledge as to whether Bobby was paid the proceeds of the sale of his NEL and JMC shares. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">437 In turn, Bobby’s evidence in court was that he had never heard of the term “5-Stars” and that the 1987 Memorandum was merely a document created to appease Tony and/or Camila in the context of a prior family dispute regarding the Australian properties.

</div> As to why the 1987 Memorandum bore Bobby’s signature, his answer was that Ernest used to give him and his siblings a lot of papers to sign, and there were instances where Bobby had signed papers and forms in blank before Ernest filled in the content subsequently.

</div> However, there is nothing which indicates that the assets referred to in the Five Stars Memorandum were the result of the alleged NEL/JMC sale. In fact, the figures in the memorandum suggest that the assets were <span class="font-italic">not</span> the sale proceeds of the alleged NEL/JMC sale. As of 31 December 1970, “Five Stars” was recorded as having assets totalling approximately US$9.5m. It was Ernest’s case that he did not pay JRIC the proceeds from the NEL/JMC sale at the time of purchase, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, August 1967 and September 1970 respectively. Instead, he paid the sale price out of dividends that NEL and JMC subsequently declared. However, between 1967 and 1970, the total dividends declared by NEL were HK$18.1m,

</div>
</div>
</div> In my view, however, no such conclusion can be drawn from the remittances alone. The bank statements merely record sums of money being remitted into DOM’s account. There is no evidence to suggest that these remittances were indeed the sale proceeds that Ernest allegedly owed to Bobby. These remittances could have been the distributions from the family assets that Ernest was managing after Robert Sr died (as I have found above at [140]). They could also have been returns from the investment of the assets of “5-Stars”, which as mentioned above, have no established link to JRIC’s alleged sale proceeds. Indeed, Tony, Isabel and Camila could have received these same remittances, but their bank statements have unfortunately not been adduced before the court. These remittances are therefore equivocal and do not take Ernest’s case very far. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">440 Ernest also sought to connect these remittances into DOM with another memorandum written by him dated 8 December 1986. The memorandum provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">WITH THE RECENT REMITTANCES TO LLOYDS BANK GENEVA AND SWISS BANK CORP VANCOUVER FOR THE RESPECTIVE CREDIT OF SOVEREIGN CORP S.A. AND DOMINION CORP S.A., ALL THE VARIOUS CASH DEPOSITS AND OTHER ASSETS OF PALOMAR, SOVEREIGN INC., DOMINION INC., COMMONWEALTH INC., NOW BELONG TO THE “TRINITY TRUST’.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">THE OBJECT OF THE ‘TRINITY TRUST’ IS TO AT ALL TIMES KEEP THE CAPITAL INTACT AND SAFELY INVEST ONLY THE REVENUE i.e. INTEREST AND DIVIDEND MAY BE DISTRIBUTED BY MYSELF AND IN MY ABSENCE BY MY MOTHER AND OR MY SISTER, TO WHOMEVER THEY SEE FIT.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">First, I note that Bobby was not cross-examined on this memorandum at all and no questions in relation to the document were put to him. Secondly, like the 1987 Memorandum, there is nothing on the face of this memorandum that links it to any alleged sale of NEL and JMC shares. Neither does the document show that the assets of “5-Stars” were actually JRIC’s sale proceeds. The documents, even if taken together, show at the highest that there was a group of assets known as the “5-Stars” and that Bobby and Tony’s share of this group of assets were paid out to them in full. The remaining assets were then owned by “Trinity Trust”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Ernest, Isabel and Camila. This, however, does not prove Ernest’s case that (a) JRIC sold their NEL and JMC shares to Ernest; (b) Ernest invested the sale proceeds for JRIC under “5-Stars”; and (c) Ernest paid Bobby and Tony their share of the sale proceeds.          </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">441 On the other hand, there is evidence which contradicts Ernest’s case on the purport of the 1987 Memorandum. First, the third paragraph of the 1987 Memorandum records the house at 27 Carrington Avenue and the Branston Farm being beneficially transferred over to “Trinity Trust”. Ernest, Tony and Bobby, however, gave evidence in court that in 1993, there was a segregation of certain Australian properties owned by the De La Sala family, held through the DLS Australian Companies. This segregation came about as a result of a prior family dispute regarding the Australian properties, including 27 Carrington Avenue, the Branston Farm, and a shopping centre known as Totem Shopping Centre (see above at [435]).

</div> To resolve the dispute, 27 Carrington Avenue was transferred to Bobby, the Branston Farm was transferred to Isabel and Bobby’s daughters, and Tony came to own the Totem Shopping Centre along with some other properties. However, there was no suggestion that Bobby, Isabel and Bobby’s daughters had obtained 27 Carrington Avenue and the Branston Farm from the “Trinity Trust”. In fact, Tony’s evidence was that he had bought over Bobby’s and Isabel’s shares in the DLS Australian Companies sometime in 1993, and pursuant to that purchase, 27 Carrington Avenue and the Branston Farm were transferred out of the DLS Australian Companies.

</div> I am unable to accept Ernest’s explanation. Simply because the funds came from Bobby’s Swiss bank account or DOM does not show that these remittances were actually the funds Bobby was supposed to receive pursuant to the alleged pay-out in 1987. The remittances could just as well have been the “fruit” of the “tree” that Ernest had been managing on JRIC’s behalf and which were transferred to Bobby’s Swiss bank account or DOM previously. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">444 I also note that although these transfers were described in the letters as “gifts” or originating from “[Ernest’s] assets”, it is clear that these descriptions were used only to create the appearance that Ernest was the source of the funds. This was necessary in order for those members of the family domiciled in Australia to avoid paying tax on these funds. For example, in a facsimile sent by Ernest to Bobby dated 21 December 1999, Ernest had reminded Bobby that a remittance of US$10 to Bobby would be a “gift” from him:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">GREETINGS MY DEAREST BROTHER BOBBY.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">I AM SENDING YOU THIS FAX AS A ‘AIDE MEMOIRE’.

</div> In fact, Ernest could not have relied on the 1987 Memorandum at the Injunction Application. As mentioned above at [171], Ernest’s story at the Injunction Application was that he paid JRIC for their NEL/JMC shares <span class="font-italic">before </span>Robert Sr died. This would have been totally inconsistent with any story that Ernest had paid Bobby and Tony out only in 1987. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">447 The Plaintiff Companies and ECJ have argued that the 1987 Memorandum relates to the family’s prior dispute over certain Australian properties. However, it must be borne in mind that Ernest is the party that is seeking to rely on this document. The Plaintiff Companies and ECJ have only put forward their interpretation of the document as a response to Ernest’s reliance on the document. I have found that the 1987 Memorandum neither supports Ernest’s case nor contradicts my finding that there was no NEL and JMC sale in 1967 and 1970 respectively. Therefore, it is not strictly necessary for me to decide whether the 1987 Memorandum was indeed related to the family’s dispute over the Australian properties. But, as this is likely to be taken up elsewhere, I shall proceed to give my findings. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The settlement of the Australian properties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">448 As mentioned above at [441], the Australian properties owned by the DLS Australian Companies were divided in 1993. Pursuant to this division, the house at 27 Carrington Avenue was transferred to Bobby, the Branston Farm was transferred to Isabel and Bobby’s daughters and the DLS Australian Companies, which owned the Totem Shopping Centre and some other properties were transferred to Tony.  Tony thus “bought” Bobby’s and Isabel’s shares in the DLS Australian Companies, and Camila’s shares in JERIC Consolidated Pty Ltd were willed (and eventually transferred upon Camila’s death) to Tony.

Ernest was certainly not an “advisor” as he claims and I note Tony’s evidence contradicts this when Tony states Ernest did the division and settled and effected the respective amounts to be paid. The documents clearly show this to be the case. A 21 June 1995 letter written by Ernest to Isabel, Tony and Bobby confirms the sale of Bobby’s and Isabel’s shares in the DLS Australian Companies to Ernest. The letter recorded:

In the early 2000s, Ernest had begun experimenting with various trust structures to ensure continuity in the management of the assets of the Plaintiff Companies in the event of his demise.

As a preliminary observation, I note that the parties are <span class="font-italic">not</span> taking the position that the assets held by the Plaintiff Companies are subject to either the REC-HLV Trust or the SSS Trust.

</div> It appears that these funds originated from the Plaintiff Companies. There is no other evidence of how much funds were placed into the REC-HLV Trust. Indeed, the trust document indicates that only US$10 was settled under the trust (though further property and investments could be added to the trust fund at any time (see cl 1(k)(ii)).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">456 As alluded to at [452] above, Ernest argues that the REC-HLV Trust shows that he considered the Plaintiff Companies and their assets as belonging to him. I am unable to accept this. First, there is evidence which suggests that the funds in the REC-HLV Trust comprised not only Ernest’s assets, but Camila’s assets as well. In an email dated 4 March 2006 from Ernest to Teresa, Ernest had stated that Camila’s birthday gifts to her grandchildren every 18 July <span class="font-italic">originated from</span> the REC-HLV Trust:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">GREETINGS TERESA,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">WHEN YOU ARE IN SINGAPORE I WILL REITERATE WHAT YOU HAVE ALREADY BEEN BESTOWED ON EACH PAST 18 JULY BY MY HASTA LA VISTA TRUST (4 X AUD 100,000) PLUS POSSIBLE FUTURE POTENTIAL – YOU WILL UNDERSTAND IT IS IMPRUDENT TO BE TOO EXPLICIT IN THE EMAIL BUT IF YOU GOT AN IDEA WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT JUST REPLY “OK” IN YOUR RETURN EMAIL, SO THAT I WILL KNOW THAT YOU ARE NOT AS CLUELESS AS THE OTHER 8 BENEFICIARIES. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">YOU MAY CARE TO DISCREETLY LET AUNTY ISABEL HAVE A COPY OF THIS EMAIL.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It is undisputed that Camila’s birthday gifts did not originate from Ernest’s personal funds. On Ernest’s case, the gifts were Camila’s proceeds from the alleged sale of her NEL and JMC shares, while on ECJ’s case, the gifts were distributions from the family legacy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">457 Secondly, while Ernest is expressed to be the “settlor” of the trust and has the power to select the beneficiaries and change the terms of the trust, it must be remembered that the REC-HLV Trust was instituted by Ernest only as a trial; he had wanted to experiment with various structures and find the most suitable one to ensure that the Plaintiff Companies and their assets were properly managed in his absence. This is evident from the fact that only a small fraction of the Plaintiff Companies’ assets was settled under the REC-HLV Trust, and that the trust was eventually revoked on 25 June 2009.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-843df100-863d-41a4-9525-2bca971ad6bf" data-toggle="modal" type="button">432</button></sup>

</div>
</div>
</div> It should therefore come as no surprise that Ernest would reserve to himself the power to amend the terms of the trust. Ernest’s description of himself as the “settlor” is consistent with his practice of manifesting himself as the owner of the Plaintiff Companies in order for the rest of the De La Sala family to avoid paying heavy taxes. This was also the belief of ECJ and I see no reason not to accept this. Ernest is the “settlor” insofar as he was the family custodian of the Plaintiff Companies’ assets or part thereof. Indeed, Ernest considered designating Bobby and Terrill as protectors of the trusts that he was setting up.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">458 Thirdly, the fact that Tony’s children were left out as beneficiaries is not inconsistent with Ernest managing the Plaintiff Companies on behalf of the De La Sala family. There is some evidence to suggest that Tony’s “share” of the family assets had been previously settled (I am unable on the evidence before me to tell whether this was a settlement of his share of the “fruit” or his share of the assets, though there was certainly a settlement of Australian properties with a substantial value as mentioned above at [448]). If I had to come to a conclusion, then I would have found it was settlement of his share of the “fruit”. Tony would also have agreed, given that Camila was still alive until July 2005, to only have claim to the “fruits” but not the “tree”, which was being managed and looked after by Ernest. With the settlement of the substantial Australian properties, Tony would henceforth have no further claims to any more “fruit” from the tree as the settlement was large enough to include part of the tree. In a letter from Ernest to Isabel dated 4 March 1995, Ernest had stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">MY PARAMOUNT DESIRE IS THAT THE CAPITAL ASSETS OF THESE COMPANIES (TREES) ARE PRESERVED AND CONTINUE TO GROW THROUGH PRUDENT INVESTMENTS AND ONLY A PORTION i.e. NOT EXCEEDING 25% (1/4) OF THE ANNUAL INCOME (FRUITS) BE PERMITTED TO BE <span class="font-italic">DISTRIBUTED EQUALLY TO TERESA, EDWARD, CHRISTINA, ISABEL AND NICOLE</span>.

It is apparent that Tony’s assertion that he has no financial interest in the matter is not because he believed that his NEL and JMC shares were bought out by Ernest; if that were the case, Bobby too should have “no financial interest in the matter” as his NEL and JMC shares were also allegedly purchased by Ernest. In my view, this strongly suggests that Tony’s share of the family assets (whether the “fruit” or the corpus) had been settled prior to the execution of the REC-HLV Trust. ECJ’s evidence was that they were told by Ernest that Tony’s family had been separately taken care of and that they were content with that explanation because they trusted him then and Ernest managed the ‘family’ assets, and it seemed reasonable in the light of the tension between Tony and Ernest.

</div> In any event, it is strictly unnecessary for me to make any firm finding on this issue since Tony is not presently making a claim to the assets held by the Plaintiff Companies; it suffices to say that I do not find Tony’s family being left out of the REC-HLV Trust as contrary to Ernest managing the Plaintiff Companies on behalf of the rest of the De La Sala family. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">460 Lastly, and most significantly, Ernest had tasked ECJ to improve upon the REC-HLV Trust (which was eventually revoked on 25 June 2009).

</div> The “critical mass” was also described as the “REC legacy”. The phrase “passing the baton” suggests that Ernest had received the “baton” from his father, Robert Sr, and was now looking to pass it on to the next generation, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, ECJ. In an email sent by Ernest in response to this memorandum, Ernest wrote:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [Edward–James]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">SUGGEST YOU PREPARE CONCEPT FOR MY REVIEW AND COMPARISON WITH OTHERS I HAVE.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">BASE YOUR COMPOSITION ON HOW YOU WOULD PERSONALLY DESIRE TO SEE YOUR OWN DESIGNATED ASSETS/BATON UTILISED BY WORTHY SUCCESSORS <span class="font-italic">WHO IN TURN WILL LIEKWISE PASS THE “ENHANCED” BATON/BATONS ONTO THEIR SUCESSORS ACCORDINGLY.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">EMPHASISE WHAT SAFE-GUARDS YOU WOULD INSTALL TO ENSURE THE <span class="font-italic">INFINITE CONTINUITY</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I note that this harks back to what Robert Sr said in his letter dated 2 November 1950 to Ernest, that the assets of LIL “will remain in the Lasala family until doom’s day if my sons and sons’ sons so desire it.”  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">462 Subsequent memoranda proposing various structures continued to emphasise that the assets are to be preserved and grown for the <span class="font-italic">family</span>. Some of these structures adopt certain practices that appear to mirror Ernest’s present practices.

</div> These multiple memoranda eventually culminated in the SSS Trust, which in my view strongly indicates that Ernest thought of himself as the custodian of family assets who was grooming his successors. The final version of the SSS Trust, which was not only created with the close involvement of Ernest but follows his amendments in his handwriting, was signed on 26 June 2009.

</div> It appears from these documents and drafts of the SSS Trust that ECJ were under the impression that they were developing structures to manage “family” assets. I note that there is some dispute between the parties as to whether the SSS Trust was validly executed by Ernest on 26 June 2009, or whether it was subsequently revoked by Ernest a few days later on 30 June 2009. However, it is unnecessary for me to make a finding on this as the Plaintiff Companies and/or ECJ are not taking the position that the assets of the Plaintiff Companies are held on trust <span class="font-italic">pursuant to</span> the SSS Trust. What is significant about the SSS Trust is that it reflects what ECJ and Ernest understood the position to be at the time, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that they were creating a structure to manage “family” assets, at least until Ernest allegedly revoked the SSS Trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">463 A memorandum drafted by Ernest during the period leading up to the signing of the SSS Trust reinforces my conclusion. Although Ernest conveniently claims he cannot remember drafting this, he can hardly deny doing so because he made corrections to the drafts of the memorandum in his own handwriting. The memorandum provides:

Indeed, the later part of the memorandum states that the custodians had, like Ernest, to “live offshore as a tax exile”. This would be necessary only if the assets of the Plaintiff Companies were being held on behalf of family members living in jurisdictions that imposed high taxes on offshores assets such as Australia. That is also why, in his email dated 3 February 2003 to Christina and James, Ernest describes his role as a “burden” he bore for the family.

</div> The use of that word by itself and in context is hardly consistent with all the monies and assets belonging to him. I note that during cross-examination, Ernest sought to question the authenticity of the memorandum. I find that he has no basis for doing so. First, the memorandum contains his handwritten amendments, and secondly, Ernest never contested the authenticity of the memorandum prior to taking the stand (unlike the case for other documents). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion on the facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">464 Weighing all the evidence before me, my conclusions and findings, in conjunction with those made above, including but not limited to [138], [296] and [388]–[390], are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Robert Sr did not set up a formal trust in his lifetime.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) What he did set up was LIL/NEL, which he initially meant to be his insurance policy for his family should anything untoward happen to him, and over the years he put assets into LIL/NEL and increased its share capital.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) LIL/NEL was always for the benefit of JERIC, as if he had taken out life insurance policies and named JERIC as his beneficiaries.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) JMC, in the meanwhile, was run as a business to make money, as were the other companies, subsidiaries and businesses.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) Robert Sr gradually manoeuvred LIL/NEL, in acquiring assets, paying off or eliminating debts and liabilities, collecting receivables, holding on to valuable income-producing assets without corresponding loans, such that it held a lot of assets but not much in liabilities, and later on, had no more liabilities and only assets.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(v) At that stage, Robert Sr had amassed more than enough assets in LIL/NEL by way of “insurance proceeds” to protect his family.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(vi) Robert Sr then mentioned this fact, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, (v) above, and then expressed his “wish” that LIL continues to guarantee the well-being of all his descendants and deserving relatives.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Robert Sr died unexpectedly on 27 May 1967.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Ernest was the most naturally placed to take over Robert Sr’s mantle – he already ran JMC and its subsidiaries, was adept in and, like his father, had the aptitude for business – and he did so, stepping into Robert Sr’s shoes <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the family.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) He ran the businesses under JMC as well as all the other companies, including LIL/NEL.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Importantly, he continued to look after the family’s, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, JRIC’s interests, just as his father did and managed their share of the assets and businesses. At that juncture, JRIC each had a 20% interest in the family assets by virtue of their NEL and JMC shares.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) It was clear that JERIC owned NEL as well as NEL’s subsidiaries and for a time, JMC shares, even though before Robert Sr’s passing, nominee companies were introduced into the structure; <span class="font-italic">eg</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Strath Nominees held Tony’s and Bobby’s shares.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(v) It was also clear there were Ernest’s own shareholding in JMC and its business subsidiaries outside those of NEL.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(vi) All of the family’s interests in NEL and JMC (and their subsidiaries) were transferred over to Ernest and/or nominee companies for Ernest to manage on the family’s behalf.  </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(vii) Once Ernest took over the companies, he restructured the companies in August to December 1967. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(viii) Ernest did so to create a curtain of opacity so that no one could pierce the corporate veils and ascertain ownership of the companies and its assets.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ix) He did so openly, informing his family of all his restructuring and continually reminded them of the structure that was in existence.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(x) He set up the first “orphan” structure in December 1969, at the time of his acrimonious divorce proceedings, to ensure Hannelore would not be able to trace his assets.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Ernest managed NEL after his father died, hid it behind nominee companies and an “orphan” structure, and was extremely successful in multiplying the family’s wealth:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Ernest managed and invested JRIC’s share of the businesses and assets, as well as his own, and Ernest kept “score-cards” for each member of JRIC.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Ernest sent letters and micro-cassette recordings to his siblings reminding them of what he had been doing in relation to the business as well as the corporate structures and bank accounts.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Ernest continued with the practice of distributing the “fruit” whilst retaining the balance to augment and strengthen the “tree” (I have noted above the practice of retaining 2/3 of the “dividend” and Ernest’s Memorandum of 4 March 1995 which mentions that not more than 25% shall be distributed in any year). Ernest continued the practice of numbered bank accounts into which these distributable portions of the dividend were credited.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) Ernest also continued to keep the assets and funds “off-shore” outside Australia, in tax “friendly” jurisdictions and later went on to form Panamanian, BVI and Liberian companies which he described as “pockets” or “valises” but whose funds and assets were to be deposited in banks in safe jurisdictions like Switzerland, Vancouver, Hong Kong and other financial centres. Ernest told his siblings that from his experience, so long as such companies do not actively engage in business (as compared to passively holding funds), no questions are asked as long as their registration was kept current. Further no annual returns needed to be filed for these companies.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(v) He regularly sent money to his siblings whenever they wanted to purchase properties or assets in Australia through the device of loans from banks outside Australia.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(vi) He sent money to the grandchildren in Camila’s name on the latter’s birthdays.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(vii) Ernest remained the “tax exile”, living outside Australia and managing the businesses.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Ernest never bought out the interests of JRIC.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) He came to be regarded with great respect as the head of the De La Sala family:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) When there were disputes, or differences of opinion on the businesses or the running of the businesses in Australia, he had the final say and gave instructions and directions.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) When there were differences between Tony and Bobby with the former complaining about Bobby staying “rent free” at 27 Carrington Avenue with Camila, Ernest stepped in at his mother’s request to resolve and settle the same once and for all. Tony also resented Ernest dictating how the Australian businesses should be run.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Ernest divided the Australian properties and businesses, and gave Tony his freedom to manage his assets, by transferring ownership of the company holding Totem Shopping Centre and other properties to Tony (as noted above, Camila’s shares in JERIC Consolidated Pty Ltd were transferred, in accordance with her will, to Tony, after her death);</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) He had a quarrel with Tony in 2003 and they seldom talked to each other after that date.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(v) Ernest dealt with Camila’s estate after she died in July 2005.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Over the years, Ernest sent back large sums of money to Tony, Bobby and Isabel and/or their children whenever funds were required for various purposes:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) In fact over the years, his siblings had more than enough assets in Australia and their children also bought their houses and homes with money directly as a “gift” from Uncle Ernest or through their parents.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) The next generation, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Robert Sr’s grandchildren (other than Ernest’s two sons), were all well provided for.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) As noted above, Tony took over ownership of substantial assets in Australia in settlement and, to use Ernest’s words in his memo, this was “to resolve current animosity between principal shareholders of De la Sala PTY LTD/JERIC CONSOLIDATED PTY LTD” (though I make no finding as to the nature and extent of this settlement given that there is a lack of evidence, and Tony and his immediate family have ostensibly disavowed any claim to the Plaintiff Companies’ assets and are not parties to the present proceedings).</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) Bobby, on the other hand, still had part of his 20% share with Ernest.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(v) Ernest also still holds the undistributed part of Camila’s Estate within the funds he controlled prior to ECJ “joining him” in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Prior to August 2011, Ernest was still holding funds and assets that belonged to Bobby as well as part of the undistributed 20% share of Camila’s estate which included Bobby’s share. As Tony and Isabel disavow any such claim and are not parties to this action, there is no need for any finding in relation to them. The evidence they have chosen to put before me, and especially their allegations that Ernest had bought all of them out, I found to be unbelievable and unreliable and I reject the same.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) As he was getting on in years, Ernest had to start thinking of a successor. Ernest could not find a single person like himself who could manage the businesses and investments, so he recruited ECJ, who were obviously his more favoured nephew and niece (and her husband) as they were, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, tertiary qualified, so that he could “train” them and give them the benefit of his experience in running the businesses. He had earlier asked Maria-Isabel and her husband, but they declined to do so. I totally reject Ernest’s case that ECJ wanted business experience and exposure and he created the opportunity for them to do so in Singapore. In addition to my findings above and especially at, but not limited to, [371], [378], [384] and [460]:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) I find that he represented to ECJ that they had been selected by him as the new custodians for the “family legacy’ that Robert Sr had set up, and which he had been managing and administering as “trustee”, and they had to be “tax exiles” like him. He would train them up and give them the benefit of his experience in handling these assets and funds and they would eventually take over from him.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Like his father before him, Ernest had difficulty letting go of the reins and, perhaps being more astute and more experienced, did not agree with many of ECJ’s business decisions.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) He and ECJ had an unfortunate misunderstanding over their handling of certain funds left in their charge in August 2011 and that escalated into a full blown dispute resulting in these proceedings when he claimed, quite untruthfully, that all the monies and assets in the Plaintiff Companies, were his. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) At the time of the dispute and the Injunction proceedings, the Plaintiff Companies still held funds that belonged to:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Bobby’s original 20% at the time of Robert Sr’s death. That sum has been multiplied by Ernest over the years and I am unable to tell how much it had been increased by, how much had been sent to Bobby and how much of Bobby’s 20% still remained with the Plaintiff Companies as effectively no evidence of this was put before me. These sums have to be accounted for; and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Funds belonging to the estate of Camila that had yet to be distributed. This too is unascertainable on the evidence before me and Bobby would be entitled to his share of Camila’s undistributed estate. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(j) After Robert Sr’s death, Ernest took over, ran and managed all the businesses, their assets and the funds as Robert Sr did, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, he had absolute discretion and control. He also became the tax exile. I find that whilst he would credit dividends into JRIC’s accounts, and perhaps only JRI after his mother passed on, he re-invested the larger portion (whether it was 2/3 or 3/4 or some other figure) as his father did before him. He was able to refuse funding for projects which his siblings or their children brought to him.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Ownership of the Plaintiff Companies and their assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">465 It remains for me to make the necessary findings as to the ownership of the Plaintiff Companies and their assets. The 3rd, 4th and 6th plaintiffs (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, DOM, JMM and SMC) are held under the triangular corporate structure of the 1st, 2nd and 5th plaintiffs (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, PAL-CFC-PEN) (“the Orphan Companies”). To identify the owners of the Plaintiff Companies and their assets, certain questions in respect of the triangular corporate structure of PAL-CFC-PEN must be addressed, specifically:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether such a structure is valid under the applicable law; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) How the ultimate beneficial owner of (a) the shares, and (b) the assets of the Orphan Companies is to be determined; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) How the ultimate beneficial owner of the shares of the Orphan Companies may procure the transfer to himself of (a) the shares, and (b) the assets of the Orphan Companies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">466 To answer these questions, I turn to the law of the BVI and Panama, where PAL, CFC and PEN were incorporated.

</div> Under BVI law, a company is a separate legal entity, separate from that of its shareholders. The experts also agree that shares of the Orphan Companies could be beneficially owned by a person outside the structure, and that the assets held by the Orphan Companies could likewise be held beneficially for a person outside the structure.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">473 On balance, I prefer Mr Hoyos’ evidence to Mr Ballard’s. It is trite law that when evaluating the evidence given by an expert, the court will take into account the credentials of the expert and the methodology by which the expert reached his or her conclusions (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Mui Teck v Public Prosecutor </span>[2003] 3 SLR(R) 139 at [11]). In respect of the experts’ methodology, I note that Mr Hoyos’ opinions, at least on the aspects of Panamanian law that I am relying on and on which Mr Ballard presents a differing opinion, are supported by numerous authorities, both statute and case law. In contrast, Mr Ballard’s opinions have little or no supporting authority (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, Mr Ballard’s answer to question 4(d), <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, how may the ultimate beneficial owner of the shares of the Orphan Companies procure the transfer of the (a) shares and (b) assets of the companies to himself). I find Mr Hoyos’ opinions to be more persuasive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">474 In respect of the experts’ credentials, it appears to me that Mr Hoyos would have a more intimate understanding of Panamanian corporation and trust law as compared to Mr Ballard. Mr Hoyos was the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Justice of Panama between 1994 and 2000, has published books on private law institutions of the Panamanian Legal System, and has provided expert witness testimony on Panamanian law in multiple cases spanning different jurisdictions. While Mr Ballard is a lawyer described as a commercial law expert and has advised banks and Fortune 500 companies on transnational as well as Panamanian legal issues, I find that his exposure to Panamanian corporation and trust law would not be as extensive as Mr Hoyos. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">475 From the experts’ evidence, the following legal propositions are common between the BVI and Panama:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A company is a separate legal entity, separate from its shareholders;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The shares of the Orphan Companies can have a beneficial owner;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The assets held by the Orphan Companies can be held beneficially for someone else;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) If the shares and/or assets of the Orphan Companies are held beneficially for someone else, that person may procure the transfer of those shares and/or assets to himself;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The beneficial owner of the shares is not the beneficial owner of the assets held by the Orphan Companies; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) If the beneficial owner of the shares wants to transfer the assets of the Orphan Companies to himself, he would have to procure the appropriate shareholder resolutions directing the board of directors to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It follows from these principles that Ernest bears the initial legal burden of proving that he is the beneficial owner of the Plaintiff Companies and their assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">476 On the facts, I note that Ernest was the one who incorporated the Orphan Companies, and had always exercised full and complete control over the companies and their affairs. The evidence adduced suggests, and I so find, that Ernest is the beneficial owner of the shares of the Orphan Companies. Furthermore, I am of the view that the Orphan Companies are not holding their assets beneficially. While the companies hold considerable assets, they have nominal or insubstantial paid-up capital and no apparent trading operations. It is obvious that these assets are being held by the companies for some other person and/or entity. Indeed, Ernest often described the Orphan Companies as “envelopes” or “containers”, not only in his AEIC and oral evidence, but also in his letters to his family. Ernest also maintained full control of the assets of the Orphan Companies. In my view, the Orphan Companies are holding the assets that were put in them by Ernest, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>subject to what I say below, Ernest is the putative beneficial owner of the assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">477 However, and this is an important caveat to the foregoing, I have already found that a part of the funds and assets managed by Ernest belongs partially to JRIC. Ernest has, over the years, paid out sums of money to JRIC; that amount cannot be ascertained on the evidence before me. In my view, Ernest holds part of the beneficial interest in the shares of the Orphan Companies and their assets on behalf of JRI and Camila’s estate (although I am unable to determine in what proportion). The same should apply for the 3rd, 4th and 6th plaintiffs (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, DOM, JMM and SMC) since they are all owned under the triangular structure of the Orphan Companies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">478 It follows that Ernest, as the putative beneficial owner of <span class="font-italic">both</span> the shares and the assets of the Plaintiff Companies, was entitled to transfer to himself the assets of the Plaintiff Companies. However, he is not entitled to dispose of <span class="font-italic">all</span> the assets or treat them as if they belonged to him; he holds part of those assets on trust for JRIC. I also acknowledge that Tony and Isabel have come to court to say, in effect, that they have no interest in these funds as they sold their shares and/or interest to Ernest. That, however, still leaves Bobby’s share as part of JRIC as well as his entitlement as a one-third beneficiary of the residuary estate under Camila’s will, less any sums of money and/or assets paid out of these two components. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Camila’s estate</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">479 As mentioned above at [12], Camila passed away in July 2005.

HongKongBank International Trustee Limited was appointed as the executor of her estate.

</div> Bobby has since written to Isabel on 26 September 2013, 10 and 15 November 2013, after the commencement of the present proceedings, asking for a statement of distribution. Isabel has yet to reply these letters. She refused to do so because “the matter is now in the hands of [her] solicitors” as she “expect[s] Bobby to commence proceedings against [her] … in Sydney”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Registrar’s Appeal No 352 of 2014 (“RA 352/2014”)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">483 There is one other matter I need to deal with, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, RA 352/2014. This is an appeal against the decision of an assistant registrar (“the AR”) granting Ernest’s application to produce two documents (collectively, “the WP Documents”):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A letter from Ian Winter QC dated 27 November 2013, which is marked “without prejudice” (“the IW Letter”); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) An email from James to Isabel dated 27 November 2013 titled “letter to Ernest De La Sala” (“James’s Email”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I note at the outset that it puzzles me why Ernest insisted on producing these two documents. As can be seen from the discussion above, the WP Documents are hardly relevant to the present dispute. Indeed, Ernest’s closing submissions had referred to the WP Documents in passing in <span class="font-italic">one paragraph</span> only (out of 767 paragraphs).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">484 I set out the background to this appeal. One month before the parties exchanged AEICs, James instructed Mr Ian Winter QC to prepare the IW Letter, which was sent to Ernest’s lawyers on 27 November 2013. As mentioned above, the letter was marked “without prejudice”. On the same day, James emailed Isabel informing her that he had sent the IW Letter to Ernest and that she might want to discuss its contents with Ernest as the contents of the letter might affect Isabel and her interests (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, James’s Email). James had not attached the IW Letter to the email as he considered it privileged. No response was received from Ernest, Isabel or their lawyers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">485 The matter then proceeded to trial. On 3 October 2014, after most of Ernest’s witnesses had given evidence, Ernest filed a Supplementary List of Documents disclosing the WP Documents. This was challenged by ECJ on the basis that they were inadmissible “without prejudice” communications. I expressed my disappointment and disapproval at Ernest’s late attempt to adduce these documents, but to ensure that all the relevant evidence were before the court, in the event that this is taken up elsewhere, I directed Ernest to file a formal application to admit the documents.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">486 The application went before the AR who allowed it, citing two brief oral grounds for her decision. The first was that the IW Letter did not contain any admission of interests against James. The second was that, even if an admission was not necessary, the letter was not written with the genuine purpose of reaching a settlement.  ECJ then filed RA 352/2014. To avoid delays to the trial, the parties agreed, and I also directed parties to address the appeal in closing submissions. Ernest was entitled to cross-examine James on the WP Documents, and ECJ could call Ian Winter QC to give evidence in respect of his instructions for the preparation of the IW Letter. The parties were also in agreement that I could refer to the WP Documents insofar as it was necessary for me to decide the issue of admissibility. I turn to the parties’ arguments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">487 ECJ argues that the IW Letter was a genuine invitation to negotiate settlement, and this, in and of itself, is sufficient to constitute an admission against interest which attracts the privilege.  It was unnecessary for the other party to agree before without prejudice privilege would arise. Further, Ernest had not explained the extreme lateness of his attempt to adduce the WP Documents as evidence in the present proceedings.  On the other hand, Ernest raises four independent grounds as to why the IW Letter does not attract without prejudice privilege: (1) the IW Letter contains no admissions as required under s 23 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed); (2) the IW Letter was not made for the genuine purpose of settlement; (3) there is no evidence that Ernest at any time accepted the IW Letter as being “without prejudice”; and (4) in any event, any privilege attached to the IW Letter is lost under the broad “fraud exception”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">488 I am of the view that the WP Documents are protected by “without prejudice” privilege. The “without prejudice” privilege governs the “admissibility of evidence and is founded on the public policy of encouraging litigants to settle their differences rather than to litigate them to the finish” (see <span class="font-italic">Rush &amp; Tompkins Ltd v Greater London Council</span> [1989] AC 1280 at 1299). The privilege protects the party who seeks a compromise against the disclosure of his correspondence in the course of settlement negotiations. This principle is expressed in s 23 of the Evidence Act (see <span class="font-italic">Mariwu Industrial Co (S) Pte Ltd v Dextra Asia Co Ltd and another</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 807 (“<span class="font-italic">Mariwu</span>”) at [24]), which provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Admissions in civil cases when relevant</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">23.</span>—(1)  In civil cases, no admission is relevant if it is made —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) upon an express condition that evidence of it is not to be given; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) upon circumstances from which the court can infer that the parties agreed together that evidence of it should not be given.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  Nothing in subsection (1) shall be taken —</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(a) to exempt any advocate or solicitor from giving evidence of any matter of which he may be compelled to give evidence under section 128; or</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(b) to exempt any legal counsel in an entity from giving evidence of any matter of which he may be compelled to give evidence under section 128A</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">489 There appear to be two prerequisites before the “without prejudice” privilege may be invoked. The first is that the communication (in respect of which privilege is claimed) must arise in the course of genuine negotiations to settle a dispute, while the second is that the communication must constitute or involve an admission against the maker’s interest (<span class="font-italic">Mariwu</span> at [29]; see also <span class="font-italic">Sin Lian Heng Construction Pte Ltd v Singapore Telecommunications Ltd</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 433 (“<span class="font-italic">Sin Lian Heng</span>”) at [13]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">490 With respect to the first prerequisite, it is undeniable that there was a dispute between the parties when the WP Documents were sent. Ernest’s contention is that the WP Documents were not made for the genuine purpose of a settlement and this brings them outside the scope of the “without prejudice” privilege. He cites three reasons in support of his contention: (1) the IW Letter is replete with threats; (2) Ian Winter does not act for Edward and Christina; and (3) IW’s answers in cross-examination reveal that James’s intention for sending the letter was to highlight Ernest’s alleged misconduct and the ramifications for him if the matter was not settled. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">491 Having perused the IW Letter, I find that it was a genuine invitation by James to negotiate a settlement between the parties. James’s desire for the parties to come to a settlement agreement can be clearly seen from paragraphs 5, 9 and 52–55 of the IW Letter (which I do not propose to set out given my view that it is protected by “without prejudice” privilege). Paragraph 5 of the IW Letter further indicates that James had, prior to the sending of the IW Letter, discussed the issue of a settlement with Edward and Christina (and <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span> the Plaintiff Companies), who indicated their willingness to resolve the dispute on mutually acceptable terms. It is true that the bulk of the IW Letter emphasises the weaknesses of Ernest’s case and the potential consequences of the matter being litigated in open court (such as the reputational damage to the family or possible investigations by the various authorities). However, I do not think this undermines James’s genuine intention to negotiate a settlement and I turn to the English High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Schering Corporation v CIPLA Ltd and another</span> [2004] EWHC 2587 (Ch) to illustrate this. In that case, Laddie J had to decide whether a particular letter was protected by “without prejudice” privilege, and one of the questions he had to decide was whether the letter could be regarded as a “negotiating document”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, as indicating a willingness to negotiate. The learned judge had the following to say about the letter (at [19] and [21]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[19] The question here is whether or not the letter of 6 July is a negotiating document. In assessing it, I shall try and put myself in the position of the reasonable recipient so as to determine the message it conveys. In my view the message is perfectly clear. <span class="font-italic">As is common in correspondence between parties who face potential litigation, the author maximizes the strength of his case.</span> That is what the first two paragraphs do. They say that CIPLA is confident, on the basis of legal advice, that Schering's patent is invalid. But if that was all that CIPLA was doing, first of all, it need not have written this letter to Schering at all; it could simply have entered the market. Or it could have then stopped the letter at the end of the second paragraph. But the author did not do that. Instead, he said that he was prepared to avoid a path of confrontation if there was “an alternative commercial solution acceptable to both parties.”</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[21] <span class="font-italic">The fourth paragraph it seems to me is once again the sort of paragraph which one would expect from a party wishing to emphasize to its potential negotiating partner the strength of its case.</span> It says that absent an objection from Schering, CIPLA will feel at liberty to go ahead, presumably by importing products into the UK market. <span class="font-italic">Once again, it seems to me that it is common, indeed normal, for one party to assert that its confidence is so great in the correctness of its position, that it feels that it is safe to proceed without regard to the other side's position if negotiations are not entered into and resolved satisfactorily. But the overall message continues to be one of wishing to negotiate.</span> True enough, as Mr Thorley argues, this letter is expressed in terms which suggest that it is Schering who have to ask for negotiations; but that is form rather than substance. <span class="font-italic">This is an invitation, as I read it, to Schering to negotiate.</span> The heading “without prejudice” reinforces that message. I have no doubt at all that this was a negotiating document and for that reason is covered by the without prejudice privilege. In the result, Schering is not entitled to refer to it in its particulars of infringement and the action must be struck out.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">492 I also do not think that the contents of the IW Letter amount to “threats” as Ernest alleges. There is a clear distinction between highlighting to the other party the potential risks of proceeding with litigation, which may include investigations by the relevant authorities, and threatening to report the other party to those authorities unless the other party settled. The IW Letter made it plain (no less than six times at paras 7, 8, 18, 38, 46, and 50) that James had no intention of sending any material or information to the authorities that might subject Ernest or Isabel to investigations. Furthermore, the IW Letter was drafted by an experienced Queen’s Counsel, who gave evidence that he had advised James that on no account could the IW Letter contain any threat that James would do anything should the proceedings not be settled. He also testified that he would have refused to act for James if his instructions were otherwise.  I further observe that neither Ernest nor his lawyers raised any objections to the IW Letter until 10 months after it was sent when Ernest indicated his intention to produce the letter as evidence. I am therefore of the view that the IW Letter arose in the course of genuine negotiations to settle the dispute between the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">493 I turn to the second prerequisite, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the communication must constitute or involve an admission against the maker’s interest. This prerequisite appears to originate from s 23(1) of the Evidence Act itself, which limits its applicability to “admissions”. In other words, s 23 only deals with the circumstances under which an “admission” would be inadmissible (or irrelevant). The term “admission” is defined in s 17(1) of the Evidence Act as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">17.</span>—(1)  An admission is a statement, oral or documentary, which suggests any inference as to any fact in issue or relevant fact, and which is made by any of the persons and under the circumstances hereinafter mentioned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mariwu</span> further added the gloss that such “admission” must be an admission against interest (at [31]) as the protection of such admissions is the basis of the “without prejudice” privilege. In <span class="font-italic">Sin Lian Heng</span>, Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) has this to say about such admissions (at [43]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A statement or action that appears on its face to go against the interest of the maker might be seized upon by the opposite party as an admission. This may take the form of statements which are prejudicial in any number of ways. Where one party enters into negotiations with another to explore the possibilities of settlement, it makes sense of course to attempt to convince the opponent of the weaknesses of his position; but it is not unusual – even common – to seem to acknowledge possible weaknesses in one’s own case. <span class="font-italic">Even the level of an offer may be seen as a barometer of the offering party’s enthusiasm for the merits of his own position, and while that may be quite irrelevant if the communication was cloaked by the privilege, one can see that most litigants would avoid any attempt at settlement if there was a risk that their offers to settle were later going to be raised against them as a sign of weakness.</span> It is thus in the overall spirit of encouraging negotiations that parties be sufficiently protected when they “lay their cards on the table”. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">494 I agree with ECJ’s submission that a genuine invitation to negotiate a settlement is sufficient, in and of itself, to constitute an admission against interest for the purposes of attracting “without prejudice” privilege. Parties should not be discouraged from initiating settlement negotiations in the fear that their willingness to negotiate might be utilised against them in the future as a sign of weakness. This would run contrary to the policy which undergirds the operation of the “without prejudice” principle. I have already found that the IW Letter is a genuine invitation by James to negotiate a settlement. It follows that the IW Letter is protected by “without prejudice” privilege. It is not necessary for James to demonstrate that the IW Letter contains material that is prejudicial to his (and Edwards and Christina’s) positions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">495 I now deal with the remaining two grounds that Ernest alleges justifies admitting the WP Documents. The first ground was that Ernest did not accept the WP Documents as being protected by “without prejudice” privilege. This argument is misconceived. Section 23(1)(a) clearly provides that an “admission” is inadmissible if it is made upon an express condition that evidence of it is not to be given. This is typically done by marking the communication expressly “without prejudice” (see <span class="font-italic">Mariwu</span> at [24]), which was clearly done for the IW Letter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">496 The second ground was that any privilege attached to the WP Documents was lost under the broad “fraud exception”. In this regard, Ernest argues that (1) the IW Letter demonstrates that the present proceedings were brought for a collateral purpose, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to pressure Ernest to settle to avoid disastrous and ruinous consequences set out in the IW Letter; and (2) the WP Documents were unlawful for perverting the course of justice as they sought to influence Ernest and/or Isabel’s evidence. I have already found that the IW Letter is a genuine invitation to negotiate a settlement and I am unable to see how it has the effect which Ernest alleges it to have. I therefore dismiss this ground. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">497 In the circumstances, I allow RA 352/2014. Costs before me and below must follow the event, the order for costs below is set aside; costs are accordingly to be paid by Ernest to ECJ, such costs to be agreed or assessed pursuant to [513] below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">498 My findings of fact have been set out above and I will not repeat them as this judgment is long enough as it is.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Plaintiff Companies’ claims </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">499 For the reasons set out above, Ernest is the beneficial owner of the shares in the Plaintiff Companies. On my findings of fact of BVI and Panamanian law, Ernest is entitled to call for ECJ to effect transfers of shares as he directs and he is also entitled to call for their resignation from their directorships and appoint new directors as he may direct.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">500 For the reasons set out above, and subject to my following findings and rulings, Ernest is the beneficial owner of the assets and/or funds held by the Plaintiff Companies. However, because Ernest has mixed the assets and/or funds of Camila’s Estate, Tony, Bobby and Isabel with his own funds into the assets and/or funds held by the Plaintiff Companies, Ernest holds that part of those assets and/or funds on trust for his respective siblings and mother’s estate, less any payments that have been made by Ernest over the years to them and Camila’s estate. On the evidence that has been put before me, I am unable to ascertain the assets and/or funds that belong to Ernest and those that belong to his siblings and mother’s estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">501 For the reasons set out above, I find that Camila’s estate has not been fully or properly distributed or accounted for and subject to [503] below, Ernest is liable to account for the due administration and distribution of Camila’s Estate in accordance with her will and codicils.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">502 Although Tony, Bobby, Isabel and the Estate of Camila are not parties before me, Tony, Bobby, Isabel and the Executors of the Estate of Camila have given evidence before me and the issues in this case are intricately intertwined with their personal interests in the assets and/or monies that came from Robert Sr to them and which were subsequently handled, invested and multiplied by Ernest’s exceptional business abilities and acumen. As I have noted above, I am also unable to tell if Tony has obtained everything that is due to him or what amounts each of these parties have already received or have yet to receive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">503 The injunction covering US$200 million is to remain in place for 60 days from the date of this judgment to enable Bobby, if he so wishes, to intervene in these proceedings and to apply for Ernest to account for his share of the assets and/or funds belonging to him less what he has already been paid. If Bobby fails to make such an application, then that injunction over the US$200 million shall be discharged on the 61st day after the date of this judgment and returned to Ernest or to such entity as Ernest shall direct and I shall then deal with consequential matters arising therefrom. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">504 In the event that Bobby takes the view that his share of the assets and/or monies and/or his share of Camila’s Estate exceeds the US$200 million, Bobby shall be at liberty to apply to injunct such further or other sum as the court shall deem appropriate upon appraisal of the facts presented to it. Similarly, Ernest shall be entitled to do likewise to reduce the sum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">505 Subject to the foregoing, the Plaintiffs’ claims against Ernest are dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Ernest’s counterclaim for breach of director’s duties, etc</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">506 For the reasons set out above, Ernest’s counterclaims against ECJ are dismissed. ECJ had acted on their <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> belief that the Plaintiff Companies were holding assets which belonged to the family legacy and this was due to the personal representations of Ernest. They acted on this belief, reasonably held, in the face of Ernest’s claims that the Plaintiff Companies’ assets and/or funds were all his. I reject Ernest’s claims that ECJ acted in breach of their fiduciary duties owed to the Plaintiff Companies as directors or had dishonestly assisted in breaches of trust or took part in a lawful or unlawful conspiracy to injure Ernest. Ernest was in a large part responsible, by creating these triangular structures and by making the representations to ECJ as found by me, for the state of affairs in which ECJ acted, in my view, in accordance with their fiduciary duties as directors to protect the Plaintiff Companies when Ernest removed funds from them into his personal accounts. Ernest did not tell ECJ he was doing so and they found this out after the fact.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ECJ’s counterclaim for misrepresentation </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">507 For the reasons and my findings set out above, including, but not limited to [371], [378], [384], [460] and [464], I find that ECJ have made out their case of fraudulent misrepresentation against Ernest. For the reasons that I have set out above, I find that Ernest had represented to ECJ that there was a family legacy instituted by Robert Sr which Ernest was looking after as custodian for the De La Sala family when this was, to his knowledge, false. It was false on a number of bases. It was false on his case that all the assets were his; it was false on the evidence of Tony and Isabel, who were his main witnesses and who alleged they were all bought out and had no interest in the Plaintiff Companies or their assets; it was also materially false on the facts as I have found them. On this basis, Ernest persuaded ECJ, despite Edward and Christina’s prior unfavourable experience working for Ernest, to give up their personal careers, relocate to and remain in Singapore to be trained to manage the assets held by the Plaintiff Companies and to become future custodians of the family legacy at great personal cost to them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">508 For the reasons set out above and my findings (already referred to above), Ernest knew Robert Sr had not (other than to express his “wishes” which were dependent on his children taking appropriate steps to turn that into reality), set up any family trust and/or family legacy, and that after Robert Sr passed away, Ernest had merely consolidated JRIC’s assets with his own and Ernest managed all their and his assets and/or funds on their behalf. Ernest made those representations orally and in his faxes falsely to induce and persuade ECJ to give up their careers and relocate and remain in Singapore at, as it turned out, a sacrifice in that what they were paid did not or barely covered their losses. I am also sure, and I so find and hold, that if ECJ knew the truth, they would not have given up their personal careers, uproot their families and relocate to Singapore at great personal expense, especially as Edward and Christina had unpleasant experiences working for Ernest before. I also find and hold that although attractive remuneration, a carrot so artfully dangled by Ernest, would have been a factor, what counted with them was that they were serving the family interests in taking up this role; a role which Ernest had described as a “burden”, and which description Camila had also corroborated to Edward and Christina, and through Christina, to James. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">509 Ernest is therefore liable to ECJ in damages for his false representations, such damages to be assessed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Orders</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">510 The parties have two weeks from the date of this judgment to consider the same and, in consultation with each other, draw up appropriate orders in line with and to give effect to this judgment. This will include consideration of whether one of the companies should be split off to hold the balance of Bobby’s share and Bobby’s share of Camila’s estate. I will see the parties three weeks from today, or at such other date as the Registrar shall fix, to review the draft orders proposed and if there are any disagreements, I will make the final ruling on the same.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">511 The injunction over the US$200 million shall remain on the conditions set out above. The parties are also to suggest how this sum should be held pending final resolution, if any, of the remaining issues. If any of the parties feel it should be increased or decreased, they shall make the appropriate application therefor within the three week time period and fix the same for hearing on the date indicated in [510] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">512 I believe there are no reasons to withhold release of the sealed affidavit filed by Ernest on his bank accounts and assets, as an account has to be taken for the ascertainment of Bobby’s share and entitlement under Camila’s will if Bobby intervenes and takes out the appropriate application for the same, but I will hear parties’ views on the same on the date fixed in accordance with [510] above; it will remain sealed in the meantime.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">513 The parties are to make written submissions on costs including the numerous applications where costs were reserved, and disbursements they claim within 4 weeks from the date hereof. I will assess the costs on another date (other than that under [510]) to be fixed by the Registrar</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">514 These proceedings have been, most unfortunately, protracted, hard-fought and has irretrievably fractured the De La Sala family. I had at a number of stages of this hearing encouraged the parties to attempt mediation, but their differences must have been too wide and deep as this suggestion was never taken up. I can only say that Robert Sr, described in the Australian press as a “gentle” and “trusted tycoon”, a “rarity”, and his wife Camila, must be turning in their graves at this public airing of their family’s disputes and differences.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">515 It is also unfortunate that this will not end here. There are likely to be further proceedings whether here or elsewhere as a consequence of my findings to bring this very unfortunate dispute to a conclusion. There may also be resultant investigation from the Australian tax and perhaps other authorities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">516 But what is clear is that Robert Sr’s wish will now not be fulfilled. His children, Tony, Isabel and especially Ernest, have failed him. His warning of the high price of avarice and its cousin, jealousy, made on that hot sultry afternoon in Tokyo on 7th July 1957 has fallen by the wayside, forgotten after 59 years. His hopes, his dreams and his noble wish for his family and descendants have come to naught. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Quentin Loh <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Thio Shen Yi SC, Samantha Lee, Karen Teo and Sharleen Eio (TSMP Law Corporation) for the plaintiff;<br/>Harpreet Singh SC, Lim Shack Keong, Joan Lim and Keith Han (Cavenagh Law LLP) for the defendant and plaintiff in counterclaim;<br/>Cavinder Bull SC, Gerui Lim, Adam Maniam, Tan Yuan Kheng and Kelly Lua (Drew &amp; Napier LLC)<br/>for 1st to 3rd defendants by counterclaim.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
