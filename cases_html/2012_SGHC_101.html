        Philip Pillai J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff is a painting
                    contractor and the defendant is a manufacturer and supplier
                    of paint. The full account of the background to the dispute
                    arising between the parties is set out in <em>Anti-Corrosion Pte Ltd v Berger Paints Singapore Pte
                        Ltd and another appeal</em> [2011]
                    1 SLR 427 (“the CA
                    decision”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       For the purpose of this
                    judgment, which deals solely with the assessment of damages,
                    it suffices to set out the following salient facts. The
                    plaintiff was subcontracted to paint the surfaces of a
                    building project at Bukit Batok Street 23 (‘the
                    Bukit Batok project”) which included:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     a 9-storey ramp
                        up building (“Building A”);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     a 30-storey building
                        (“Building B”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It
                    bought the defendant’s paint for that purpose. The
                    plaintiff applied the paint to the surfaces of the building
                    project based on the defendant’s proposed paint
                    system. However, there was extensive discolouration. The
                    plaintiff bought replacement paint from a third party,
                    Haruna (S) Pte Ltd, and repainted both the discoloured and
                    adjacent areas in the buildings. Although the original
                    painting works took 7.5 month to complete, the
                    repainting works took 16 months. Subsequently, the
                    plaintiff brought the present action claiming damages for
                    the expense of repainting. It claimed that the defendant had
                    given a warranty for the paint so long as the use of the
                    paint was based on the defendant’s proposed paint
                    system. The defendant denied that the paint was defective
                    and brought a counterclaim against the plaintiff for the
                    contract price of the goods supplied. It also denied that it
                    had given any enforceable warranty covering the paint
                    supplied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In <em>Anti-Corrosion Pte Ltd v Berger Paints Singapore Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2010] SGHC 351, I found that the
                    plaintiff had not proven its case (namely that the defects
                    in the paint had caused the discolouration) on a balance of
                    probabilities. I also observed <em>obiter</em> that if I had decided on the issue of
                    the warranty, I would have found that the defendant had
                    warranted all its products used in any of the
                    plaintiff’s projects for a period of five years,
                    provided that the use was based on a proposed paint system
                    by the defendant. The plaintiff appealed. The defendant
                    cross-appealed on the question of the
                warranty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Court of Appeal
                    dismissed the defendant’s cross-appeal on the warranty
                    at [27]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Joseph Yong made his statements to
                        Vincent Lim intending the latter to rely on them. We
                        therefore find the following assurances given by Joseph
                        Yong were express terms of the contract:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    the Respondent's Decora
                                Emulsion paint would be fit for application on
                                the internal surfaces of the Bukit Batok
                                project, without the need for a sealer coat;
                                and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    the provision of a
                                five-year warranty for the paints used in the
                                Bukit Batok project, provided the use of paint
                                was based on a proposed paint system by the
                                Respondent:
                                see [9] and [10] above as
                                well as [42]-[45] below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Court of Appeal allowed
                    the plaintiff’s appeal and made the following
                    findings:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">38    Accordingly, we find that the
                            paint discolouration was more likely than not caused
                            by defects in the Decora Emulsion paint supplied by
                            the Respondent. There has therefore been a breach of
                            the express term of the contract that the
                            Respondent's paint would be free from defects and
                            fit for application on the internal surfaces of the
                            Bukit Batok project, without the need for a sealer
                            coat (see [27(a)] above). This finding obviates the
                            need to consider whether there is a breach of the
                            implied terms of the SGA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       This assessment of damages
                    follows the Court of Appeal’s findings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiff’s claim
                    of $1,185,545.60 for special damages is as

                    no adequate explanation has been provided, the court may
                    well be justified in relying solely on what can be proven
                    through documentation and not the oral testimony, as was the
                    case in <em>Bocatra Construction Pte Ltd v

                        [31]. I bear
                    these principles in mind as I turn to consider each item
                    claimed by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The plaintiff claims that
                    the entire area that required repainting were as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     176,882 m² being
                        the equivalent of about 6 out of 9 storeys of Building
                        A; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     100,883 m² being the equivalent of
                        about 19 out of 30 storeys of
                    Building B.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This means that three
                    storeys of Building A and 11 storeys of Building B
                    did not require repainting by reason of discolouration or
                    had not been originally painted with the Berger paint. The
                    plaintiff had originally issued a letter of demand for
                    repainting, of $443,243.20 (excluding the cost of paint).
                    The plaintiff also claims the costs of a sub-contractor who
                    repainted Building B.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The defendant has since

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The plaintiff claims the
                    sum of $224,000.00 as the cost of hiring Swiss Plan
                    Construction Pte Ltd (“Swiss Plan”) to carry
                    out the repainting works of the 2nd storey to the
                    19th storey of the 30-storey building
                    (Building B), comprising the units’ ceiling and
                    wall and basement-corridor ceiling. This was completed by
                    March 2009. As this is fully documented in Swiss
                    Plan’s statement of final account dated 23 March
                    2009, and is not disputed, I allow this head of

                    are the plaintiff’s other heads of claim arising out
                    of the plaintiff’s repainting works for 6 of the
                    9 storeys of Building A, comprising 176,882
                        m<sup>2</sup>. It is in evidence from
                    the on-site supervisor, that the units were repainted for
                    handover by February 2009 and the corridors and external
                    areas were completed between March and September 2009. The
                    plaintiff submits invoices and pay slips for these other
                    heads of claim. The defendant has a common objection to
                    these claims, that the plaintiff has not provided any
                    evidence to show that these were for costs incurred
                    exclusively for the repainting of six storeys of
                    Building A. These costs cannot be proved with complete
                    certainty and I shall accordingly attempt to make an
                    assessment based on the available evidence. <em>Tai Hing Cotton Mill Ltd v Kamsing Knitting

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     I note that the number of
                    workers originally deployed in the paintworks was a monthly
                    average of about 20 whilst it was claimed that a
                    monthly average of 23 workers for the repainting. From
                    the invoice submitted by the subcontractor, Building B
                    was completed by the sub-contractor by March 2009. Taking
                    into account that the repainting of Building B had been
                    subcontracted out, and that the plaintiff only repainted
                    6 storeys of Building A, it would be safer to
                    adopt a measure of the work done by reference to the
                    7.5 months taken to repaint both Building A and
                    Building B which was 7.5 months and to take into
                    account the respective paint surfaces.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Based on the constant of
                    the surface area, Building A comprised around
                    63.7% of the total surface area originally painted
                        (<em>ie</em>, 176,882
                        ÷ 277,765 x 100%), all things else
                    being equal, I would apportion the time taken to repaint
                    Building A (subject to adjustments below) to be around
                    4.78 months (<em>ie</em>, 63.7% x
                    7.5= 4.78 months).</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The bulk of the
                    plaintiff’s damage claim is for $631,685.09 allegedly
                    being the cost of paying its workers to carry out its
                    repainting works. To support its claim, the plaintiff
                    produced monthly payslips acknowledged by its workers. Based
                    on the payslips, the plaintiff allegedly took
                    16,142 man days, or 16 months, to repaint the
                    affected area.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     As the plaintiff had
                    already sub-contracted the repainting works of
                    Building B to Swiss Plan, the plaintiff is only
                    entitled to recover the workers’ salary for repainting

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The additional time required for
                repainting</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     However, I was mindful
                    that the plaintiff had submitted that extra time was
                    required in repainting given the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     An extra 15%
                        time to account for the difficulty of re-painting around
                        windows and fixtures that had to be
                    protected;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     An extra 50% to account for the 50%
                        less manpower that the Plaintiffs deployed (due to the
                        necessity of continuing with the on-going contract
                        works);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a>(c)     An extra 10% to account for the
                        Plaintiffs not using scissors lifts when they had the
                        use of them during the original painting works;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_d"></a>(d)     An extra 10% for the sanding off of
                        the discoloured paint before re-painting works could
                        start.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The defendant disputes
                    item (a) in quantum but not in principle. The difference in
                    the position taken by the respective parties lies in the
                    fact that the defendant’s expert allowed for a 10%
                    increase in time “in view of the difficulties
                    encountered during repainting works due to the installed
                    mechanical and electrical services”, whereas the
                    plaintiff’s expert found that 20% would be a more
                    realistic cost “resulting from difficulties
                    encountered due to the need to cut-in around installed
                    mechanical and electrical services, and the protection to
                    windows”. In its closing submissions, the plaintiff
                    adopted the middle ground of 15% in its computations. The
                    figure of 15% appears to have been accepted as a reasonable
                    one by the defendant’s expert in cross-examination.
                    Taking all the above into account, I accept that the figure
                    of 15% is not unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     With respect to
                    item (b), I note the plaintiff’s expert
                    witness’s evidence that the plaintiff had deployed an
                    average of 19.89 workers per month during the original
                    painting works, and 23 workers per month during the
                    repainting works. Given that more workers were used on
                    average during the repainting works than the original
                    painting works, I had difficulty accepting that the time for
                    repainting would have been extended at all due to shortage
                    of labour, let alone by such a wide margin as 50%. This is
                    especially since the repainting work for Building B had
                    been outsourced to Swiss Plan which had completed all of its
                    sub-contracted works by February 2009. The plaintiff’s
                    workers only had to repaint 6 storeys of Building A.
                    Based on the foregoing, I would reject the plaintiffs uplift
                    based on item (b).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     As for Item (c), the
                    plaintiff is claiming that it took extra time for repainting
                    due to the lack of a scissors lift, which it used during the
                    original works. However, the plaintiff additionally claims
                    $81,579.95 for the “Rental of Portable Scaffolding,
                    Scissors Lift and Boom Lift” for the entire period of
                    repainting as evidenced by an invoice for the period June
                    2008 to September 2009 for “scaffolding, scissor lift
                    and boomlift”. As I have allowed some claim for extra
                    time on Item (a) and (d), I would make no double counting
                    arising from the alleged non-use of the scissors lift in the
                    repainting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     As for Item (d), the
                    plaintiff has led evidence to show that sanding off was an
                    additional step required before repainting could take place
                    given that no sealer coat was applied. Although the
                    defendant challenged whether the plaintiff did or needed to
                    sand off the entire painted surface, <em>ie</em>, specifically the internal surfaces to be
                    repainted, no alternative reasonable figure was proposed and
                    given that in cross-examination, the defendant’s
                    witness Chin Cheong appeared to have accepted the
                    sanding-off in principle, I find that the figure of 10%
                    submitted by the plaintiff is not
                unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In the premises, I find
                    that the plaintiff’s claim of 16 months for
                    repainting was inflated. The claim should be reduced to a
                    figure of approximately 6.05 months, arising from the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>4.78 months x 115% x 110% = 6.05
                        months.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The plaintiff is therefore
                    only entitled to recover $238,855.93 for the salary costs of
                    its workers’ deployed to repaint Building A
                        (<em>ie</em>, 6.05
                        ÷ 16 x $631,685.09 =
                    $238,855.92).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Dinner for workers</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The defendant challenges
                    the sum claimed under this head (<em>ie</em>, $34,668.00) on largely the same basis as
                    it challenges the amount claimed for worker’s salary.
                    Given my adopting of a 6.05 months proxy for the
                    completion of repainting the 6 storeys of Block A, and
                    not the 16 months claimed, I accordingly reduce the sum
                    claimed proportionately to $13,108.84 , <em>ie</em>, $34,668.00 x (6.05 ÷
                    16) = $13,108.84.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Foreign Worker Levy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Like the other heads of
                    claim, the sum of $63,115 should be reduced proportionately
                    to $23,865.36 following the application of the
                    6.05 months proxy for completion of repainting of
                    Building A, <em>ie</em>, $63,115 x
                    (6.05 ÷ 16) = $23,865.36.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Consumable tools</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The plaintiff claims
                    $11,428.35 as the costs incurred to purchase consumable
                    tools to carry out the repainting works. It has produced
                    receipts to prove that these costs were incurred. The
                    defendant do not dispute that these tools were purchased. In
                    similar vein to Item 3, however, it does challenge
                    whether these tools were purchased <em>for
                        the purpose of the repainting works</em>. Its case
                    is that unless the plaintiff discharges its burden of
                    showing that these tools were purchased for the purpose of
                    the repainting, I should only grant nominal damages. It is
                    more likely than not that in the course of the repainting,
                    consumable tools such as turpentine and brushes would be
                    required. The plaintiff’s has produced evidence of
                    these tools and affirmed that these tools were purchased and
                    used in the repainting works. There is no reason to
                    disbelieve the plaintiff. Absent evidence to the contrary,
                    the plaintiff has proven its claim under this
                head.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Upkeep for Vehicle GQ 895L</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In this item, the

                    upkeep for Vehicle GQ 895L (“the

                    repainting works. The defendant objects to the
                    plaintiff’s claim under this head on a number of
                    grounds. First, it repeats its point that the plaintiff
                    should not be awarded damages unless it can show that a
                    particular item was used solely for the purpose of the
                    repainting works and no other. Second, it cites the
                    plaintiff’s expert’s belief that a reasonable
                    deduction should be made to account for the “higher
                    running costs” of using an older vehicle as compared
                    to a brand new one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     As to the first objection,
                    the plaintiff has produced receipts verifying that it has
                    spent $11,613.78 on petrol, parking and servicing in
                    relation to the Vehicle. Its factual witness testified that
                    these sums were expended in relation to the repainting
                    works. I accept that testimony. The defendant has not
                    adduced any evidence to show that the Vehicle was used for
                    other purposes. It has not adduced any evidence to show that
                    the expenses were incurred in relation to a different
                    vehicle. I see no basis for finding that the expenses or the
                    Vehicle were used for purposes other than the repainting
                    works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     As for the second
                    objection, the defendant is entitled to claim damages for
                    expenses reasonably incurred. I do not think it unreasonable
                    that it should use its existing company vehicle for the
                    purpose of the repainting works. It was not obliged to
                    obtain a new vehicle for the purpose. The defendant has also
                    not quantified how the discount should be
                applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     What is relevant, however,
                    is the fact that the sum claimed under this head was
                    incurred over a period of 16 months which should be adjusted
                    to 6.05 months proxy. As such, the plaintiff is
                    awarded:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>$11,613.78 x (6.05 ÷
                        16) = $4,391.46</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Accommodation for workers by AC Creative Pte Ltd
                and Cheer Keong Contractor &amp; Construction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The plaintiff claims
                    $29,393.20 for accommodation of the workers utilised for
                    repainting works who could not stay on the site of the
                    building project after February 2009 when the
                    Building A units were handed back to the main
                    contractor. As such, the plaintiff claims that alternative
                    accommodation had to be secured for them with
                    AC Creative Pte Ltd and Cheer Keong Contractor
                    &amp; Construction for period March to September
                    2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The defendant is not
                    challenging the fact that the site was handed back in
                    February 2009. However, it raises the same objections
                    – first, that the plaintiff has premised its claim on
                    more man days than actually expended, and second, that the
                    plaintiff has not proven its case that all the workers
                    living in the alternative accommodation were used solely for
                    the purpose of the repainting works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The first objection is
                    valid in light of my allocation of 6.05 months to
                    repaint 6 storeys of Building A. It is in evidence
                    that Building A was handed back to the main contractor
                    in February 2009. Whilst only the corridors and external
                    areas of Building A remained to be repainted, the
                    plaintiff has produced no evidence to establish the number
                    of workers that he utilised for this remaining area and the
                    duration of their work and accommodation costs. Accordingly
                    the plaintiff has not established this head of
                claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Administrative charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The plaintiff claims
                    $16,000 as administrative charges for the additional time
                    spent by the managing director of the plaintiff and his
                    clerical staff in the administration of the additional work
                    incurred when repainting became necessary. The plaintiff
                    submits that $1,000 per month is not unjustified as a
                    measure of value of this work. It is clear that additional
                    management time would have had to be deployed for the
                    repainting works. I would accordingly award $6,050
                        (<em>ie</em>, 6.05 x 1,000) to the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Rental of Portable Scaffolding, Scissors Lift and
                Boom Lift</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The plaintiff has adduced
                    an invoice from Hup Seng Aluminium Construction Pte Ltd
                    which shows that the Portable Scaffolding, Scissors Lift and
                    Boom Lift were leased to the plaintiff from 1 June 2008
                    to 30 September 2009 (16 months) for
                    $81,579.95.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Given my allocation of
                    6.05 months, I would allow the rental costs for this
                    duration. This amounts to $30,847.42 (<em>ie</em>, $81,579.95 x 6.05 ÷
                    16).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Paint Investigation by Setsco Services Pte
                Ltd</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The plaintiff originally
                    made a claim of $10,700 as the costs of engaging Setsco
                    Services Pte Ltd to prepare a report on the paint supplied
                    by the defendant. It has since withdrawn its claim for this
                    item, and rightly so, as this should be considered at the
                    taxation stage and not the assessment of damages stage. An
                    expert report obtained in view of a dispute that has arisen
                    is a matter for taxation and not assessment of
                    damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Repainting work for project at No. 2 Toh Tuck
                Link</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The plaintiff did not
                    proceed with its claim under this head at trial. In its
                    closing submissions, it confirmed that it was not making a
                    claim for this item.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">GST</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The plaintiff claims 7%
                    GST of all the Items 1-12 in the table above at
                        <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>. The defendant
                    has disputed the plaintiff’s entitlement to this. It
                    is surprising, however, that the plaintiff’s closing
                    submissions and reply submissions do not address this claim
                    at all. That the plaintiff may have paid GST on some but not
                    all of the items is clear.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The plaintiff has failed
                    to show that GST was paid or payable on several of the
                    items, <em>eg</em>, workers’
                    salary and dinner, consumable tools, vehicle upkeep,
                    administrative charge, foreign worker levies. Whilst other
                    invoices like the paint and subcontractor invoice did
                    include GST, the plaintiff in issuing its own invoices for
                    this work to the owner/main contractor would be able to
                    recover GST thereby, it bearing only the differential burden
                    of value added. It has provided no evidence of this amount.
                    Accordingly I would disallow this claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Set-off for Defendants’ invoice for paint

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Parties are agreed that

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In the light of my

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In the light of my
