        Chan Sek Keong CJ (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal by the appellant, the Management Corporation Strata Title
                    Plan No 301 of Grange Heights (“the MC”), against the
                    decision of the High Court judge (“the Judge”) in Originating
                    Summons No 875 of 2009 (“the Present Action”) dismissing the
                    MC’s application for a declaration that the Court of Appeal (“the
                    CA”) has statutory and/or inherent jurisdiction to reopen and set aside
                    an earlier decision which it made and reconstitute itself to rehear the matters
                    dealt with in that decision (see <em>Management Corporation
                        Strata Title Plan No 301 v Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2010] 1 SLR 645 (“the First Instance
                    Judgment”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Present Action is yet another court proceeding between the MC and the
                    respondent, Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd (“Lee Tat”), after more
                    than 35 years of litigation between these parties and their respective
                    predecessors in title. The parties’ dispute centres on whether the
                    residents of and visitors to Grange Heights (collectively referred to hereafter
                    as “the Residents”) are entitled to use a right of way over
                    Lot 111-31 of Town Sub-Division 21 (“the Servient Land”)
                    for access between Grange Road and the land upon which Grange Heights sits,
                        <em>viz</em>, Lot 687 of Town Sub-Division 21
                    (“the Grange Heights site”), which is an amalgamation of
                    Lot 111-34 of Town Sub-Division 21 (“Lot 111-34”)
                    and Lot 561 of Town Sub-Division 21 (“Lot 561”).
                    For ease of discussion, in this judgment, we shall continue to refer to
                    Lot 111-34 and Lot 561 by their respective lot numbers even though
                    they no longer exist as two separate and distinct lots.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The last decision in this marathon saga of litigation was the decision of this
                    court (“the 2008 CA”) in <em>Lee Tat Development
                        Pte Ltd v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 301</em>
                    [2009] 1 SLR(R) 875 (“<em>GH
                        (No 8)</em>”), where the court decided to re-examine the
                    core dispute between the parties with regard to the said right of way over the
                    Servient Land (“the Right of Way”) and determine the status of the
                    easement in order to bring finality to the dispute once and for all. After a
                    comprehensive and intensive examination of the factual matrices of and the legal
                    issues decided in the previous proceedings, the 2008 CA concluded as follows
                    (see <em>GH (No 8)</em> at
                    sub-paras (e)–(f) of [111]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     by reason of the principle established in <em>Harris v
                            Flower</em> (1904) 74 LJ Ch 127 (“the <em>Harris v Flower</em> principle”), which entails
                        that a right of way granted over a servient tenement for the benefit of a
                        dominant tenement cannot be used for the benefit of a non-dominant tenement,
                        the Residents could not use the Right of Way for access between Grange Road
                        and Lot 561 as the grant of the Right of Way made in 1919 by the
                        original owner of the Servient Land (“the 1919 Grant”) had
                        covered (<em>inter alia</em>) Lot 111-34, but not
                        Lot 561; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Residents also could not use the Right of Way for access between
                        Grange Road and Lot 111-34 (even though, as just mentioned, the 1919
                        Grant had extended to that lot) as the Right of Way had been extinguished by
                        operation of law where that lot was concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       As events have turned out, the 2008 CA’s judgment has not in fact
                    achieved the objective of bringing finality to the parties’ dispute over
                    the Right of Way as the MC has once again commenced proceedings, this time, by
                    applying in Summons No 3446 of 2009 (“SUM 3446/2009”) to
                    set aside the 2008 CA’s judgment on the ground that it was reached in
                    breach of natural justice. Specifically, the MC alleges that it was not heard on
                    “the basis upon which [the 2008 CA] ultimately based its
                        decision”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The orders sought by the MC in SUM 3446/2009 are the

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background to the Present Action</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       To explain how the filing of SUM 3446/2009 led to the Present Action, it
                    is necessary for us to set out briefly the history of the litigation between the
                    parties and their respective predecessors in title over the Right of Way (for
                    the full background, see <em>GH (No 8)</em> at
                    [2]–[67]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plots of land relevant to the Right of Way</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Servient Land, along with Lot 111-30 of Town Sub-Division 21,
                    Lot 111-32 of Town Sub-Division 21 (“Lot 111-32”),
                    Lot 111-33 of Town Sub-Division 21 (“Lot 111-33”)
                    and Lot 111-34 (collectively, “the Dominant Lands”),
                    originally belonged to a company called Mutual Trading Ltd
                    (“MTL”). In 1919, when MTL was in liquidation, it sold the
                    Dominant Lands to various parties whilst retaining ownership of the Servient
                    Land. To provide access from the Dominant Lands to Grange Road and <em>vice versa</em>, MTL made the 1919 Grant conferring the
                    benefit of the Right of Way on each of the purchasers of the Dominant Lands in
                    the following terms:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">And together with full and free right and liberty for the Purchaser his
                        executors administrators and assigns being the owner or owners for the time
                        being of the land hereby conveyed or any part thereof and their tenants and
                        servants and all other persons authorised by him or them in common with
                        others having a similar right from time to time and at all times hereafter
                        at his and their will and pleasure to pass and repass with or without
                        animals and vehicles, in along and over the [Servient Land].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The MC’s predecessor in title, Hong Leong Holdings Ltd
                    (“HLH”), became the owner of Lot 111-34 in 1970, and Collin
                    Development Pte Ltd (“Collin”), which was subsequently renamed Lee
                    Tat (<em>ie</em>, the respondent), became the owner of
                    Lot 111-32 and Lot 111-33 in 1973. When HLH acquired Lot 111-34
                    in 1970, it also acquired the adjacent lot, Lot 561, which (with a land
                    area of 9,631.6m<sup>2</sup>) was more than three times the size
                    of Lot 111-34 (which had a land area of
                        3,066.1m<sup>2</sup>). Subsequently, HLH amalgamated the two
                    lots to form the Grange Heights site in order to develop Grange Heights. Unlike
                    Lot 111-34 (which has access to Grange Road), Lot 561 has no access to
                    Grange Road, but it fronts two other public roads, namely, River Valley Grove
                    (which leads to River Valley Road) and St Thomas Walk (which leads to River
                    Valley Road as well as Killiney Road).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       It would appear that when HLH bought Lot 561 to amalgamate it with
                    Lot 111-34 for residential development, it decided that the development
                    should have an address and a name associated with Grange Road rather than with
                    either Killiney Road or River Valley Road. In the Present Action, the MC has
                    candidly admitted that its principal objective in SUM 3446/2009 is to have
                    the 2008 CA’s judgment set aside, with a view to restoring the status quo
                        <em>ante</em> in respect of the Right of Way (<em>ie</em>, the status quo prior to the 2008 CA’s
                    decision, with the Residents having the right to use the Right of Way for at
                    least pedestrian traffic, if not for vehicular traffic as well, between Grange
                    Road and the Grange Heights site). This is not so much to enable the Residents
                    to actually use the Right of Way for pedestrian and/or vehicular traffic between
                    Grange Road and the Grange Heights site, but, rather, to maintain the current
                    address and/or the current name of Grange Heights. It appears that the
                    MC’s concern is that if the Right of Way cannot in law be used for the
                    benefit of the Grange Heights site, Grange Heights might not be able to retain
                    its current address and/or its current name, and that would depreciate the
                    market value of the residential units in Grange Heights by about 20%. To put
                    this argument in its proper perspective, it is necessary to point out that when
                    the Official Receiver put up the Servient Land for sale in late 1996, it invited
                    both the MC and Lee Tat to tender for the land. The MC did not submit any bid,
                    and Lee Tat eventually purchased the Servient Land from the Official Receiver on
                    27 January 1997 at the price of $3.02m.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The development of Grange Heights</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       When HLH drew up its plans to develop Grange Heights in 1970, it submitted a
                    proposed layout plan which included a road over the Servient Land as a means of
                    access between Grange Road and the development. That appears to have been an
                    attempt by HLH to secure a permanent right to use the Right of Way to cross from
                    Grange Road to Lot 111-34 and thence to Lot 561, and <em>vice versa</em>. The proposed layout plan was rejected by the
                    planning authorities on the ground that HLH did not own the Servient Land. The
                    layout plan that was eventually approved excluded the proposed road over the
                    Servient Land from the development.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Grange Heights was completed in 1976. It comprises, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, 120 residential apartments, a car park for 188 cars and a
                    swimming pool, all situated on Lot 561, as well as two tennis courts and
                    changing rooms, which are situated on Lot 111-34. As noted by the 2008 CA
                    in <em>GH (No 8)</em> at [91], the Residents have been
                    using St Thomas Walk for both vehicular and pedestrian traffic to and from
                    the Grange Heights site ever since Grange Heights was completed. In contrast,
                    during the same period, the Residents:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     did not use the Right of Way for vehicular traffic between Grange Road and
                        the Grange Heights site in any meaningful way (although this is disputed by
                        Mr Steinbock); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     used the Right of Way for pedestrian traffic so infrequently that it fell
                        into disrepair, which led the MC to commence proceedings in 2004 (via
                        Originating Summons No 706 of 2004 (“OS 706/2004”))
                        for a declaration that it was entitled <em>vis-à-vis</em> Lee Tat to repair and/or maintain the Right of Way
                        for pedestrian and/or vehicular use.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The first action</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The first action in this long-running saga of litigation (“the First
                    Action”) was commenced in 1974 when Grange Heights was still under
                    construction. Collin objected to the use of the Right of Way by HLH and its
                    contractors for access to the building site on Lot 561, contending (based
                    on the <em>Harris v Flower</em> principle) that such use
                    was excessive and interfered with its (Collin’s) enjoyment of the Right of
                    Way. Collin sought a declaration that HLH and its contractors were not entitled
                    to use the Right of Way in the aforesaid manner, as well as an injunction
                    restraining HLH and its contractors from using the Right of Way in that
                    manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     HLH’s defence was that Collin, being a dominant owner, could not invoke
                    the <em>Harris v Flower</em> principle to restrict the
                    enjoyment of the Right of Way by another dominant owner; only the owner of the
                    Servient Land (“the Servient Owner”) had the <em>locus standi</em> to do so. It was argued that Collin, as a dominant
                    owner, had no cause of action against HLH unless Collin could prove that the use
                    of the Right of Way by HLH and its contractors had caused substantial
                    interference with its (<em>ie</em>, Collin’s)
                    enjoyment of the easement. HLH also counterclaimed for (in essence) a
                    declaration that it was entitled to use (as well as to authorise other persons
                    to use) the Right of Way for access to Lot 111-34 “<em>or elsewhere</em>” [emphasis added] (see <em>Collin Development (Pte) Ltd v Hong Leong Holdings Ltd</em>
                    [1974–1976] SLR(R) 618 (“<em>GH
                        (No 1)</em>”) at [8]) –
                    <em>ie</em>, including Lot 561 – so long as such
                    use did not substantially affect Collin’s enjoyment of the Right of
                    Way.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     At first instance, F A Chua J upheld (in <em>GH
                        (No 1)</em>) HLH’s defence as outlined in the preceding
                    paragraph. He found that there was no evidence of substantial interference with
                    Collin’s enjoyment of the Right of Way by HLH and its contractors, and
                    thus dismissed Collin’s claim. He also dismissed HLH’s counterclaim
                    for the declaration mentioned at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above
                    on the ground that the declaration could only be obtained against the Servient
                    Owner, which was not Collin at that time. Only Collin appealed against
                    Chua J’s decision; that appeal was unsuccessful (see <em>Collin Development (Pte) Ltd v Hong Leong Holdings Ltd</em>
                    [1974–1976] SLR(R) 806).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Two points may be noted about the First Action. First, HLH’s
                    counterclaim was the second failed attempt by HLH to secure a permanent right to
                    use the Right of Way for access from Grange Road to Lot 111-34 and thence
                    to Lot 561, and <em>vice versa</em> (as regards
                    HLH’s first failed attempt, see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>
                    above). These two attempts show that HLH was aware that the Right of Way could
                    not be used for the benefit of Lot 561. Second, because Collin was not the
                    Servient Owner at the time of the First Action, what we shall hereafter call
                    “the <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue” –
                    <em>ie</em>, the issue of whether HLH (and subsequently,
                    its successor in title, the MC) was entitled <em>as against the
                        Servient Owner</em> to use the Right of Way for access between Grange
                    Road and Lot 561 – was <em>not</em> decided in
                    the First Action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The second action</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The second action between the parties (“the Second Action”) was
                    commenced in 1989 when Lee Tat (as Collin was by then known) tried to close off
                    the Right of Way by erecting a gate and a fence on the Servient Land. The MC
                    obtained an interim injunction to restrain Lee Tat from interfering with the
                    Residents’ use of the Right of Way (see <em>Management
                        Corporation Strata Title Plan No 301 v Lee Tat Development Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1990] 2 SLR(R) 634 (“<em>GH
                        (No 3)</em>”) at [6]). Lee Tat applied to discharge the
                    interim injunction, contending that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Residents could no longer use the Right of Way for the benefit of
                        Lot 111-34 (even though that lot was one of the Dominant Lands) as that
                        lot ceased to exist when it was amalgamated with Lot 561 to form the
                        Grange Heights site, with the result that the Right of Way was extinguished
                            <em>vis-à-vis</em> that lot (<em>ie</em>, Lot 111-34); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Residents were not entitled to use the Right of Way for the benefit of
                        Lot 561 as that lot was not one of the Dominant Lands (in this regard,
                        Lee Tat invoked the <em>Harris v Flower</em> principle
                        just as Collin had done in the First Action).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In the High Court, P Coomaraswamy J dismissed Lee Tat’s
                    application and granted the MC a permanent injunction on the grounds that (see
                        <em>GH (No 3)</em> at [8]–[11]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     the amalgamation of Lot 111-34 with Lot 561 had not destroyed
                        the Right of Way <em>vis-à-vis</em> Lot 111-34 as
                        that plot of land continued to exist; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     Lee Tat had admitted that the Residents had not substantially interfered
                        with its enjoyment of the Right of Way.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Lee Tat’s appeal against Coomaraswamy J’s decision
                    (“the 1992 appeal”) was dismissed by the CA (“the 1992
                    CA”). In finding for the MC, the 1992 CA said (see <em>Lee
                        Tat Development Pte Ltd v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan
                        No 301</em> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 1 (“<em>GH (No 4)</em>”)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20    [Lee Tat] ... as [the owner] of [Lot] 111-32 and
                            [Lot] 111-33 [is] only entitled to protection of [its] right of way
                            over [the Servient Land] if [its] enjoyment of that right is
                            substantially interfered with by the [MC]. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23    The [R]esidents ... have not subjected [the Servient Land] to such
                            heavy vehicular traffic as to substantially interfere with the right of
                            way of [Lee Tat]. <em>In fact, they do not use it for
                                vehicular traffic at all but only as a footpath</em>.
                            ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    Therefore, there is still no likelihood of such excessive user as to

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Three points may be noted about the Second Action. First, the MC based its
                    case before the 1992 CA on the premise that the Residents had used the Right of
                    Way only as a footpath and not for vehicular traffic. This premise was also the
                    causative basis of the 1992 CA’s decision in the 1992 appeal. Second, the
                    MC argued (just as HLH had done <em>vis-à-vis</em> Collin
                    in the First Action) that Lee Tat could not rely on the <em>Harris v Flower</em> principle because Lee Tat was not the Servient
                    Owner. It follows from this argument that if Lee Tat were to acquire the title
                    to the Servient Land, the MC would be estopped from arguing that Lee Tat, in its
                    capacity as the Servient Owner, could not invoke the <em>Harris v
                        Flower</em> principle. But, as we shall see (at, <em>inter alia</em>, <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> below),
                    even after Lee Tat became the Servient Owner, the MC continued to argue that Lee
                    Tat could not rely on the <em>Harris v Flower</em>
                    principle. Third, both the MC and Lee Tat litigated the Second Action as
                    dominant owners with the same right to enjoy the Right of Way (the rights of HLH
                    and Collin <em>inter se</em> as dominant owners were also
                    the very basis of the High Court’s and the CA’s decisions in the
                    First Action (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above)). This meant
                    that the <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue, which concerned
                    the rights of the <em>Servient Owner</em>, was <em>not</em> decided in the Second Action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The third and fourth actions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In the third action between the parties (“the Third Action”),
                    the MC, via OS 706/2004, sought a declaration that it was entitled as
                    against Lee Tat to repair and/or maintain the Right of Way for pedestrian and/or
                    vehicular use. Lee Tat was by then the Servient Owner, having acquired the title
                    to the Servient Land from the Official Receiver in January 1997 (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above). Lee Tat responded to the Third Action
                    by filing a separate action against the MC (“the Fourth Action”)
                    for the following reliefs:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>

                            in the conferment of any easement rights to Lot 561 and/or [the
                            Grange Heights site] being land other than the dominant tenement
                            (Lot 111-34);</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    a declaration that the [R]ight of [W]ay over [the Servient Land] shall

                            Grange Heights from Grange Road and vice versa absolutely and

                            [the Servient Land] to access Grange Heights from Grange Road absolutely
                            and indefinitely …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In view of the reliefs sought by Lee Tat in the Fourth Action, the High Court,
                    with the consent of the parties, heard that action first. This resulted in the
                    Fourth Action being decided before the Third Action even though it was commenced
                    later.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Fourth Action</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     It can be seen from the reliefs sought in the Fourth Action that Lee Tat was
                    once again invoking the <em>Harris v Flower</em> principle
                    to prevent the Residents from using the Right of Way for the benefit of
                    Lot 561, but, this time, in a different capacity as the Servient Owner.
                    Contrary to its previous position in the Second Action (where it had, in effect,
                    argued that Lee Tat, not being the Servient Owner, could not raise the <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue), the MC contended before the High
                    Court in the Fourth Action that the <em>Harris v
                        Flower</em> issue had already been decided against Collin/Lee Tat in
                    the First Action and the Second Action, and was therefore <em>res
                        judicata</em>. Lee Tat argued to the contrary – namely, no
                    estoppel, whether in the form of cause of action estoppel or issue estoppel,
                    applied to the <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue because,
                    given that the issue could only be decided in relation to the Servient Owner and
                    given that Collin/Lee Tat did not own the Servient Land at the time of the First
                    Action and the Second Action, the issue was not decided in either of those
                    actions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The High Court <em>did not</em> accept the MC’s
                    submission that the <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue had been
                    decided in the <em>First</em> Action (see <em>Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd v Management Corporation Strata Title
                        Plan No 301</em> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 828 (“<em>GH (No 5)</em>”) at [24]–[27]), but it
                        <em>did</em> agree with the MC that the issue had been
                    decided by the 1992 CA in the 1992 appeal (see <em>GH
                        (No 5)</em> at [30]–[37]). The High Court thus ruled on the
                    Fourth Action in the MC’s favour. On appeal by Lee Tat, the CA
                    (“the 2005 CA”), by a majority (Chao Hick Tin JA dissenting),
                    upheld the High Court’s decision that Lee Tat was estopped by <em>res judicata</em> from raising the <em>Harris
                        v Flower</em> issue as the issue had already been decided by the 1992
                    CA (see <em>Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd v Management Corporation
                        of Strata Title Plan No 301</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 157
                        (“<em>GH (No 6)</em>”) at
                    [14]–[26]). It is important to note that the 2005 CA did not determine the
                        <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue on the merits; instead,
                    it merely ruled on whether that issue had been decided in the Second Action,
                    with the majority of the 2005 CA (“the Majority Judges”) ruling in
                    the affirmative and Chao JA, in the negative.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Third Action</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Following the outcome of Lee Tat’s appeal in the Fourth Action
                    (“the 2005 appeal”), the High Court understandably held in the
                    Third Action that the MC was entitled as against Lee Tat to repair and/or
                    maintain the Right of Way for pedestrian and/or vehicular use, and granted the
                    MC a declaration to that effect (see <em>Management Corporation
                        Strata Title Plan No 301 v Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2007] 2 SLR(R) 554 (“<em>GH
                        (No 7)</em>”)). Lee Tat appealed against the High
                    Court’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The 2008 CA reserved judgment at the conclusion of the hearing of Lee
                    Tat’s appeal (“the 2008 appeal”), and subsequently directed
                    the parties to make submissions on two questions. The first question
                    (“the First Further Question”), which consisted of two limbs, was
                    as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The events leading to the Present Action</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Approximately seven months after the 2008 CA delivered its judgment, the MC
                    filed SUM 3446/2009. The application was premised on the assumption that
                    the 2008 CA was not <em>functus officio</em> –
                    <em>ie</em>, on the assumption that the CA had statutory
                    jurisdiction under s 29A of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act
                    (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“the SCJA”) and/or inherent
                    jurisdiction to reopen and set aside its decision in an earlier case despite
                    having already disposed of that case. In view of the jurisdictional assumption
                    underlying SUM 3446/2009, the Registrar of the Supreme Court (“the
                    Registrar”) directed the MC to file a fresh action for that
                    jurisdictional point to be decided as a preliminary issue by the High Court.
                    This led the MC to commence the Present Action for the following
                        declarations:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    A declaration that pursuant to section 29A of the [SCJA] and/or
                            the inherent jurisdiction of the courts, the [CA], as the court of last
                            resort in the Republic of Singapore, has the jurisdiction and power to
                            reopen and set aside an earlier decision of its own and to reconstitute
                            itself to rehear and/or reconsider the matters arising therefrom;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    Consequently, a declaration that the [CA] does therefore have the

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The MC’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In the court below, the MC’s case proceeded on the basis that the
                    Present Action concerned “only one legal question”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> namely:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[W]hether, <em>on the assumption</em> that its
                        decision was arrived at in breach of natural justice, [the CA] has the

                        nation’s court of last resort. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The MC’s submission on this legal question was that the CA had both
                    statutory and inherent jurisdiction to reopen and set aside a decision which it
                    had made in breach of natural justice, and, thus, the declarations sought in the
                    Present Action ought to be granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Apropos the CA’s <em>inherent</em> jurisdiction,
                    the MC submitted that it was “an independent and unwritten basis of
                    jurisdiction, quite apart from statute or the Rules of
                        Court”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> In the MC’s view, the CA necessarily had inherent jurisdiction
                    to reopen and set aside a decision which it had made in breach of natural
                    justice because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_a"></a>(a)     there was a particular need for the apex court of any nation to have the

                    and also the views of Prof Jeffrey Pinsler in “Inherent Jurisdiction

                    (“Prof Pinsler’s article”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The MC further submitted that there could be few situations more deserving of
                    the exercise by the CA of its inherent jurisdiction to reopen and set aside its
                    own decisions than a situation where the previous decision in question was
                    rendered in breach of natural justice. This was because natural justice
                    possessed a fundamental quality of the highest order, in that the twin pillars
                    of natural justice and the overarching requirement of procedural fairness were
                    fundamental to any modern concept of a fair hearing (citing Gerry Maher,
                    “Natural Justice as Fairness” in <em>The Legal
                        Mind: Essays for Tony Honoré</em> (Neil MacCormick &amp; Peter Birks
                    eds) (Clarendon Press, 1986) ch 6 at p 107). In this connection, it
                    may be recalled that the twin pillars of natural justice are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_a"></a>(a)     the rule that no one may act as a judge in his own cause (“the bias
                        rule”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_b"></a>(b)     the rule that no person should be condemned without his having been heard
                        and/or without his having been given prior notice of the allegations against
                        him (“the hearing rule”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     With regard to the <em>statutory</em> jurisdiction of the
                    CA to reopen and set aside a decision which it had made in breach of natural
                    justice, the MC submitted that the CA’s decision in <em>Koh
                        Zhan Quan Tony v Public Prosecutor and another motion</em> [2006]
                    2 SLR(R) 830 (“<em>Tony Koh</em>”)
                    showed that the CA had such jurisdiction by virtue of s 29A of the SCJA. In
                    the MC’s view, that section gave the CA jurisdiction to “set aside
                    any judgment (including its own) in appropriate
                        circumstances”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> which would include jurisdiction to set aside any decision that the
                    CA had made in breach of natural justice. It was argued that the doctrine of
                        <em>functus officio</em>, which would preclude a court
                    from reopening its decision on a case once it had disposed of that case, did not
                    apply where the challenge to the CA’s previous decision was brought on the
                    basis of a procedural, as opposed to substantive, miscarriage of justice. In
                    this respect, the MC submitted that the relief which it sought apropos the 2008
                    CA’s judgment would not involve reopening the merits of that
                    judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The MC also emphasised “[t]he mission and spirit of s 29A(4) [of
                    the SCJA]”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> and submitted that “where a breach of the rules of natural
                    justice [was] alleged, the CA [was] not barred from, and indeed would, if
                    anything, be obliged to rectify the miscarriage of justice”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> In this connection, the MC contended that justice had not been done
                    in the 2008 appeal because it had been denied the right to be heard on the
                        <em>Arnold</em> exception, which, in its view, was
                    pivotal to the 2008 CA’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     With regard to <em>Arnold</em>, the MC contended that the
                    case did not stand as authority for an “egregious error” exception
                    to <em>res judicata</em> (even under English law); on the
                    contrary, the correctness of a decision in law was irrelevant to its finality as
                    between the parties concerned under the doctrine of <em>res
                        judicata</em>. It was argued that there were strong policy reasons for
                    not recognising an “egregious error” exception to <em>res judicata</em> in Singapore as such an exception would
                    undermine certainty and confidence in the legal system: nothing could be more
                    undesirable than to permit a litigant to re-litigate a decision made against it
                    by the CA, which decision had every appearance of finality, in the hope that a
                    differently constituted bench might be persuaded to take a view which its
                    predecessor had rejected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The MC submitted that the <em>Arnold</em> exception, far
                    from being an “egregious error” exception to <em>res judicata</em>, was instead a narrow exception that was applicable
                    only when there was “new material, whether new factual evidence or a
                    subsequent change in the law, such as to amount to ‘special
                    circumstances’ to avoid the usual doctrine of finality in
                        litigation”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> [emphasis in original omitted] in the larger interest of justice.
                    (As an aside, it may be noted that in the present appeal, the MC has gone
                    further to contend that “[t]he <em>Arnold</em>
                    exception cannot apply when the decision in question is that of an apex
                        court”.)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Lee Tat’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Lee Tat’s main submissions in the court below were that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     the CA’s jurisdiction and powers were determined by the SCJA;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     once the CA had given a decision on a case before it, it was <em>functus officio</em> in so far as that case was concerned
                        as it had no enabling jurisdiction under s 29A of the SCJA and/or no
                        inherent jurisdiction to reopen and set aside its earlier decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In support of these submissions, counsel referred to (<em>inter
                        alia</em>) the following authorities: <em>Blenwel
                        Agencies Pte Ltd v Tan Lee King</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 529,

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In Lee Tat’s view, s 29A of the SCJA did not confer on the CA
                        <em>statutory</em> jurisdiction to reopen and set aside
                    its earlier decisions as the section applied only to matters relating to appeals
                    from the High Court, and not to earlier decisions of the CA. Since the CA had no
                    statutory jurisdiction to reopen and set aside its earlier decisions, it did not
                    have <em>inherent</em> jurisdiction to do so either as such
                    alleged inherent jurisdiction would clearly fall outside the scope of the
                    CA’s statutory jurisdiction as set out by the express words of the SCJA.
                    In this regard, Lee Tat submitted that <em>Pinochet
                        (No 2)</em>, one of the authorities cited by the MC apropos the
                    CA’s inherent jurisdiction (see <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a>
                    above), was not relevant as it was a case involving apparent bias, which had not
                    been alleged by the MC in the Present Action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Lee Tat further contended that <em>Pinochet
                        (No 2)</em> (and also <em>Taylor</em>,
                    another case cited by the MC) did not support the proposition that a court was
                    obliged to ask all the parties to make submissions on matters which it had
                    independently identified before it could rule on those matters. In any case, Lee
                    Tat pointed out, the parties had in fact been invited by the 2008 CA, after the
                    hearing of the 2008 appeal, to make written submissions on <em>res judicata</em>, abuse of process and the extinguishment of a right
                    of way (see <em>GH (No 8)</em> at [17]). In the
                    circumstances, Lee Tat submitted, it was within the competence of the 2008 CA to
                    decide on the applicability of the <em>Arnold</em>
                    exception without requiring counsel to make any submissions on this
                    point.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Judge’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The Judge, in a reserved judgment (<em>viz</em>, the
                    First Instance Judgment), dismissed the Present Action. In order to preserve the
                    nuances in his judgment, we reproduce in full below the relevant passages of the
                    First Instance Judgment which set out his analysis of the doctrine of <em>res judicata</em> and the CA’s jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4    … [W]hat is the predominant rule? If there is finality
                                (<em>res judicata</em>) then there is no
                            question of achieving individual justice for the parties because the
                            finality principle outweighs the justice principle. If that were the
                            case, it does not matter [whether] the previous court had committed a
                            simple error or, as the 2008 [CA’s] judgment … and
                            Lord Keith in <em>Arnold</em> …
                            described it – an “egregious error”. The point is
                            not whether the [CA] may correct an egregious error but whether it can
                            correct an egregious error at all when the matter is <em>res judicata</em>. An outrageous or notorious (a dictionary
                            meaning of “egregious”) error ought to be corrected but
                            only when the court has the jurisdiction to do it. The doctrine of
                                <em>res judicata</em> serves to mark the point
                            of finality; and the point of finality in litigation is that one does
                            not envisage eventuality after finality. That would mean that after a
                            matter is <em>res judicata</em> any egregious
                            error, or, as alleged in this case, [any] decision made in breach of
                            natural justice must be left to lie in respect of the same matter
                            between the same parties. If challenges such as the present one …
                            by the [MC] were to go on, the correction of the breach of natural
                            justice might itself be challenged on the ground of the court having
                            made an egregious error or another breach of natural [justice] …
                            or [on] some other inventive ground importing similarly emotive, but
                            vague sentiments. It is an important aspect of the function of law to be
                            clear and not vague; to be precise and consistent so that it can be
                            understood and followed. Even if the 2008 [CA’s] judgment was
                            wrong because it was itself made in egregious error, the case had ended
                            with the final judgment of the final court of appeal; and I therefore
                            need only repeat what was cited above [from [72] of <em>GH (No 8)</em>] – “the public interest in
                            the finality of litigation (‘the finality principle’)
                            outweighs the public interest in achieving justice between the parties
                            (‘the justice principle’)”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6    …
                            <em>The [CA] is at full liberty to reverse its position
                                and depart from the law if it thinks that the law was made as a
                                result of an egregious (or any) error, but it can only do so in a
                                different case. Final must be final – not almost final or
                                conditionally final</em>. To see some small justice done in an
                            individual case may be at the cost of greater injustice unseen. The
                            notion of doing “justice” may itself be a moot [point] as
                            a result. … [T]he point I make here is that the overturning of a
                            case when the matter is <em>res judicata</em> may
                            not mean that justice was necessarily done. When two different coram of
                            the [CA] ha[ve] reached opposing conclusions, who is to say which was
                            right? And so, without finality, when would it end? In my view, if the
                            complaint concern[s] only an error made by the [CA], egregious or
                            otherwise[,] the matter ends there. Convening [the CA] to rule that the
                            2008 [CA’s] judgment was wrong … would be to compound an
                            error by repeating it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7    [The MC], however, was advocating a different point. [It] argued that
                            an error arising from a breach of natural justice transcend[ed] an
                            egregious error. It is an attractive idea, but is it tenable?
                            …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9    The inherent powers that [the MC] wants to urge the [CA] to exercise
                            [are] much wider, and [are] similar to that in <em>Taylor</em> and <em>Pinochet
                                (No 2)</em> where the respective courts held that even
                            after final judgment had been delivered the court had an inherent power
                            to reopen the case. These two cases were clearly decided on policy
                            grounds since the phrases “inherent power” and
                            “doing justice” have no clearly defined limits.
                            “Inherent power” should not be used as though it were the
                            joker in a pack of cards, possessed of no specific designation and used
                            only when one [does] not have the specific card required. The same might
                            be said of “doing justice” because one man’s justice
                            can be another man’s injustice. “Inherent power”
                            does not mean unlimited power, and if a substantive power to reopen a
                            case on [the] merits is to be given, it must come expressly from the
                            legislature. A court’s “inherent power” is a useful
                            residual power to overcome minor hitches or errors so as to give effect
                            to the main judgment. Although the two English authorities [<em>ie</em>, <em>Taylor</em> and
                                <em>Pinochet (No 2)</em>] support [the
                            MC’s] submission that the [CA] has the inherent power to correct a
                            procedural wrong, I hesitate to hold that the same policy grounds should
                            apply in our courts. First, the policy grounds in both <em>Taylor</em> and <em>Pinochet
                                (No 2)</em> were not seriously questioned in those cases
                            themselves. Whether it is policy or idiosyncrasy, a ruling will
                            transcend its origin and become law over time. Secondly, in <em>Pinochet (No 2)</em> the House of Lords was
                            moved by the apprehension that if the perception of apparent bias was
                            not corrected there would be a loss of public confidence in the
                            administration of justice. … Thus it seems to me that the ground
                            for invoking the inherent jurisdiction of the court to rehear a
                            substantive matter that [is] otherwise <em>res
                                judicata</em> [is] one founded on the overriding need to
                            uphold public confidence in the judiciary and the administration of
                            justice. If that [is] so, as I think it is, then we cannot ignore the
                            different grades of procedural wrongs. The apparent bias of the judge
                            seem[s] to be the only one. Both <em>Taylor</em>
                            and <em>Pinochet (No 2)</em> stand as direct
                            authority for the principle that the apparent bias of the judge may
                            justify the setting aside of a final judgment. There are different
                            grades of procedural wrongs. Not all of them would justify setting aside
                            a final judgment. The [MC]’s complaint before me on the improper
                            procedure ground was … different from that in <em>Taylor</em> and <em>Pinochet
                                (No 2)</em>. It was based on the complaint that the [MC]
                            was not given the chance to advance [its] argument on a point which [it]
                            now says was … crucial in the court’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11    [Lee Tat]’s answer to <em>Taylor</em> and
                                <em>Pinochet (No 2)</em> was based on the
                            argument that the [CA] was a statutory creation. It thus derives its
                            jurisdiction and power strictly from the enabling words of the statute
                            and no more. It is a strong argument. The relevant statutory provision
                            [is] s 29A of the [SCJA] … Lawyers often have difficulty
                            with the words “and subject to the provisions of this Act”
                            [in s 29A(4) of the SCJA]. Does it mean that the [CA] cannot
                            arrogate to itself “inherent powers” since strictly,
                            Parliament had not reserved that power which it could have done very
                            simply and in a single line? <em>Taylor</em> and
                                <em>Pinochet (No 2)</em> too, were decided
                            the way they were because there were no statutory provisions. I ha[ve]
                            already expressed my doubts as to the applicability of <em>Taylor</em> and <em>Pinochet
                                (No 2)</em>, but in any event, even if they represent an
                            exception, the exception occupies a very narrow space and would be
                            limited to the implicit power to set aside a final judgment and rehear
                            the case only on the ground that otherwise it would seriously diminish
                            public confidence in the integrity of the courts and the administration
                            of justice. It will not apply to a case such as this where the only
                            charge [is] that the judgment might well have been wrong on the merits,
                            whether because of an egregious error or [because of] the failure to
                            hear counsel’s arguments.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The Judge’s reasoning in the above quotation may be summarised as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_a"></a>(a)     The principle that there should be finality in litigation (“the
                        finality principle”) outweighed the principle that justice must be
                        achieved between the parties (“the justice principle”).
                        Therefore, there should be no exceptions to <em>res
                            judicata</em>, except in the case of a judgment tainted by
                        bias.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_b"></a>(b)     The 2008 CA was wrong to depart from the finality principle in the 2008
                        appeal. But, even though the 2008 CA’s decision was erroneous, the
                        finality principle mandated that the decision was binding on the High Court
                        and should not be departed from even by the CA itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_c"></a>(c)     It followed that the MC should not be granted the declarations sought in
                        the Present Action as the grant of those declarations would pave the way for
                        a fresh coram of the CA to be convened to set aside the 2008 CA’s
                        judgment, when that judgment was <em>res judicata</em>
                        as between the MC and Lee Tat. The Present Action must, therefore, be
                        dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The present appeal </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Prior to the hearing of the present appeal against the Judge’s decision,
                    this court informed counsel for the respective parties (via a letter from the
                    Registrar dated 5 April 2010) that they were expected to be familiar with
                    the entire history of the matter when they argued the appeal. In particular, the
                    MC’s counsel was instructed to address the CA on the arguments which the
                    MC claimed it had not been given an opportunity to make in the 2008
                    appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The MC’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The MC’s arguments before this court, as set out in the MC’s
                    written case dated 29 January 2010 filed for this appeal and the additional
                    submissions which the MC tendered to this court, may be summarised as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Judge was wrong to hold that the finality principle outweighed the
                        justice principle. Such an approach was inimical to the fundamental
                        constitutional role of the courts. It was also contrary to the decision of
                        this court in <em>Tony Koh</em>, and perhaps contrary
                        to even the 2008 CA’s decision and case law around the world.</p>

                        sufficient basis for the court to reopen and set aside a final judgment was
                        an unjustified restriction of the principle established in <em>Pinochet (No 2)</em> and <em>Taylor</em>, which was that any <em>unfair</em> process would justify the setting aside by an apex
                        court of its own judgment (citing <em>State Rail Authority of
                            New South Wales v Codelfa Construction Proprietary Limited</em>

                        MC’s view) showed that an apex court always had jurisdiction to
                        correct procedural errors because (<em>inter alia</em>)
                        every court had a duty to abide by the rules of natural justice).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The MC emphasised that the Judge’s decision was based on the erroneous
                    premise that the MC was challenging the 2008 CA’s decision on the merits
                    and was contending that the 2008 CA erred in applying the <em>Arnold</em> exception to the Majority Judges’ decision in the
                    2005 appeal – which was <em>not</em> in fact what the
                    MC was seeking to do. The MC submitted that it was seeking, instead, to set
                    aside the 2008 CA’s decision on the ground of breach of natural justice,
                    specifically, on the ground that the breach of the hearing rule in the 2008
                    appeal had resulted in manifest unfairness to the MC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In his written note dated 19 May 2010 and his oral submissions at the
                    hearing before us, counsel for the MC accepted that the 2008 CA was correct to
                    hold that the Majority Judges erred in deciding in the 2005 appeal that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_a"></a>(a)     the change in Lee Tat’s capacity from that of being solely a
                        dominant owner in the First Action and the Second Action to that of being
                        both a dominant owner as well as the Servient Owner in the Fourth Action did
                        not make a difference to Lee Tat’s rights in respect of the Right of
                        Way; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_b"></a>(b)     issue estoppel applied to bar Lee Tat from raising the <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue in the Fourth Action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This concession implies that the MC now accepts that the Majority
                    Judges’ decision in the 2005 appeal was wrong. At the same time, however,
                    the MC also contends that the 2008 CA’s decision (regardless of whether it
                    was right or wrong) should be set aside as having been made in breach of the
                    hearing rule in that the MC was not heard on the <em>Arnold</em> exception in the 2008 appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The MC’s counsel submitted that in the present appeal, the MC would only
                    be seeking to persuade this court to reopen the 2008 CA’s

                                that [the MC] would rely upon in the context of the <em>Arnold</em> exception (including the hardship it
                                would suffer in the reversal of the 2005 CA Decision [<em>ie</em>, the Majority Judges’ decision in
                                the 2005 appeal]),</p>

                    are essentially the same as the arguments advanced before but unaddressed by the
                    Judge (see <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a> above). The MC has also made
                    a further submission, <em>viz</em>, that the <em>Arnold</em> exception does not apply to the decisions of an
                    apex court (see, likewise, <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Leaving aside for the moment the MC’s argument that the <em>Arnold</em> exception does not apply to an apex court’s
                    decisions, “the ‘special circumstances’ that [the MC] would
                    rely upon in the context of the <em>Arnold</em>
                        exception”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> are as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    There was an expectation created from 1974 to 2004 on the basis of the
                            Court decisions in the First and Second Actions that the [R]ight of
                            [W]ay existed (<em>vis-à-vis</em> Lee Tat) for the
                            benefit of the amalgamated lot [<em>ie</em>, the
                            Grange Heights site].</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    The construction and design of [Grange Heights] – the
                                condominium (apart from having a Grange Road address and being named
                                after Grange Road) was built facing Grange Road with the kitchens
                                facing St Thomas Walk.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   The other entrances are not suitable for emergency vehicles such
                                as fire trucks to enter. Entering through St Thomas Walk would
                                require a fire truck to go against the flow of traffic because of
                                the low ceiling of the main lobby; similarly, entering through River
                                Valley Grove would be impossible because of the low carpark
                                ceiling.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iii)   In October 1996, the Official Receiver offered only Lee Tat and
                                [the MC] an option of bidding for the servient tenement [<em>ie</em>, the Servient Land]. Because the Official
                                Receiver made it clear to [the MC] that the servient tenement would
                                be sold subject to the [R]ight of [W]ay, it [<em>ie</em>, the MC] did not make efforts to bid
                                [for]/purchase it. Instead, Lee Tat bought it but subject to the
                                [R]ight of [W]ay. …</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(iv)   The purchase of the servient tenement by Lee Tat on
                                27 January 1997 was recorded in an Indenture of Conveyance,
                                which was registered on 29 January 1997. The Indenture of
                                Conveyance specifically refers to an Order of Court dated
                                30 December 1996 (registered on 19 January 1997), which
                                formally vested the servient tenement in the Official Receiver and
                                record[ed] it as being subject to the [R]ight of [W]ay.
                                …</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(v)    Between January 1997 and 2004, Lee Tat took no action to challenge
                                the existence of the [R]ight of [W]ay on the basis that it was now
                                the servient tenement owner.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    This long-standing expectation further crystallized as a result of the
                            2005 CA Decision [<em>ie</em>, the Majority
                            Judges’ decision in the 2005 appeal]. Transactions of sale (about
                            13 purchases) and tenancies that took place thereafter were made on the
                            basis that there was a right of way.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    Without the Grange Road access, there is serious financial prejudice
                            as the value of Grange Heights is significantly lower … as a
                            River Valley property.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    In 2005–2006, St Thomas Walk properties were selling at
                                between about $600 and $1100 psf (Chestbright and Airview
                                Towers respectively).</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   In 2006, Grange Road properties were selling at approximately
                                $1800 psf (The Grangeford).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)    Now that the issue is at the fore, the proprietors (at an EOGM held on
                            8 May 2010) and the MC are content with a limited right of way
                            comprising a narrow footpath. This may enable the Court to achieve a
                            just result. See: <em>Bracewell v Appleby</em>
                            [1975] Ch 408; <em>Yickvi Realty Pte Ltd v Pacific Rover
                                Pte Ltd</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 951, where the Courts
                            fashioned a remedy that resulted in a just compromise between the
                            parties’ respective proprietary interests and rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Lee Tat’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Before us, Lee Tat reiterated its arguments in the court below – namely,
                    (a) the CA is <em>functus officio</em> after giving
                    its decision on the case before it; and (b) the CA, whose jurisdiction and
                    powers are delineated by the SCJA, does not have statutory jurisdiction to
                    reopen and set aside its previous decisions, and therefore does not have
                    inherent jurisdiction either in this regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     With regard to the complaint by the MC that it was not heard on the <em>Arnold</em> exception in the 2008 appeal, Lee Tat’s
                    counsel argued that that did not constitute a breach of natural justice because,
                    as a general principle, a court was not limited to considering only the cases
                    cited by the parties (see <em>Pacific Recreation</em> at
                    [32]). <em>A fortiori</em>, it would not be a breach of
                    natural justice for a court to rely on a case or proposition that none of the
                    parties had cited when there were other cases or propositions before the court
                    on a point which was related to or broader than the point in issue (citing, in
                    addition to <em>Pacific Recreation</em>, <em>Miliangos v George Frank (Textiles) Ltd</em> [1976] AC 443
                    at 478 (<em>per</em> Lord Simon of Glaisdale) and
                        <em>Spring v Guardian Assurance Plc and Others</em>
                    [1995] 2 AC 296 at 316 (<em>per</em>
                    Lord Goff of Chieveley)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     With regard to the <em>Arnold</em> exception, Lee
                    Tat’s counsel contended that it could operate in special circumstances
                    (see <em>Arnold</em> at (<em>inter
                        alia</em>) 107, where Lord Keith of Kinkel referred to
                    Sir James Wigram VC’s statement in <em>Henderson
                        v Henderson</em> (1843) 3 Hare 100; 67 ER 313 that
                    there might be “special cases” (at 115; 319) in which <em>res judicata</em> would not apply), and that the pertinent
                    special circumstances were not limited to a change in the law, but included the
                    emergence of new material which could not by reasonable diligence have been
                    adduced in the earlier proceedings between the same parties. Lee Tat’s
                    counsel also referred to Neuberger LJ’s statements in <em>Coflexip SA v Stolt Offshore MS Ltd (No 2)</em>
                    [2004] FSR 708 (“<em>Coflexip SA
                        (No 2)</em>”) that “issue estoppel ha[d] become
                    less strict over the last fifty years or so” (at [50]) and that
                    “the decision in <em>Arnold</em> itself represented
                    a change, or at the very least a significant development, in the law” (at
                    [52]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In addition, counsel for Lee Tat pointed out that there was “no
                    foundational basis”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> for the Present Action. This was because the Present Action was
                    premised on the assumption that the MC had not been heard on <em>res judicata</em> and the <em>Arnold</em>
                    exception in the 2008 appeal, when the 2008 CA’s directions to the parties
                    to make submissions on the First Further Question and the Second Further
                    Question had in fact given the MC the fullest possible opportunity to address
                    all the material issues considered by the 2008 CA. In other words, Lee Tat
                    contended that there was no factual basis for the Present Action, and that the
                    court was being asked to do something which it should decline to do, namely, to
                    decide a hypothetical case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Counsel for Lee Tat also urged this court to take into consideration the
                    following forensic tactics of the MC in the previous proceedings between the
                    parties:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_a"></a>(a)     In the 2005 appeal, the MC relied on <em>Arnold</em>
                        to argue that there were no special circumstances that prevented the
                        operation of <em>res judicata</em>, which argument was
                        accepted by the Majority Judges (see [25] of <em>GH
                            (No 6)</em>). This showed that the MC was fully aware of the
                        significance and relevance of <em>Arnold</em> and the
                            <em>Arnold</em> exception at the time of the 2008
                        appeal (which was heard after the 2005 appeal). Yet, the MC chose not to
                        refer to <em>Arnold</em> and/or the <em>Arnold</em> exception in any of the written submissions which it
                        filed for the 2008 appeal. In the circumstances, it was

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The [2008] CA gave the [MC] as much as it gave [Lee Tat] virtually
                                <em>carte blanche</em> to address it on all
                            aspects pertaining to the issue of “res judicata”
                            including the “issue-estoppel” rule, the exception to that
                            rule and <b><u>Arnold</u></b>. [underlining and
                            emphasis in bold in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_b"></a>(b)     In the Fourth Action, the MC successfully persuaded both the High Court
                        and the Majority Judges that Lee Tat was not entitled to raise the <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue because the 1992 CA had
                        already decided the issue against Lee Tat in the 1992 appeal. However, the
                        MC had in fact submitted in the 1992 appeal that the <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue was not relevant as Lee Tat was not
                        the Servient Owner at that time. That argument was accepted by the 1992 CA,
                        which meant that the <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue was
                            <em>not</em> decided in the 1992 appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_c"></a>(c)     Prior to the hearing of the 2005 appeal, Lee Tat’s counsel sought to
                        ascertain from the MC’s counsel whether the MC had argued in the 1992
                        appeal that the <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue was not
                        relevant, but the MC’s counsel did not respond to this query.
                        According to Lee Tat’s counsel, Lee Tat became aware that the MC had
                        made such an argument only after reading the 2008 CA’s judgment in
                            <em>GH (No 8)</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Lee Tat’s final submission was that the 2008 CA’s judgment was, in
                    any event, plainly correct on the compelling ground that the 2008 CA had ruled
                    against the MC on a separate and even more fundamental point, <em>viz</em>, the <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue
                    – which concerned the rights of Lee Tat as the <em>Servient
                        Owner</em> and the MC as the dominant owner of Lot 111-34 –
                    was not <em>res judicata</em> because it had <em>never</em> been decided <em>on the
                        merits</em> in all the previous actions between the parties and their
                    respective predecessors in title prior to the 2008 appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues to be decided in this appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In view of the reliefs sought by the MC in the Present Action, there are two
                    questions which we have to decide in this appeal, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the CA has statutory jurisdiction under s 29A of the SCJA
                        and/or inherent jurisdiction to reopen and set aside a decision which it
                        made in breach of natural justice and rehear the matters dealt with in that
                        decision; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_b"></a>(b)     if the CA has the aforesaid jurisdiction, whether the declarations sought
                        by the MC in the Present Action should be granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We shall hereafter refer to these two questions as
                    “Question (a)” and “Question (b)”
                    respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Question (a)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     We can answer Question (a) quickly. In our view, the CA <em>has</em> inherent jurisdiction to reopen and rehear an issue
                    which it decided in breach of natural justice as well as to set aside (in
                    appropriate cases) the whole or part of its earlier decision founded on that
                    issue. If the CA (or, for that matter, any other court) has decided an issue
                    against a party in breach of natural justice, it cannot be said that the CA was
                    fully apprised or informed at the material time of all the relevant
                    considerations pertaining to that issue, and, therefore, the CA cannot be said
                    to have applied its mind judicially to that issue. In other words, the CA would
                    not have exercised its jurisdiction properly <em>vis-à-vis</em> that issue, and, therefore, it cannot to be said to be
                        <em>functus officio</em> in the sense of having
                    exhausted its power to adjudicate on that issue. Nothing in the SCJA prescribes
                    for this situation, and we see no justification to circumscribe the inherent
                    jurisdiction of this court (which would be the effect if we were to rule that
                    the CA has no inherent jurisdiction to reopen an issue which it decided in
                    breach of natural justice) as that could potentially result in this court
                    turning a blind eye to an injustice caused by its own error in failing to
                    observe the rules of natural justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     A breach of natural justice, whether involving a breach of the bias rule or a
                    breach of the hearing rule, is basically a procedural wrong because it denies
                    the aggrieved party a full, fair and impartial hearing. Of course, not every
                    breach of natural justice is equally serious. For this reason, we agree with the
                    Judge that there are “different grades of procedural wrongs” (see
                    the First Instance Judgment at [9] (reproduced earlier at <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a> above)), and that not every procedural wrong
                    entitles the aggrieved party to be reheard and/or to have a final judgment set
                    aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     As a matter of principle, where a decision is made in breach of the bias rule,
                    that decision <em>must</em> be set aside and the matters
                    dealt with therein reheard. A decision tainted by bias is a non-decision because
                    it is not made by an impartial judicial mind, but is instead corrupted by the
                    existence of a conflict of interest. Even apparent bias (as opposed to actual
                    bias) is sufficient justification for a final judgment to be set aside <em>ex debito justitiae</em> (see <em>Pinochet
                        (No 2)</em> as well as [9] of the First Instance Judgment)
                    because if such a judgment is allowed to stand, that may affect public
                    confidence in the Judiciary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     However, the same consideration does not apply to a decision made in breach of
                    the hearing rule. The authorities relied on by the MC –
                    <em>viz</em>, <em>Isaacs</em>,
                        <em>Craig v Kanssen</em> [1943] KB 256 and <em>Kofi Forfie, Odikro of Marban v Barima Kwabena Seifah,
                        Kenyasehene</em> [1958] AC 59 – do not contradict this
                    distinction between a breach of natural justice involving the bias rule and a
                    breach involving the hearing rule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     As a matter of principle, a breach of the hearing rule <em>does
                        not</em> entail that the tainted decision <em>must</em> be set aside. Instead, it merely requires that:
                    (a) the aggrieved party be given, <em>in appropriate
                        cases</em>, the opportunity to be heard on the issues on which he was
                    not heard; and (b) the court thereafter considers whether its previous
                    decision was correct and, if it finds that that decision was not correct, either
                    sets aside or rectifies (depending on what the circumstances of the case
                    require) that decision (see further <a href="#p1_60">[60]</a>
                    below). In other words, where the hearing rule is breached, the aggrieved party
                    has a <em>prima facie</em> right to be heard on the matters
                    on which he has not been heard, <em>but only on those matters and
                        not on any other matters in respect of which no allegation of breach of the
                        hearing rule has been made</em>. Natural justice does not require that
                    the aggrieved party be over-compensated by being given more than what he claims
                    he has been denied, <em>ie</em>, a fair hearing on the
                    matters on which he was not heard. However, if a hearing on those matters will
                    not change the ultimate outcome of the case (<em>ie</em>,
                    if the aggrieved party will still lose the case even if he is given a hearing on
                    the matters on which he was not heard), then the hearing would be in vain and an
                    exercise in futility. In such a situation, the court would be entitled to
                    exercise its discretion not to grant the aggrieved party a hearing on the
                    matters on which he was not heard – as the Judge did in the court below on
                    the ground that even if the 2008 CA’s decision were wrong, it should still
                    be <em>res judicata</em> as between the MC and Lee
                    Tat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Assuming that it is appropriate for the court to grant the aggrieved party a
                    hearing on the issues on which he was not heard, the court has to go on to
                    consider, after the hearing, whether to uphold, set aside or vary its earlier
                    decision. In this regard, we find the following comments of this court pertinent
                    even though they were made in the context of a breach of the hearing rule in
                    arbitration proceedings (see <em>Soh Beng Tee &amp; Co Pte Ltd v
                        Fairmount Development Pte Ltd</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 86 at
                    [91]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If … the same result could or would ultimately have been attained,
                        or if it can be shown that the complainant could not have presented any
                        ground-breaking evidence and/or submissions regardless, <em>the bare fact that the arbitrator might have inadvertently denied one
                            or both parties some technical aspect of a fair hearing would almost
                            invariably be insufficient to set aside the award</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     We should add that in cases where a decision made in breach of natural justice
                    (whether involving the hearing rule or the bias rule) is to be set aside, only
                    the tainted part of that decision needs to be set aside. The other parts of the
                    decision which are not tainted by the breach of natural justice would still
                    stand and would be binding on the parties concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Question (b)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Turning now to Question (b) (see sub-para (b) of <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a> above), the Judge did not grant the MC the
                    declarations sought in the Present Action because, in his view, the grant of
                    those declarations would, at the highest, pave the way for a fresh coram of the
                    CA to be convened to set aside the 2008 CA’s judgment – something
                    which the Judge felt should not be done because the 2008 CA’s judgment,
                    even if it were wrong, should be <em>res judicata</em> as
                    between the MC and Lee Tat. The Judge felt that he ought not to provide an
                    opportunity for another coram of the CA to compound the error made by the 2008
                    CA (namely, failing to apply <em>res judicata</em> to the
                    Majority Judges’ decision in the 2005 appeal) by reversing the 2008
                    CA’s judgment. The objective of the Judge in so ruling was noble. But, was
                    his decision correct in law?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The MC submitted that it was not because the Judge, in effect, went off on a
                    tangent –
                    <em>viz</em>, he proceeded on the erroneous premise that
                    “the <em>‘gravamen’</em> of [the
                    MC’s] application to set aside the 2008 CA[’s] [d]ecision was that
                    the 2008 CA was <em>‘</em><b><em>wrong</em></b><em>to have overturned’</em> the 2005 CA Decision
                        [<em>ie</em>, the Majority Judges’ decision in
                    the 2005 appeal]”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> [emphasis in italics and bold italics in original], when the basis
                    of the MC’s application was “not the <b><em>error</em></b> arising from the breach of natural justice, but the breach
                    of natural justice <b><em>itself</em></b>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> [emphasis in bold italics in original]. In our view, this criticism
                    that the Judge decided the Present Action on the wrong premise is unfounded
                    because the Judge did address the issue of whether a breach of natural justice
                    by the CA justified the setting aside of a final judgment (see in this regard
                    the First Instance Judgment at [7]–[11]). He held that “in cases
                    other than cases of alleged bias of the judge, finality in a decision
                    outweigh[ed] the individual interests of a particular litigant” (see the
                    First Instance Judgment at [10]). In our view, the MC really has no answer to
                    this ground for dismissing the Present Action since it accords with its
                    submissions that there should not be an “egregious error”
                    exception to <em>res judicata</em> and that the <em>Arnold</em> exception does not apply to the decisions of an
                    apex court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The MC has also emphasised that in contending that the Judge went off on a
                    tangent as described at <a href="#p1_63">[63]</a> above, it is
                    not arguing that the 2008 CA’s decision was wrong. We find this submission
                    disingenuous. Of course, the MC must be contending that the 2008 CA’s
                    decision was wrong. This is because the MC is, in effect, seeking to argue that
                    if it had been given the opportunity to address the 2008 CA on the material
                    issues in the 2008 appeal (or, to be more precise, on the <em>Arnold</em> exception specifically, since that is the issue which the
                    MC alleges it was not heard on), the 2008 CA would not have decided the 2008
                    appeal in Lee Tat’s favour, but would instead have upheld the
                    Residents’ right to use the Right of Way, even if it limited such right to
                    use of the easement only as a footpath. This is precisely why the MC wishes to
                    have the 2008 CA’s decision set aside. In short, the MC is attempting to
                    do precisely what it claims it is not doing –
                    <em>viz</em>, challenging the 2008 CA’s decision on
                    the merits. It follows, all the more, that the MC has no answer to the
                    Judge’s reason for dismissing the Present Action (which was that the 2008
                    CA’s decision should not be set aside even if it were wrong and/or were
                    made in breach of natural justice).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     We, of course, disagree with the Judge’s insistence that <em>res judicata</em> is absolute and that “[f]inal must
                    be final” (see [6] of the First Instance Judgment), save in cases
                    involving a breach of the bias rule. As we decided in the 2008 appeal, <em>res judicata</em> is not absolute. In the circumstances and
                    for the reasons stated in <em>GH (No 8)</em> at [73]
                    (elaborated on at <a href="#p1_95">[95]</a>–<a href="#p1_97">[97]</a> below), justice is better than finality and
                    the justice principle should prevail over the finality principle so as to avert
                    the <em>grave injustice that would result if</em> res
                    judicata <em>were applied</em>. This exception to <em>res judicata</em> – which is in essence the <em>Arnold</em> exception – is not a new exception. It was
                    accepted in <em>Henderson v Henderson</em>, the <em>locus classicus</em> on <em>res
                        judicata</em>, that there might be “special cases”
                        (<em>per</em> Sir Wigram VC at 115; 319, in a
                    passage which was cited in <em>Arnold</em> at, <em>inter alia</em>, 107) where <em>res
                        judicata</em> would not apply. Reference may also be made to
                    Neuberger LJ’s statements in <em>Coflexip SA
                        (No 2)</em> at [50] and [52] (reproduced earlier at <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a> above). In our view, contrary to what the
                    Judge feared, sanctioning a narrow exception to <em>res
                        judicata</em> in the form of the <em>Arnold</em>
                    exception will not necessarily lead to judicial anarchy or an unacceptable
                    degree of uncertainty in the law. This is because, given the threshold of grave
                    injustice intrinsic to the <em>Arnold</em> exception, the
                    cases in which the exception can be applied will be few and far between.
                        <em>Arnold</em> was one such case (see <a href="#p1_87">[87]</a>–<a href="#p1_89">[89]</a> below), and the same may be said of the 2008 appeal, given
                    the circumstances before the 2008 CA (see <a href="#p1_93">[93]</a>–<a href="#p1_98">[98]</a>
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Although we disagree with the Judge’s underlying reason for dismissing
                    the Present Action (which was that there should be no exception to the finality
                    principle apart from cases where the bias rule was breached), we agree with the
                    result reached by the Judge on the ground that the grant of the declarations
                    sought by the MC will not serve any useful purpose. This is because the
                    declarations are sought as a precursor to the hearing of SUM 3446/2009, in
                    which the issue to be decided is whether the 2008 CA’s decision should be
                    set aside. It may be recalled that that decision was based on three separate and
                    distinct grounds (see <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above),
                    namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_a"></a>(a)     the <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue was not <em>res judicata</em>;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_b"></a>(b)     the <em>Arnold</em> exception was applicable to the
                        Majority Judges’ decision in the 2005 appeal that Lee Tat was estopped
                        from raising the <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_c"></a>(c)     the Residents were not entitled to use the Right of Way for both access
                        between Grange Road and Lot 561 as well as access between Grange Road
                        and Lot 111-34.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In our view, it is pointless to set aside the 2008 CA’s decision and
                    grant the MC a hearing on the <em>Arnold</em> exception
                        (<em>viz</em>, the issue which the MC claims it was not
                    heard on in the 2008 appeal) because the rulings of the 2008 CA as set out at
                    sub-paras (a) and (c) of <a href="#p1_66">[66]</a> above
                    entail that even if the ruling at sub-para (b) thereof were discounted, the
                    outcome of the 2008 appeal would still be the same. In this regard, it bears
                    reiteration that the MC has conceded before us that the ruling at
                    sub-para (a) of the preceding paragraph is correct; <em>ie</em>, the MC now accepts that the Majority Judges erred in ruling
                    in the 2005 appeal that the <em>Harris v Flower</em> was
                        <em>res judicata</em> (see <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> above). We also note that the MC has not argued that the
                        <em>Arnold</em> exception is applicable to the rulings
                    set out at sub-paras (a) and (c) of the preceding paragraph. It follows
                    that these two rulings are <em>res judicata</em> as between
                    the MC and Lee Tat. Indeed, we would go further to state that if Lee Tat had
                    been permitted to raise the <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue
                    in the 2005 appeal (which, as just mentioned, the MC now accepts Lee Tat should
                    have been allowed to do) and if the Majority Judges had ruled on the merits of
                    that issue, they (and also Chao JA) would undoubtedly have decided (as the
                    2008 CA did in <em>GH (No 8)</em>) that the <em>Harris v Flower</em> principle prevented the Residents from
                    using the Right of Way for access between Grange Road and Lot 561.
                    Accordingly, the Judge’s decision to dismiss the Present Action as an
                    exercise in futility is essentially correct. The power of the court to grant a
                    declaration is discretionary, and where the court feels that a declaration will
                    serve no useful purpose, no declaration will be granted (see <em>Latham Scott v Credit Suisse First Boston</em> [2000]
                    2 SLR(R) 30 at [74]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Observations on the allegation by the MC that it was not heard on the
                Arnold exception in the 2008 appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     What we have stated above is sufficient to dispose of this appeal. However, we
                    think it is necessary for us to also comment on the assumption made by the MC in
                    the Present Action –
                    <em>viz</em>, the assumption that there was a breach of the
                    hearing rule in the 2008 appeal in that the MC was not heard on the <em>Arnold</em> exception. This is because if this assumption is
                    left unanswered, a reader of this judgment might think that the present appeal
                    is being conveniently dismissed on technical grounds. That may in turn affect
                    public confidence in the CA and, as a corollary, public confidence in the
                    administration of justice in this country. For this reason, we propose to set
                    out the factual matrix of the 2008 appeal so as to give the full and complete
                    backdrop of the MC’s allegation of breach of the hearing rule by the 2008
                    CA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Mr Steinbock’s affidavit, which was filed in support of
                    SUM 3446/2009, contains assertions that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_a"></a>(a)     The reasons given by the 2008 CA for its decision in the 2008 appeal were
                        not argued at the hearing of the appeal or otherwise canvassed before the
                        2008 CA. Lee Tat did not even cite <em>Arnold</em> or
                        at any time argue that there was an “egregious error”
                        exception to <em>res judicata</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_b"></a>(b)     None of the matters pivotal to the 2008 CA’s decision were raised in
                        the course of the 2008 appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">These are basically the complaints of the MC <em>vis-à-vis</em> the 2008 appeal. Although the second complaint refers
                    to all the matters pivotal to the 2008 CA’s judgment, the crux of that
                    complaint is not that the 2008 CA erred in holding that the <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue was not <em>res
                        judicata</em> (as mentioned at, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> above, the MC now
                    concedes that this ruling is correct) or that the 2008 CA’s ruling on the
                    Residents’ lack of entitlement to use the Right of Way (whether for the
                    benefit of Lot 561 or for the benefit of Lot 111-34) was wrong, but
                    that the 2008 CA’s application of the <em>Arnold</em>
                    exception was wrong and that if the MC had been heard on that exception, it
                    could (or would) have persuaded the 2008 CA to decide otherwise. In other words,
                    the substance of the MC’s complaint concerns the <em>Arnold</em> exception, and the MC has used that part of the 2008
                    CA’s judgment which deals with this exception as a peg to hang its case
                    for setting aside the <em>whole</em> of the 2008 CA’s
                    judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     We accept that the 2008 CA did not ask the MC to address it on the <em>Arnold</em> exception specifically – but, neither did
                    it ask Lee Tat to do so. In that sense, neither party was heard on the <em>Arnold</em> exception, but only in that sense. Both parties
                    were, however, aware that <em>res judicata</em> was in
                    issue in the 2008 appeal. Indeed, <em>res judicata</em>
                    loomed large in both the Fourth Action and the Third Action as Lee Tat’s
                    case in those two actions was that the <em>Harris v
                        Flower</em> issue was not <em>res judicata</em>
                    because it had not been decided <em>vis-à-vis</em>
                    Collin/Lee Tat as the Servient Owner in either the First Action or the Second
                    Action, both of which had been litigated by Collin/Lee Tat solely as a dominant
                    owner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The question which arises from the MC’s allegation of breach of the
                    hearing rule in the 2008 appeal is whether, taking into consideration the
                    parties’ respective submissions (both written and oral) in that appeal and
                    the two further questions from the 2008 CA (<em>ie</em>,
                    the First Further Question and the Second Further Question set out at,
                    respectively, <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> and <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above), there was sufficient material upon
                    which the MC could have made submissions on: (a) the doctrine of <em>res judicata</em> generally; (b) exceptions to <em>res judicata</em>; (c) whether the <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue was <em>res
                        judicata</em>; and (d) whether the Right of Way had been
                    extinguished because of the drastic change in the character and the nature of
                    use of Lot 111-34 as described in <em>GH
                        (No 8)</em> at [102]–[105]. In our view, the material facts
                    in this regard fall into four categories, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_a"></a>(a)     the parties’ respective written cases for the 2008 appeal;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_b"></a>(b)     the parties’ respective submissions on the First Further Question
                        and the Second Further Question;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_c"></a>(c)     the MC’s knowledge of the <em>Arnold</em>
                        exception at the time of the 2008 appeal; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_d"></a>(d)     the parties’ respective positions before the 2008 CA as to whether
                        the <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue had already
                        previously been decided on the merits.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties’ respective written cases for the 2008
                appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The written cases filed by Lee Tat and the MC respectively for the 2008 appeal
                    show that both parties directly addressed the question of whether the <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue was <em>res
                        judicata</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In its written case filed on 7 May 2007, Lee Tat submitted as

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The earlier decisions of the Court had focused on the contest of two
                        dominant tenements and never decided <em>the issue of whether

                            matter that is <em>res judicata</em>. Even if, as
                            Lee Tat claims, the [Majority Judges] had misinterpreted [the decision
                            in] the Second Action (which, it is humbly submitted, is certainly not
                            the case), the [Majority Judges’] decision … itself gives
                            rise to issue estoppel on all the issues that Lee Tat had raised in the
                            Fourth Action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">38.    These issues [<em>ie</em>, the reliefs sought by
                            Lee Tat in the Fourth Action (reproduced at [19] above)] were considered
                            and dismissed in the Fourth Action. Hence, [the MC’s] entitlement
                            to the [R]ight of [W]ay has been unequivocally decided by these
                            honourable courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">122.  … It is humbly submitted that Lee Tat’s appeal must fail,

                                process. Lee Tat also cannot be allowed to side-step the real issue
                                (of repair) at hand, and by a side-wind, mount a collateral attack
                                on the earlier decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original omitted]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The argument underlying the above quotation –
                    <em>viz</em>, that Lee Tat was estopped from raising the
                        <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue – was a constant
                    refrain in the MC’s written case for the 2008 appeal. It is thus
                    abundantly clear that <em>res judicata</em> was very much
                    in play before the 2008 CA, with the MC contending that the <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue was <em>res
                        judicata</em> because it had already been decided against Lee Tat
                    twice: first, by the 1992 CA in the 1992 appeal, and, second, by the Majority
                    Judges in the 2005 appeal (who ruled that the 1992 CA had decided the <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue against Lee Tat).</p>

                    Further Question and the Second Further Question likewise show that both parties
                    were clearly aware that <em>res judicata</em> was a live
                    issue in the 2008 appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     The First Further Question raised the issue of whether the MC was precluded by
                        <em>res judicata</em> or abuse of process from
                    asserting in the Third Action a right <em>vis-à-vis</em>
                    Lee Tat to use the Right of Way for vehicular traffic in addition to pedestrian
                    traffic, given that the 1992 CA and the Majority Judges had accepted (in,
                    respectively, the 1992 appeal and the 2005 appeal) the MC’s argument that
                    the Residents had not substantially interfered with Lee Tat’s enjoyment of
                    the Right of Way because they used the Right of Way <em>only</em> as a footpath and not for vehicular traffic (see <em>GH (No 4)</em> at [23] and <em>GH
                        (No 6)</em> at [24]).</p>

<p class="Judg-1">The italicised part of the above quotation might give the impression that Lee
                    Tat was relying on the doctrine of <em>stare decisis</em>,
                    as opposed to <em>res judicata</em>, in its written
                    submissions on the First Further Question. It is clear, however, from the
                    overall tenor of those submissions that the doctrine invoked by Lee Tat was that
                    of <em>res judicata</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     This was also the MC’s understanding, as can be seen from the MC’s
                    reply to Lee Tat’s written submissions on the First Further Question. The
                    MC contended (<em>inter alia</em>) that any finding in the
                    Second Action and the Fourth Action that the Residents had used the Right of Way
                    only as a footpath related to “the state of affairs existing at that

                        state”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> The MC submitted (citing <em>Goh Nellie v Goh Lian
                        Teck and others</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 453 at [34]) that this
                    was significant because no issue estoppel could arise in changing circumstances.
                    The MC further argued that even if the 1992 CA and the Majority Judges had found
                    that the Right of Way could be used only as a footpath, such a finding would
                    have been collateral to the main issue decided, which was the <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue. No issue estoppel could arise based on a
                    collateral finding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The Second Further Question raised the issue of whether the 2008 CA had the
                    power to extinguish the Right of Way “[i]n view of the change in
                        circumstances”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> Lee Tat submitted that the 2008 CA did have such power by virtue of
                    s 29A of the SCJA, and contended that the Right of Way should be
                    extinguished because, <em>inter alia</em>, given the change
                    in circumstances since the 1919 Grant was made, the purpose for which the Right
                    of Way had been granted no longer existed where Lot 111-34 was
                    concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The MC criticised Lee Tat’s submissions as a “stubborn refusal to
                    accept the basic doctrine of <em>res
                        judicata</em>”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> and as being based on the erroneous notion that “the doctrine
                    of <em>res judicata</em> somehow [did] not apply to cases
                    which ha[d] reached [the CA]”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> [emphasis in original omitted]. The MC contended that the question
                    of whether the Right of Way had been extinguished was a matter that had already
                    been decided by the 1992 CA in the 1992 appeal and the Majority Judges in the
                    2005 appeal, and Lee Tat was merely attempting to re-litigate a point that was
                    already <em>res judicata</em>. These arguments by the MC
                    show that it knew that <em>res judicata</em> was a key
                    issue in the 2008 appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The MC’s knowledge of the <em>Arnold</em>
                exception at the time of the 2008 appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Significantly, at the time of the 2008 appeal, the MC not only knew that
                        <em>res judicata</em> was an important issue, but was
                    also aware of, specifically, the <em>Arnold</em> exception.
                    During the hearing of this appeal, we were informed by counsel for Lee Tat (and
                    this was not denied by counsel for the MC) that in the 2005 appeal, the MC
                    referred to <em>Arnold</em> and argued (successfully) that
                    there were no special circumstances which could prevent <em>res
                        judicata</em> from applying to the 1992 CA’s decision in the
                    1992 appeal (see sub-para (a) of <a href="#p1_52">[52]</a>
                    above). The MC also referred the 2005 CA to <em>Henderson v
                        Henderson</em>,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> a pertinent decision relied on by Lord Keith when he expounded
                    the <em>Arnold</em> exception (see <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a> above). In their written decision in <em>GH
                        (No 6)</em>, the Majority Judges did not refer to <em>Henderson v Henderson</em>, but, significantly, they cited
                        <em>Arnold</em> in accepting the MC’s argument
                    that “no ‘special circumstances exception’ existed …
                    such as to prevent the operation of issue estoppel” (see <em>GH (No 6)</em> at [25]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties’ respective positions on whether or not the
                    <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue was <em>res
                    judicata</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     It is evident from the foregoing that the MC could have made submissions on
                    the <em>Arnold</em> exception to the 2008 CA if it had
                    wanted to. Indeed, given the MC’s position before the 2008 CA that the
                        <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue was <em>res judicata</em> and given our adversarial system of trial, it would
                    not have been unreasonable to expect the MC to have addressed the 2008 CA on
                    possible exceptions to <em>res judicata</em> –
                    especially the <em>Arnold</em> exception – so as to
                    pre-empt any potential rebuttal to its contention that the <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue was <em>res
                        judicata</em>. Considering that the MC took precisely that pre-emptive
                    step in the 2005 appeal (by citing <em>Arnold</em> as well
                    as <em>Henderson v Henderson</em> to the 2005 CA), we find
                    it surprising that the MC did not think it necessary and/or prudent to adopt a
                    similar approach in the 2008 appeal, especially when the 2008 CA had indicated
                    (via the qualification to the Second Further Question (see <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above)) that Lee Tat might be permitted to
                        <em>reopen</em> an issue which had already been ruled
                    on in the Second Action (<em>viz</em>, the issue of whether
                    the Right of Way had been lost as a result of the amalgamation of
                    Lot 111-34 and Lot 561 to form the Grange Heights site). Indeed, one
                    may argue that it is equally surprising that the MC is relying on its own
                    omission to raise the <em>Arnold</em> exception in the 2008
                    appeal (despite being aware of that exception to <em>res
                        judicata</em> and of the importance of <em>res
                        judicata</em> in that appeal generally) as the basis for setting aside
                    the 2008 CA’s judgment on the ground that it (the MC) was not given the
                    opportunity to be heard on the <em>Arnold</em> exception in
                    that it was not asked to address the 2008 CA on the exception.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     In comparison, given that Lee Tat’s position in the 2008 appeal was that
                    the <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue was not <em>res judicata</em>, it might reasonably be thought that there
                    was no reason for Lee Tat to argue that the <em>Arnold</em>
                    exception was not applicable. Such an argument would be relevant only if the
                        <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue were <em>res judicata</em>, and, as just mentioned, Lee Tat’s position
                    in the 2008 appeal was that the issue was not <em>res
                        judicata</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summary of our observations on the MC’s allegation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     To summarise our observations on the allegation by the MC that it was not
                    heard on the <em>Arnold</em> exception in the 2008 appeal,
                    whilst it is true that the MC was, in the literal sense, not heard on that
                    exception, neither was Lee Tat. In view of the material facts outlined at
                        <a href="#p1_72">[72]</a>–<a href="#p1_84">[84]</a> above, it would not be unreasonable for an observer to come
                    to the conclusion that the MC in fact had the opportunity to address the 2008 CA
                    on the <em>Arnold</em> exception. In our view, the real
                    question for consideration is not whether the MC was heard on the <em>Arnold</em> exception in the 2008 appeal, but, rather,
                    whether, having regard to the material facts which we have just discussed, the
                    MC should have addressed the court on that exception.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The MC’s submissions on the Arnold exception</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     
          <em>Vis-à-vis</em> the <em>Arnold</em> exception proper, the MC has made two submissions (see
                        <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a> above) which, in our view, merit
                    some comment. The first is that the 2008 CA erred in regarding the <em>Arnold</em> exception as an “egregious error”
                    exception to <em>res judicata</em>, when it was actually a
                    narrow exception to <em>res judicata</em>. The second is
                    that the <em>Arnold</em> exception does not apply to the
                    decisions of an apex court. We do not find these submissions persuasive. To
                    explain why we are of this view, it is necessary to first examine <em>Arnold</em> itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The decision in <em>Arnold</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     The material facts of <em>Arnold</em> are as follows. The
                    landlord granted the tenants a lease for a term of some 32 years, with rent
                    reviews to take place at intervals of approximately five years. A dispute over
                    the construction of the rent review clause arose at the first rent review. The
                    matter was referred to an arbitrator, who construed the rent review clause
                    against the landlord. The landlord then appealed to the English High Court. The
                    appeal was heard by Walton J, who construed the rent review clause in a
                    manner unfavourable to the tenants. The tenants applied to Walton J for
                    leave to appeal to the English CA and for a certificate under
                        s 1(7)(<em>b</em>) of the Arbitration Act 1979
                    (c 42) (UK) (“the requisite UK Arbitration Act certificate”)
                    that the case involved a question of law of general public importance or a
                    question which, for some other special reason, should be considered by the
                    English CA. Walton J refused both applications. The tenants appealed to the
                    English CA, which dismissed the appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Subsequently, in two proceedings between other parties on similar rent review
                    clauses, the English CA held that Walton J’s construction of the rent
                    review clause in the earlier action between the landlord and the tenants was
                    wrong. When the next rent review between the landlord and the tenants came up,
                    the tenants sought to reopen Walton J’s decision in the previous
                    action, which, as between them, would ordinarily have been <em>res judicata</em>. The issue went up to the House of Lords, which
                    decided (in <em>Arnold</em>) that <em>res
                        judicata</em> (whether in the form of cause of action estoppel or
                    issue estoppel) was not absolute, and that the <em>special
                        circumstances</em> in that case called for a departure from the strict
                    doctrine of <em>res judicata</em> in order that justice
                    might be done to the tenants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     The exact words used by Lord Keith to explain the House of Lords’
                    reasoning were as follows (see <em>Arnold</em> at
                    109–110):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he law [is] that there may be an exception to issue estoppel
                        in the special circumstance that there has become available to a party
                        further material relevant to the correct determination of a point involved
                        in the earlier proceedings, whether or not that point was specifically
                        raised and decided, being material which could not by reasonable diligence
                        have been adduced in those proceedings. One of the purposes of estoppel
                        being to work justice between the parties, it is open to [the] courts to
                        recognise that in special circumstances[,] inflexible application of it may
                        have the opposite result …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is next for consideration whether the further relevant material which a
                        party may be permitted to bring forward in the later proceedings is confined
                        to matters of fact, or whether what may not entirely inappositely be
                        described as a change in the law may result in, or be an element in special
                        circumstances enabling an issue to be re-opened. … Your Lordships
                        should appropriately, in my opinion, regard the matter as entire and
                        approach it from the point of view of principle. If a judge has made a
                        mistake, perhaps a very egregious mistake, as is said of
                        Walton J.’s judgment here, and a later judgment of a higher court
                        overrules his decision in another case, do considerations of justice require
                        that the party who suffered from the mistake should be shut out, when the
                        same issue arises in later proceedings with a different subject matter, from
                        reopening that issue?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the instant case there was no right of appeal against the judgment of
                        Walton J. because he refused to grant a certificate that the case
                        included a question of law of general public importance. There can be little
                        doubt that he was wrong in this refusal … I consider that anyone not
                        possessed of a strictly legalistic turn of mind would think it most unjust
                        that [the] tenant[s] should be faced with a succession of rent reviews over
                        a period of over 20 years all proceeding upon a construction of [the] lease
                        which is highly unfavourable to [them] and is generally regarded as
                        erroneous. … There is much force also in the view that the landlord,
                        if the issue cannot be reopened, would most unfairly be receiving a very
                        much higher rent than [the rent which it] would be entitled to on a proper
                        construction of the lease. … Estoppel per rem judicatam, whether
                        cause of action estoppel or issue estoppel, is essentially concerned with
                        preventing abuse of process. In the present case I consider that abuse of
                        process would be favoured rather than prevented by refusing the [tenants]
                        permission to reopen the disputed issue. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The MC’s conception of the <em>Arnold</em>
                exception is too narrow</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     It can be seen from the above extract from <em>Arnold</em> that Lord Keith’s primary consideration in
                    formulating the <em>Arnold</em> exception was that the
                    exception was intended to serve the wider interests of justice, with the
                    “overriding consideration in mind” (at 107, citing <em>Carl Zeiss Stiftung v Rayner &amp; Keeler Ltd and Others</em>
                    [1967] 1 AC 853 (“<em>Carl Zeiss
                        Stiftung</em>”) at 947 <em>per</em>
                    Lord Upjohn) being “to work justice and not injustice” (see
                        <em>Arnold</em> at 107, likewise citing <em>Carl Zeiss Stiftung</em> at 947). From this perspective,
                    there is no reason to believe that Lord Keith meant to limit the
                    application of the <em>Arnold</em> exception to cases where
                    at least one of the two factors specified in <em>Arnold</em> –
                    <em>viz</em>, “further material relevant to the
                    correct determination of a point involved in the earlier proceedings, …
                    being material which could not by reasonable diligence have been adduced in
                    those proceedings” (at 109) and “a change in the law” (at
                    109), which factors have been paraphrased by the MC as, respectively,
                    “new factual evidence [and] a subsequent change in the
                        law”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> [emphasis in original omitted] – is present. In other words,
                    the rationale which underlies the <em>Arnold</em> exception
                    does not seem to support the MC’s narrow conception of the scope of this
                    exception.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     In this regard, it is significant that <em>Arnold</em>
                    is, strictly speaking, not a case where there was a change in the law after the
                    decision which was said to give rise to an estoppel was made, except, perhaps,
                    where the landlord and the tenants were concerned. Pertinently, there was no
                    change in the law on the construction of the rent review clause which was before
                    Walton J. Instead, what transpired was that Walton J construed that
                    clause wrongly, and his erroneous decision was <em>res
                        judicata</em> as between the landlord and the tenants. When the
                    English CA, in subsequent cases involving similar rent review clauses, rejected
                    Walton J’s decision, the English CA did not change the law or make
                    new law <em>vis-à-vis</em> the interpretation of rent
                    review clauses of the type in issue in <em>Arnold</em>; it
                    merely corrected Walton J’s erroneous construction of that type of
                    rent review clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     As a result of these rulings of the English CA, Walton J’s decision
                    would cause grave injustice to the tenants if they were bound by it at the next
                    rent review. In this regard, it is important to note that Walton J’s
                    decision, although only a decision of the English High Court, was equivalent to
                    a decision of an apex court where the landlord and the tenants were concerned
                    because Walton J refused to grant the tenants either leave to appeal or the
                    requisite UK Arbitration Act certificate. The House of Lords was of the view
                    that, given the circumstances, an exception should be made to <em>res judicata</em> because it was “most unjust that [the]
                    tenant[s] should be faced with a succession of rent reviews over a period of
                    over 20 years all proceeding upon a construction of [the] lease which [was]
                    highly unfavourable to [them] and … generally regarded as
                    erroneous” (see <em>Arnold</em> at 110).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The legal position confronting Lee Tat at the time of the Third Action (prior
                    to the 2008 CA’s ruling in the 2008 appeal) was similar to that
                    confronting the tenants in <em>Arnold</em>. The Majority
                    Judges’ decision in the 2005 appeal (<em>viz</em>,
                    that the <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue was <em>res judicata</em> because the 1992 CA had decided it on the
                    merits in the 1992 appeal) was clearly wrong because the 1992 CA had not in fact
                    decided the <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue on the merits
                    and, further, not all the requisites of issue estoppel were present in the 2005
                    appeal. The result of the Majority Judges’ decision was to perpetuate
                    “grave injustice” (see <em>GH
                        (No 8)</em> at [81]) to Lee Tat as the Servient Owner so long as
                    the Residents had the right to use the Right of Way contrary to the terms of the
                    1919 Grant, and it was this consideration which led the 2008 CA to hold that it
                    was justifiable to invoke the <em>Arnold</em> exception in
                    the 2008 appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     In our view, given the concern with justice which underlies the House of
                    Lords’ decision in <em>Arnold</em> and the 2008
                    CA’s decision in the 2008 appeal, there does not seem to be any reason to
                    confine the application of the <em>Arnold</em> exception to
                    the narrow ambit espoused by the MC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 2008 CA did not regard the <em>Arnold</em>
                exception as an “egregious error” exception</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     In <em>GH (No 8)</em>, the 2008 CA expressly stated
                    (at [81]) that “[t]he Majority Judgment [<em>ie</em>, the Majority Judges’ decision in the 2005 appeal]
                    contained an egregious error”. The MC understood this statement to mean
                    that the 2008 CA applied the <em>Arnold</em> exception
                    based solely on the ground of the Majority Judges’ egregious error in the
                    2005 appeal. That was not, however, how the 2008 CA approached the <em>Arnold</em> exception. The egregious error of the Majority
                    Judges was merely the starting point of the 2008 CA’s inquiry into whether
                    there were special circumstances in the 2008 appeal that warranted the
                    application of the <em>Arnold</em> exception. After its
                    inquiry, the 2008 CA answered this question in the affirmative.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     The exact reasoning of the 2008 CA on this point was as follows (see <em>GH (No 8)</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">80    In the present case, the circumstances that may warrant the
                            application of the <em>Arnold</em> exception are
                            the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    Neither the [High Court] nor the [1992] CA in the Second Action
                                decided the Main Issue [<em>ie</em>, the
                                    <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue] … on
                                the merits … As such, the Majority Judges in the [2005
                                appeal] held – wrongly (and contrary to the dissenting
                                judgment of Chao JA) – that the Main Issue had been
                                decided in the Second Action …</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    The Majority Judges held that Lee Tat was precluded by the
                                doctrine of issue estoppel from raising the Main Issue in the Fourth
                                Action even though not all the essential elements of issue estoppel
                                were satisfied …</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    Notwithstanding the decision of the Majority Judges, it is likely
                                that there will be continuing litigation between Lee Tat and the
                                Residents on many issues which have yet to be resolved, such as the
                                type of use which the Residents may lawfully make of the Right of
                                Way. In particular, the question of whether the Residents, who had
                                used the Right of Way “only as a footpath” (see [GH
                                (No 4)] … at [23]) at the time of the Second Action, may
                                now use this easement for vehicular traffic has not been decided
                                (see [<em>GH (No </em>7)] … at
                                [36]–[37]). Given this likelihood of further litigation
                                between the parties, we agree with Lord Keith’s statement
                                in <em>Arnold</em> … at 110 that the
                                public interest in seeing an end to litigation (which would entail
                                upholding the operation of issue estoppel to the Majority Judgment
                                    [<em>ie</em>, the Majority Judges’
                                decision in the 2005 appeal]) is of little weight in these
                                circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    Even if the Majority Judges were right in holding that the Main
                                Issue had been decided in the Second Action, the decision in the
                                Second Action as the Majority Judges interpreted it (<em>viz</em>, that the Residents could use the Right
                                of Way for the benefit of not only Lot 111-34 but also
                                Lot 561) would have been contrary to established law, a point
                                which Chao JA noted in his dissenting judgment (see [<em>GH (No 6)</em>] … at [74]).
                                Therefore, in holding that Lee Tat was estopped by the decision in
                                the Second Action from litigating the Main Issue in the Fourth
                                Action, the Majority Judges effectively perpetuated an erroneous
                                legal position <em>vis-à-vis</em> the
                                MC’s rights over the Servient [Land].</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(e)    The Majority Judges did not notice that the MC made contradictory
                                arguments in the Fourth Action, as compared to the Second Action, on
                                the question of whether the Main Issue had been decided in the
                                Second Action. In the Second Action, the MC successfully argued
                                (with respect to the <em>Harris v Flower</em>
                                principle) that Lee Tat had no standing to raise the Main Issue as
                                the latter was not the owner of the Servient [Land]. In other words,
                                in the Second Action, the MC succeeded in its submission that the
                                Main Issue could not be decided in that action. In the Fourth
                                Action, however, the MC took the converse position and argued that
                                not only had Lee Tat raised the Main Issue in the Second Action, but
                                that issue had also been decided in the Second Action (see
                                    [<em>GH (No 6)</em>] at [13]). The
                                Majority Judges accepted the MC’s argument, with the result
                                that an estoppel arose against Lee Tat in the Fourth Action
                                    <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Main Issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(f)    Even if Lee Tat were allowed to raise the Main Issue in this
                                appeal [<em>ie</em>, the 2008 appeal] and even
                                if it were to then succeed in its case on this issue, the Residents
                                would not be inconvenienced in not being able to use the Right of
                                Way for access between their apartments on Lot 561 and Grange
                                Road. This is because the Residents can still reach Lot 561 via
                                St Thomas Walk …, which they have in fact used ever
                                since Grange Heights was completed … Further, as we noted
                                … above, the Residents may also use River Valley Grove for
                                access to Lot 561.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(g)    As a result of the Majority Judgment, the current legal position
                                    <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Main Issue is that
                                “[i]t was decided in the [Second Action] that it was lawful
                                for the [R]esidents ... to use the [S]ervient [Land] as a [footpath]
                                to access Grange Road and <em>vice
                                versa</em>” (see [<em>GH
                                    (No 6</em>)] at [16]). This has in turn prevented Lee
                                Tat from making optimal use of the Servient [Land] in terms of
                                developing it in conjunction with the two dominant tenements that
                                Lee Tat owns (<em>viz</em>, Lot 111-32 and
                                Lot 111-33) – something which Lee Tat would be able to do
                                if it were permitted to litigate the Main Issue and if it were to
                                then succeed in its case on that issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">81    In our view, the aforementioned circumstances qualify as
                            “special circumstances” (<em>per</em>
                            Lord Keith in <em>Arnold</em> … at 109)
                            for the purposes of the <em>Arnold</em> exception.
                                <em>The Majority Judgment contained an egregious
                                error (in so far as it stated that the Main Issue had been decided
                                in the MC’s favour in the Second Action), and its effect was
                                to prevent Lee Tat from raising the Main Issue in the Fourth Action
                                (and likewise before the [j]udge in the [Third] Action) even though
                                that issue had never been decided on the merits. This has caused
                                grave injustice to Lee Tat</em> in that it has been prevented
                            from raising a fundamental issue concerning its rights as the owner of
                            the Servient [Land] (<em>ie</em>, the Main Issue),
                            which might be decided in its favour if it were permitted to litigate
                            that issue. In our view, there is sufficient similarity between the
                            circumstances in <em>Arnold</em> and those in the
                            present case to justify our holding that there are “special
                            circumstances” … in this case which warrant the
                            application of the <em>Arnold</em>
                            exception.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     The 2008 CA’s approach mirrored that of the House of Lords in <em>Arnold</em>, where Lord Keith did not apply the
                    criterion of egregiousness to sieve out mistakes of a lesser degree in respect
                    of which no exception to <em>res judicata</em> should be
                    made, but instead used the expression “a very egregious mistake”
                    (at 109) as the starting point of an inquiry into whether “considerations
                    of justice require[d] that the party who suffered from the mistake should be
                    shut out … from reopening [the] issue [in respect of which the mistake
                    was made]” (at 109; also quoted at [76] of <em>GH
                        (No 8)</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     It may also be noted that the 2008 CA did not find that the special
                    circumstances before it were <em>the same</em> as the
                    circumstances before the House of Lords in <em>Arnold</em>,
                    but held, instead, that there was “sufficient similarity”
                        (<em>see GH (No 8)</em> at [81]) between the two
                    sets of circumstances. A material factor (absent in <em>Arnold</em>) which the 2008 CA took into account was the fact that in
                    the 2005 appeal, the MC advanced a legal argument on the <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue which it knew (or, at least, ought to have
                    known) was unmeritorious – namely, the argument that the <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue was <em>res
                        judicata</em> as it had already been decided against Lee Tat by the
                    1992 CA. As mentioned earlier (see, <em>inter alia</em>,
                        <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above), this argument was in direct
                    opposition to the MC’s argument on the <em>Harris v
                        Flower</em> issue in the 1992 appeal, where the MC had contended
                    – successfully – that Lee Tat, not being the Servient Owner at that
                    time, could not raise the <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue.
                    In the 2005 appeal, the MC managed to persuade the Majority Judges to accept its
                    submission that the <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue was
                        <em>res judicata</em> – a decision which the MC
                    now concedes was wrong (see, <em>inter alia</em>, <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> above). In our view, this factor transcends
                    the sort of “special circumstances” which Lord Keith had in
                    mind in his exposition of the <em>Arnold</em> exception. It
                    may be argued, by way of rebuttal, that, given our adversarial system of trial,
                    it was open to the MC to make whatever submissions it deemed appropriate to its
                    case in the Fourth Action as the court could and would have rejected those
                    submissions which it considered unmeritorious. We do not agree with this
                    argument. Counsel should always adhere to the highest standard of advocacy and
                    refrain from tendering to the court arguments which they know or should know are
                    lacking in merit and/or contrary to established law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     In this connection, it is also pertinent to note that during the hearing of
                    this appeal, evidence emerged that in the 2005 appeal, the MC appeared to have
                    deliberately suppressed (by omission) the fact that its submissions on the
                        <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue in that appeal
                        (<em>ie</em>, the 2005 appeal) were contradictory to
                    its submissions on that same issue in the 1992 appeal (see sub-para (c) of
                        <a href="#p1_52">[52]</a> above). In our view, this evidence
                    may be said to exacerbate the MC’s conduct in advancing to the 2005 CA a
                    contradictory argument on the <em>Harris v Flower</em>
                    issue (as compared to its argument on that issue in the 1992 appeal), and may be
                    regarded as “new material”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> [emphasis in original omitted] which justifies the 2008 CA’s
                    decision to apply the <em>Arnold</em> exception even on the
                    MC’s narrow conception of this exception. This evidence may also be viewed
                    as evidence of a special circumstance of an egregious nature in that the
                    MC’s conduct in the 2005 appeal led the Majority Judges to hold –
                    wrongly (as the MC has now conceded) – that the <em>Harris
                        v Flower</em> issue was <em>res
                    judicata</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The <em>Arnold</em> exception applies to an apex
                court’s decisions as well</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    As mentioned earlier (see <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a> above),
                    another submission which the MC made before this court (although not in the
                    court below) <em>vis-à-vis</em> the <em>Arnold</em> exception is that the exception does not apply to the
                    decisions of an apex court. We are unable to see why the <em>Arnold</em> exception should be thus limited since the doctrine of
                        <em>res judicata</em> is not based on the hierarchical
                    status of the court which made the decision that is said to give rise to an
                    estoppel, but is instead based on the finality principle, which applies to all
                    court decisions that have become final, either because they have not been
                    appealed against or because they have been finally and fully disposed of on
                    appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The twists and turns in the litigation over the Right of
                Way</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Before we conclude this judgment, we wish to make one final observation on
                    this protracted saga of litigation over the Right of Way. The law on easements
                    is well-established where the rights of dominant owners <em>inter
                        se</em> are concerned, and likewise <em>vis-à-vis</em> the rights as between a dominant owner and a servient
                    owner. The scope of the 1919 Grant (as regards the Dominant Lands entitled to
                    the benefit of the Right of Way) was not in dispute; neither was the <em>Harris v Flower</em> principle. These factors should have
                    produced a straightforward and clear-cut judgment on the rights of the parties
                    (and their respective predecessors in title) <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Right of Way at the various stages of ownership of
                    the Servient Land. This, however, did not turn out to be the case. In the Fourth
                    Action, the MC exploited its (and also HLH’s) earlier success against
                    Collin/Lee Tat in the First Action and the Second Action by asserting that the
                        <em>Harris v Flower</em> issue had already been decided
                    against Collin/Lee Tat in those two actions (when the issue had not in fact been
                    decided) and was thus <em>res judicata</em> for the
                    purposes of the Fourth Action (when it was not). This argument was misleading,
                    but, nevertheless, the Majority Judges accepted it (wrongly, as the MC has now
                    conceded) on the basis of what, in their view, was decided in the 1992 appeal.
                    The result was that the MC secured for itself a right which it was in fact not
                    legally entitled to have – namely, the right to use the Right of Way for
                    pedestrian traffic between Grange Road and Lot 561. In the Third Action
                    (which was decided after the Fourth Action), the MC sought to extend this right
                    to cover <em>vehicular</em> traffic, but failed before the
                    2008 CA, which not only reaffirmed the <em>Harris v
                        Flower</em> principle, but also applied that principle in ruling on
                    the rights <em>inter se</em> of the MC (as the dominant
                    owner of Lot 111-34) and Lee Tat (as the Servient Owner) in respect of the
                    Right of Way.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    As mentioned earlier (at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above), the
                    2008 CA intended its decision to bring finality to this long-running dispute
                    over the Right of Way. However, that was not to be. Aggrieved by the
                    “drastic change in what [it hitherto] believed had been [its] land law
                        rights”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> the MC filed SUM 3446/2009 to set aside the <em>whole</em> of the 2008 CA’s decision on the ground that it was
                    not heard on the <em>Arnold</em> exception by the 2008 CA
                    – ignoring entirely, in this regard, the implications of the 2008
                    CA’s rulings that: (a) the <em>Harris v
                        Flower</em> issue was not <em>res judicata</em>
                    as it had previously never been decided on the merits; (b) the Residents
                    were not entitled to use the Right of Way for access between Grange Road and
                    Lot 561 because of the <em>Harris v Flower</em>
                    principle; and (c) the Residents were also not entitled to use the Right of
                    Way for access between Grange Road and Lot 111-34 because that easement had
                    been extinguished by operation of law where Lot 111-34 was concerned. The
                    incongruity of the MC’s grievance speaks for itself when all these
                    circumstances are taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary of our rulings and our conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    In summary, there are only two questions which we need to decide in this
                    appeal, <em>viz</em>, Question (a) and
                    Question (b) (see <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a> above). Our
                    rulings on these two questions are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_103-p2_a"></a>(a)     The CA has inherent jurisdiction to reopen and set aside its own decisions
                        made in breach of natural justice and rehear the matters dealt with in such
                        decisions. How this jurisdiction is to be exercised depends on the nature of
                        the breach – a breach of the bias rule will entitle the aggrieved
                        party to have the judgment set aside <em>ex debito
                            justitiae</em> and the matters dealt with therein reheard, whilst
                        a breach of the hearing rule will (in appropriate cases) entitle the
                        aggrieved party to a hearing on the matters on which he was not heard, with
                        the court deciding only after such a hearing whether the impugned judgment
                        is to be set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_103-p2_b"></a>(b)     Regardless of which rule of natural justice is breached, if the impugned
                        decision is indeed to be set aside, only the tainted part of the decision
                        (as opposed to the entire decision) needs to be set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_103-p2_c"></a>(c)     The grant of the declarations sought by the MC in the Present Action will
                        not serve any useful purpose for the reasons stated at <a href="#p1_66">[66]</a>–<a href="#p1_67">[67]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    For these reasons, we affirm the Judge’s decision to dismiss the Present
                    Action. This appeal is thus dismissed with costs here and below as well as the
                    usual consequential orders.</p>
