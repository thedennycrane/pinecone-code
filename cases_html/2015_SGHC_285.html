<p class="Judg-Author">
        See Kee Oon JC:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The material facts of this case are
                    straightforward. The then 23-year-old appellant had rented a Ferrari 360 Modena
                    F1 sports car (“the car”) from Ace Drive Car Rental for under a
                    week. It carried the vehicle licence plate number SKD2284H. He chose to affix
                    another vehicle’s licence plate number SQ1H onto the car instead, using 3M
                    double-sided tape.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 19 March 2013, the appellant was stopped at
                    random by an enforcement officer from the Land Transport Authority
                    (“LTA”) while driving the car and investigations subsequently
                    revealed that he had exhibited a false licence plate. The licence plate SQ1H
                    belonged to another car, a Mercedes Benz E200. The appellant had picked it out
                    from a website of “special” car plate numbers and he did not know
                    the owner of the car.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The appellant was thus charged under s
                        129(2)(<em>d</em>) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276,
                    2004 Rev Ed) (“the Act”), an offence punishable under
                    s 129(2)(iii) of the Act. For convenient reference, I reproduce the
                    relevant provision of the Act:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>False statements, forging of licences,
                        etc.</b>

                                which is required under this Act to be carried on a vehicle or

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">he shall, unless he establishes to the satisfaction of the

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(iii) … with a fine not exceeding $5,000 or with imprisonment

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The appellant elected to plead guilty to the
                    charge and he was sentenced by the court below to two weeks’ imprisonment.
                    The District Judge in her grounds of decision (published as <em>Public Prosecutor v Chong Jiajun Eugene</em> [2015] SGDC 142)
                    emphasised that a custodial sentence was necessary to deter such offences,
                    citing the difficulty in detecting them and the heavy burden on the resources of
                    enforcement agencies, as well as the potential inconvenience and harm that might
                    be caused to other road users. She further noted that the appellant had given
                    two different explanations for why he had decided to affix the false licence
                    plate on the car.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Upon hearing the submissions of the respective
                    parties on appeal, I allowed the appeal and set aside the sentence of
                    imprisonment and substituted it with a fine of $5,000, in default two
                    weeks’ imprisonment. I now set out my grounds for my
                decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appellant’s contentions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On appeal, counsel for the appellant accepted
                    that deception is inherent in such offences, and agreed that the District Judge
                    was not wrong to have regard to the “not inconsiderable” potential
                    harm that might be caused should traffic or other violations occur.
                    Nevertheless, he submitted that an aggravating feature must exist to warrant a
                    custodial term. This might take the form of evidence of some other circumstance
                    or particular act or acts of deception, such as a collateral purpose in using
                    the false licence plate, <em>eg</em>, to evade Electronic
                    Road Pricing (“ERP”) charges (as was the case in <em>Public Prosecutor v Tan Wei Jin</em> [2010] SGDC 216
                        (“<em>Tan Wei Jin</em>”)). Even then the
                    High Court had found in dealing with the appeal in <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Chua Chee Hou</em> [2012] SGDC 89 (“<em>Chua Chee Hou</em>”) (Magistrate’s Appeal
                    No 61 of 2012) that a fine would suffice on the facts, where the appellant
                    affixed a false licence plate on the car in question so that he could reuse a
                    season parking ticket and avoid payment of parking charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The key plank of counsel’s submission was
                    that there was no discernible dishonesty or deception equivalent to that
                    demonstrated in the cases cited before the District Judge. The appellant’s
                    motive should have been accorded due consideration in determining the
                    appropriate sentence, given that there was no evidence of any violation of other
                    laws. The car was rented for less than a week, and all the appellant wanted to
                    do was to “feel rich” in the car, and “look good”
                    posing for a photo shoot with the false licence plate number SQ1H, which was a
                    “golden number”. There was no other sinister motive and no basis
                    to assume that he had some other nefarious or unlawful aims in mind. It was thus
                    submitted that the District Judge had erred in summarily dismissing his
                    reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The prosecution’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In response to the appellant’s submission,
                    the Deputy Public Prosecutor (“DPP”) countered that public policy
                    considerations would require a deterrent sentence for such offences. Sentencing
                    precedents show that the starting point would be a custodial sentence. There was
                    potential harm in each offence, and innocent parties might be affected and
                    resources would need to be expended to trace the actual offender if there were
                    to be any traffic violations involving the car.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The DPP submitted that the very act of fixing a
                    false number plate by itself involved deception. In response to the
                    court’s query, the DPP clarified that the offence in question was detected
                    at random and there was no evidence of any traffic or other violations committed
                    by the appellant. Nonetheless, the DPP took issue with the appellant’s
                    stated motives and submitted that his explanations of preparing for a photo
                    shoot and wanting to “feel rich” by driving the car with the false
                    licence plate were not consistent and thus did not merit
                consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The DPP further submitted that offenders could
                    easily come up with unsubstantiated justifications. Such offences were also very
                    difficult to detect. She suggested that the appropriate sentence should be
                    pegged to <em>Tan Wei Jin</em>. In that case, the appellant
                    chose to withdraw his appeal against a two-week jail term, and had offered an
                    unsubstantiated motive for affixing the false licence plate, ostensibly to
                    follow his father whom he suspected of having an affair. The District Judge in
                        <em>Tan Wei Jin</em> had also agreed that there was
                    evidence of premeditation to evade detection including for non-payment of the
                    ERP charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     As for <em>Chua Chee
                        Hou</em>, the DPP highlighted that he was caught evading parking
                    charges by reusing a season parking ticket issued for another vehicle, and
                    affixing the licence plate for that vehicle to the car in question. No grounds
                    of judgment were issued by the High Court in allowing the appeal and
                    substituting the jail term with a fine of $3,000. The DPP suggested that the
                    High Court might have been influenced by the fact that the appellant was not
                    driving on the road with the car, as the car was brought to the
                    appellant’s workshop for long-term repairs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The mischief targeted by the provision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     What is the true mischief targeted by s
                        129(2)(<em>d</em>) of the Act in relation to such
                    offending conduct involving affixing another licence plate number to a vehicle?
                    As a starting point, there must of course be “intent to deceive”
                    since s 129(2) states that if it can be shown to the court’s
                    satisfaction that there was no such intent, no offence would be disclosed. The
                    pivotal enquiry relates to the purpose for which this deception was being
                    practised. In my view, this enquiry leads to the logical conclusion that the
                    mischief of the provision would be to deal with cases where licence plates are
                    fraudulently switched or attached in order to facilitate the commission of some
                    other offence. The use of another licence plate is plainly motivated in such
                    circumstances by the desire to avoid detection and thwart enforcement or
                    investigation efforts. There was however no evidence whatsoever of any such
                    motive in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     I accept that deception is inherent in the
                    offence, and such offences are indeed difficult to detect. I also agree entirely
                    with the District Judge that there is “not inconsiderable”
                    potential harm that might result. An obvious example will be if the driver is
                    involved in some other traffic violation or a serious road accident. It may mean
                    that innocent third parties become inconvenienced by the resulting
                    investigations. They could be seriously prejudiced since third-party insurance
                    claims could be frustrated, and the driver may well not even be insured.
                    Moreover, enforcement actions, if any, can be hampered or slowed down by further
                    checks and verification that would be required to ascertain the actual licence
                    plate number. These are all relevant considerations. But there was once again
                    plainly no evidence of any actual harm or inconvenience in the present case.
                    More importantly, there was no evidence put forth of any intent to cause such
                    potential harm or inconvenience.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The relevance of motive and the prosecution’s submission on
                sentence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     I turn next to the different explanations the
                    appellant appeared to have put forward before the District Judge for his
                    conduct. She was not impressed by his explanations, which she found to be both
                    “puzzling” and “unsubstantiated”, although it is not
                    clear if she had rejected both explanations outright. Nevertheless even if his
                    motives could be said to be inconsistent (and I do not necessarily agree they
                    are), I did not think this would by itself tip the scales towards a custodial
                    term when his motives appear to be quite innocent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     There was no basis in my view to conclude that
                    these must be unsubstantiated and hence <em>prima
                        facie</em> unacceptable motives when the prosecution had adduced no
                    evidence to contradict his explanations. They appeared to be plausible reasons
                    for such conduct. From his explanations, he acknowledged that he was an
                    attention-seeking young man, whose age belies his immaturity and fatuousness. He
                    was simply intent on showing off, driven by the desire to “feel
                    rich” behind the wheel of a flashy rented sports car. He wanted to be
                    seen in (or with) the car with a “golden number” rather than the
                    uninspiring “plain vanilla” number that came with the car itself.
                    That is not palpably inconsistent with the explanation he first gave to the
                    District Judge that he rented the car to pose with it at a photo shoot that he
                    was helping his friend with. They may be separate and even unrelated reasons.
                    Some may even form the view that they are frivolous reasons, but they were not
                    necessarily inconsistent or inherently incredible explanations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     With respect, the District Judge may have
                    placed undue reliance on his differing reasons, almost as if his inability to
                    keep to a consistent explanation had aggravated the offence. In any event, his
                    explanations themselves were clearly not aggravating factors, despite a
                    thinly-veiled attempt by the Prosecuting Officer to suggest this in the written
                    submission tendered before the District Judge seeking a custodial sentence. At
                    paragraph five of the prosecution’s submission on sentence marked as
                    ‘P1’, it was contended that “[s]uch circumstances are further
                    aggravated by the fact that the defendant, for such triviality as to
                    “look good” for his photoshoot, by replacing the number plates
                    with the forged ones, also avoidance [<em>sic</em>] in a
                    form of receiving the parking summons, ERP detection or other road related
                    offences”. I did not see the relevance of the perceived
                    “triviality” of his stated reason – it may have been trivial
                    or frivolous, but this was by itself no reason to suggest it was therefore
                    patently and objectively unbelievable and had somehow made his offence more
                    aggravated. As for the possible avoidance of detection, I reiterate that there
                    was no evidence of any such motives in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     It was also inappropriate for the prosecution
                    to maintain that matters were “compounded” and enforcement
                    officers would be further “inconvenienced”. With respect, this
                    appears to overstate the position. These considerations had no application at
                    all to the facts in the present case. There was certainly no evidence of such
                    inconvenience in terms of detection in the present case. He was not caught for
                    some other offence for which he was attempting to avoid detection; the facts
                    show that the offence was detected at random when he was stopped by a LTA
                    officer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Calibration of the sentence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     
          <em>Chua Chee Hou</em>
                    illustrates why the mischief targeted by the provision should be carefully
                    examined to determine whether the factual scenario at hand falls squarely within
                    it. Although there were no written grounds of judgment issued, it would appear
                    that the offender’s primary motive was to “reuse” the season
                    parking label which was issued for use on another car. He could perhaps still
                    have driven the car in question although it was undergoing repairs. At any rate
                    there was no evidence that the car would not or could not be driven. But
                    nonetheless the High Court’s decision to set aside the imprisonment term
                    and substitute it with a fine would demonstrate that even with a motive to avoid
                    incurring additional season parking charges for the car, his culpability fell
                    within the lower end of the spectrum. A high fine would thus be an adequate
                    deterrent punishment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In the present case, the offence was planned
                    and premeditated. But it seems to me that every such offence of this nature
                    would necessarily be so. As such, this is not an additional aggravating feature.
                    It is implicit in the offence itself – I cannot see how someone could have
                    chosen to affix a false number plate without conscious planning and
                    deliberation. There was no evidence that the appellant had planned for long-term
                    use of the number plate. After all, it was a rented car which he would use for
                    less than a week.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     More critically, there was no evidence of any
                    other unlawful intent, <em>eg</em>, avoidance of parking
                    summons or parking charges, ERP or road-related offences. There was no other
                    violation. There was, for instance, no evidence that he did not insert a
                    cashcard into his in-vehicle unit or that he did not display parking coupons or
                    that he did not provide the actual car number after being involved in a car
                    accident. There was no evidence that he was not insured. I reiterate that he was
                    simply stopped at random by an LTA enforcement officer. It would therefore not
                    be appropriate to overstate the potential harm that might be occasioned in such
                    circumstances, although I would readily accept that this is a relevant
                    consideration even if it is necessarily also a somewhat speculative
                one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     It was of course entirely possible that in
                    actual fact the appellant may have had various other reasons for affixing the
                    licence plate number SQ1H onto the car. He was by his own admission a young man
                    seeking to show off driving a rented sports car. It would not be implausible
                    that he might have wanted to avoid detection should he be caught speeding or
                    spotted driving recklessly or participating in an illegal road race. But to
                    ascribe such a motive to him would be wholly speculative and unfair to him when
                    no such evidence was before the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It would in fact be very likely that, in other
                    cases, false number plates are affixed in order to facilitate the commission of
                    other offences. I would emphasise that a custodial term is still warranted in
                    such cases. Imprisonment of two weeks upwards should be expected even if they
                    may be relatively minor offences such as evasion of ERP, and I would venture to
                    suggest that a longer term in the range of four weeks would be appropriate where
                    there is non-payment of road tax and/or insurance. There will also be aggravated
                    offences for which more substantial sentences of imprisonment would be
                    warranted, such as where false number plates are used on stolen cars or to
                    facilitate the commission of more serious offences like drug trafficking,
                    robbery, immigration or customs offences, to name just a few. In such cases, the
                    intent to evade detection is manifestly clear and the starting point for the
                    sentencing court would be to consider a sentence of three months’
                    imprisonment upwards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I make one final brief observation: the
                    prosecution included among its sentencing authorities a newspaper article from
                    August 2010 reporting the case of <em>Tan Wei Jin</em>.
                    Newspaper reports are widely referred to by the general public as sources of
                    news and information but they are hearsay and generally not reliable sources for
                    the court to rely on.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     I was of the view that a custodial sentence
                    would not be warranted given the circumstances under which the offence was
                    committed. In line with the High Court’s decision in <em>Chua Chee Hou</em>, the maximum fine would be adequate punishment on
                    the facts of this case. In my opinion, while a custodial sentence would
                    ordinarily still be warranted, the factual circumstances in both cases were not
                    such that they plainly fell within the mischief envisaged by the relevant
                    provision of the Act. I therefore allowed the appeal and substituted the
                    imprisonment term of two weeks with a fine of $5,000, in default two
                    weeks’ imprisonment.</p>
