The same is true in finance. Entering into a loss-making contract many times over does not make that contract any less loss-making. The appellants, Mr Iseli Rudolf James Maitland (“James”) and Ms How Soo Feng (“Sue”), were the directors and majority shareholders of The Gold Label Pte Ltd (“TGL PL”). TGL PL was the sort of company which started its Frequently Asked Questions in its sales pitches with the question: “Is this a Ponzi?”

</div> It did this through a combination of slick salesmanship and the timeless “business model” of using revenue from new gold contracts to fund its payouts under previous contracts. This, perhaps, explains the need for the question “Is this a Ponzi scheme?” in TGL PL’s sales materials. It had charts and graphs showing that its business operations were complex – but this was just to hide the fact that even though the gold sold was real, TGL PL’s means of generating a profit were entirely imaginary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Of course, such a scheme was ultimately unsustainable. By the time the appellants initiated TGL PL’s winding up on 7 October 2010, its liabilities had multiplied and it had accumulated unfulfilled contractual obligations to clients amounting to more than $76 million, with less than $500,000 left in its accounts.

</div> The appellants were both charged for fraudulent trading under s 340(5) read with s 340(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (the “Companies Act”). They were convicted after trial, and each sentenced to three years’ and 10 months’ imprisonment. The appellants now appeal against their convictions and sentences. On appeal, they effectively concede that TGL PL was carried on for a fraudulent purpose. They raise a whole number of arguments, however, to show that they were not <span class="font-italic">knowingly</span> parties to the carrying on of its business for such a fraudulent purpose. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Having heard parties and considered their submissions, I dismiss the appeals against conviction and sentence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In sum, I find that the appellants’ explanations for what they knew of TGL PL’s business model do not add up when weighed against the objective documentary evidence and their admissions in their statements. As they knew that each buyback contract was inherently loss-making, their understanding of TGL PL’s business model as using cashflow from loss-making contracts to enter into yet more loss-making contracts fundamentally revealed that they knew TGL PL’s business model was unsustainable.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 TGL PL was incorporated in Singapore on 28 April 2009 and was in the business of selling gold bars under a buyback scheme (the “Gold Buyback Scheme”).

First, <span class="font-italic">Nabill</span> pertains to disclosure of statements of material witnesses, not disclosure of material statements. This distinction is important. In a trial, there may be statements by various witnesses which contradict the accused’s defence in material ways. But the <span class="font-italic">Nabill</span> disclosure obligations do not apply to these statements by virtue of that fact. They are limited to statements of material witnesses. Second, James’ submissions conveniently omitted the requirement that the statements had to be from a witness who <span class="font-italic">can be expected</span> to confirm or contradict an accused person’s defence. It is not sufficient that there is a mere possibility that a witness could confirm or contradict an accused person’s defence; they must be in a position where they “can be expected” to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 On the facts, I was not convinced that Shirley was a material witness. It was telling that James himself did not attempt to call Shirley as a witness on his behalf. Given that Shirley’s evidence would almost entirely pertain to what James would have personally told her, this was not a situation where James would have been prejudiced by the non-disclosure of her statements such that he would not have able to make an informed decision as to whether to call her. This served as strong evidence that James himself did not consider Shirley to be a material witness.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I further found that it was unlikely that Shirley would be in a position where she could be expected to confirm or contradict James’ defence in showing that he had either a genuine intention to run TGL PL sustainably, or to illustrate that he never fully understood the business model of TGL PL. The ambit of WongPartnership’s engagement by TGL PL was limited to advice on licensing requirements.

Based on the appellants’ charges, the Fraudulent Purpose that TGL PL had been purportedly carrying on was that it had sold gold bars under a buyback scheme promising returns when in fact it did not operate any substantive profit-generating business and had no sustainable means to honour its payment and buyback obligations.

On the contrary, Sue appears to concede that the business of TGL PL was carried on for the Fraudulent Purpose: “With the benefit of hindsight, while it may seem obvious now that there was no real profit-generating formula to begin with, it is the Appellant’s knowledge at the material time that should be considered.”

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In any event, I am of the view that the DJ’s finding was amply supported by the evidence. There are a limited number of ways in which the business model of TGL PL could conceivably have made a profit. None of these were successful.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Gold Buyback Scheme was inherently unprofitable</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 One possibility is that TGL PL could have profited directly from the Gold Buyback Scheme if it earnt more money from an individual client under the scheme than it would have normally distributed to them over the lifetime of each contract. However, the probability of this scenario was negligible, as the cumulative sum of payouts distributed to directors, operating costs, as well as payouts to clients would mean that the initial revenue from each buyback contract was far exceeded by the resulting liabilities. As the Expert Report demonstrated, based on TGL PL’s internal documents, all the contracts under the Gold Buyback Scheme were inherently unprofitable.

</div> It bears repeating that the Expert Report was unopposed, and that the appellants did not call an expert of their own to controvert its findings. The DJ was thus right to find that the Gold Buyback Scheme was inherently unprofitable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I do note that there were conceivable scenarios under which TGL PL could have turned a profit. As noted in the Expert Report, if gold prices appreciated significantly, it would become rational for clients not to exercise the Sell-Back Option as the value of selling their gold bars on the open market would exceed their returns from exercising the option. This would allow TGL PL to retain the profit from the marked-up TGL PL Selling Price. Even if clients did exercise the Sell-Back Option, TGL PL would then be able to liquidate the gold for a higher price on the open market and make a profit.

</div> However, the amount by which gold prices needed to appreciate for this to happen was substantial. For a three-month GSS plan, for example, gold prices needed to rise by more than 17.9% over a three-month period.

</div> This was several times higher than the average gold price appreciation during the Material Period, which was only 2.91%. There was thus no way that TGL PL could have turned a profit from an appreciation in gold prices during the Material Period. Even without the benefit of hindsight, it was highly improbable that such a drastic appreciation in prices would have occurred, let alone sustainably so. It is telling that there is no evidence in the appellants’ internal correspondence between themselves and others in TGL PL that they had (a) possessed any evidence for future gold prices increasing, (b) evaluated for themselves the likelihood of gold prices appreciating, (c) possessed any subjective opinion on the price of gold increasing, or (d) otherwise approached TGL PL’s business on the basis that gold price appreciation was fundamental to their business model, despite bullishly touting the prospect of gold as an asset in their sales materials.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">TGL PL did not profit from buying gold at wholesale prices and selling it at retail prices</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 A second possibility is that TGL PL could have profited from arbitrage based on an ability to buy gold at lower prices and sell it at higher prices.

Moreover, to the extent that TGL PL did charge clients at a mark-up averaging 24% above the prevailing gold market price, this was not sufficient to allow it to turn a profit in individual contracts based on the findings of the Expert Report, as clients could always elect to have TGL PL buy back the gold bars at the marked-up price.

As Gary was an uncooperative witness at trial, the Prosecution had applied to treat him as a hostile witness and cross-examine him under section 156 of the EA. After cross-examination, the Prosecution also applied under section 147(3) of the EA to admit Gary’s CAD statements into evidence in substitution of his oral evidence, and under section 157(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the EA to impeach his credit as a witness. Although the DJ admitted these statements, he was “ultimately hesitant to place any significant weight on these statements as Gary was wholly unhelpful in assisting the court to understand the contents of those statements”. At the same time, however, the DJ “[agreed] that Gary’s statements corroborate the other evidence led by the Prosecution that there was no investment activity in [TGL PL] to invest the proceeds of the gold buyback business”.

</div> However, in my view, this objection mischaracterises the DJ’s approach. The DJ was hesitant to “place any <span class="font-italic">significant</span> weight” (emphasis added) on Gary’s statements but did not, contrary to James’ characterisation, “disregard” them. There was therefore no inconsistency in assigning the same statements some, albeit limited, weight as corroborating evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In any event, I am satisfied that there is sufficient evidence from the testimony of the other Prosecution witnesses and the available documentary evidence such that even without the corroborative weight of Gary’s statements, the Prosecution had succeeded in proving beyond reasonable doubt that TGL PL had no investments with external parties that would allow it to profit from any interim proceeds from the gold buyback business, nor any ability to profit from the alleged Formula (see above at [63]). For the same reason, it is unnecessary to consider Sue’s arguments on appeal regarding the DJ’s treatment of Norman’s evidence on the Formula.

Even if gold stock had been accumulated for investment at the outset of TGL PL’s business, this stock would have been liquidated by May 2010, which would have registered as incoming funds in the Daily Reports. But no significant incoming proceeds from the sale of gold outside of the buyback contracts were ever recorded in the Daily Reports.

Buying more gold to enter into yet more unprofitable contracts could not have helped TGL PL turn a profit no matter how many clients it had.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 More specifically, the Expert Report noted that the only way that TGL PL would be able to make a profit was if the price of gold appreciated at an “extreme” rate.

</div> As explained at [56] above, this did not happen during the Material Period, nor was such a price appreciation probable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 At best, entering into a succession of unprofitable contracts could have created temporary access to cashflow before the gold buyback contracts became due. However, it is clear from the above analysis that even if there was liquidity generated, the resulting funds were not invested in any way that could have offset or exceeded the losses from the Gold Buyback Scheme.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">TGL PL was carried on for the Fraudulent Purpose</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Having considered that there was no conceivable way by which TGL PL could have been profitable, the only way that TGL PL would have access to fresh funds to make contractual payouts to existing clients would have to be through the sales generated from new clients. It was, effectively, a money circulation scheme. The unsustainability of this enterprise was eventually shown by its financial situation by the end of the offending period. As of 7 October 2010, TGL PL’s unfulfilled contractual obligations to clients amounted to more than $76 million but it only had $452,364.28 in its bank accounts.

</div> The DJ did not err in finding that the business of TGL PL was carried on for the Fraudulent Purpose.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the appellants were knowingly parties to the carrying on of the business of TGL PL for the Fraudulent Purpose</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Actual knowledge is required before a person can be said to be knowingly a party to carrying on business for a fraudulent purpose under s 340 of the CA (<span class="font-italic">Tan Hung Yeoh v Public Prosecutor</span> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 262 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Hung Yeoh</span>”) at [26] and [27]). This would also encompass turning a blind eye to the obvious (<span class="font-italic">Phang Wah </span>at [25], see also <span class="font-italic">R v Hunter (Peter) and another </span>[2022] 3 WLR 485 at [129] in the context of the similarly worded s 993(1) of the UK Companies Act 2006 (c 46)). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 On appeal the appellants maintain their defence, which the DJ rejected at trial, that they lacked any fraudulent intention and had honestly relied on Gary and FTEG PL to run the Formula for TGL PL. For completeness, I note that they are not disputing that they were parties to the carrying on of the business of TGL PL, which involves participation in, concurrence with, or the taking of some positive steps in the carrying on business (<span class="font-italic">Tan Hung Yeoh</span> at [30]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 It is important to note that the Fraudulent Purpose, as specified in the charges against the appellants, was that TGL PL did not operate any substantive profit generating business and had no <span class="font-italic">sustainable means</span> to honour its payment and buyback obligations. This is a distinct question from whether TGL PL did in fact honour its payment obligations during the time the appellants were involved in its business. It is therefore irrelevant, as argued by counsel for Sue in oral submissions, that she always believed the company was solvent. A belief in solvency would not necessarily equate to a belief that TGL PL’s business model was sustainable. For example, if Sue had thought that TGL PL would be able to pay off its debts as they fell due because it had sufficient revenue from new contracts to pay off its liabilities under old ones (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a successful Ponzi scheme), this would constitute a belief that TGL PL would be solvent in the short-medium term, but not necessary a belief that TGL PL’s business was sustainable.. In this regard, I note that it is crucial for James and Sue’s defence that they had to have in mind at least one plausible mechanism by which they believed TGL PL would generate profit – carrying on its business without any such belief would necessarily entail knowing that TGL did not operate any substantive profit generating business and had no sustainable means to honour its payment and buyback obligations. Put another way, one cannot operate a business with a genuine belief as to its financial viability if they have no answer to the question “how is your business profitable?”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appellants harboured doubts from the outset about the viability of TGL PL’s business model</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Even before the commencement of TGL PL’s business, there is good reason to believe that the appellants were aware of problems with TGL PL’s business model. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Bank Negara’s raid on Genneva SB</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 On 21 July 2009, Bank Negara announced that it had raided and commenced investigations into Genneva SB for suspected deposit-taking and money-laundering activities.

</div> I disagree with James’ argument that a plain reading of the Sheng &amp; Co document shows that it sets out a means of generating returns that the appellants would have believed. It is apparent from the face of the document that the “Gold Concept” outlined in the document involved transfers between various entities such as “GCC”, “IF”, and GG”. These entities were clearly internal departments of TGL PL, as they were under the label “Divide to 8 departments”. To the extent that these departments were internal, transfers between them could not generate profits. The appellants knew this (see [134]–[137] below). The only other plausible mechanism outlined in the Sheng &amp; Co document by which profits could have been made was through buying gold bars at wholesale prices and selling them at what was labelled “market price”. However, this was not the means by which the appellants actually believed TGL PL made profits (see [142]–[144] below). The appellants thus could not have come to a genuine belief of the viability of TGL PL’s business model from the information in the Sheng &amp; Co document. Even if they had, the business model outlined in the document is inconsistent with their own explanations of how TGL PL functioned.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appellants’ inquiries with local authorities could not dispel their doubts over the viability of TGL PL’s business model </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The appellants rely on their inquiries through WongPartnership with the MAS and IE Singapore as evidence of their honest desire to conduct TGL PL’s business in a lawful manner.

</div> He argues that these inquiries were conducted at considerable expense and, moreover, that they were commissioned in order to ensure that TGL PL would not be liable for the deposit-taking and money-laundering activities that Genneva SB had been investigated for.

</div> It was only after he was so satisfied that the Gold Buyback Scheme was allowed to commence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In my view, this line of argument is fairly tangential to the appellants’ case. The fact that the appellants took steps to ensure the legality of TGL PL’s business model in some respects does not evince a more general belief on their part that it was compliant with the law in all respects. Indeed, it is unsurprising that the appellants, knowing of Bank Negara’s investigations into Genneva SB, were keen to avoid liability for the same alleged deposit-taking and money-laundering activities. This does not demonstrate, however, that the appellants possessed an honest belief in the viability of TGL PL’s business model. Regardless of the appellants’ motives for carrying on the business of TGL PL, they would want to ensure that licensing requirements did not scuttle their plans before they carried out their business, fraudulent or not.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Further, it is not at all clear that the inquiries made by TGL PL were made in good faith. It provided no information on the back-end trades conducted by the company.

</div> It also misrepresented its ability to buy gold at wholesale prices (see [57]–[61] above). This casts doubt that TGL PL’s seeking of advice from WongPartnership was a genuine attempt to seek advice on its business model, rather than for the sake of being able to claim in its sales materials that such inquiries had been made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91  To the extent that the appellants did seek to conform to the licencing requirements through such inquiries, I agree with the DJ that they did so to create a mere veneer of legitimacy. The appellants contend that the DJ erred in finding that TGL PL actively presented itself as a legitimate business on the basis of its inquiries with local authorities through WongPartnership.

However, TGL PL is required to use the sales proceeds collected from this client to purchase gold bars again to replenish TGL PL’s stock inventory. This is because based on my understanding; TGL PL needs to accumulate gold bars by purchasing them using the markup collected. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">With more sales, more markup would be collected and hence more gold bars can be purchased.

</div> However, when read in context, the reference to accumulation of gold bars refers to buying more gold bars to sell to new clients. As he elaborated in his answer, his understanding of the business model was that if “we do not have clients to buy gold bars from TGL, we are not able to roll. This is the only way I think the business can work.”

</div> This articulation of TGL PL’s business model was inconsistent with a belief that gold bars were purchased for accumulation as a means of investment. For this reason, I find that the DJ’s finding that James knew that TGL was using cashflow from new contracts to service the buyback of old contracts was not in error, notwithstanding that the decision below only made reference to admissions by Sue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 James also argues that as he was not cross-examined on his admissions in the above statements, these should not be held against him.

</div> Given the specific point in question had been put to him, James would thus have had an opportunity to clarify this in re-examination, as well as in reply submissions in the trial below. To this end, I note that James has not on appeal offered any argument or explanation for why these passages in his statements do not show that he knew cashflow from new contracts was being used to pay for the buyback options of old contracts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In addition to the admissions of the appellants highlighted above, there is corroborative evidence that James and Sue would have known that TGL’s business was dependent on the sale of new contracts to sustain the cashflow necessary to fund buybacks of old contracts. The DJ found that an email from Joanne to James, Sue and Gary dated 3 August 2010 entitled “TGL Cashflow” highlighted TGL PL’s dire financial situation and explained that TGL PL’s low sales were “unable to support the cashflow requirement”, even before accounting for operational expenses and bonuses.

</div> This finding by the DJ is not challenged by either of the appellants on appeal. I make two observations regarding this email. First, the “cashflow requirement” referenced by Joanne arose due to higher numbers of clients exercising their options to have TGL PL buy back their gold bars—these are obligations that TGL PL incurred from old contracts. Second, Joanne did not contemplate any other means of capital injection or profit that would grant TGL PL access to funds. She envisaged sales of new contracts as the <span class="font-italic">only</span> anticipated way in which TGL PL would make any profits or provide any injection of funds. It thus would have been clear to the appellants that TGL PL’s obligations under old contracts had to be serviced by incoming funds from new gold buyback contracts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appellants knew that individual buyback contracts were inherently loss-making if clients exercised the Sell-Back Option</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 I find that both appellants knew that TGL PL would incur a loss on each gold buyback contract should the client elect to exercise the Sell-Back Option.

I find this explanation unconvincing. Sue acknowledged that TGL PL’s gold bars were sold at a mark-up and therefore more expensive than those sold by other suppliers. When asked why clients would be willing to pay more for the same item, she said in her CAD statement that this was “because of the promise of rebates payment as well as the buyback at the markup price”.

</div> In short, the only reason why TGL PL’s gold was marketable at a marked-up rate was the buyback provision, which was the unique selling point of TGL PL’s business. Clients would thus have been likely to exercise it, barring an exceptional scenario where gold prices appreciated at an unprecedented rate. This was indeed what transpired. As Sue admitted, the buyback obligation was triggered by most clients during her time as director.

This answer relied on exploiting the difference between wholesale and retail prices in order to make investments elsewhere (“the investment explanation”):

E.g., let’s say I put 100k fixed deposit with a bank and the bank gives me 1%pa. What would the bank do with my money? Do you think they are going to sit on your money? Naturally no, they would set a portion of it as cash reserves, and the rest of it will be used to make investments, loans, or into areas of businesses that will make more than 1%pa for themselves. … In this case, the company is also doing exactly the same thing but just with a different instrument. This is not a money bank per se, but more of a gold bank. … When you put in 100k, what will happen to the money? Naturally, a part of it will be set aside as cash reserves as well. The remaining will be used to buy into more gold inventory. The company naturally is able to buy into gold at much lower prices from the wholesale market, which has a very significant profit margin. And these are markets that man on the street is not able to access into as well. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 TGL PL thus sought to have its sales agents represent that their method of investment was “doing exactly the same thing” as what banks did—investing in “investments, loans, or into areas of businesses”, except in this case with increasing its gold inventory. The investment explanation was likewise referenced in the training slides for sales agents for TGL PL which Sue helped to look through.

There is evidence that Sue knew this. When confronted with why this aspect of TGL PL’s business was not represented to clients in its slides, Sue retorted that this was because “we don’t need to”, because “no clients have ever asked us this question”.

</div> The same argument also applies to the admissions in their CAD statements. However, this argument does not affect my finding on this point. Even if I take the appellants’ admissions as being limited to showing their state of knowledge at the time of the trial or their statement taking, this is strongly indicative that they had no knowledge of any inflow of profit during the Material Period as well. While it would be possible for the appellants to have not known about any investment during the Material Period but then subsequently acquired new information about investments by TGL PL before their statements had been taken, it is far less likely that the appellants would have known of investment happening during the Material Period but then forget this entirely during their statement recording and testify to the opposite effect that they never knew of any investment that took place.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 As such, while the appellants’ admissions may not show that they knew definitively during the Material Period that no investments were being made, they are sufficient to show that they had no basis for believing during the Material Period that any investments were being made. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Moreover, there was nobody in TGL PL who the appellants could have plausibly believed facilitated investment with external parties. It certainly could not have been the appellants themselves. It could not have been Gary, who the appellants believed ran a Formula that consisted of mere internal transfers (see below). Neither could it have been the staff of TGL PL, who took instructions from the appellants and Gary.

The 8 September 2009 email clearly refers to the appellants elaborating on TGL PL’s business model – even if the initial explanation of the business model had been by Joseph, it is evident the appellants knew enough to make further representations about the business model at later meetings. I therefore disbelieve the appellants’ claims that they had no involvement in the meetings with WongPartnership beyond being passive observers as this is contradicted by the documentary evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 If the appellants had genuinely believed that TGL PL would have profited from arbitrage between wholesale and retail prices, it is somewhat surprising that they were so inconsistent in their description of this aspect of TGL PL’s system for acquiring gold in their explanations to WongPartnership. Their explanations of how and at what price TGL PL would obtain gold simply did not equate with each other. That this system was so indeterminate in the appellants’ minds points towards the fact that neither of them genuinely believed that TGL PL’s solution to profitability lay in this aspect of their business. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appellants had incentive to care about the viability of TGL PL’s business model </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 I note that the appellants had more than sufficient incentive to verify for themselves that TGL PL’s business model would be viable.

She travelled to Singapore from Malaysia monthly despite having children who needed her at home.

</div> James had invested $600,000, a significant amount of money, to put into the start-up capital of TGL PL. In view of the appellants’ sinking time and money into TGL PL’s operations, it is inconceivable that they would be completely apathetic to the viability of the business. While they need not have known the exact calculation of figures involved in its profitability, they would at the very least have needed to have a plausible conceptual model of at least one potential way in which TGL PL could have made money. Based on my findings above, I am convinced that not a single potential means by which TGL PL could have turned a profit could have been plausibly believed by the appellants based on what they knew.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 As a brief aside, I deal with James’ argument on appeal that it would be illogical to put in $600,000 of his own money to invest into a business entity intending to use this to commit fraud.

</div> In this email Joanne informed Gary, copying the appellants, that since 24 May 2010 there had been no transfers made according to the Formula. According to James, the Prosecution’s case was that upon receipt of this email stating that the Formula was not being run, James should have taken steps to cease TGL PL’s business, and by failing to do so he was operating the business fraudulently. This conduct by the Prosecution, James says, shows that the charge had not been made out as he could not be engaged in fraudulent trading during the Material Period which commenced much earlier on 16 December 2009.

</div> I do not agree with this. In my view, James’ failure to cease the business of TGL PL after the receipt of the 3 June 2010 email is corroborating evidence of what he already knew from the beginning of the Material Period, rather than a marker of the start of James’ knowledge that TGL PL was carried on for the Fraudulent Purpose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 James also contends that an email sent by Gary to Sue on 10 June 2010 shows that FTEG PL acknowledged it was providing the Formula to TGL PL, and that Gary was far more concerned than James and Sue about the continuing receipt of directors’ fees.

</div> In relation to the former argument, I note that provision of a formula is not inconsistent with the appellants’ belief that the Formula consisted of a series of internal transfers between bank accounts, which could not be a source of profit for TGL PL. The fact that FTEG PL had assisted in conducting internal transfers of money does not go far to show how the appellants might have thought that FTEG PL would benefit TGL PL’s profitability. As for the latter argument, I find that disagreements between Gary and the appellants about how to carry on the business of TGL PL are not inconsistent with the appellants knowing that TGL PL was carried on for the Fraudulent Purpose. This was an issue of implementation rather than direction. Furthermore, it is not necessary that the appellants had to be on the exact same page as Gary in relation to TGL PL’s business model or possess the same specific intent as him. All that is necessary is that they knew enough to be aware that TGL PL did not have any substantive profit generating business and lacked any sustainable means to honour its payment and buyback obligations, and carried on the business of TGL PL knowing this.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">TGL PL’s winding up</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 By August 2010, the appellants were aware that TGL PL was facing serious cashflow problems as a result of what they believed to be Gary’s refusal to run the Formula on its behalf. Despite this, the appellants bought out FTEG PL’s shares in TGL PL for $500,000 on 3 September 2010 and initiated a winding up of TGL PL on 7 October 2010. The appellants contend that these actions were borne out of a desire to responsibly cease the Gold Buyback Scheme, which by this time had proven unprofitable.

From the very beginning, the appellants had reason to doubt the viability of TGL PL’s business model, which was borrowed from Genneva SB and TGL SB. They were concerned that Genneva SB’s business model was potentially illegal, and that TGL SB’s business model was financially unsustainable in the long run. The appellants’ inquiries to local authorities through WongPartnership could not have allayed these concerns. An inaccurate description of TGL PL’s business model was presented to WongPartnership, and no advice was sought on the viability of the business model itself, as opposed to its compliance with regulatory requirements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 What the appellants understood of TGL PL’s business model was that the individual gold buyback contracts were inherently loss-making if clients elected to exercise their Sell-Back Options. They had no reason to believe clients would not exercise these options. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 As such, the appellants were aware that in order to earn profit from these loss-making contracts, the liquidity generated in the interim had to be invested. They knew that no investment was in fact made. They knew that the incoming cashflow from new contracts was not invested with external parties or used to buy gold for investment. They knew that cashflow was funnelled into yet more loss-making gold buyback contracts. The appellants were also aware that to the extent the Formula existed, it consisted of mere internal transfers between TGL PL’s bank accounts and could not be a source of profit. The appellants thus knew that TGL PL could not generate profit through either its loss-making buyback contracts or other forms of investments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 Noting my observation at [76] in addition to the above, it is clear that the appellants did not have in mind any plausible mechanism by which they believed that TGL PL would generate profit. They continued to carry on the business of TGL PL despite this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 Yet another consideration that strengthens my conclusion as to the appellants’ knowledge is that even if the appellants were not aware that no investment was in fact being made by TGL PL, they (i) would have had sufficient incentive to verify that TGL PL’s business model was sustainable, (ii) would have good reason to doubt that TGL PL’s business model was sustainable, (iii) would have known that the investment of TGL PL’s cashflow was (based on their understanding of its business model) the sole determinant of its sustainability, and (iv) had access to sufficient information in the form of the Daily Reports to verify whether investments were in fact being made. In view of all these factors, the appellants’ claimed ignorance about the lack of investment of TGL PL’s cashflow was effectively turning a blind eye to the obvious. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 Reviewing the evidence as a whole, I thus find that the appellants were knowingly parties to the carrying on of TGL PL’s business for the Fraudulent Purpose, as they knew that it sold gold bars under a buyback scheme promising returns when in fact it did not operate any substantive profit generating business and had no sustainable means to honour its payment and buyback obligations.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 Very much contrary to James’ understanding, however, the DJ did not regard the appellants’ reduction of directors’ fees, notwithstanding Gary’s objection, as an aggravating factor. Rather, he inferred from this episode that the appellants exercised overriding control and authority over TGL PL.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-3188fc4a-7c6a-4ea3-b257-9a371b321c69" data-toggle="modal" type="button">252</button></sup>

</div>
</div>
</div> It was this control and authority which the DJ regarded as an aggravating factor. In any event, the DJ also observed that the appellants had used their control and authority over TGL PL to enrich themselves, for instance in paying commissions to SWM PL’s sales agents despite Gary’s threat to stop doing so.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 In my view, therefore, the DJ was entitled to regard the appellants as more culpable than Gary in their commission of the offence, and to justify an uplift from Gary’s sentence on this basis.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The mitigating weight of Gary’s plea of guilt</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 Not only did the DJ find the appellants more culpable than Gary, he was also of the view that Gary’s sentence would have factored in a sentencing discount on account of his plea of guilt. A higher sentence as against the appellants could therefore be justified on the basis that, having claimed trial, no such discount was available to them. Although no written grounds were issued by the sentencing court in Gary’s case, the DJ considered that his plea of guilt had saved significant judicial and prosecutorial resources. In the first place, it had obviated the need to prove his charge via a trial. Moreover, and significantly, it had averted the need for a re-trial of the appellants’ ongoing case. Considering that the appellants’ joint trial eventually lasted 29 days, the amount of resources saved was significant. Conversely, had Gary elected instead to claim trial, the DJ surmised he might have been sentenced to three and a half to almost four years’ imprisonment.

</div>
</div> However, this misunderstands the basis on which, according to the DJ, Gary would have received a sentencing discount for his plea of guilt. The DJ did not suggest that Gary’s plea of guilt was a genuine expression of remorse. Indeed he noted that the Prosecution, in its sentencing submissions against Gary, had argued that Gary’s plea of guilt could not be so regarded.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-e57d48cb-af12-4e12-b609-e31732db1aff" data-toggle="modal" type="button">256</button></sup>

</div>
</div> Instead, the DJ justified the putative sentencing discount entirely by reference to the resources which Gary’s plea of guilt had saved. Although Sue argues that state resources were also expended on Gary’s capture and arrest,

</div> the DJ cannot be said to have been plainly wrong in forming the view that Gary’s conduct led, on balance, to the saving of state resources, and that his sentence would therefore have factored in a sentencing discount.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 All in all, having regard to the appellants’ higher level of culpability for the offence, as well as the unavailability of any sentencing discount in view of their decision to claim trial, I am of the view that an uplift from Gary’s sentence was amply justified and was not at odds with the principle of parity.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sue’s compliance with her bail conditions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 Yet another argument brought by Sue is that the DJ erred in failing to credit her strict compliance with the conditions of her bail.

In support of this argument, Sue cites the Court of Appeal’s recent guidance in in <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v BWJ</span> [2023] SGCA 2 (“<span class="font-italic">BWJ</span>”) at [43]:

The question is how much credit should be given and that depends of course on an assessment of the merits of compliance in individual cases.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 <span class="font-italic">Per</span> the Court of Appeal’s guidance, the amount of credit to be given to an offender’s compliance turns on “an assessment of the merits of compliance in individual cases”. In <span class="font-italic">BWJ</span>, the offender was “a foreigner with hardly any roots in Singapore”. After his acquittal in the High Court on a charge of aggravated rape under sections 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 375(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), he was released on bail pending the Prosecution’s appeal against his acquittal. For two years and two months subsequently, the offender was not permitted to work. He was also not allowed to return to Malaysia until he was granted permission to attend the funeral of his brother. At the court’s direction, he then dutifully returned to Singapore for the hearing of the Prosecution’s appeal even though the offence with which he had been charged carried a heavy imprisonment term with mandatory caning of at least 12 strokes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 Placing some emphasis on the offender’s “special circumstances” in determining the appropriate sentence (<span class="font-italic">BWJ</span> at [107]), the Court of Appeal noted both the offender’s restricted freedom while on bail and his dutiful conditions with his bail conditions. Thus, despite setting aside the offender’s acquittal and convicting him on the charge, the offender received a reduction of his indicative imprisonment term from 14 to 13 years in addition to 12 strokes of the cane (<span class="font-italic">BWJ</span> at [98]–[103]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 As for Sue, I agree that some credit ought to be given to her compliance in remaining in Singapore for court proceedings, where she has had to pay rent and has not been permitted to work. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 However, I note that on the facts Sue seems to have much deeper roots in Singapore than the offender in <span class="font-italic">BWJ</span>, having worked in TGL PL and travelled to Singapore frequently during the period of her involvement with it. In any event, given the preceding analysis, and Sue’s higher level of involvement than James in the sales operations of TGL PL, I am satisfied that Sue’s sentence is not manifestly excessive even after taking into account this factor.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 In mathematics, the multiplication of a negative integer by a positive integer can, on occasion, result in a positive product. This happens when the product of the equation is expressed as an absolute value. In this case, TGL PL’s product was merely a cloak for a money circulation scheme. It provided absolutely no value at all to its customers or society at large. The only semblance of profitability that arose from this enterprise were the illicit profits obtained fraudulently by James and Sue. It was, borne out by the evidence, that TGL PL was carried out for a fraudulent purpose.
