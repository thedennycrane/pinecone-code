<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The central question in this application
                    concerns the applicability of the bilateral investment treaty
                    (“BIT”) between the People’s Republic of China
                    (“PRC”) and the Lao People’s Democratic Republic
                    (“Laos”) to the Macau Special Administrative Region of China
                    (“Macau”). The second issue that arises concerns the
                    interpretation of the dispute resolution article in that treaty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff is the Government of Laos while
                    the defendant, Sanum Investments Limited, is a company incorporated in Macau.
                    The defendant made certain investments in the gaming and hospitality industry in
                    Laos. Disputes subsequently arose in relation to those investments and the
                    defendant ultimately commenced arbitration proceedings against the plaintiff.
                    The plaintiff disputed the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal (“the
                    Tribunal”) on the basis that the BIT did not apply to Macau but the
                    Tribunal held otherwise. The plaintiff then brought the present application to
                    refer the issue of jurisdiction to the High Court under s 10 of the
                    International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the
                    IAA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The pertinent facts of the present application
                    are generally not in dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background facts and the relevant international instruments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Prior to its handover to the PRC in 1999, Macau
                    was considered “Chinese territory”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> over which Portugal
                    exercised administrative power.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> After the handover, the PRC “resumed
                        sovereignty”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> over Macau and established it as a special
                    administrative region.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The handover was not an unforeseen event. In
                    1987, the PRC and Portugal signed a joint declaration on the question of Macau
                    (“the 1987 PRC-Portugal Joint Declaration”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Art 1 of the declaration provided that the
                    PRC would resume the exercise of sovereignty over Macau with effect from 20
                    December 1999. Art 2 declared the PRC’s one country, two systems principle
                    and laid down in broad terms the PRC’s basic policies regarding Macau to
                    be pursued in accordance with that principle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 31 January 1993, the BIT between the PRC and
                    Laos was signed (“the PRC-Laos BIT”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The treaty does not mention whether the
                    provisions therein extend to Macau.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       A week before the handover of Macau to the PRC,
                    on 13 December 1999, the PRC informed the United Nations Security-General
                    (“UNSG”) of the status of Macau in relation to the treaties
                    deposited with the UNSG.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 20 December 1999, the PRC resumed its
                    exercise of sovereignty over Macau.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s investment in Laos</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The facts surrounding the defendant’s
                    investment in Laos and the alleged expropriation of its investments by the
                    plaintiff are disputed. However, as the <em>merits</em> of
                    the defendant’s expropriation claim are not relevant to the present
                    application, I shall only briefly summarise the key events to provide the
                    factual backdrop to this application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 14 July 2005, the defendant was
                    incorporated under the laws of Macau. In 2007, the defendant began investing in
                    the gaming and hospitality industry of Laos through a joint venture with a
                    Laotian entity. Disputes subsequently arose between the defendant and the
                    Laotian entity. The defendant commenced arbitral proceedings by a notice of
                    arbitration under the PRC-Laos BIT on 14 August 2012, alleging, amongst other
                    things, that the plaintiff deprived them of the benefits from its capital
                    investment by the imposition of unfair and discriminatory taxes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In its notice of arbitration, the defendant
                    argued that it fell within the definition of “investor” under Art
                    1(2)(b) of the PRC-Laos BIT because it was incorporated in Macau.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> This gave rise to the plaintiff’s
                    preliminary objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. In particular, the
                    plaintiff argued that the territorial scope of the PRC-Laos BIT did not include
                    Macau and that the defendant’s claims were not arbitrable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 13 December 2013, the Tribunal delivered
                    its award on jurisdiction. It held that the PRC-Laos BIT applied to Macau and
                    that it had the jurisdiction to arbitrate the defendant’s expropriation
                    claims under Art 8(3) of the PRC-Laos BIT.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     I note in passing that on the same day that
                    arbitral proceedings leading to the present application were commenced by the
                    defendant, <em>separate</em> arbitral proceedings were
                    commenced by the defendant’s parent company incorporated in the
                    Netherlands pursuant to the BIT concluded between the Netherlands and Laos in
                        2005.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> It therefore appears that the
                    defendant is pursuing two claims under two BITs in relation to the same subject
                    matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The present proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The plaintiff filed the present application,
                    Originating Summons No 24 of 2014 (“OS 24/2014”), on 10 January
                    2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 19 February 2014, the plaintiff filed
                    Summons No 884 of 2014 (“SUM 884/2014”) praying for the admission
                    of two diplomatic letters (“the Two Letters”) that were exhibited
                    in Outakeo Keodouangsinh’s affidavit of 19 February 2014. The first letter
                    dated 7 January 2014 (“the Laos Letter”) was sent from the Laotian
                    Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the PRC Embassy in Vientiane, Laos.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The letter stated Laos’ view that the
                    PRC-Laos BIT did not extend to Macau and sought the views of the PRC Government
                    on the same. The second letter dated 9 January 2014 (“the PRC
                    Letter”) was the reply from the PRC Embassy in Vientiane, Laos stating
                    its view that the PRC-Laos BIT did not apply to Macau “unless both China
                    and Laos make separate arrangements in the future”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 11 April 2014, I heard SUM 884/2014 and
                    granted the prayers therein, subject to the defendant’s right to object to
                    admissibility at the hearing of OS 24/2014. The defendant raised the issue of
                    admissibility of the Two Letters and this will be addressed below at
                    [38]–[56].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The plaintiff’s submissions can be
                    summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     The PRC-Laos BIT does not apply to
                        Macau and official correspondence between the two states confirms this. The
                        other pieces of positive evidence point towards the same
                    conclusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        defendant’s expropriation claims exceed the scope of the agreement to
                        arbitrate under the PRC-Laos BIT; Art 8(3) of the PRC-Laos BIT only applies
                        to disputes involving the quantum of compensation payable to
                        investors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The defendant’s submissions can be
                    summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     The application raises only
                        questions of pure international law which are not justiciable by the court.
                        Singapore is not a party to the PRC-Laos BIT and the issues involving the
                        interpretation of international treaties have nothing to do with Singapore
                        domestic law. Even if the issues are justiciable, the standard of review is
                        a limited one of deference and respect for the Tribunal.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Two Letters should not be admitted
                        as further evidence for the present application because the plaintiff has
                        not satisfied any of the <em>Ladd v Marshall</em>
                        conditions.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     According to the moving treaty frontiers rule in international law, the
                        PRC-Laos BIT is presumed to apply to Macau because it formed part of the
                        territory of PRC from 20 December 1999 upon the restoration of Chinese
                        sovereignty. None of the exceptions to this rule applies. Laos has failed to
                        establish that the PRC-Laos BIT does not apply to Macau.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Tribunal had the jurisdiction to
                        decide the defendant’s expropriation claims under Art 8(3) of the
                        PRC-Laos BIT.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     There are two preliminary issues to be
                    determined in this application:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the present application only
                        raises issues of international law which are
                    non-justiciable.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the Two Letters should be admitted as evidence in this
                        application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The two substantive issues arising in this
                    application are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the PRC-Laos BIT applies to
                        Macau.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether
                        the defendant’s expropriation claims fall outside the scope of Art
                        8(3) of the PRC-Laos BIT.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the present application only raises issues of international
                law which are non-justiciable</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The defendant submits that this application
                    only concerns questions of pure international law because it stems from an
                    investment treaty arbitration which operates on an international plane different
                    from typical international commercial arbitrations. It also argues that a
                    decision on the interpretation of the PRC-Laos BIT would potentially have
                    significant consequences for approximately 130 other BITs to which the PRC is
                    party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In adopting this position, the defendant
                    acknowledges that the courts may well find justiciable a question of
                    international law that in fact bears on the application of domestic law (see the
                    Singapore High Court decision of <em>Lee Hsien Loong v Review
                        Publishing Co Ltd and another and another suit</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R)
                    453 (“<em>Review Publishing</em>”) at
                    [98]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     However, the defendant attempts to distinguish
                        <em>Review Publishing</em> by pointing out that the
                    court there was only concerned with the procedure to be adopted when private
                    litigants wish to serve the process of the Singapore court on defendants
                    residing in Hong Kong under a treaty concluded between Singapore and the PRC.
                    The defendant further submits that Singapore is not a party to the PRC-Laos BIT
                    and the issues here have nothing to do with Singapore domestic
                law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     I am unable to accept the defendant’s
                    submission on the issue of justiciability. While it cannot be denied that
                    Singapore is not a party to the PRC-Laos BIT, it does not necessarily follow
                    that the issues in this application have nothing to do with a person’s
                    rights or duties under Singapore law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Here, the plaintiff is relying on s
                        10(3)(<em>a</em>) of the IAA, a Singapore statutory
                    provision, to seek a review of the Tribunal’s positive ruling on
                    jurisdiction. This issue evidently has a bearing on the application of Singapore
                    law and on the right of the plaintiff to have the Tribunal’s ruling on
                    jurisdiction reviewed by this court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     At the hearing before me, counsel for the
                    plaintiff, Mr Bull, referred me to the English Court of Appeal decision of
                        <em>Republic of Ecuador v Occidental Exploration and
                        Production Co</em> [2006] 2 WLR 70 (“<em>Occidental Exploration</em>”). In that case, the defendant, a
                    Californian corporation, sought tax reimbursements from the Ecuadorian tax
                    authorities. The authorities refused those claims and arbitration proceedings
                    were commenced under a BIT between the United States of America (“the
                    US”) and Ecuador. The arbitrators decided that London would be the place
                    of arbitration and subsequently held in favour of the defendant on all issues
                    except for one. Ecuador applied for the award to be set aside under the
                    Arbitration Act 1996 (c 23) (UK) (“the UK Arbitration Act”) while
                    the defendant challenged the court’s jurisdiction to determine the
                    application on the basis that the court would be required to interpret
                    provisions of the BIT which were non-justiciable in an English
                court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The court held that it had the jurisdiction to
                    interpret an international instrument where it was necessary to do so in order
                    to determine a person’s rights and duties under domestic law. In holding
                    that it did have the jurisdiction to interpret the BIT between Ecuador and the
                    US, the court took into account the special character of a BIT and the
                    parties’ agreement to arbitrate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In relation to the special character of a BIT,
                    the court held (at [32]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The treaty involves, on any view, a deliberate attempt to ensure for
                        private investors the benefits and protection of consensual arbitration; and
                        this is an aim which national courts should, in an internationalist spirit
                        and <em>because</em> it has been agreed between states
                        at an international level, aspire to give effect …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As for the parties’ agreement to
                    arbitrate, the court held that it was recognised under English private
                    international law and was subject to the UK Arbitration Act because London was
                    the place of arbitration. It was further held (at [46]) that the English courts
                    were being asked to interpret the scope of the agreement in order to give effect
                    to the rights and duties contained in the agreement to arbitrate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In my view, the reasoning and conclusions
                    reached in <em>Occidental Exploration</em> are applicable
                    to the facts of the present case. The present facts are similar to those found
                    in <em>Occidental Exploration</em> in two significant
                    respects: the international instrument to be interpreted here is also a BIT and
                    Singapore is not a party to the PRC-Laos BIT just as the UK was not party to the
                    US-Ecuador BIT. While there are undoubtedly differences between the dispute
                    resolution articles of the PRC-Laos BIT and those of the US-Ecuador BIT, there
                    is no dispute between the parties that the plaintiff was entitled to bring a
                    review of the Tribunal’s jurisdictional ruling under s 10 of the IAA. I am
                    therefore of the view that the present application does not raise questions of
                    international law that are non-justiciable; it concerns the rights of parties
                    seeking to invoke this court’s jurisdiction under s 10 of the IAA to
                    review the Tribunal’s ruling on jurisdiction. Put another way, I am unable
                    to determine the plaintiff’s rights under s 10 of the IAA without first
                    considering the issue of whether the PRC-Laos BIT applies to
                Macau.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Moreover, the issues raised in this
                    application do not concern the exercise of sovereign or legislative prerogative
                    in matters of high policy such as sovereign immunity, deployment of troops
                    overseas, boundary disputes or recognition of foreign governments (see <em>Review Publishing</em> at [100]). I am only concerned with
                    the legitimacy of the plaintiff’s challenge to the Tribunal’s
                    jurisdiction under s 10 of the IAA which in turn involves an interpretation of
                    the PRC-Laos BIT. Mr Yeo, on behalf of the defendant, raises an alternative
                    argument. He argues that even if the issue here is justiciable, the standard of
                    review is a limited one of deference and respect for the Tribunal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     I am unable to agree with Mr Yeo’s
                    submission because the standard of review under s 10 of the IAA and Art 16(3) of
                    the Model Law is generally regarded as <em>de novo</em>
                    (see the recent Court of Appeal decision of <em>PT First Media
                        TBK (formerly known as PT Broadband Multimedia TBK) v Astro Nusantara
                        International BV and others and another appeal</em> [2014] 1 SLR 372
                        (“<em>Astro</em>”)). In that case, the
                    Court of Appeal affirmed at [162]–[163] the <em>de
                        novo</em> standard of judicial review which entailed a fresh
                    examination of the issue of joinder and jurisdiction decided by the arbitral
                    tribunal in its award on preliminary issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Mr Yeo attempted to distinguish <em>Astro</em> on the basis that the dispute there was a
                    commercial one unlike the present investor-state arbitration which concerned the
                    interpretation of international treaties. There is, to my mind, no principled
                    basis for such a distinction presented by Mr Yeo: nothing in <em>Astro</em> indicates that a different standard of review is to apply
                    to a challenge under s 10 of the IAA on jurisdiction involving investor-state
                    arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     It was also argued in the defendant’s
                    written submissions that the qualifications and expertise of the arbitral
                    tribunal counselled against the adoption by this court of anything other than a
                    limited review of the Tribunal’s positive jurisdictional
                        ruling.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     While I had no reason to doubt the eminence or
                    expertise of the Tribunal, this does not mean that a limited standard of review
                    is appropriate. The defendant’s submission, if taken to its logical
                    conclusion, would mean that there would be a varying standard of review in every
                    application under s 10 of the IAA depending on the relative expertise and
                    qualifications of the High Court Judge hearing the application as compared to
                    that of the arbitral tribunal members. That cannot be the case; there is nothing
                    in s 10 of the IAA or <em>Astro</em> that supports the
                    defendant’s submission in this regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     For these reasons, I dismiss the
                    defendant’s objection that the issues in this application are
                    non-justiciable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     There is one final ancillary point I wish to
                    deal with before considering the evidence tendered by the parties. Public
                    international law is not technically foreign law which needs to be proved by
                    expert evidence. It was therefore not strictly necessary for the parties to file
                    Prof Chesterman’s and Sir Daniel Bethlehem’s affidavits. However, I
                    found them helpful in crystallising the issues and the parties’ positions
                    on those issues for the purposes of the present application, and I was therefore
                    happy to accept them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Two Letters should be admitted as evidence in this
                application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The Two Letters constituted a key plank of the
                    plaintiff’s case and therefore it came as no surprise that Mr Yeo devoted
                    a substantial portion of his oral submissions to argue that the Two Letters
                    should not be admitted as evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     It is apposite to set out the full text of the

                        China’s policy of one country, two systems, its constitutional and
                        legal framework, the Basic Law of [Macau] as well as the fact that the
                        Agreement itself is silent on its extension to [Macau], which returned to
                        the sovereignty of the People’s Republic of China in 1999, six years

                        follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In accordance with the &lt;&lt;Basic Law of [Macau]&gt;&gt;, the
                        Government of [Macau] may, with the authorisation of the Central

                        its own with foreign states and regions; in principle the bilateral
                        investment agreements concluded by the Central People’s Government are

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In view of the foregoing, [the PRC-Laos BIT] concluded in Vientiane on 31

                        separate arrangements in the future.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We avail ourselves of this opportunity to express to you the assurances of
                        our highest consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Mr Yeo contends that the <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> conditions are applicable here (or, in the
                    alternative, relevant) and that the plaintiff has not satisfied any of the
                    conditions for the admission of the Two Letters. In particular, Mr Yeo contends
                    that Laos could have but did not obtain the Two Letters with reasonable
                    diligence and that there was no evidence of any communications between the two
                    countries even though Laos claimed that it was reaching out to the PRC
                    government a year ago in April 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     At the hearing before me, Mr Yeo raised doubts
                    as to the authenticity and credibility of the PRC Letter as there was no
                    reference to the author’s department or designation and there was no
                    indication that a PRC governmental entity was involved in its preparation. He
                    also mentioned that the translation provided by the plaintiff was suspicious
                    because the PRC national emblem that appeared in the second letter was also
                    affixed to the translation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the Ladd v Marshall principles apply</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The <em>Ladd v
                        Marshall</em> principles do not strictly apply in this application.
                    Section 37(4) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed)
                    states that the Court of Appeal should not receive further evidence, except in
                    relation to an interlocutory order, unless there are “special
                    grounds” (see also O 57 r 13 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014
                    Rev Ed)). The expression, “special grounds”, has been judicially
                    interpreted to mean the three conditions of <em>Ladd v
                        Marshall</em> (see the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>Lassiter Ann Masters v To Keng Lam (alias Toh Jeanette)</em>
                    [2004] 2 SLR(R) 392 (“<em>Lassiter Ann
                    Masters</em>”) at [22]). I note that there is no equivalent
                    provision for an originating summons commenced in the High Court or, more
                    specifically, in relation to a review by the High Court of a jurisdictional
                    ruling under s 10 of the IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     However, a party does not in my view have a
                    full unconditional power to adduce fresh evidence at will. As observed in
                        <em>Lassiter Ann Masters</em> at [26], the court has
                    discretion whether to admit such evidence and reasonable conditions must be set.
                    In exercising this discretion, I thought it appropriate to refer to the three
                    conditions of the <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> test, with a
                    slightly less stringent first condition (see <em>Lassiter Ann
                        Masters</em> at [24]). Applying these conditions, fresh evidence may
                    be admitted if:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_a"></a>(a)     the party seeking to admit the
                        evidence demonstrates sufficiently strong reasons why the evidence was not
                        adduced at the arbitration hearing;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_b"></a>(b)     the evidence if admitted would probably have an important
                        influence on the result of the case though it need not be decisive;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        evidence must be apparently credible though it need not be
                        incontrovertible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In relation to the first modified <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> condition, Mr Bull’s argument is
                    essentially that the diplomatic communications between PRC and Laos took time
                    and effort to bear fruit and the Two Letters could not have been produced at an
                    earlier date. Mr Yeo on the other hand argues that Laos could have obtained a
                    response from the PRC government much earlier since it only took two days for
                    the PRC government to respond to the Laos Letter. Mr Yeo further submits that
                    the plaintiff was entirely silent on their efforts to obtain the Two Letters
                    between April 2013 when the intention to challenge the Tribunal’s
                    challenge was made by the plaintiff and the issuance of the arbitral award in
                    December 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Mr David J Branson, counsel for the plaintiff
                    in the arbitration proceedings, sent an email dated 19 April 2013 to the
                    Tribunal explaining the plaintiff’s position on various procedural issues
                    in the arbitration. It was also stated in the email that<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Further the Government is having difficulty reconstructing the history of
                        the [PRC-Laos BIT]. It is also reaching out to the PRC through diplomatic
                        channels, but it is difficult to know how quickly there can be a response.
                        It would be important to have the PRC view if it can be obtained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The Laos Letter dated 7 January 2014 (see [39] above) made
                        reference to two prior meetings between high-ranking officials of the
                        plaintiff and the PRC government on 27 December 2013 and 3 January
                            2014.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     While Mr Yeo is technically correct to point
                    out that not much was said after the 19 April 2013 email, I do not think that
                    the plaintiff had a continuing duty to update the Tribunal on whether its
                    efforts to reach out to PRC through diplomatic channels had borne any fruit.
                    Leaving aside the issue of credibility of the Two Letters which I shall come to
                    at [51] below, I would infer from the two meetings mentioned in the 7 January
                    2014 letter that the plaintiff must have engaged in some form of diplomatic
                    communications or discussions in the period of time leading up to the
                    meetings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In addition, I am unable to agree with Mr
                    Yeo’s assertion that the short time it took the PRC government to respond
                    to the Laos Letter was evidence that the PRC Letter could have been obtained
                    much earlier. This assertion places undue emphasis on the Two Letters themselves
                    when the circumstances leading up to the Two Letters must be looked at in its
                    entirety. In my judgment, the Two Letters should be viewed as the culmination of
                    communications and meetings between the plaintiff and the PRC government which
                    undoubtedly took some time. Moreover, the Two Letters constitute evidence that
                    could possibly have been used in the plaintiff’s favour in the arbitration
                    proceedings. It thus seems to me highly unlikely that the plaintiff
                    intentionally dragged out the entire process of obtaining the Two Letters to
                    their own detriment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Reviewing the entire circumstances leading up
                    to the Two Letters including 19 April 2013 email, the two meetings in December
                    2013 and January 2014 as well as the Two Letters themselves, I accept the
                    plaintiff’s explanation that time was needed for diplomatic communications
                    and discussions to take place between the plaintiff and the PRC government. It
                    seems to me that the plaintiff could have perhaps <em>tried</em> to obtain the Two Letters earlier but there was no
                    evidence before me to suggest that they <em>would</em> have
                    obtained the letters earlier had they done so. I am also mindful that the first
                    condition of the modified <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> test is
                    to be applied in a less stringent fashion on the facts of the present
                    application (see [44] above). On balance therefore, I find that the first
                    requirement has been satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The second requirement of whether the Two
                    Letters would probably have an important influence on the result of this
                    application can be dealt with briefly. I think they do have an important
                    influence because they are indicative of the parties’ intentions in
                    drafting the PRC-Laos BIT and this goes towards answering the central question
                    of whether the PRC-Laos BIT applied to Macau. The Two Letters are also relevant
                    in determining whether under Art 29 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of
                    Treaties 1969 (“VCLT”) and Art 15(b) of the Vienna Convention on
                    the Succession of States in respect of Treaties 1978 (“VCST”) it
                    is “otherwise established” that the PRC-Laos BIT does not apply to
                    Macau. In deciding whether to admit the Two Letters, I do not have to make a
                    conclusive determination on the numerous issues raised by the defendant –
                    all I had to decide was whether, if admitted, the Two Letters would <em>probably</em> have an important influence on the result of
                    this application. Therefore, in my view, the second requirement is satisfied as
                    well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     I turn to the final requirement of whether the
                    Two Letters are apparently credible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     I first address Mr Yeo’s submissions
                    regarding the translation of the PRC Letter. In my judgment, there is nothing
                    suspicious or sinister about the appearance of the PRC emblem in the
                    plaintiff’s translation of the second letter. It is the <em>text</em> of the translation that is of relevance to the present
                    dispute and I do not think there is any contention on the part of the defendant
                    that the translation provided by the plaintiff was inaccurate or incorrect.
                    Indeed, as pointed out by Mr Bull, there is no material difference between the
                    translations furnished by the two parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Mr Yeo also raises doubts as to the
                    authenticity and credibility of the PRC Letter because there is no mention of
                    the author’s designation and no record of the author’s signature in
                    the letter. The response time of two days, according to Mr Yeo, suggests that no
                    consultation with any PRC governmental authority was undertaken.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     With respect, there is simply no evidence to
                    support Mr Yeo’s submission that no consultation took place. His view is
                    premised on a certain subjective opinion of standard diplomatic practice which
                    has not been substantiated by factual or expert evidence. I certainly do not
                    think either Mr Yeo or Sir Daniel is an expert on PRC diplomatic practice and
                    they were not holding themselves out to be experts in that field.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     More importantly, Mr Alounkeo Kittikhoun,
                    Laos’ Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, has filed an affidavit attesting
                    to the authenticity of the Two Letters<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> and I
                    have no reason to doubt the authenticity or veracity of Mr Kittikhoun’s
                    affidavit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In the circumstances, I think that the Two
                    Letters satisfied the requirement of apparent credibility as well as the two
                    other requirements discussed above and accordingly admitted them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 1: Whether the PRC-Laos BIT applies to Macau</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The focus of the parties’ submissions
                    was on the central issue of whether the PRC-Laos BIT applies to
                Macau.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Both parties are agreed that Art 29 of the
                    VCLT and Art 15 of the VCST are relevant in determining whether the PRC-Laos BIT
                    applies to Macau.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Art 29 of the VCLT enshrines the
                    “moving treaty frontiers” rule and provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1"><div align="center">

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>

                            territory would be incompatible with the object and purpose of the
                            treaty or would radically change the conditions for its
                            operation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     It is pertinent to note that although the PRC
                    and Laos are parties to the VCLT, they are <em>not</em>
                    parties to the VCST. Nevertheless, the parties are agreed that both articles are
                    rules of customary international law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The effect of Art 29 of the VCLT and Art 15 of
                    the VCST is that a treaty is binding on the entire territory of each contracting
                    state unless it (a) appears from the treaty; or (b) is otherwise established
                    that the contracting states had intended otherwise. I note that Art 15 of the
                    VCST is more specific in that the object and purpose of the treaty would also be
                    considered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     On the present facts, the PRC-Laos BIT is
                        <em>prima facie</em> applicable to the entire
                    territories of Laos and the PRC which undisputedly includes Macau unless it
                    appears from the treaty or is otherwise established that the contracting states
                    had intended otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     There is no dispute that the general rule
                    applies and the submissions of the parties are primarily directed at the two
                    exceptions to the rule. I should mention at the outset that it is difficult to
                    see any credible basis for the first exception, <em>viz</em>, that a contrary intention <em>appears from
                        the treaty</em> because the PRC-Laos BIT is silent on whether it
                    applies to Macau. It does not state positively that the treaty applies to Macau;
                    nor does it exclude Macau from its scope of application (<em>cf</em> the PRC-Russia BIT signed in 2006 discussed at [79] below). I
                    therefore agree with the Tribunal’s conclusion that “no definite
                    conclusion” can be drawn from the silence in the PRC-Laos
                        BIT.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The plaintiff submits that the first exception
                    has been established. They argue that the Two Letters establish a subsequent
                    agreement within the meaning of Art 31(3)(<em>a</em>) of
                    the VCLT which provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1"><div align="center">Article 31 General Rule of Interpretation</div>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    There shall be taken into account, together with

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>a</em>) Any subsequent agreement between the
                        parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I think this submission should properly be analysed under the
                        second exception because even if there were a subsequent agreement showing
                        that the contracting states did not intend for the treaty to apply to Macau,
                        this would not constitute a contrary intention that appears <em>from the treaty</em>. I therefore considered this
                        submission as well as the rest of the parties’ submissions on the
                        various documents under the second exception instead.</p>

                    and academic writings were tendered by parties to support their respective
                    cases. I shall discuss them in the following order to determine whether the
                    second exception has been fulfilled, <em>ie</em>, whether
                    it has been otherwise established that the PRC-Laos BIT does not apply to

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Two Letters</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     I note as a preliminary point that the Two
                    Letters were not available for the Tribunal’s consideration because they
                    were only obtained after the Tribunal had handed down its award. This sequence
                    of events was unfortunate because the Tribunal lamented at [232] of its
                        award<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> that they did not have very much to go on
                    in terms of evidence:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A first remark to be made by the Tribunal is the difficulty it faced in
                        ascertaining the application or non-application of the PRC/Laos BIT to
                        [Macau] due to the paucity of factual elements presented by the Parties:
                        there were no affidavits from the PRC, Laos or [Macau], which could probably
                        have been obtained from the respective authorities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     I have already set out the full text of the
                    Two Letters above at [39]–[40]. Mr Yeo contends that the Two Letters are
                    irrelevant as a matter of international law because the plaintiff is seeking to
                    admit them after proceedings had been commenced on 14 August 2012, <em>ie</em>, the critical date. According to Mr Yeo and the
                    defendant’s expert, Professor Shan, it is the PRC government’s
                    intent at the moment of <em>handover</em> that is relevant
                    and their intent <em>today</em> is of no
                        relevance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     However, this contention seems to ignore Art
                        31(3)(<em>a</em>) of the VCLT which allows subsequent
                    agreements between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the
                    application of its provisions to be taken into account. The defendant’s
                    response in its written submissions is that there was in fact no evidence that
                    the relevant PRC authority was involved in the PRC Letter. In substance, this
                    argument goes towards the credibility of the PRC Letter which already has been
                    addressed above at [51].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In my judgment, the Two Letters signify an
                    agreement under Art 31(3)(<em>a</em>) of the VCLT between
                    PRC and Laos that the PRC-Laos BIT does not apply to Macau.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The High Court in <em>Review
                        Publishing</em> faced a similar issue. The question that arose before
                    Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) was whether the Treaty on Judicial
                    Assistance in Civil and Commercial Matters between the Republic of Singapore and
                    the People’s Republic of China (28 April 1997), GN No T2/2001, Bilateral
                    Treaty No B459 (ratified by Singapore 29 April 1998) (“the Singapore-PRC
                    JAT”) applied to Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In holding that the Singapore-PRC JAT did not
                    apply to Hong Kong, Menon JC relied on a letter from the Ministry of Foreign
                    Affairs, Singapore (“the MFA”) which stated that the Hong Kong
                    Department of Justice had confirmed that the Singapore-PRC JAT treaty was not
                    applicable to Hong Kong. He went on to hold (at [124]) that the views of the MFA
                    and the Hong Kong Department of Justice weighed strongly in favour of the
                    respondent’s position that the Singapore-PRC JAT treaty did not apply to
                    Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Mr Yeo raises a series of objections to the
                    application of Art 31(3)(<em>a</em>) of the VCLT and the
                    characterisation of the Two Letters as a subsequent agreement. He first argues
                    that the PRC Letter is at best a statement on the interpretation and effect of
                    Art 138 of the Macau Basic Law and “has nothing to do with the
                    interpretation of the PRC-Laos BIT under international law”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     This argument is without merit. To begin with,
                    Art 138 is not even mentioned in the Two Letters. The Laos Letter states that
                    the Basic Law of Macau is <em>one</em> of the reasons for
                    the non-applicability of the PRC-Laos BIT to Macau. The other reasons include
                    the policy of one country, two systems and the constitutional and legal
                    framework of PRC. In response, the PRC Letter refers to the Laos Letter and
                    states that bilateral investment agreements concluded by PRC are not applicable
                    to Macau. In other words, Mr Yeo has conflated the agreement reached between the
                    contracting states with the <em>reasons</em> furnished for
                    that agreement. Reading the Two Letters as a whole, it is clear that there is an
                    agreement between PRC and Laos that the PRC-Laos BIT does not apply to
                    Macau.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Mr Yeo also argues in his written submissions
                    that fairness and due process militate against the consideration of the Two
                    Letters. He further argues that if the wording in the PRC Letter was taken as
                    indicative of the PRC’s intent regarding the application of PRC BITs to
                    Macau, this would deprive Macanese investors and foreign investors in Macau of
                    the protections of nearly 130 PRC BITs and disrupt a stable legal framework for
                    investment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     I note that the High Court in <em>Review Publishing</em> did not think that any unfairness or
                    lack of due process would result from taking into consideration the MFA letter
                    that was obtained after proceedings had begun. This however is not conclusive
                    since this argument may not have been taken up by the parties there.
                    Nevertheless, I do not think it is entirely clear how unfairness or lack of due
                    process would result in the light of Art 31(3)(<em>a</em>)
                    of the VCLT which allows subsequent agreements to be taken into account. If Art
                        31(3)(<em>a</em>) is of general application to most
                    treaties, then parties relying on the provisions of BITs would be forewarned
                    that subsequent agreements could potentially affect the interpretation of the
                    treaty provisions. In any case, the PRC government would have been fully aware
                    of the implications of their opinion as stated in the PRC Letter especially
                    since it was worded in <em>general</em> terms. This
                    categorical approach suggests to me that the position adopted in the letter was
                    a confirmation of the status quo rather than a dramatic upheaval of the current
                    expectations held by states which have treaties with PRC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In my judgment, the Two Letters did not amount
                    to a <em>retroactive</em> agreement that altered the
                    positions and expectations of third parties such as the defendant. From the way
                    that the PRC Letter was worded, it appears that the non-applicability of the
                    PRC-Laos BIT to Macau was not a dramatic change of position but was rather an
                    affirmation of the common understanding between the states that the treaty from
                    its inception did not apply to Macau.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The Two Letters therefore strongly support the
                    plaintiff’s claim that the PRC-Laos BIT did not apply to
                Macau.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Other BITs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The defendant also relies on cl 1 of the
                    PRC-Russia BIT concluded in 2006 which specifically excludes Hong Kong and Macau
                    from its application. In the absence of any such exclusionary clause in the
                    PRC-Laos BIT, the defendant argues that the treaty was intended to apply to
                    Macau. Even though Macau was not part of the territory of the PRC in 1993 when
                    the PRC-Laos BIT was signed (as opposed to the situation in 2006), the defendant
                    submits that the parties were well aware that Macau would be handed over to PRC
                    in 1999 according to the terms of the 1987 PRC-Portugal Joint
                    Declaration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     In my judgment, the absence of an express
                    exclusion for Macau post-handover does <em>not</em> lead
                    inevitably to the conclusion that the PRC-Laos BIT must apply to Macau. As
                    pointed out by the Tribunal, while the imminent handover was well known to both
                    the PRC and Laos<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>, they may have thought it
                    unnecessary to exclude Macau because the PRC did not at that time exercise
                    sovereignty over Macau.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The plaintiff also argues that the PRC and
                    Laos may not have considered it necessary to expressly state in the PRC-Laos BIT
                    that its provisions do not apply to Macau because there was a common
                    understanding between them that the treaty did not extend to Macau.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> To support this view the plaintiff cites
                    the Two Letters as evidence of this common understanding. I am inclined to
                    accept this contention. As I have already made observations on the Two Letters
                    above at [67]–[78], I need not repeat them here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     To conclude, the PRC-Russia BIT does not
                    advance either party’s case in any meaningful way.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     I turn now to four other BITs which were cited
                    by the Tribunal, namely, the PRC-Portugal BIT, the PRC-Netherlands BIT, the
                    Macau-Portugal BIT and the Macau-Netherlands BIT. The Tribunal found that the
                    provisions in these BITs were very similar to that found in the PRC-Laos
                        BIT.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> In particular, the Tribunal found that the
                    articles on the settlement of investment disputes are the substantially the
                    same. The Tribunal opined that these similarities tend to prove that the rules
                    of the PRC-Laos BIT were compatible with their application in Macau and there
                    was no need to reject them for their incompatibility with the capitalist
                    economic system. The defendant aligned itself with the Tribunal’s opinion
                    by arguing that allowing Macanese investors to benefit from both sets of BITs
                    would enhance the object and purpose of BITs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     In response, the plaintiff raises Art 1 of the
                    Mexico-PRC BIT which defines the territory of the PRC. According to the
                    plaintiff, this definition is virtually identical with that found in the
                    PRC-Netherlands BIT. However, the Mexico-PRC BIT contains a footnote which
                    states that the governments of Hong Kong and Macau can separately negotiate and
                    enter into BITs with Mexico. This, so the argument goes, would have been
                    entirely unnecessary if the Mexico-PRC BIT automatically applies to Hong Kong
                    and Macau.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The flaw in the plaintiff’s reasoning is
                    that the footnote is strictly speaking irrelevant to the issue of whether the
                    PRC-Laos BIT applies to Macau. It does not suggest, one way or the other,
                    whether the Mexico-PRC BIT applies to Macau. Consider the following two
                    scenarios. In the first, the Mexico-PRC BIT applies to Macau. The footnote would
                    then be a confirmation of Macau’s right to enter into <em>additional</em> BITs with Mexico just as Macau has entered into BITs
                    with Portugal and Netherlands even though the PRC already has parallel treaties
                    with those countries. In the second alternative scenario where the Mexico-PRC
                    BIT does <em>not</em> apply to Macau, this does not prevent
                    Macau from entering into its own BITs with Mexico. In short, the citation of the
                    footnote in the Mexico-PRC BIT by the plaintiff does not advance their case in
                    any way.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     In a similar vein, I do not think any
                    definitive conclusions can be drawn from the existence of the four parallel
                    BITs. While it is undoubtedly correct to conclude that investors would benefit
                    from overlapping protections contained in separate BITs signed by the PRC and
                    Macau, this conclusion does not answer the logically anterior question of
                    whether the BITs signed by PRC apply to Macau. It could well be the case that
                    the Macau government thought it fit to enter into separate BITs because the BITs
                    signed by PRC did <em>not</em> apply to Macau. It might
                    also be the case that very similar provisions were found in the BITs Macau
                    entered into because Macau had wanted to as far as possible enjoy the same
                    protections obtained by the PRC with third countries. In short, the four
                    parallel BITs with very similar provisions do not point towards the conclusion
                    that the PRC-Laos BIT applies to Macau.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     There is one final point before I move on to
                    the next piece of evidence. In its written submissions, the plaintiff argued
                    that the fact that Macau can enter into BITs in its own capacity does <em>not</em> demonstrate in any way that treaties entered into by
                    the PRC Government were applicable to Macau.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> I agree that no definite
                    conclusion may be drawn from the mere fact of Macau’s powers to enter
                    treaties in its own capacity. In a hypothetical scenario where Macau was unable
                    to negotiate its own BITs, then this would suggest that the PRC’s BITs
                    would apply to Macau. However, the converse is not necessarily true. According
                    to Art 136 of its Basic Law, Macau is able to negotiate and enter into its own
                    BITs. I recognise that this does not automatically lead to the conclusion that
                    the PRC’s BITs do not apply to Macau, although it does seem to indicate to
                    a limited extent that the PRC’s treaties do not apply to
                Macau.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     To conclude, the other BITs are of limited
                    utility in determining the central question whether the PRC-Laos BIT applies to
                    Macau. However, Macau’s ability to negotiate and enter into its own BITs
                    tends to suggest to a limited extent that the PRC’s treaties do not apply
                    to Macau.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 1987 PRC-Portugal Joint Declaration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     As mentioned at [5] above, Art 2 of the 1987
                    PRC-Portugal Joint Declaration affirms PRC’s one country, two systems
                    principle. Clause VIII of Annex I elaborates on Macau’s treaty-making
                    powers and the applicability to Macau of PRC’s international agreements in
                    the following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">VIII</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to the principle that foreign affairs are the responsibility of
                        [PRC’s government], [Macau] may on its own … maintain and
                        develop relations and conclude and implement agreements with states, regions
                        and relevant international or regional organizations in the appropriate
                        fields …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The application to [Macau] of international agreements to which [PRC] is
                        or becomes a party shall be decided by [PRC’s government], in
                        accordance with the circumstances of each case and needs of [Macau] and
                        after seeking the views of the [Macau government]. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     According to the international law expert for
                    the plaintiff, Professor Simon Chesterman, the 1987 PRC-Portugal Joint
                    Declaration suggests that the PRC government may at a future date decide whether
                    the PRC-Laos BIT should apply to Macau.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> Prof
                    Chesterman went on to opine that the PRC Letter is a confirmation that the
                    process for extending the PRC-Laos BIT to Macau has not taken place.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The main rebuttal presented by the
                    international law expert for the defendant, Sir Daniel, is that the 1987
                    PRC-Portugal Joint Declaration is a treaty between the PRC and Portugal that is
                    only binding on them and it cannot therefore create rights or duties for other
                    states such as Laos.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> Sir Daniel also suggests that the joint
                    declaration is in the nature of a statement regarding the PRC’s internal
                    constitutional arrangements with Macau and therefore “calls to
                    mind” Art 27 of the VCLT which states “a party may not invoke the
                    provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a
                        treaty”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     With respect, Sir Daniel’s objections
                    miss the point. The plaintiff is not relying on the 1987 PRC-Portugal Joint
                    Declaration to enforce the rights contained therein. The plaintiff is only
                    relying on the declaration as evidence of the PRC’s intention that the
                    PRC-Laos BIT does not apply to Macau. In my opinion, the plaintiff is entitled
                    to do so. There was also no evidence before me to suggest that the PRC had taken
                    measures to extend the scope of the PRC-Laos BIT to Macau. All this pointed
                    towards the conclusion that the PRC-Laos BIT does not extend to
                Macau.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     I would add that Art 27 of the VCLT had no
                    application to the facts at hand. The plaintiff is not seeking to invoke the
                    articles of the 1987 PRC-Portugal Joint Declaration to justify its failure to
                    perform the PRC-Laos BIT. In fact, the defendant has not identified any
                    particular provision of the PRC-Laos BIT that has been breached by the plaintiff
                    because the question before me is a conceptually distinct one: does the PRC-Laos
                    BIT apply to Macau? Hence, I have no hesitation in concluding that Art 27 did
                    not apply here.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 1999 Note</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     The next piece of evidence that the plaintiff
                    relies on is the 1999 Note. The gist of the note is recorded in a document
                    entitled “Multilateral Treaties deposited with the
                        Secretary-General”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>. The 1999 Note makes reference to the 1987
                    PRC-Portugal Joint Declaration and lists treaties that are applicable to Macau.
                    It goes on to state that<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">IV. With respect to other treaties that are not listed in the Annexes to
                        this Note, to which [PRC] is or will become a Party, the Government of [PRC]
                        will go through separately the necessary formalities for their application
                        to [Macau] if it is so decided.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     While the absence of the PRC-Laos BIT in the
                    annexes to the 1999 Note may suggest at first blush that the treaty does not
                    apply to Macau, this suggestion is untenable in the light of the fact that only
                    multilateral treaties are listed in the note. The PRC-Laos BIT, being a
                    bilateral treaty, would not have been listed by the PRC in the 1999 Note in any
                    event because it is simply not a multilateral treaty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     The plaintiff attempts to overcome this
                    obstacle by asserting that PRC’s overall approach to multilateral and
                    bilateral treaties with respect to Hong Kong and Macau were the same<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> and that “great pains” were
                    taken to ensure that the international legal position of both Hong Kong and
                    Macau would remain largely unchanged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     This contention was not substantiated by
                    reference to authorities either in the plaintiff’s written submissions or
                    the second affidavit of Prof Chesterman. Even if I accept for the sake of
                    argument that the PRC had adopted such a policy, it is not clear to me whether
                    that policy would have been served by taking the same stance with respect to
                    multilateral and bilateral treaties. It is also not clear whether the
                    application of PRC’s treaties to Macau would advance or undermine the
                    PRC’s alleged policy to preserve the legal status quo of
                Macau.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Accordingly, I am unable to place any weight
                    on the 1999 Note for the purposes of determining whether the PRC-Laos BIT
                    applies to Macau.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Hong Kong analogy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Prof Chesterman noted that the international
                    legal position regarding the application of the PRC’s treaties to Hong
                    Kong is similar to that for Macau. He cited the 1984 PRC-UK Joint Declaration,
                    which, like the 1987 PRC-Portugal Joint Declaration, provided that the
                    application of PRC’s treaties to Hong Kong would be decided by PRC
                    government in accordance with the needs of Hong Kong and after seeking the views
                    of the Hong Kong government.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> Prof
                    Chesterman also cited two articles to support his view that the clear assumption
                    was that PRC’s bilateral treaties would <em>not</em>
                    apply to Hong Kong.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Sir Daniel’s response was that Prof
                    Chesterman did not address the issue of whether PRC’s treaties applied to
                    Hong Kong after the 1997 handover. He also pointed out that it did not follow
                    from Hong Kong’s independent treaty-making competence that PRC’s
                    treaties do not apply to Hong Kong.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> Broadly
                    speaking, Sir Daniel did not think that the arrangements with respect to Hong
                    Kong apply equally to Macau.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    I note parenthetically that although Sir
                    Daniel was previously in the employ of the UK Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office
                    as its Principal Legal Adviser, he did not express an opinion on the UK’s
                    position regarding the 1987 PRC-Portugal Joint Declaration or whether the BIT
                    between the PRC and the UK applies to Hong Kong and/or Macau. This was perhaps
                    unfortunate because an explanation of the UK’s position in those respects
                    would have been helpful in determining the issue at hand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Returning to Sir Daniel’s response, I
                    do not think that the Hong Kong experience is entirely irrelevant to the present
                    application. I make two observations in this regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    First, identical wording was used in both
                    the 1984 PRC-UK Joint Declaration and the 1987 PRC-Portugal Joint Declaration in
                    relation to the applicability of PRC’s treaties to Hong Kong and Macau
                    respectively. Clause XI of Annex I of the 1984 PRC-UK Joint Declaration
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The application to [Hong Kong] of international agreements to which [PRC]
                        is or becomes a party shall be decided by the [PRC government], in
                        accordance with the circumstances and needs of the [Hong Kong], and after
                        seeking the views of the [Hong Kong government].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Clause VIII of Annex I of the 1987 PRC-Portugal Joint
                        Declaration states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The application to [Macau] of international agreements to which [PRC] is
                        or becomes a party shall be decided by the [PRC government], in accordance
                        with the circumstances and needs of [Macau] and after seeking the views of
                        the [Macau government].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Second, the work of the Joint Liaison Group
                    for Hong Kong (“the JLG”) in negotiating and concluding bilateral
                    agreements on behalf of Hong Kong during the period leading up to the 1997
                    handover suggests that PRC’s treaties would not automatically apply to
                    Hong Kong. If the converse were true, <em>ie</em>, if
                    PRC’s treaties had automatically applied to Hong Kong, it would not have
                    been necessary for the JLG to negotiate and conclude bilateral agreements for
                    Hong Kong in a number of areas, including that of investment promotion and
                    protection. It therefore seems that the prevailing underlying assumption at the
                    time leading up to the handover was that PRC’s treaties would not apply to
                    Hong Kong after the handover. This conclusion is supported by an article written
                    in 1997 by the outgoing Attorney-General of Hong Kong, Mr J F
                        Mathews<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> and a 2005 speech by Hong Kong’s
                    Secretary for Justice, Mr Wong Yan Lung SC<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    I accept that nothing in the arrangements
                    made by PRC and the UK concerning Hong Kong can be regarded as <em>conclusive</em> of the arrangements made by PRC and Portugal
                    regarding Macau. However, the identical wording found in the two joint
                    declarations and the approach taken by the Hong Kong Joint Liaison Group suggest
                    that PRC is likely to have adopted the same approach towards Hong Kong and
                    Macau. In other words, the approach and arrangements made with respect to Hong
                    Kong was likely to have been used as a model for Macau. I would note in this
                    regard that the Basic Law for both Hong Kong and Macau are similar in many
                    aspects, and this also supports my view that the approach that was taken for
                    Hong Kong was the same as that for Macau.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Consequently, the PRC was likely to have
                    been of the view that their treaties would not automatically apply to Macau
                    after the 1997 handover and the Hong Kong experience is to that extent relevant
                    to the determination of the central question in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 2001 WTO Trade Policy Report</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Mr Bull clarified at the hearing before me
                    that the Tribunal did not consider this particular document because it was not
                    adduced in the arbitral proceedings. The Secretariat of the World Trade
                    Organization periodically prepares trade policy reviews in which member
                    countries’ trade and related policies are examined and evaluated. The
                    plaintiff relies on the 2001 WTO Trade Policy Report on Macau which states at
                    paragraph 27 that<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27    In 1999, [Macau] signed a double taxation agreement
                            with Portugal … [Macau] also signed a bilateral agreement on
                            investment protection with Portugal …
                            <em>[Macau] has no other bilateral investment treaties or
                                bilateral tax treaties</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Relying on the above extract, Prof Chesterman opines that the
                        BITs entered into by PRC do not automatically apply to Macau.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    In contrast, Sir Daniel interpreted the
                    emphasised sentence in the extract to mean that Macau had <em>concluded</em> no other BITs or bilateral tax treaties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> The
                    defendant also tendered the 2007 and 2013 editions of the WTO Trade Policy
                    Report on Macau which do not contain the emphasised sentence in the extract from
                    the preceding paragraph.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    After carefully reviewing the various
                    editions of the WTO reports, I am of the view that the reports have some bearing
                    on the issue of whether the PRC-Laos BIT applies to Macau although the report is
                    by no means conclusive. If the PRC-Laos BIT had indeed applied to Macau, it is
                    unlikely that an unequivocal statement to the contrary (see [107] above) would
                    have found its way into a report issued by a reputable organisation such as the
                    WTO. Having said that, I am aware that the 2001 report explored a wide range of
                    issues and was probably not intended to express a conclusive view on the
                        <em>legal</em> issue of whether the PRC-Laos BIT
                    applies to Macau. In the circumstances, the 2001 report suggests to a limited
                    extent that the PRC-Laos BIT does not apply to Laos.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on Issue 1</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Weighing the evidence cited above in the
                    round, I arrive at the conclusion that the plaintiff has established on a
                    balance of probabilities that the PRC-Laos BIT does not apply to
                Macau.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    The Tribunal reached the opposite conclusion
                    by relying on the default application of the general rule found in Art 29 VCLT
                    and Art 15 VCST that a treaty is binding on the entire territory of each
                    contracting state. They found that a different intention had not been otherwise
                    established by the evidence. In my view, there was sufficient evidence to rebut
                    the general rule that the PRC-Laos BIT applies to Macau, even if one was
                    restricted only to the evidence that was placed before the Tribunal. With the
                    introduction of the Two Letters and the 2001 report in the present proceedings,
                    the conclusion that the PRC-Laos BIT does not apply to Macau becomes all the
                    more clear, and I decide accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 2: Whether the defendant’s expropriation claims fall
                outside the scope of Art 8(3) of the PRC-Laos BIT</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    In view of my decision on Issue 1 that the
                    PRC-Laos BIT does not apply to Macau, it is not necessary for me to rule on
                    Issue 2. However, since counsel for both parties have made full submissions on
                    this issue, I set out below my brief views on the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    The investor protection clause of the
                    PRC-Laos BIT can be found in Art 4 which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    Neither Contracting
                            State shall expropriate, nationalize or take similar measures
                            (hereinafter referred to as “expropriation”) against
                            investments of investors of the other Contracting state in its
                            territory, unless the following conditions are met:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">a.    as necessitated by the public
                            interest;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">b.    in accordance with domestic legal
                                procedures;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">c.    without discrimination;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">d.    against appropriate and effective
                                compensation;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    The compensation mentioned in paragraph 1 (d) of
                            this Article shall be equivalent to the value of the expropriated
                            investments at the time when expropriation is proclaimed, be convertible
                            and freely transferable. The compensation shall be paid without
                            unreasonable delay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    The following paragraphs of Art 8 of the
                    PRC-Laos BIT are also the subject of much contention between the parties:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1"><div align="center">Article 8</div>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    Any dispute between an investor of one Contracting
                            State and the other Contracting State in connection with an investment
                            in the territory of the other Contracting State shall, as far as
                            possible, be settled amicably through negotiation between the parties to
                            the dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    If the dispute cannot be settled through
                            negotiation within six months, either party to the dispute shall be
                            entitled to submit the dispute to the competent court of the Contracting
                            State accepting the investment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    If a dispute <em>involving</em> the amount of compensation for expropriation
                            cannot be settled through negotiation within six months as specified in
                            paragraph 1 of this Article, it may be submitted at the request of
                            either party to an <em>ad hoc arbitral
                                tribunal</em>. The provisions of this paragraph shall not
                            apply if the investor concerned has resorted to the procedure specified
                            in the paragraph 2 of this Article.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    The Tribunal interpreted the word
                    “involving” in Art 8(3) broadly to mean “include” or
                    “wrap” and considered it to be inclusionary rather than
                    exclusionary. It reasoned that if the parties had intended to limit the
                    jurisdiction of the Tribunal exclusively to disputes on the amount of
                    compensation, other terms such as “limited to” would have been
                    used. On the contrary, the plaintiff contends that the ordinary meaning of the
                    word “involve” can also mean “imply” or
                    “entail” and this interpretation would, according to them, be more
                    consistent with the words “amount of compensation for
                    expropriation”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Before delving into an analysis of the word
                    “involving” in Art 8(3), I should first set out the broader
                    context of Arts 4 and 8 of the PRC-Laos BIT.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    Article 4 lists four conjunctive conditions
                    that would take a contracting state outside the definition of expropriation. The
                    fourth condition is “appropriate and effective” compensation and
                    Art 4(2) elaborates on the elements of appropriate and effective
                    compensation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Article 8 provides a framework for resolving
                    disputes between PRC and Laos. Negotiation is the first port of call under Art
                    8(1). If the dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation after six months,
                    either party is “entitled” to refer the dispute to the courts of
                    the state accepting the investment under Art 8(2). A dispute involving the
                    amount of compensation for expropriation may also be referred by either party to
                    arbitration under Art 8(3) although this option is only available if Art 8(2) is
                    not invoked.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Since the ordinary meaning of the word
                    “involving” and the broader context of Arts 4 and 8 are generally
                    unable to provide much guidance on the way it should be interpreted, I turn to
                    the decision of <em>Tza Yap Shum v Republic of Peru</em>,
                    Case No ARB/07/06, Decision on Jurisdiction and Competence (ICSID 19 June
                        2009)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> (“<em>Tza Yap
                        Shum</em>”) which has been cited by both parties. In that case,
                    Mr Tza Yap Shum submitted a request for arbitration against the Republic of Peru
                    (“Peru”), claiming that the Peruvian Tax Authorities had violated
                    certain provisions of the PRC-Peru BIT (“the PRC-Peru BIT”). Peru
                    filed several jurisdictional objections, including one based on Art 8(3) of the
                    PRC-Peru BIT, an article which was similar in all material aspects to Art 8(3)
                    of the PRC-Laos BIT.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    The tribunal there referred to the
                    dictionary meaning of the word “involve” and held that it meant
                    “to enfold, envelope, entangle, include”. According to the
                    tribunal, a <em>bona fide</em> interpretation of these
                    words indicated that the only requirement was that the dispute must <em>include</em> the determination of the amount of compensation,
                    and not that the dispute must be restricted to the amount of compensation (at
                    [151]). The tribunal further held that it might be assumed from the preamble of
                    the PRC-Peru BIT that the purpose of allowing the parties to submit certain
                    disputes to ICSID arbitration was to promote investments (at [153]). It was also
                    held that a restrictive interpretation of the word “involving”
                    would mean that the investor would never have access to arbitration (at [154]).
                    In coming to its conclusion, the tribunal noted that variations of the phrase
                    “disputes involving the amount of compensation for expropriation”
                    have been included in various treaties since the 1980s and that the phrase
                    reflects “a certain degree of distrust or ideological unconformity on the
                    part of communist regimes regarding investment of private capital as well as a
                    “concern about the decisions of international tribunals on matters such
                    regimes are not familiar with and over which they have no control” (at
                    [145]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    On balance, I am of the view that the
                    phrase, “a dispute involving the amount of compensation” in Art
                    8(3) of the PRC-Laos BIT should be given a restrictive meaning, <em>viz</em>, disputes limited to the amount of compensation for
                    expropriation. First, the word “involve” is also capable of being
                    interpreted restrictively to mean imply, entail or make necessary<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span>. The specific wording of the phrase,
                    “amount of compensation for expropriation” in Art 8(3), when
                    compared with the broad wording of the phrase “any dispute in connection
                    with an investment” in Art 8(1), suggests that a more restrictive meaning
                    was intended for the phrase in Art 8(3). Put another way, the PRC and Laos could
                    have used the phrase, “a dispute in connection with an investment”
                    for consistency with the phrasing in Art 8(1) if they had truly intended for an
                    arbitral tribunal to have a broad jurisdiction on all aspects of an
                    expropriation dispute and it is of some significance that they chose not to do
                    so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Second, the reasoning in <em>Tza Yap Shum</em> is problematic. The tribunal concluded that an
                    investor would never have access to arbitration if Art 8(3) was read
                    restrictively to only refer to disputes on the amount of compensation. This is
                    simply not correct. Limiting an arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction to a
                    dispute which only concerns the amount of compensation for expropriation does
                    not necessarily mean that a party may not refer a dispute to arbitration.
                    Parties may still utilise Art 8(3) where: (a) the dispute remains unresolved
                    after six months of negotiation; (b) the dispute concerns the amount of
                    compensation for expropriation; and (c) Art 8(2) has not been invoked <em>by the investor</em>, <em>ie</em>, it
                    may still be invoked if the <em>State</em> has invoked Art
                    8(2). It is important to appreciate that the option to arbitrate under Art 8(3)
                    is extinguished not by limiting disputes to those concerning the amount of
                    compensation for expropriation but by the investor’s submission of the
                    dispute to the courts under Art 8(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    While the scope for submitting a dispute to
                    arbitration under the PRC-Laos BIT may seem limited, this limited scope for the
                    submission of a dispute to arbitration is understandable in the light of the
                    observation made in <em>Tza Yap Shum</em> that communist
                    regimes possessed a certain degree of distrust regarding investment of private
                    capital and were concerned about the decisions of international tribunals on
                    matters over which they have no control. I had no doubt that these concerns were
                    also present when the PRC-Laos BIT was concluded between the two communist
                    states and this in my judgment formed an important part of the context in which
                    Art 8 of the PRC-Laos BIT should be interpreted (see Art 31(1) of the
                    VCLT).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    In addition, the restrictive interpretation
                    of the phrase “involving” in Art 8(3) cannot be displaced by the
                    general purpose of promoting investments found in the preamble to the PRC-Peru
                    BIT which the tribunal in <em>Tza Yap Shum</em> seemed to
                    place undue reliance on. It is a truism to say that the purpose of any BIT is to
                    promote investments. But it does not follow from this general proposition that
                    every ambiguity found in such treaties should invariably be resolved in favour
                    of the investor. Every BIT represents a negotiated bargain between two
                    contracting states and the provisions therein reflect the extent to which the
                    sovereignty of each contracting state has been curtailed. The bargains struck in
                    BITs should therefore not be lightly displaced without due consideration of the
                    context in which they were made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Another ancillary point deserves some
                    elaboration. The defendant contends that the Tribunal was correct to conclude
                    that “involving” in Art 8(3) should be read broadly to mean
                    “to include”. Such a broad reading is problematic because almost
                    every investment dispute is likely to include a dispute over the amount of
                    compensation payable. This would mean that almost every dispute could be
                    submitted by either party to arbitration under Art 8(3) – a result that
                    two communist states were unlikely to have contemplated or intended at that time
                    (see above at [123]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    Third, the shift from PRC’s
                    “first-generation” BITs to “second-generation”
                    suggests that the PRC-Laos BIT which fell into the former category should be
                    read restrictively. The plaintiff submits that first-generation BITs were
                    deliberately restrictive in only permitting disputes relating to the amount of
                    compensation for expropriation to be submitted to arbitration.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span>
                    Subsequently, after 1998, more expansive dispute resolution clauses can be found
                    in PRC’s second generation BITs. In support of this submission, the
                    plaintiff cites Art 9 of the BIT between PRC and Germany dated 1 December 2005
                    which uses the broader phrase, “any dispute concerning
                    investments”. I accept these submissions and think that they go some way
                    in supporting a more restrictive reading of Art 8(3).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    I have one final observation before I
                    conclude. The plaintiff argues that Art 8(3) “only estops the investor
                    from seeking arbitration of a dispute concerning ‘the amount of
                    compensation for expropriation’ if that question has already been
                    submitted for adjudication before the local courts pursuant to Art
                        8(2)”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span>. The plaintiff goes on to
                    suggest that nothing in Art 8(3) prevents an investor from arbitrating a dispute
                    over the <em>quantum</em> of damages for expropriation if
                    he has only submitted the dispute over <em>liability</em>
                    to adjudication.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> I do not think that this
                    additional gloss to Art 8(3) can be correct. The second sentence of Art 8(3)
                    provides that “the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply if the
                    investor concerned has resorted to the procedure specified in [Art
                    8(2)]”. In my view, this language is unequivocal and nothing in Art 8(3)
                    in fact supports the interpretation advanced by the plaintiff. The plaintiff is
                    advancing a special meaning to that sentence in Art 8(3) when there is no
                    evidence that the parties had intended such a special meaning to be imputed. I
                    therefore cannot agree with the plaintiff’s argument on this
                point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    In conclusion, the Tribunal did not possess
                    subject-matter jurisdiction over the defendant’s expropriation claims
                    because only disputes over the amount of compensation for expropriation can be
                    submitted to arbitration under Art 8(3).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    For the foregoing reasons, I allow the
                    plaintiff’s application with costs to be agreed or taxed.</p>
