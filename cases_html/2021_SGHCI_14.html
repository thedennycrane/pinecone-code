Chantal is survived by her two daughters, Heika Burnison (“Heika”, born in 1987) and Birka Burnison (“Birka”, born in 1990). They are the only beneficiaries of the Estate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The second defendant, Marcus Weber (“Weber”), is a Swiss National who operated out of Zurich until 2002 when he obtained a work permit to work in Singapore. Weber became a permanent resident of Singapore in 2003.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The first defendant, BCS Business Consulting Services Pte Ltd (“BCS”) is a company incorporated in Singapore on 31 March 1999. Weber is a director and the sole shareholder of BCS. The third defendant, Renslade Holdings Limited (“Renslade (HK)”) is a company incorporated in Hong Kong on 5 November 2007 and Weber is its sole shareholder. It is not disputed that Weber in effect owns and controls BCS and Renslade (HK). A reference to the “Defendants” or “Singapore Defendants” includes a reference to Weber, BCS and Renslade (HK) as the context so requires.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The present application arises in the context of a dispute between the plaintiff and the Defendants over the beneficial ownership of intellectual property rights in a compound called “Ethocyn” and the income and proceeds generated by those rights (“the Trust Assets”, see [12] below).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The underlying dispute</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The facts, the issues, our findings and our grounds of decision can be found in our judgment on liability reported in <span class="font-italic">Baker, Michael A (executor of the estate of Chantal </span><span class="font-italic">Burnison, deceased) v BCS Business Consulting Services Pte Ltd and others</span> [2020] 4 SLR 85 (“the Judgment”). Although we only refer to those facts, issues or findings as are necessary for the purposes of this application, this judgment must be read in the context of and together with the Judgment.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Chantal was the co-inventor of the compound, “Ethocyn”. Ethocyn was used in various cosmetic and beauty products. The rights to the inventions and patents of Ethocyn (“the Ethocyn Rights”) were initially assigned to California-incorporated companies controlled by Chantal (“the Chantal Companies”). The Chantal Companies entered bankruptcy proceedings in February 1999. The Ethocyn Rights, among other assets, were eventually sold to a New Zealand company, Renslade Holdings Limited (“Renslade (NZ)”) on 19 October 1999 with the sanction of the US Bankruptcy Court. Sometime between 2000 and 2001 or perhaps 2002, it is not clear when (see the Judgment at [13]), the Ethocyn Rights were transferred to a Singapore company, Renslade Singapore Pte Ltd (“Renslade (S)”), and then finally to BCS on 1 April 2002. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Over the years, the Ethocyn Rights yielded a sizeable income and profits. This was derived mainly from a supply and distribution agreement (“SDA”) entered into between BCS and Nu Skin International Inc (“Nu Skin”) in June 2003. Under the SDA, BCS agreed to supply Ethocyn to Nu Skin for its usage and distribution. In return, Nu Skin would make direct payments to BCS. These payments formed the bulk of moneys generated from the Ethocyn Rights (referred to in the Judgment as the “Trust Moneys” or “Trust Monies”). Sometime in or around 2007, the bulk of Trust Moneys were transferred from BCS to Renslade (HK).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 In or around 2014, Weber withdrew a sum of CHF9.5m (Swiss Francs) from the Trust Moneys. Baker alleged that Chantal agreed to loan Weber CHF6m but that Weber withdrew the larger sum of CHF9.5m without her knowledge. Weber denied this was a loan on the basis that he was using money that belonged to him.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Chantal was diagnosed with metastatic colon cancer in September 2015. From May 2016, Chantal repeatedly sought an account of the Trust Assets and Trust Moneys, but to no avail. We found that Weber and Dr Ralf Wojtek (“Wojtek”), a lawyer representing BCS, as well as another lawyer, Mr Urs Wehinger, delayed doing so on one pretext or another, (see [157]–[186] of the Judgment). After Chantal passed away on 2 October 2016, Baker became the executor of the Estate. He sought to have the assets of the trust and Trust Moneys transferred to the Estate. When this was not done, Baker filed the present Suit in Singapore in November 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Baker, as executor of the Estate, sued the Defendants for: (a) breach of fiduciary duties as trustees under an oral trust or an oral agreement to hold and manage assets, the Ethocyn Rights, and the income derived therefrom, for Chantal; as well as (b) breach of a loan agreement of CHF9.5 million with 3% per annum interest (“the Loan Agreement”). Renslade (HK) was sued for dishonestly assisting BCS and Weber in their breach of fiduciary duties. The Defendants are also sued for conspiring and acting together with the intention of injuring Chantal and/or the Estate. Baker’s claims, on behalf of the Estate are set out in [32] and [33] of the Judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Baker claimed, essentially, that Chantal was the beneficial owner of the Ethocyn Rights. She had arranged for Renslade (NZ) to negotiate with the Chantal Companies and the Creditors’ Committee in the bankruptcy proceedings and reached an agreement to purchase the Ethocyn Rights. There was no one else willing or interested to purchase the Ethocyn Rights despite the efforts of the Creditors’ Committee, their merchant bankers, an entity known as the Kriegsman Group and an experienced work out specialist. Chantal was subsequently introduced to Weber and entered into an agreement with Weber (“the Trust Agreement”) for Weber to acquire the Ethocyn Rights from Renslade (NZ) and to hold any income or proceeds generated from the Ethocyn Rights on trust for her (we refer to the trust as “the Trust” and the assets held on trust as “the Trust Assets”). Under this Trust Agreement, the Defendants were entitled to retain 5% of the proceeds generated. Further, although Chantal had agreed to loan Weber CHF6m, Weber then took the CHF9.5m from the Trust Moneys without her knowledge or consent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The Defendants’ defences are set out at [34]–[54] of the Judgment. In gist, BCS and Weber denied that there was any trust as alleged, or any kind of agreement between Chantal and Weber for the latter to acquire and hold the Ethocyn Rights and/or any income or proceeds generated on trust, for Chantal. Instead, BCS and Weber saw the acquisition of the Ethocyn Rights as a good business opportunity and agreed to purchase the same from Renslade (NZ), which had acquired the Ethocyn Rights from the bankrupt Chantal Companies with the sanction of the US Bankruptcy Court. Weber and BCS acquired the Ethocyn Rights using Renslade (S), and from 25 May 2000, until her death, Chantal worked for, and assisted Renslade (S) with the exploitation of the Ethocyn Rights as a consultant. The Ethocyn Rights were subsequently transferred to BCS because Nu Skin did not wish to deal with Renslade (S), a shell company. Further, for tax reasons, the profits generated from the Ethocyn products were transferred to Renslade HK and only 5% (from 2007 to 2014) and 10% (from 2016) of the proceeds of sale were retained by BCS in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The course of proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The parties agreed to bifurcate the trial into liability and quantum tranches. In addition to their pleadings, the parties agreed upon an Agreed List of Issues for the court’s decision (see the Judgment at [58] and [59]). Some of the relevant agreed issues included:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) Was there a Trust Agreement between Chantal and Weber as pleaded by the Estate … in the Statement of Claim (Amendment No.3)?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(f) If a Trust Agreement existed between Chantal and Weber, what is the governing law of any alleged Trust (as defined in … the Defence (Amendment No.4) …?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(g) If the Alleged Trust was invalid, are the Defendants nevertheless holding the Trust Assets and/or Trust Moneys … and/or any other income [or] proceeds generated from the Trust assets on a resulting trust and/or constructive trust for Chantal’s Estate under California Law?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(h) If the Alleged Trust was valid under California law, can the assets alleged to be held on trust be claimed by Chantal’s Estate?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) Are the Trust Agreement and/or Alleged Trust illegal, void, or unenforceable as being contrary to the public policy of Singapore?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(j)  If the Alleged Trust is illegal, void, or unenforceable as being contrary to the public policy of Singapore, are the Defendants nevertheless holding the Trust Assets and/or the Trust Moneys and/or any other income or proceeds generated from the Trust Assets on a resulting trust for Chantal’s Estate under Singapore law?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The parties were not able to agree the further issues framed by the other. The Estate’s list of additional issues is set out at [60] of the Judgment. For the purposes of this judgment, one of the relevant issues at [60] was:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) If the Trust and/or Trust Agreement pleaded by Chantal’s Estate is governed by California law, was the Trust and/or Trust Agreement invalid under California law? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 From the Defendants’ list of additional issues set out at [61] of the Judgment, one of the relevant issues was:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) If the Alleged Trust … is governed by California law, was the Alleged Trust valid, legal and enforceable under California law?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The parties agreed that foreign law would be proved by way of submissions from registered foreign lawyers. This is one of the advantages of hearings before the Singapore International Commercial Court (a separate division of the High Court, where, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, foreign law can be proved by legal submissions rather than through expert witnesses and findings of fact). The parties also agree that the factual witnesses would give their evidence first and the registered foreign lawyers’ submissions on issues of California law would be made together with closing legal submissions from the Singapore lawyers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The trial of the liability tranche took place in Singapore from 11 to 16 November 2019. The trial was originally fixed for hearing from 11 to 15, and 18 to 21 November 2019.<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>At the joint request of counsel, this court sat, in a special sitting, on a Saturday, 16 November 2019, as counsel informed the court that they were concerned the evidence would not be completed within the days allocated for the evidence tranche of the trial. Baker, Heika and the Estate’s lawyer, one Mr Johnson, gave evidence. On that Saturday, Baker closed his case at approximately 1.51pm, whereupon the Defendants elected under O 35 r 4(3) and O 110 r 3(1) of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) not to call evidence and submitted that they had no case to answer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 This therefore meant that the affidavits of evidence-in-chief of Weber and Wojtek, Weber’s lawyer, were <span class="font-italic">not</span> admitted into the evidence and consequently disregarded. This court therefore only heard the oral testimony of Baker and his witnesses, who had been cross-examined by the Defendants’ counsel, and considered the evidence contained in the documents that had been admitted without formal proof (but not necessarily as to the truth of their contents). This court did not have the benefit of any evidence, whether by evidence-in-chief or oral testimony in cross-examination from Weber and Wojtek.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The parties then filed their written submissions. The registered US counsel duly filed their affidavits and submissions on California law. On 3 and 6 February 2020, we heard legal submissions by registered US counsel on California law relating to bankruptcy, trusts and illegality. We also heard closing submissions from Singapore counsel on the facts and on the law, which included Singapore law on trusts, illegality, (including the unenforceability of a trust tainted by illegality), and public policy in relation to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the effect of a foreign illegality.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 We reserved judgment and after deliberation, we handed down our Judgment on 29 April 2020 and held as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There was a Trust Agreement between Chantal and Weber. Renslade (NZ) had held the Ethocyn Rights on trust for Chantal. When the Rights were transferred to Renslade (S), Chantal remained the beneficial owner of those Rights. This remained the case when the Ethocyn Rights were assigned or transferred to BCS. Therefore, Chantal had always been the beneficial owner of the Ethocyn Rights, the Trust Moneys and the Trust Assets (see the Judgment at [187] and [188]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Chantal had agreed to loan Weber the sum of CHF6m for 3 years with interest at 3% per annum but Weber had withdrawn CHF9.5m from the profits made under the Nu Skin SDA without Chantal’s knowledge or consent, and had not repaid that amount or rendered an account of any interest as of the date of the Judgment (see the Judgment at [199]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Trust Agreement was governed by Singapore law (see the Judgment at [214]). Under Singapore law, there was an express trust (at [226]) and, in any event, a resulting trust would also arise on the facts (at [230]). In the alternative, if the Trust Agreement were governed by California law, a trust would also have arisen (at [240]). This court rejected the claim that the trust was unenforceable for illegality, finding that the Trust Agreement was enforceable under both Singapore (at [258]–[269]) and California law (at [298]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) As the Trust Agreement was valid and enforceable, </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) the Defendants had breached their fiduciary duty to Chantal by failing to provide an account of the Trust and the Trust Moneys;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) the Defendants had breached the Trust Agreement by unilaterally increasing the commission from 5% to 10% from 2016 to 2017 without Chantal’s knowledge and consent; </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Weber had breached his fiduciary duty by failing to procure BCS or Renslade (HK) to return the Trust Assets, and also breached his contractual obligation to return CHF9.5m with the 3% annual interest; and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) by claiming legal and beneficial ownership over the Trust Assets and Trust Moneys, the Defendants had conspired with the intention of injuring Chantal and/or the Estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 We therefore made orders relating to the plaintiff’s claims for relief. We ordered the taking of accounts. The parties have since extracted the order of court in SIC/JUD 5/2020, the relevant portions of which are produced below:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1. it is hereby declared that [BCS] and/or [Renslade (HK)] hold the intellectual property rights to the inventions and patents of Ethocyn (“the Ethocyn Rights”) and 95% of any income or proceeds generated from the Ethocyn Rights (“the Trust Assets”) including 95% of the monies which were paid by Nu Skin International Inc to [BCS] and any other income or proceeds generated from the Trust Assets on trust for the Plaintiff (“the Trust Assets and Trust Monies”);</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. the Defendants are to provide a detailed account of all the transactions which have taken place in respect of the Trust Assets and Trust Monies within 14 days from the date of judgment; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3. the Defendants are to account to the Plaintiff the Trust Assets and Trust Monies, and the Plaintiff is at liberty to trace and recover the Trust Assets and Trust Monies, if necessary. The Defendants shall pay the Plaintiff all sums due to the Plaintiff on the taking of the account of the Trust Assets and Trust Monies; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4. Parties are at liberty to apply to the Court for any orders or directions in relation to the taking of accounts of the Trust Assets and Trust Monies;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5. [Weber] is to pay to the Plaintiff CHF9.5 million plus interest at the rate of 3% per annum calculated from the date the sum of CHF9.5 million was loaned to [Weber] to the date of the judgment and the post judgment interest rate of 5.33% calculated from the date of judgment until the said sum of CHF9.5 million plus interest is repaid; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">6. the sum of US$10,330,658.91 which was paid by [Renslade (HK)] into Court pursuant to the Order of Court No. 2 of 2020 dated 11 January 2020, shall be released to the Plaintiff, Michael A Baker, and/or his solicitors, Drew &amp; Napier LLC; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The Defendants appealed against this court’s Judgment in CA/CA 76/2020 (“the Appeal”). The defendants then applied, on 4 May 2020, for a stay pending the Appeal in HC/SUM 25/2020. We heard and dismissed the application for a stay on 16 June 2020. The Defendants then made a further application for stay of execution to the Court of Appeal, on 17 June 2020, in CA/SUM 70/2020 (“SUM 70”). The Court of Appeal heard SUM 70 on 15 July 2020, and held, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that:  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There would be no stay for the payment of the CHF9.5m. The payment shall be made to the plaintiff’s solicitors, Drew &amp; Napier LLC (“Drew &amp; Napier”), pending the disposal of the Appeal. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b)  The sum of US$10.3m, which had previously been paid by Renslade (HK) into court, shall remain with Drew &amp; Napier pending the disposal of the Appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 On 19 January 2021, the Court of Appeal heard the appeal, affirmed the Judgment of this Court and orders made and dismissed the Appeal with costs stating: “We agree with the comprehensive judgment of the court below. In our view, we see no reason to disturb any of the findings made therein, or the orders made.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In the meanwhile, as there was no stay ordered for the taking of accounts, that process commenced with Weber asking for time to file his affidavit with an account of the Trust Assets and Trust Moneys. Following the Court of Appeal’s dismissal of the application for stay of execution in SUM 70, on 13 October 2020, Weber filed an affidavit on behalf of the Defendants to account for the Trust Assets and Trust Moneys. Drew &amp; Napier replied in a letter with objections to the account and requested the Defendants to file a further affidavit to address the deficiencies with the account. The Defendants’ solicitors, WongPartnership LLP (“WongPartnership”), replied with further accounts, which Drew &amp; Napier still did not find satisfactory. After further correspondence between the solicitors from both sides, Baker’s lawyers eventually wrote to court to ask for directions. Pursuant to the court’s directions, Weber filed a further affidavit which provided a combined account of the Trust Assets and Trust Monies from 2000 to 2021. Baker filed an affidavit in reply, to give notice of his objections to the combined account. Baker further demanded payment from the Defendants. Baker’s objections to the combined accounts were disputed in turn by WongPartnership, and no payments were made. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 After much contention and delays, the taking of accounts has moved into the final stages. Baker applied in SUM 25/2021 (“SUM 25”), for payment of US$10,313,895.25 and CHF1,662,894.67, which Baker claims are due on the accounts filed thus far, interest on the Trust Assets and Trust Moneys found due, unredacted copies of certain documents, and costs.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The parties appeared before us on 23 and 24 September 2021 to make their respective submissions on this SUM 37 and to make final submissions on the taking of accounts in SUM 25 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, after the plaintiff had attempted to falsify and surcharge the accounts submitted by the Defendants). This judgment deals with SUM 37 and we have yet to deliver our judgment on the taking of the accounts in SUM 25. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 It is therefore important to note that <span class="font-italic">these proceedings are ongoing and have not been completed</span>.

Baker would have been “judicially estopped” from making such assertions in the US, but as Singapore does not apply that doctrine, Baker was allowed to proceed and succeeded against the Defendants.

We accept [33(d)] was not, for obvious reasons, an issue before us. Importantly, however, the issue contained in the first sentence of [33(e)] was also the case pleaded before us by the Defendants. Again, they had failed before us and the Court of Appeal. The mischief contained in the second sentence of [33(e)] above is that the Defendants never ran the argument of “judicial estoppel” before us, despite being able to run all the other arguments under California law in relation to bankruptcy, trusts, illegality, as well as the public policy of Singapore where a person has obtained assets from a foreign bankruptcy court by making false and misleading statements to the foreign court.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 On 24 September 2021, the California court allowed, in full, BCS’s application to proceed with the Second Amended Complaint. The timelines for the Californian Proceedings have also been pushed back for six months, so as to allow for discovery to take place.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Parties’ arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Baker complains that the Californian Proceedings are a collateral attack on the Judgment and the Appeal. This court found, and the Court of Appeal affirmed, that there is a valid and binding Trust over the Ethocyn Rights in favour of the Estate. In contradiction of this, BCS takes the position in the Californian Proceedings, that absolute ownership of the Ethocyn Rights belonged to it (and subsequently Renslade (HK)). This, on Baker’s view, clearly amounts to vexatious and oppressive conduct on the part of BCS, which justifies the grant of an ASI.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In response, BCS argues that it is not seeking to undermine this court’s Judgment. The causes of action raised in the Californian Proceedings are separate and distinct from those that have been adjudicated upon by this court, and the Californian Proceedings also concern facts which were only discovered by BCS <span class="font-italic">after </span>the conclusion of the Appeal.

Fourth, it has been emphasised on many occasions that, since such an order indirectly affects the foreign court, the jurisdiction is one which must be exercised with caution … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 These general principles include, importantly, the reminder that since such an order indirectly affects the foreign court, comity requires that this jurisdiction is one that must be exercised with caution. The authorities have identified five non-exhaustive key factors that the court will consider in deciding whether to grant such an injunction (<span class="font-italic">Lakshmi</span> at [50]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) whether the defendants are amenable to the jurisdiction of the Singapore court; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) the natural forum for resolution of the dispute between the parties;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) the alleged vexation or oppression to the plaintiffs if the foreign proceedings are to continue;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) the alleged injustice to the defendants as an injunction would deprive the defendants of the advantages sought in the foreign proceedings; and </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) whether the institution of the foreign proceedings is in breach of any agreement between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The reference in <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi </span>(at [50(e)]) to an “agreement between the parties” explains the distinction drawn in the authorities between <span class="font-italic">contractual</span> and <span class="font-italic">non-contractual ASIs</span> (see <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Law of Singapore – Conflict of Laws </span>vol 6(2) (LexisNexis, 2020 Reissue) (“<span class="font-italic">Halsbury</span>”) at para 75.125). Contractual ASIs refer to those granted to restrain the ASI defendant, from breaching a contractual obligation to commence proceedings in a specific forum. The ASI sought by Baker in this case is not contractual in nature, seeing that there is no such obligation on BCS to sue in any particular forum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Instead, Baker is asking for a <span class="font-italic">non-contractual ASI</span>. The hallmark of non-contractual ASIs is <span class="font-italic">vexatious and oppressive conduct</span> on the part of the ASI defendant (<span class="font-italic">Halsbury </span>at paras 75.127 and 75.128). Whether the ASI defendant’s conduct in instituting foreign proceedings is vexatious and oppressive, is an objective issue to be answered with the reference to the facts of each case (<span class="font-italic">Koh Kay Yew v </span><span class="font-italic">Inno-Pacific Holdings Ltd</span> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 148 (“<span class="font-italic">Koh Kay Yew</span>”) at [19]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Within the category of non-contractual ASIs, a further distinction can be drawn between cases of <span class="font-italic">consecutive </span>and <span class="font-italic">concurrent </span><span class="font-italic">proceedings</span>. Consecutive proceedings cases differ from concurrent proceedings cases because in the former situation, the forum court has already issued a judgment. It would be vexatious and oppressive for an ASI defendant to commence foreign proceedings, so as to relitigate issues that have been decided by the forum court and thus undermine a judgment with <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> effect: Thomas Raphael QC, <span class="font-italic">The Anti-Suit Injunction </span>(OUP, 2nd Ed, 2019) (“<span class="font-italic">Raphael</span>”) at [5.18].The same point was made in Steven Gee QC, <span class="font-italic">Commercial Injunctions</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 7th Ed, 2021) (“<span class="font-italic">Gee</span>”) at [14-094]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The English court may grant an injunction to prevent a party bound by the res judicata or issue estoppel effect of an English judgment relitigating the underlying dispute or issue abroad. This extends to litigating abroad matters which could and should have been litigated as part of the original action. Granting an anti-suit injunction for this purpose both forwards an important English public policy of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">preventing collateral attack on a final judgment </span>by a disappointed litigant, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">prevents </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">relitigation of determined issues</span>, and gives effect to a substantive right not to be sued which has been created by the relevant judgment. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 We accept that in situations of consecutive proceedings, there may sometimes be a fine line between a party arguing in the foreign court that a prior judgment should not be <span class="font-italic">enforced</span> or <span class="font-italic">recognised</span> in a foreign jurisdiction, and vexatious and oppressive conduct which needs to be enjoined. The former is generally an issue for the foreign court to determine, according to its own rules on the enforcement and recognition of foreign judgments. A court would be slow to interfere with the foreign court’s determination of how its judgment should be treated. Notwithstanding this, however, there remains the possibility that, in certain circumstances, mounting a challenge against a court’s judgment in foreign jurisdictions would amount to clearly vexatious and oppressive conduct which must be restrained. An important point of distinction lies in whether the defendant is merely resisting an enforcement proceeding brought by the successful plaintiff in the foreign court, or whether the defendant has pre-emptively decided, on its own accord, to launch a collateral attack of the court’s judgment in a foreign jurisdiction. Further, it bears repeating that an ASI operates against the ASI defendant <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">personam</span>, and is not directed at the foreign court. Indeed, in the final analysis, the need to account for the foreign court’s own jurisdiction to determine its own matters for itself is simply a reflection of the established principle that the jurisdiction to grant an ASI is one to be “exercised with caution”: <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi</span> at [49(d)]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 A paradigm example of a case involving consecutive proceedings, which justified an ASI can be seen in <span class="font-italic">Masri</span><span class="font-italic"> v Consolidated Contractors (No 3) </span>[2009] QB 503 (“<span class="font-italic">Masri</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Masri</span>, the claimant commenced an action in London against the defendants in respect of an agreement reached in 1992. The claimant obtained judgment against the defendants, in which the English court declared, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that the 1992 agreement had not been terminated. The defendants then commenced an action in Yemen for declarations that, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the agreement had been terminated and that the defendants were not liable to the claimant. As noted above, this was not a case where the defendant was resisting enforcement <span class="font-italic">per se </span>– there was no attempt by the claimant to commence enforcement proceedings in Yemen. The claimant applied for an ASI, which was granted by the English High Court. The defendant appealed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The English Court of Appeal dismissed the defendant’s appeal. Lawrence Collins LJ concluded that the fact that the respondent was seeking to relitigate in a foreign jurisdiction (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Yemen) matters which were already <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>between himself and the claimant by reason of the English judgment, could be sufficient ground for the grant of an ASI. He described a case “in which the judgment debtors are seeking to relitigate abroad the merits of a case which, after a long trial, they have lost in England” as “a classic case of vexation and oppression”: <span class="font-italic">Masri</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [82], [86]–[95], and [100]. The English court has powers to make such an ancillary order in protection of its jurisdiction and its processes, including the integrity of its judgments, as well as the underlying rights of the successful claimant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Hence, besides restraining vexatious and oppressive conduct, the court will also intervene by way of an injunction to prevent an abuse of its processes. The protection of a court’s own judgment and processes is a matter properly for that court to determine. As the Court of Appeal stated in <span class="font-italic">Beckett </span><span class="font-italic">Pte Ltd v Deutsche Bank AG </span>[2011] 2 SLR 96 at [19]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In our view, the issue was very simply this. As stated by Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough in <span class="font-italic">Turner v </span><span class="font-italic">Grovit</span> [2002] 1 WLR 107 at [24] (the facts of that case are not directly relevant), a court may issue an anti-suit injunction to restrain an individual from continuing to prosecute foreign proceedings which amount to an abuse of its (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the aforesaid court’s) process because of their effect on pending litigation in that court. Such abuse is a species of unconscionability and wrongful conduct justifying the grant of an injunction. We should add that once there is an abuse of the court’s process, the matter ceases to be a case involving only the competing interests of the parties concerned – the public interest in ensuring that the judicial process is not abused is engaged, and the court must intervene, where it is able to do so, to prevent its process from being abused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In referring to the specific instance where the continued prosecution of foreign proceedings may have an impact on pending litigation in the court issuing the ASI, we do not understand the Court of Appeal to be <span class="font-italic">restricting</span> such ASIs to that specific situation – it is clear instead that the Court of Appeal was referring to just one instance where the abuse would justify an injunction. The principle remains that a court will intervene to prevent its process from being abused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 This principle was also referred to in <span class="font-italic">Masri</span> and approved by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Beckett </span><span class="font-italic">Pte Ltd v Deutsche Bank AG and another </span>[2011] 1 SLR 524 at [34]. It suffices for us to quote from <span class="font-italic">Masri</span> at [100]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is consistent with principle for an English court to restrain relitigation abroad of a claim which has already been subject of an English judgment. There is long-established authority that protection of the jurisdiction of the English court, its process and its judgments by injunction is a legitimate ground for the grant of an anti-suit injunction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The key question, therefore, is whether the Californian Proceedings amount to a relitigation of the issues that we have already decided in the Suit, which Judgment has been affirmed by the Court of Appeal. As we will go on to explain, <span class="font-italic">many</span> (but not all) of the claims raised by BCS in the Californian Proceedings are contradictory to the findings made in the Judgment. These allegations, including the key allegations relating to the doctrine of judicial estoppel, therefore amount to an attempt by BCS to relitigate issues already decided by this court. This is thus both vexatious and oppressive to the Estate and also an abuse of this court’s process, and it warrants the grant of an ASI. However, BCS should be allowed to pursue those claims which <span class="font-italic">do not </span>contradict our findings, in the Californian Proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 We have set out the claims being made by BCS in California from [30]–[42] above. In our judgment, these claims clearly proceed on the following factual premises: (a) that <span class="font-italic">there is no Trust</span> in favour of the Estate over the Ethocyn Rights, or in the alternative <span class="font-italic">the </span><span class="font-italic">said Trust is not enforceable</span>; (b) because of Chantal’s false statements to the US Bankruptcy Courts, the Estate is judicially estopped from asserting the existence of the Trust; (c) that the sale of the Ethocyn Rights in the bankruptcy action was anything other than an arms-length transaction; and (d) that Chantal did not retain any rights in Ethocyn after the sale. However, the existence, validity and enforceability of the Trust were two of the key issues decided by us in these proceedings. We have earlier referenced the parties’ lists of agreed, as well as non-agreed issues, all of which raised the existence, validity and enforceability of the Trust (see [14]–[16] above), both under Singapore law as well as California law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 As we noted, at [63] of the Judgment, the existence, validity and enforceability of the Trust formed the “heart of the dispute” between the parties:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">63 At the heart of this dispute are two underlying issues:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) Was there a Trust Agreement between Chantal and Weber and his companies (BCS and Renslade (HK)) to hold the Ethocyn Rights and all income and proceeds therefrom on trust for Chantal (“Trust Agreement”) or did Weber purchase the Ethocyn Rights for his own investment in his own right?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) If there was a valid Trust Agreement, was it unenforceable or void as a result of an illegality under Singapore law and/or California law?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Having considered the evidence put before us and after considering the legal and factual closing submissions, including submissions on US law from registered US lawyers, we found as a fact (see [21] above) that there was a Trust Agreement between Chantal and Weber, which gave rise to the Trust, and the Trust was valid and enforceable, whether its governing law was Singapore law or California law. As noted above, we also ruled on illegality and public policy whether Singapore or California was applied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Therefore, the factual premise on which the Californian Proceedings are predicated<span class="font-italic"> </span>clearly and directly<span class="font-italic"> </span>contradicts and seeks to undermine the findings of this court. Indeed, this is clear from our questions to the Defendants’ counsel, Mr Thio Shen Yi SC (“Mr Thio SC”), and his replies during oral submissions on 23 September 2021: </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">Berger, IJ: Yes, I---I’m having a problem with this because you did raise various questions [in this Suit] that US law on bankruptcy and trusts and you did argue <span class="font-italic">that the trust was illegal or unenforceable</span> for a variety of reasons…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">Loh, JAD: …  Was it not argued <span class="font-italic">before us</span> that we certainly shouldn’t be allowing a party to make a statement on oath to a US Court, mislead the US Court, and now come to us and say, ‘Well, please forget all about that’?  Now, that argument was made before us.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">Thio: Yes, but the preclusive effect of … that statement is a little different.

And it was pointed out to us in no uncertain terms that this paragraph, that paragraph, <span class="font-italic">et cetera</span>, of what Chantal had filed in the bankruptcy proceedings were lies. <span class="font-italic">And therefore, as a matter of public policy, we shouldn’t let somebody disavow what she said</span>.  </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">Thio: Well, Your Honour, …  Like, …  they [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Chantal] did a bad thing.

In these exchanges, Mr Thio SC conceded that the Californian Proceedings, as commenced by the Initial Complaint, was initially premised on the position that there was no trust, in direct contradiction of this court’s findings in the Judgment. He qualified his position by saying that the claim in judicial estoppel, as first raised in the First Amended Complaint, no longer required the position that there was no trust, but instead that the plaintiff was <span class="font-italic">prevented</span> from asserting a trust. As we will explain later (see [72]–[78] below), this is, <span class="font-italic">in substance</span>, if not in form, an attack on the <span class="font-italic">enforceability </span>of the Trust, which is another matter expressly considered, and rejected, in the Judgment. With respect, Mr Thio SC’s attempt to draw the difference between “judicial estoppel” and its preclusive effect on the one hand, and claiming there was no trust or no enforceable trust on the other, is a distinction without any difference. This is clear from the pleadings in the Californian Proceedings and Weber’s 23rd affidavit filed on 22 September 2021, where he exhibits the Second Amended Complaint at paragraphs 21 and 23:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">21. On May 24, 2000, Renslade Holdings Pte Ltd, a Singapore Incorporated Company (“Renslade SG”) acquired all rights transferred under the Asset Purchase Agreement from Renslade NZ and, in 2002, transferred these rights to the Plaintiff [BCS]. Renslade SG was, at that time, owned by Marcus Weber (“Weber”), who was also the owner of the Plaintiff [BCS].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">23. By Deed of April 1, 2002, [BCS] obtained the rights to Ethocyn from Renslade SG. All rights in Ethocyn were to be owned by [BCS] with no ownership interest retained by Burnison. [BCS did not hold the rights in trust for Burnison or her estate. The Ethocyn Rights were held by [BCS], and the proceeds from the exploitation of the [Ethocyn] Rights, after deducting [BCS’s] share of the profits, were segregated in Renslade Holdings Hong Kong (“Renslade HK”), an entity owned by Weber.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In our judgment, the Defendants are attacking the existence or enforceability of the Trust in the Californian Proceedings. This was something they put in issue before us, but Baker has prevailed, and they have failed. It is very clear to us that the Defendants are now pursuing this same line of factual and legal allegations – which they have failed to establish before us in Singapore – in the Californian Proceedings, and trying to dress it up with an argument on “judicial estoppel” which they alleged was a rule of procedure that would not apply in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Amenability to jurisdiction and natural forum</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 We briefly address the Singapore Defendants’ amenability to this court’s jurisdiction, as well as the question of which is the natural forum to hear the claims being pursued in the Californian Proceedings, which are relevant factors to be considered in deciding whether to grant the ASI.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The point on amenability to this court’s jurisdiction can be disposed of briefly. As referenced at [3] and [4] above, BCS is a Singapore corporation and Weber is a permanent resident in Singapore and carries out at least some of his business in Singapore and Hong Kong. He is the sole shareholder and director of BCS and the sole shareholder of Renslade HK. The Singapore Defendants submitted to this court’s jurisdiction by appearing in these proceedings without objecting to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts or otherwise challenging the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts. The importance of this fact cannot be overstated in this context, which will become relevant when we consider the Defendants’ vexatious and oppressive, as well as procedurally abusive, conduct. This is a case where the Singapore Defendants have willingly participated in these proceedings, filed and responded to various applications, and proceeded on the basis that they would defend the action in Singapore. Although the Defendants eventually decided to argue that there was no case to answer after the plaintiff’s case at trial had closed, this does not change the fact that the Defendants were (and continue to be) participants in the Singapore court’s processes. The proceedings in relation to the taking of accounts has not been completed. This is how they have conducted themselves for the almost four years since they first entered their respective appearances in this matter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Turning to the question of natural forum, BCS now argues before us that California is the natural forum to hear the claims pursued in the Californian Proceedings, insofar that these claims are founded on facts which occurred in the US, and are likely governed by US and not Singapore law. We agree with BCS that its claims in the Californian Proceedings are founded on facts which occurred in the US. We are also prepared to accept that these claims could be governed by US law. However, even assuming that California is the natural forum to hear the claims being pursued in the Californian Proceedings, this is not a bar to Baker’s prayer for an ASI. First and foremost, as we have noted earlier, the defendants never challenged the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts. Secondly, many of the business aspects in this case, as is more common nowadays, also span across Switzerland, parts of Europe in the early days of setting up the Ethocyn business, New Zealand, Singapore and Hong Kong. The evidence shows the parties communicating from different parts of the world and also meeting in different parts of the world. Beyond this, however, there are other factors and legal principles that require discussion.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 We begin by distinguishing the authorities which have stated that it is a necessary condition that Singapore is the natural and proper forum for an ASI to be granted on the ground that the foreign proceedings are vexatious and oppressive: see <span class="font-italic">Koh Kay Yew</span> at [19] and <span class="font-italic">VKC v VJZ and another </span>[2021] SGCA 72 at [18]. Those cases address the usual case of concurrent proceedings, and the question of consecutive proceedings was not considered. We have already explained the nature of this distinction and why it is necessary to bear this in mind when approaching the exercise of the discretion to grant an ASI (see [49]–[54] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The requirement of natural forum stems from the underlying need for the forum to have <span class="font-italic">sufficient interest </span>with the case before an ASI is granted. It also follows that the natural forum requirement is <span class="font-italic">not an invariable one</span>, and the court may grant an anti-suit injunction <span class="font-italic">even though it is not the natural forum if it </span><span class="font-italic">otherwise has sufficient interest with the matter</span>: <span class="font-italic">Halsbury </span>at para 75.129 (for instance, in single forum cases where the action is only justiciable abroad, the forum court may act notwithstanding that it is not the natural forum: see <span class="font-italic">Airbus </span><span class="font-italic">Industrie GIE v Patel </span>[1999] AC 119 at 139). In a consecutive proceedings case, the forum court’s sufficient interest would arise from the need to <span class="font-italic">protect its judgment from a collateral attack</span>, occasioned by the commencement of proceedings abroad by the ASI defendant: <span class="font-italic">Masri</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [96], <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lawrence Collins LJ. Therefore, if the claims pursued by BCS <span class="font-italic">do </span>amount to relitigation of issues already decided by this court, we will have no reservation in issuing an ASI, even if California may be the natural forum when considering some aspects of this case. This court has an interest in protecting its judgment and preventing an abuse of its own processes. In any event, insofar that the claims raised by BCS in California concern issues <span class="font-italic">already decided by this court</span>, in the circumstances of this case, the consideration of the natural forum is strictly speaking immaterial.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">BCS’s claims as an attempt at relitigating matters already decided in the Judgment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 As referenced by our comments above, we start by noting that the claims pursued by BCS, as reflected in the Second Amended Complaint, fall into four categories, which correspond to four series of events:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Intercepted Payment Claims, which pertains to BCS Pharma’s interception of the US$2m which Nu Skin was supposed to pay to BCS;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Trademark Claims, which pertains to the purported assignment of trademark rights from BCS to Grey Pacific Labs and Grey Pacific Science’s subsequent exploitation of the same;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the claim in judicial estoppel, which pertains to Chantal’s declaration to the US Bankruptcy Courts that the sale of the Ethocyn Rights to Renslade (NZ) was above board; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the Wrongful Settlement Claims, which pertains to the negotiation and conclusion of the Settlement Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Intercepted Payment Claims and Trademark Claims</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 We agree with Baker

</div> that the Intercepted Payment Claims and the Trademark Claims are an attempt by BCS to relitigate matters that were put in issue before this court and have decided by this court. As noted, perhaps <span class="font-italic">ad nauseum</span>, the Defendants were unsuccessful in trying to appeal the findings and Judgment against them. In the Second Amended Complaint, BCS asserts that it is the proper owner of the Ethocyn Rights and the US$2m. BCS alleged, in the US Proceedings, that “no ownership interest [was] retained by [Chantal]” and BCS “did not hold the rights in trust for [Chantal] or her estate”.

</div> This assertion, that it owns the Ethocyn Rights and the proceeds therefrom absolutely, is a repeat of the Singapore Defendants’ defence in the Suit. This assertion further contradicts the finding of this court that the Ethocyn Rights and all proceeds therefrom belong to <span class="font-italic">the Estate</span> beneficially. More egregiously, the reliefs prayed for by BCS in the Second Amended Complaint include, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, restitution of the US$2m and the trademark rights that were wrongfully assigned. These prayers for relief also contradict the orders from this court for the Singapore Defendants to account for the Trust Assets.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 However, in relation to the Trademark Claims, we note that BCS’s complaints do not just relate to the ownership of the Ethocyn Rights (which amounted to relitigation of issues already decided by this Court), but also with Baker’s fraudulently holding out that he was an officer of BCS. This aspect, in our view, does not amount to relitigation. Legal title to the Ethocyn Rights remained with BCS, and to that extent any divesting of said legal title should be properly done by <span class="font-italic">BCS</span>. It was not for Baker to “short-circuit” the process and pretend to be an officer of BCS, a party against whom he was embroiled in bitter litigation. Put another way, there is nothing to stop BCS proceeding against Baker in his <span class="font-italic">personal capacity</span>, for lying about his affiliation to BCS. In the same vein, insofar that Heika, as an officer of Grey Pacific Labs, willingly entered into the assignment agreement for the trademark rights knowing that Baker is not an officer of BCS, BCS should also be allowed to claim against her (and also Grey Pacific Labs, if Heika’s state of mind can be attributed back to it). In this regard, we note the characterisation of these claims put forward by Mr Thio: </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">Thio: … I mean, the easier example, I suppose, are the IP rights. For example, I mean, if I have a third party’s property in my house and I refuse to return that property, wrongfully refuse to return that property, that third party cannot break into my house or can’t pick the lock, take out the prop---take the property and leave.  Now, no damage has been caused to me.  …   the locks were picked but they are intact. I have suffered no financial loss. But there is trespass. And that’s a rot   that is a wrong that I am entitled to seek redress against, even though I am not entitled to any redress in relation to the property that was moved.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">So, for example, the IP rights, if you fraudulently masquerade as a[n] officer of the company, that is a breach of well, that’s a tort. That tortious the   company the proper process of company the organisation of companies is engaged. Now, trust law isn’t engaged.  </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">…</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">… But if we do not succeed on judicial estoppel, and they can said  and they are allowed to say that this is a   or wha---they prove to the---or they can rely on the judgment of the Singapore Court to say all this is on trust, there are still claims that well, there are still wrongs to be addressed. We have genuine grievances that we are entitled to seek … redress for. I heard---if either company, I’m the legal owner of the company, I’m the legal owner of or the company is a legal owner of intellectual property rights at that point of time, there is a proper way of transferring these, either by way of a court order or by way of an agreement. But you don’t masquerade, you don’t pretend to be my officer and take those.  You don’t come into my house and take my sta---take your stuff without my permission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">We will address this in terms of the scope of the ASI that could be granted, if we were so minded.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Judicial estoppel claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 We are also of the view that the claim in judicial estoppel is an attempt by BCS to relitigate the issue of Chantal’s declaration to the US Bankruptcy Courts. In oral arguments before us, Mr Thio SC emphasised that BCS did not raise, and thus this court did not have to decide, the claim in judicial estoppel. In response, Baker’s counsel, Ms Woo Shu Yan (“Ms Woo”), argued that BCS could, and should, have raised the claim in judicial estoppel before this court. As a result, having failed to raise the claim in judicial estoppel earlier, BCS could not now be allowed a second bite at the cherry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 We agree with Ms Woo. It is vexatious and oppressive for an ASI defendant not just to relitigate issues which has been decided by the forum court, but also issues which <span class="font-italic">could, and should</span>, have been brought before the forum court (but were not): <span class="font-italic">Raphael</span> at [5.19]; <span class="font-italic">Gee</span> at [14-094]; <span class="font-italic">Noble Assurance v Gerling-</span><span class="font-italic">Konzern</span> [2006] EWHC 253 (Comm) (“<span class="font-italic">Noble Assurance</span>”) at [95] (this principle can be analogised to the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> as pronounced in the seminal decision of <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span>). This principle is expressed in <span class="font-italic">Raphael </span>at [5.19] in the following terms:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">When a matter was not decided in the original … proceedings, but could and should have been raised in those proceedings, it has been held that in appropriate circumstances it can be an ‘abuse of process’ and thus vexatious and oppressive, to seek to raise those matters in subsequent foreign litigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In our judgment, the claim in judicial estoppel <span class="font-italic">could</span>, and <span class="font-italic">should</span>, have been raised by the defendants before this court, in the Suit. Mr Thio SC argued otherwise, and there were, broadly speaking, two planks to his arguments: (a) first, that that the claim in judicial estoppel is <span class="font-italic">not </span>an attack on the findings of this court such that it did not matter whether or not judicial estoppel was raised before us in the Suit; and (b) secondly, that the claim in judicial estoppel could not have been raised in Singapore. We find neither of these planks convincing, and address them in turn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 We begin with Mr Thio’s argument that the claim in judicial estoppel <span class="font-italic">does not </span>amount to an attack on the findings of this court. We find it important to set out again, in a fair bit of detail, our exchanges with Mr Thio on this point:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">Loh, JAD: Alright. So let me ask you this. Was it not argued before us that we certainly shouldn’t be allowing a party to make a statement on oath to a US Court, mislead the US Court, and now come to us and say, ‘Well, please forget all about that’?  Now, that argument was made before us.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">Thio: Yes, but the preclusive effect of that ar---with   the effect of that statement is a little different.  Because it goes to either credibility or it’s something to persuade Your Honour that, look, the trust cannot exist because you have to make the---because Chantal said something directly opposite to what she’s asserting here.  But---…</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">Loh, JAD: But I’m having difficulty with that, Mr Thio, because what I just said was clearly said to us in the context of public policy and illegality. ‘You shouldn’t allow a party to go on oath and say these things’. And it was pointed out to us in no uncertain terms that this paragraph, that paragraph, <span class="font-italic">et cetera</span>, of what Chantal had filed in the bankruptcy proceedings were lies. And therefore, as a matter of public policy, we shouldn’t let somebody disavow what she said.  Now, I can’t see, I think that is the point Justice Berger was bringing up, counsel also say, ‘By the way, the United States, if they try to do this, there’s judicial estoppel. And there’s no way they would be allowed to disavow what they told the Court. And here are the authorities.’</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">…</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">Loh, JAD: But the question is, you are now, no doubt to me in my mind and speaking for myself, having a second bite of the cherry on an issue that should have been raised here.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">Thio: ...  In Singapore, the argument that was thought most likely to succeed or to persuade Your Honours, which failed eventually, was the public policy and illegality argument.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">But that is not the same as a judicial estoppel argument, which is a distinct or a defined doctrine under US law. It appears explicitly in the text of the decision cited. But---and not in Singapore. It doesn’t appear here. So we couch it in different terms. Like, we---they did a bad thing. You ought not to countenance this behaviour. And therefore, we wrap it up and try to bring it under the doctrine of illegality. At---but that failed. And illegality is a complex issue which has different requirements and it has different consequences.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">So it---it’s not the same doctrine, Your Honour.  It---it’s closely related on the facts but they are legally distinct. I think that’s the best answer that I can offer</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">Berger, IJ: Wouldn’t you have to agree that if the trust, as this Court has determined, if there is a trust, that all of your claims would have to fail? … If there is a trust, then your clients don’t have any interest in what’s been transpiring since the existence of the trust has been decided. And even if there were misrepresentations made to obtain a transfer of the trademark or whatever, it’s of no consequence and of no interest in terms of standing for your clients to complain about it.  Unless you can convince the Court that it should ignore the existence of the trust.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">Thio: Well, I think that is one reason why that---why a declaration is being sought. Because the---my learned friend says that the declaration goes completely contrary to the finding of this Court.  I beg to differ. Because what the declaration says is that you cannot---I mean, the Singapore Court’s jurisdiction is not being challenged.  You   the---they can’t take a US Court decision saying the exact opposite and come to Singapore and say the Singapore Court should change its position. No, it’s enforceable. BCS is a Singapore company. It’s enfor---that decision is enforceable against them. They can’t run away from it.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">Well---and in a world where we have multiple cate---you have multiple suits with a possibility of inconsistent decisions, that’s something that we accept. We deal with it, …</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">But the declaration is that they are judicially estopped from asserting that there is a trust. So that’s different from the question of whether there is a trust or not. It is a preclusionary---it’s a preclusion. They are precluded … </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">Berger, IJ: No, I understand that the judicial estoppel position or claim, if you were successful in the United States, would mean that the client in Singapore would be unable to rely on there being a trust because the plaintiff would be estopped from bringing it up. So you could proceed as if there’s been no determination of that trust because of estoppel. And as we have discussed a minute ago, that’s something that could have been presented to this Court as another reason why the California Court would not find this to be a valid trust on the basis that you cannot raise this, having previously taken a contrary position. But as things stand right now, where it wasn’t raised in Singapore, you’re asking the US Court to ignore it on the basis of judicial estoppel.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">…</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">Thio: … I mean, of course, this is assuming, and this is still in answer to Justice Berger’s point that, <span class="font-italic">if we do not succeed on the trust issue and that we   and they</span><span class="font-italic">---and that the---everything is held on trust for the estate, I mean, is there anything left?</span></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">… </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">Loh, JAD: Alright. So let’s leave that to one side. Your learned friend has read out parts of your client’s current statement of claim or points of claim. And it seems to say that you’re disavowing there’s any trust.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">Thio: Well, the---of course, in the original complaint, you will find that they are this---the original complaint, which was running, I suppose, in parallel to the Singapore proceedings, does disavow the trust. But with the (indistinct) complaint, as you can see from the remedy that has been sought, where the remedy is that they are judicially estopped from asserting the---a trust from arising …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 To begin with, Mr Thio SC conceded that the claims in illegality and public policy on one hand, and judicial estoppel on the other, are “closely related”. We do not think these claims are “closely related”, but instead are the same<span class="font-italic"> </span>facets or aspects which fall within the overlapping area of two intersecting circles. In the Suit, the Defendants’ case, on illegality and public policy, was that Chantal orchestrated Renslade (NZ) to purchase the Ethocyn Rights, and made false declarations in the US Bankruptcy Proceedings to approve the sale of the Ethocyn rights to Renslade (NZ). To that extent, the Trust Agreement, and by extension the Trust, would be unenforceable (see Judgment at [242]–[245]). We have dealt with this issue extensively in the Judgment at [258]–[269], having found that the declarations by Chantal were false. In particular, we highlight that arguments were made before us not only on illegality under Singapore law, but also under California law, which pertained to both illegality <span class="font-italic">and</span> public policy, as well as going to whether the trust was constituted for a valid purpose. We note in particular the Defendants’ argument, as we summarised at [283] of the Judgment, was that: “because Chantal’s false statements to the Bankruptcy Court constituted a fraud on the court, public policy prohibits enforcement of the Trust”. Having considered these various submissions and having heard US counsel, we concluded that the Trust was enforceable under Singapore and California law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Turning to the judicial estoppel claim, BCS <span class="font-italic">again </span>relies on Chantal’s false statements or misrepresentations to the US Bankruptcy Court to argue that the Estate cannot assert the Trust as against the Defendants. As we noted in the oral hearing, the Defendants could have easily added judicial estoppel as another ground on which the Trust could not be enforced in their arguments before us in the Suit. They had already put forward a litany of complaints on the same factual basis, and we do not see any reason why they could not have included judicial estoppel as well. In fact, the phrase “illegality and public policy” could have very well been replaced with the phrase “judicial estoppel”, and the Defendants’ arguments before us would have remained the same (albeit buttressed by further submissions on the legal aspects of judicial estoppel). As an illustration, the Defendants had submitted in their reply submissions dated 27 December 2019 at paragraph 227:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the Plaintiff’s Allegations are true, then the statements made by Ms Burnison in the US proceedings under penalty of perjury which disavowed any interest in Renslade NZ or the Ethocyn Rights would have been <span class="font-underline">false, and made </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">deliberately</span><span class="font-underline"> with the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">knowledge</span><span class="font-underline"> that they were false</span>. Ms Burnison’s fraudulent statements constituted <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">clear breaches of US law</span>, <span class="font-italic">including</span> (a) perjury, (b) fraud on the court, (c) violation of 18 U.S.C. s 152, and (d) violation of 18 U.S.C. s 157. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It would not have been surprising or out of place if the Defendants had simply added a further argument that the same also gave rise to judicial estoppel under California law that prevented Baker from asserting the existence of the Trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Facing this hurdle, Mr Thio SC attempted to draw a distinction between the argument on illegality and public policy, which answers the question of “whether there is a trust or not”, and the argument on judicial estoppel, which would preclude the plaintiffs from “asserting that there is a trust”. As we have stated above (see [59]), we find this a distinction without any difference and totally unconvincing. Both of these arguments stem from the <span class="font-italic">same </span>fact, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that “Chantal said something [before the US Bankruptcy Courts] directly opposite to what she’s asserting here [in the Suit]”. Furthermore, this distinction suggests that the only thing that the court is concerned with in terms of illegality and public policy is the existence of the trust, whereas, in truth, this argument can also be characterised as an issue of <span class="font-italic">enforceability</span> of the trust, which overlaps significantly with what a plaintiff can or cannot assert in proceedings based on the trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 More importantly, however one characterised these various defences, both of the arguments on illegality/public policy and judicial estoppel go towards the <span class="font-italic">existence and enforceability </span>of the Trust as a matter of substance, which are matters already canvassed in the Judgment. The weakness of Mr Thio SC’s distinction is most clearly shown through his exchanges with Berger IJ. When asked whether “if there is a trust … all of [BCS’s] claims [in the Californian Proceedings] would have to fail”, Mr Thio SC conceded that all of BCS’s claims would fail. But the existence of the Trust was clearly a finding made by this court. Further, Mr Thio SC also conceded that BCS would not have standing in any of the claims brought in the Californian Proceedings unless “[BCS] can convince the [Californian] Court that it should ignore the existence of the trust”. In the same vein, Mr Thio accepted that “in answer to [Berger IJ’s] point that, if we do not succeed on the trust issue and that …  everything is held on trust for the estate, I mean, is there anything left?” Put differently, the claim in judicial estopped aims to achieve the substantial result that the Trust Assets and Trust Monies are <span class="font-italic">not </span>held on Trust for the Estate. But this court clearly found to the contrary (see references cited at [21] above). Put another way, it is clear from Mr Thio SC’s arguments, that the judicial estoppel claim is a necessary step for BCS in the Californian Proceedings <span class="font-italic">because </span>it would circumvent our findings concerning the Trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 We make one further point on the <span class="font-italic">timing </span>of the judicial estoppel claim. BCS only added this claim in the First Amended Complaint <span class="font-italic">after </span>the Appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. The timing suggests that the claim in judicial estoppel was strategically concealed by BCS, to be deployed in the event that the Appeal did not end in its favour.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 For the reasons stated in [73]–[77] above, the claim in judicial estoppel <span class="font-italic">was </span>an attack on the Judgment of this court, because it was, in substance, seeking to establish that the Trust Assets and Trust Monies were <span class="font-italic">not</span> held on Trust for the benefit of the Estate. It therefore follows that this claim <span class="font-italic">should </span>have been raised before this court in the Suit, where the issue of the existence and enforceability of the Trust was exhaustively canvassed, unless there is any reason why this claim <span class="font-italic">could</span> <span class="font-italic">not</span> have been heard in the Suit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 This brings us to the second plank of Mr Thio SC’s argument, that judicial estoppel <span class="font-italic">could not</span> have been raised in Singapore. We agree that if there were legitimate reasons to not have pursued the claim in judicial estoppel, then BCS should not be penalised for failing to raise the same before us during the Suit. If, however, there is no legitimate reason, then BCS would not be allowed to drip-feed issues in multiple fora, which would be vexatious and oppressive. This is in line with the <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> doctrine referenced above at [34].  In <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Hender</span><span class="font-italic">son</span> at 382, Wigram VC observed:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[W]here a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in, and of adjudication by, a court of competent jurisdiction, the court requires the parties to that litigation to bring forward their whole case, and will not (except under special circumstances) permit the same parties to open the same subject of litigation in respect of a matter which might have been brought forward as part of the subject in contest, but which was not brought forward only because they have, from negligence, inadvertence, or even accident, omitted part of their case. The plea of res judicata applies, except in special case[s], <span class="font-italic">not only to points upon which the court was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 This principle was elaborated in <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck and others </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 453 (“<span class="font-italic">Nellie Goh</span>”) at [53]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… To put it shortly, a court should determine whether there is an abuse of process by looking at all the circumstances of the case, including whether the later proceedings in substance is nothing more than a collateral attack upon the previous decision; whether there is fresh evidence that might warrant re-litigation; whether there are <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> reasons why an issue that ought to have been raised in the earlier action was not; and whether there are some other special circumstances that might justify allowing the case to proceed. The absence or existence of these enumerated factors (which are not intended to be exhaustive) is not decisive. In determining whether the ambient circumstances of the case give rise to an abuse of process, the court should not adopt an inflexible or unyielding attitude but should remain guided by the balance to be found in the tension between the demands of ensuring that a litigant who has a genuine claim is allowed to press his case in court and recognising that there is a point beyond which repeated litigation would be unduly oppressive to the defendant. <span class="font-italic">In the context of cases such as the present, the inquiry is directed not at the theoretical possibility that the issue raised in the later proceedings could conceivably have been taken in the earlier but rather at whether, having regard to the substance and reality of the earlier action, it reasonably ought to have been</span>. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">These principles as laid down in <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie </span>were subsequently approved by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">The Royal Bank of Scotland NV (formerly known as ABN </span><span class="font-italic">Amro Bank NV) &amp; others v TT International (nTan Advisory Pte Ltd &amp; others) and another appeal </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1104 at [102].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Here, Mr Thio SC explained that judicial estoppel was not raised before this court as estoppel would be a matter of procedure governed by the <span class="font-italic">lex </span><span class="font-italic">fori</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Singapore law, and Singapore law does not recognise judicial estoppel.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Defendants’ Written Submissions for SUM 37 (16 September 2021) at para 87(d).</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> We do not think that Mr Thio SC’s explanation here passes muster. Whether a rule of law is substantive or procedural in nature is to be decided by the process of <span class="font-italic">characterisation</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>undertaken by the forum courts. While the <span class="font-italic">existing</span> categories of estoppel recognised by <span class="font-italic">English</span> law are procedural, this does not mean that judicial estoppel <span class="font-italic">must necessarily </span>be procedural under <span class="font-italic">Singapore </span>law. In fact, <span class="font-italic">Dicey</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>expressly recognises that whether a <span class="font-italic">specif</span><span class="font-italic">ic specie </span>of estoppel can be characterised as a rule of substance or procedure “may well vary with the type of estoppel under consideration” (<span class="font-italic">Dicey</span> at [7–038], citing Yeo Tiong Min SC (<span class="font-italic">ho</span><span class="font-italic">n</span>), <span class="font-italic">Choice of Law for Equitable Doctrines</span> (OUP, 1st Ed, 2004) at 134–136).  It was thus <span class="font-italic">open</span> to the Defendants to raise the facts relating to the judicial estoppel claim, and to raise the question of <span class="font-italic">characterisation </span>before us. The fact is that they failed to do so <span class="font-italic">at all</span>, preventing this court from even considering the proper characterisation of judicial estoppel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In the circumstances, this was entirely unsatisfactory, given that the Defendants had also made extensive submissions to this court during the Suit about California law through their US counsel. Insofar that the Californian courts would have considered the claim in judicial estoppel, there was no reason why this claim “could [not] have been presented to this Court as another reason why the California Court would not find this to be a valid trust” (see [72] above). Indeed, we have already observed at [74] above that the claim of judicial estoppel would neatly fall in place together with the other bases on which the Defendants sought to contest the enforceability of the Trust. As a matter of substance and reality, we find that the issue of judicial estoppel <span class="font-italic">ought</span> to have been raised before us (see <span class="font-italic">Nellie Goh</span> at [53]), and that it “properly belonged to the subject of litigation” (<span class="font-italic">Henderson v Hender</span><span class="font-italic">son</span> at 382). To allow the Defendants to pursue this in the Californian Proceedings, in the light of our view that those proceedings amount in substance to a collateral attack on a Singapore Judgment, would be oppressive as well as an abuse of process and warrants this court’s intervention. <span class="font-italic">Raphael</span> aptly states (at para 19.44, footnote 81) that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In this regard, the Singapore courts have adopted the remark in the first edition of this work that ‘the greater the positive and voluntary involvement of the injunction respondent in the local proceedings, and the longer the local suit has been allowed to proceed before the commencement of the parallel proceedings, the stronger the case for an injunction’ (see <span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Sandipala Arthaputra v STMicroelectronics Asia Pacific</span> [2015] 5 SLR 873 at [137]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Wrongful Settlement Claims</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 However, we recognise that the Wrongful Settlement Claims does not amount to an attempt at relitigating issues that we have already decided. First, the facts giving rise to the Wrongful Settlement Claims were only uncovered by BCS <span class="font-italic">after the Appeal concluded</span>. Baker did not dispute this. More significantly, Baker also did not contend that these facts <span class="font-italic">could have been discovered by BCS </span><span class="font-italic">with reasonable diligence</span>. This court clearly did not deal with the issue of the Wrongful Settlement Claims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Secondly, the crux of the Wrongful Settlement Claims does not rest with the ownership of the Ethocyn Rights, but rather with Baker’s misrepresentation to Nu Skin that he was a representative of BCS. As far as Nu Skin was concerned, its counterparty was BCS, who held legal title to the Ethocyn Rights. To that extent, BCS was the proper party who should deal with Nu Skin, even if BCS was only holding to the Ethocyn Rights on trust for the Estate. Again, if the Estate wanted to deal with Nu Skin directly, the proper course of action was for BCS to first divest legal title in the Ethocyn Rights to the Estate. Baker was not entitled to “short-circuit” the process by lying about his affiliation with BCS. Therefore, BCS would be entitled to pursue the Wrongful Settlement Claims against Baker <span class="font-italic">in his personal capacity.</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Californian Proceedings are still at an early stage</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 For completeness, we are mindful of the principle that an ASI should not be granted if foreign proceedings have proceeded to an advanced stage because of considerations of comity: <span class="font-italic">Sun Travel &amp; Tours Pvt Ltd v Hilton International Manage (Maldives) Pvt Ltd </span>[2019] 1 SLR 732 at [82]. In this case, the Californian Proceedings are still at an early stage, with <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">BCS still being able to amend its pleadings and discovery yet to begin. This is not a situation where the Californian Proceedings have advanced to the trial stage such that there would be a wastage of resources if BCS is restrained from continuing with the proceedings, nor has the US court made any findings which may be undermined by the ASI. The balance of convenience, therefore, points towards the grant of the ASI.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 A related consideration is that of delay. In this regard, we note that SUM 37 was filed only on June 2021, almost two years after the Californian Proceedings were commenced (see [29] above). However, we do not find this to be fatal. As Ms Woo explained, instead of applying before this court for an ASI, the plaintiff decided to apply in California for a stay of the Californian Proceedings

</div> (even though we note that the plaintiff initially applied to <span class="font-italic">dismiss </span>the Californian Proceedings on the ground of <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span> in October 2019 but failed, and the Californian Proceedings were only stayed by consent in June 2020). Ms Woo further reminded this Court that there was another action in the US commenced by Dev Service SA (“Dev”), a company owned and controlled by Weber, against a property at Lake Arrowhead (“Arrowhead Property”) which was bought using the Trust Monies (“Arrowhead Litigation”). According to Ms Woo, the Arrowhead Litigation was withdrawn after the Appeal was dismissed. For that reason, the plaintiff expected that the Californian Proceedings would also be withdrawn. But they were surprised when they were not. We accept Ms Woo’s explanation as to why SUM 37 was not filed earlier, and on that basis find that there is no delay sufficient to defeat the plaintiff’s application for the ASI.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">BCS should not be allowed to claim against the US Defendants</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 For the foregoing reasons, BCS should not be allowed to continue the Californian Proceedings against <span class="font-italic">the Estate</span>. However, in the Californian Proceedings, BCS is also claiming against the US Defendants. A question thus arises as to whether BCS should also be restrained from claiming against the US Defendants, notwithstanding that they did not appear as parties to the Suit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 We are of the view that this question should be answered in the affirmative. The forum court has the power to enjoin an ASI defendant from litigating, in foreign proceedings, against those <span class="font-italic">who are not parties to the proceedings before the </span><span class="font-italic">forum court</span>: <span class="font-italic">Gee </span>at [14-094]; <span class="font-italic">Noble Assurance </span>at [95]–[97]; <span class="font-italic">Crescendo Maritime Co v Bank of Communications </span>[2016] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 414 (“<span class="font-italic">Crescendo</span>”) at [54]–[56].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In <span class="font-italic">Noble Assurance</span>, a London reinsurer commenced proceedings abroad attempting to nullify the result of a London arbitration award against the reinsured, who was party to the arbitration, as well as the ultimate reinsured, who was not party to the arbitration. The English High Court found that it was vexatious of the reinsurer to commence foreign proceedings against the reinsured. Further, and more importantly, insofar that the reinsurer joined the ultimate insured in the foreign proceedings on the basis that they shared the same legal position, it was equally vexatious of the reinsurer to claim against the ultimate reinsured as well. To that extent, the English High Court found that it had jurisdiction to grant a temporary injunction enjoining the reinsurer from claiming against both the reinsured and ultimate reinsured. In <span class="font-italic">Crescendo</span>, the position in <span class="font-italic">Noble Assurance</span> was accepted as part of the <span class="font-italic">ratio </span>of the latter case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In our view, the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Noble Assurance</span> applies with equal (or even greater) force to the present case. Many claims against the US Defendants are also premised on the footing that BCS/Renslade HK own the Ethocyn Rights absolutely, which is contrary to the findings of this court in the Suit. Further, the Daughters and the Grey Pacific Companies, while not parties to the Singapore proceedings, are inextricably linked to the Trust. Heika and Burka are the beneficiaries of the Estate, the latter of which is the only beneficiary of the Trust. Heika gave evidence before us. BCS Pharma and Grey Pacific Companies were incorporated to serve as vehicles for Baker and the Daughters. Put another way, the US Defendants are clearly parties who should have the benefit of the Singapore judgment even if they are not, strictly speaking, privy to the same. The attempt to make these claims against the US Defendants, in our view, clearly amount to an attempt to denude our judgment of any real practical effect, since, if successful, BCS’s argument would suggest that Chantal’s daughters, the beneficiaries of the Estate, cannot then rely on our findings that the Estate was the beneficiary of the Trust. To that extent, this court would be justified in enjoining BCS from suing the US Defendants.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The ambit of the ASI</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 For the reasons set out above, we are of the view that many of the claims pursued by BCS in the Californian Proceedings amount to an attempt at relitigating matters already decided by this court, and thus vexatious and oppressive and amount to an abuse of process. We also find that BCS’s claims are vexatious and oppressive towards the Estate. Moreover, these claims relitigating the same issues that have been decided by this court amount to a collateral attack of this court’s Judgment. This justifies the issuance of an ASI against BCS, to restrain BCS from relitigating the subject-matter of the Suit against the Estate <span class="font-italic">and </span>the US Defendants through the Californian Proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 However, we have also noted that not <span class="font-italic">all </span>of the claims pursued by BCS are attempts at relitigating issues already decided by this court.

The intellectual property rights in the Ethocyn (“the Ethocyn Rights”) were held by companies controlled by Chantal, which entered into bankruptcy proceedings in the US (“the US Bankruptcy Proceedings”) in February 1999. The Ethocyn Rights were acquired by Renslade New Zealand with the approval of the US Bankruptcy Court in October 1999, and subsequently transferred to Renslade Singapore, sometime between 2000 and 2001 or 2002 and eventually to BCS on 1 April 2002. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 In November 2017, the Estate commenced the suit (“the Suit”) against the defendants (BCS, Marcus Weber (“Weber”) and Renslade Holdings Ltd (“Renslade (HK)”)) (collectively, “the Defendants”), alleging that the Defendants were trustees of the Ethocyn Rights for the Estate, and had breached their fiduciary duties. In August 2019, while the Suit was underway, BCS commenced proceedings in the United States District Court for the Central District of California (“the Californian Proceedings”) against Baker and BCS Pharma Corporation (“BCS Pharma”), alleging that Baker had wrongfully diverted payment due to BCS to BCS Pharma (“the Intercepted Payment Claim”). The Californian Proceedings were stayed in June 2020 because of the Singapore proceedings.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 The SICC rendered its judgment in <span class="font-italic">Baker, Michael A (executor of the estate of Chantal </span><span class="font-italic">Burnison, deceased) v BCS Business Consulting Services Pte Ltd and others</span> [2020] 4 SLR 85 (“the Judgment”) on 29 April 2020. In the Judgment, the court held that there was a valid and enforceable trust agreement governed by Singapore law as between Weber and Chantal. Chantal was the beneficial owner of the Ethocyn Rights, and the moneys and income generated therefrom (“the Trust Assets and Trust Monies”). The bulk of the Trust Monies were derived from a supply and distribution agreement between the Defendants and one Nu Skin International Inc (“Nu Skin”). In particular, this court rejected the defence of illegality raised by the Defendants. The Trust remained valid and enforceable in spite of Chantal’s false declaration to the US Bankruptcy Court to conceal her interest in the transfer of the Ethocyn Rights from the Chantal companies to Renslade New Zealand. The Defendants breached their fiduciary duties, and were ordered to account to the plaintiff for the Trust Assets and Trust Monies (“the Account”).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 The Defendants’ appeal against the Judgment (“the Appeal”) was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in January 2021. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 In March 2021, the US District Court lifted the stay on the Californian Proceedings. BCS then joined Chantal’s daughters (“the Daughters”) and two companies incorporated by the Daughters, one Grey Pacific Labs LLC and Grey Pacific Science, Inc (“Grey Pacific Companies”) as defendants to the Californian Proceedings, and included further complaints against Baker, BCS Pharma, the Daughters and Grey Pacific Companies (collectively, “the US Defendants”). BCS’ complaints include, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that Baker wrongfully caused all trademark rights related to the Ethocyn Rights to be conveyed to the Grey Pacific Labs, cutting the Defendants out of business (“the Trademark Claim”), that Baker was “judicially estopped” from asserting the existence of the Trust in the California courts (“the Judicial Estoppel Claim”), and that Baker had wrongfully held himself out as a representative of BCS in reaching a settlement agreement with Nu Skin (“the Wrongful Settlement Claims”), in addition to the Intercepted Payment Claim.  </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 On 14 May 2021, the plaintiff filed a separate application for payment due on the taking of the Account (“the Accounting Application”). On 16 June 2021, the plaintiff made the present application for an anti-suit injunction (“the ASI Application”).</div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Dispute</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 The plaintiff made the ASI Application on the basis that the Californian Proceedings were a collateral attack on the Judgment, as BCS took the position in the Californian Proceedings that BCS remained the absolute owner of the Ethocyn Rights, contrary to the SICC’s findings affirming the existence of the Trust. BCS’s conduct was therefore vexatious and oppressive, and an ASI should be granted.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 BCS, however, argued that it did not seek to undermine the court’s Judgment, as the causes of action in the Californian Proceedings were separate and distinct from those adjudicated upon by the court. The Californian Proceedings also concerned new facts discovered after the Appeal, including the new claims against Baker in his personal capacity.  </div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 The jurisdiction to grant an ASI was to be exercised when the “ends of justice” require it. The court would consider factors such as the defendant’s amenability to the court’s jurisdiction, the natural forum of the resolution of the dispute between the parties, the alleged vexation or oppression to the plaintiffs if the foreign proceedings were to continue (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">45</span>]–[<span class="font-weight-bold">46</span>]). It would be vexatious and oppressive for a defendant to re-litigate issues decided by the forum court in the foreign proceedings (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">49</span>]). The court would also grant an ASI to prevent the abuse of its processes and to protect the court’s own judgment from being undermined by a defendant in the foreign proceedings (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">53</span>]). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 The court found that the Intercepted Payment Claims were an attempt by the Defendants to re-litigate matters already decided in the Judgment, contradicting its  findings in the Judgment that the Trust Assets and Trust Monies belonged to the Estate beneficially (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">67</span>]). But with respect to the Trademark Claims, insofar as they pertained to Baker’s holding out as the officer of BCS, that did not amount to re-litigation (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">68</span>]). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 The Judicial Estoppel Claim was also an attempt to re-litigate the issue of Chantal’s false declarations before the US Bankruptcy Courts (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">69</span>]). It was vexatious to re-litigate issues that could and should have been brought before the forum court (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">70</span>]). The Defendants failed to raise the Judicial Estoppel Claim at all, despite having extensively raised the existence, validity and enforceability of the Trust under Singapore and US laws, including the defence of illegality and public policy as key issues in the Suit; all of which arose from the same facts (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">73</span>]–[<span class="font-weight-bold">76</span>]). It was therefore oppressive to allow the Defendants to pursue the Judicial Estoppel Claim in the Californian Proceedings and it was also an abuse of process (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">81</span>]).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">13 The court did not consider the Wrongful Settlement Claims an attempt at re-litigation, because the facts were uncovered after the Appeal concluded (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">82</span>]), and did not concern the ownership of the Ethocyn Rights (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">83</span>]).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">14 Other factors also leaned in favour of granting an ASI. The Defendants did not object to the court’s jurisdiction, and willingly participated in the Singapore proceedings, including those for the Accounting Application heard together with the ASI Application (at [62]). That the California court was the natural forum was immaterial so long as the forum court had sufficient interest with the case. The court had sufficient interest in protecting its judgment from a collateral attack (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">65</span>]).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">15 As the Californian Proceedings were at an early stage with discovery yet to be completed, there would be no wastage of resources; the balance of convenience therefore pointed towards granting the ASI (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">84</span>]).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">16 The court held that the ASI applied to the other US Defendants who were not parties to this Suit. The claims against the US Defendants were based on BCS’s absolute ownership of the Ethocyn Rights, which contradicted the court’s findings and threatened to denude the Judgment of any real practical effect (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">86</span>]–[<span class="font-weight-bold">89</span>]). </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">17 In conclusion, the court found that many of BCS’s claims in the Californian Proceedings were an attempt at re-litigating matters already decided by the court, which were oppressive and vexatious and amounted to an abuse of process, for which an ASI was granted (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">90</span>], [<span class="font-weight-bold">92(a)</span>] and [<span class="font-weight-bold">93</span>]). But BCS was allowed to pursue other claims that did not impinge on the findings concerning the existence, validity and/or enforceability of the Trust (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">91</span>] and [<span class="font-weight-bold">92(b)</span>]). The court also granted an ASI preventing the Defendants from prosecuting or continuing to prosecute any proceedings in the United States or anywhere else in the world which pertained to such issues that had been the subject of litigation before the court (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">94</span>]).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
