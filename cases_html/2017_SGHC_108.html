</div><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> Chinpo was incorporated in Singapore on 11 August 1970 by Tan Cheng Hoe (“Tan”). It carries on the businesses of “ship agencies &amp; ship chandlers” (</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">ie</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">representing ships and supplying bunker, stores, and spare parts to them) and “general wholesale trade (including general importers and exporters).”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">5 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Tan was a director of Chinpo and its associated companies, Tonghae Shipping Agency (Private) Limited (“Tonghae”) and Great Best Trading (Private) Limited (“Great Best”) (collectively, the “Companies”). He was also a shareholder in Tonghae and Great Best, but not in Chinpo. There was no substantive separation between the Companies. They shared the same premises at 7500A Beach Road, #09-320/321 (the “Premises”), and the same set of employees. They used the same email account to communicate with entities from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (“DPRK”), and used the same Bank of China (“BOC”) account (the “BOC Account”) to receive and perform remittances.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">6 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Tan has two daughters, Tan Hui Tin (“Hui Tin”) and Tan Bee Tin (“Bee Tin”), both of whom were accounts executives in Chinpo as well as directors and/or shareholders in each of the Companies. Hui Tin and Bee Tin oversaw the day-to-day operations of the Companies, and all other staff reported to them. Still, Tan visited the Premises every day, and was consulted on “major matters” concerning the Companies.</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Dealings with entities from DPRK </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">7 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">In the 1970s, Tan began interacting with DPRK entities while working as an employee in his brother’s company, which dealt with DPRK entities. Subsequently, Korea Tonghae Shipping Co (“Korea Tonghae”), one of the largest ship operators in the DPRK, appointed Chinpo as its shipping agent. In 1984, Tonghae was established to be the shipping agent for Korea Tonghae, and Chinpo provided its ship agency services to other DPRK entities. Nevertheless, Chinpo continued to provide goods and services to the vessels of Korea Tonghae, while Tonghae processed the documentation for the vessels to enter and depart Singapore.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">8 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">After Korea Tonghae underwent a re-organisation in the late-1990s, Chinpo and Tonghae began providing their services to Ocean Maritime Management Company Limited (“OMM”) instead of Korea Tonghae. Tan characterised OMM as the “new name” of Korea Tonghae. Among the vessels administered by Korea Tonghae (and then OMM) was the DPRK-flagged </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">MV </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Chong Chon Gang</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> (the “Ship”)</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, which was owned by Chongchongang Shipping Company Limited, a DPRK one-ship company.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">9 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">In 2005, Tan partitioned off part of the Premises for the DPRK Embassy in Singapore (“the Embassy”) to use as its mailing address. Tan offered the partitioned area to the Embassy without cost to build goodwill with the DPRK entities. No one from the Embassy was based permanently at the Premises. At the suggestion of Tan, the Embassy listed Tan as its “security guard” with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Singapore so that he could enter the partitioned area and collect mail for it. These arrangements have continued since.</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">2 April 2009–3 July 2013 outward remittances totalling US$40,138,840.87</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">10 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">In the course of providing ship agency services to OMM, Chinpo received moneys from the sale of freight on behalf of OMM (via the BOC Account). With these funds, Chinpo paid for the costs of shipping the freight, the sums due to itself for ship agency services, and the salaries of the OMM staff stationed in Singapore. Thereafter, Chinpo remitted moneys left over to overseas entities in accordance with the instructions of OMM. Hui Tin and Bee Tin maintained the records of these remittances on behalf of OMM.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">11 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">According to the Statement of Agreed Facts, between 2 April 2009 and 3 July 2013, Chinpo made 605 outward remittances on behalf of OMM and the other DPRK entities from the BOC Account (the “605 Remittances”), and charged a fee of at least US$50 per remittance on most occasions. The total value of the 605 Remittances was US$40,138,840.87.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">12 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">By 2012, however, the demand for ship agency services from OMM had declined. Nevertheless, Chinpo maintained its office and kept its staff, hoping that business from OMM would pick up. Chinpo also continued remitting moneys for OMM to preserve its working relationship with OMM.</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">8 July 2013 outward remittance of US$72,016.76</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">13 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">On 11 April 2013, the Ship departed the DPRK for a voyage to Cuba and back (the “Voyage”).

Fenton and Co., S.A. (“CB Fenton”), a shipping agent operating at the Panama Canal. This sum was payment for the transit expenses of the Ship in the Panama Canal (en route to Cuba), which the Ship passed through on 1 June 2013. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">15 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">On 4 June 2013, the Ship discharged its cargo of steel plates at Havana, Cuba.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">16 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">On 20 June 2013, the Ship docked at Mariel, Cuba, where it took on arms and related materiel (the “Materiel”) comprising: (a) six trailers of SA-2 and SA-3 surface-to-air missile systems (“SAMs”); (b) two MiG-21 aircraft and engines for them (“MiG-21s”); and (c) ammunition and miscellaneous arms-related materiel such as rifles and night-vision binoculars.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">17 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">On 24 June 2013, the Ship docked at Puerto Padre, Cuba, where it took on 10,500mt of sugar.

Unlike the other provisions in the DPRK Regulations, Reg 12(b) contained no express mental element. Further, the words “may reasonably be used to contribute” therein did not imply that the person transferring the funds had to have known the intended use of the funds. Rather, the Prosecution only had to prove that the funds transferred could reasonably be used to contribute to the NRPA of the DPRK. The general presumption in law that a mental element is a necessary ingredient of every offence was displaced. Parliament had intended to oblige persons to exercise “greater vigilance and due diligence” to avoid contributing to the NRPA of the DPRK. Nevertheless, s 79 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) provides for a defence of a mistake of fact (the “s 79 defence”). Hence, a person would not be liable for a breach of Reg 12(b) if it can be proved on a balance of probabilities that due care and attention to avoid the breach had been exercised (GD at [121]–[127]). </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">27 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The DJ found that the Materiel, which comprised SAMs, MiG-21s, and other conventional weaponry, could reasonably be used to contribute to the NRPA of the DPRK. The DPRK was known to use SAMs to defend its nuclear sites and MiG-21s in its military operations. Further, the Transfer was a necessary payment for the transportation of the Materiel from Cuba to the DPRK via the Panama Canal. Hence, the Transfer could reasonably be used to contribute to the NRPA of the DPRK (GD at [130]–[134]).</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">28 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The DJ found further that Chinpo had failed to exercise due care and diligence to avail itself of the s 79 defence. By 2012, Chinpo should have known that OMM and the other DPRK entities with whom it dealt were state-owned entities whose funds were under the control of the government of the DPRK. Chinpo had, through Tan, a long and close relationship with the entities and diplomats of the DPRK, and knew that the representatives of the DPRK entities from whom Chinpo received instructions worked not simply for the DPRK entities concerned but also for the DPRK government. Further, Chinpo knew that DPRK entities were subject to international sanctions that prevented them from opening bank accounts to remit moneys, and that they had been taking steps to circumvent these sanctions. Yet, Chinpo simply assumed the moneys that it had been asked to remit by the DPRK entities belonged to the DPRK entities, did not query the purposes of the remittances, and executed the remittance instructions without delay. Chinpo even helped to conceal the transactions by omitting the names of the vessels concerned from the remittance application forms submitted to the BOC. The Ship itself had previously been detained in Ukraine with AK-47 rifles on board, with information about the detention available online, and Chinpo had on 8 February 2010 performed a remittance of US$52,500.00 on behalf of OMM entitled “Chong Chon Gang – Penalty”. Further, Chinpo should have been suspicious of the purposes of the Voyage, having known that the Ship was traveling from the DPRK to Cuba through the Panama Canal, and having been asked by OMM to falsely declare the name of the Ship as “MV South Hill 2” to the BOC (GD at [135]–[150]). </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">MCRBA Charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">29 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">It was undisputed that Chinpo did not have a valid remittance license at the material time.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">30 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The DJ observed that a person who carried on a “remittance business” without a valid remittance license breached s 6 of the MCRBA.

The word “business” simply described an activity of a systematic and repetitive nature. Chinpo ended up holding large sums of moneys for OMM and the other DPRK entities. Moneys had been deposited with Chinpo even when no sums were due by their depositors to it, and where it had not otherwise been involved in the transactions. These deposits continued even after the depositors’ demand for ship agency and ship chandelling services from Chinpo had drastically declined. Chinpo had also informed OMM on 7 January 2013 that it would continue to “help your company for inward/outward remittances”. These remittances were clearly unrelated to the ship agency and ship chandelling services provided by Chinpo, and were made to assist the DPRK entities to access the banking system. An OMM representative had also agreed that OMM was using Chinpo as its payment agent (GD at [155]–[158]).</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">32 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The DJ held that s 2 of the MCRBA did not require that carrying out the 605 Remittances </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">per se</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">had to yield a monetary profit for Chinpo, and Chinpo did in fact gain from doing so. Chinpo had been motivated by its desire to maintain a working relationship with OMM and the DPRK entities for business gain. Further, in return for the assistance, Tan was given access to funds for his personal investments. For example, an OMM representative had granted Chinpo an interest-free loan of over S$1m to make silver investments (GD at [159]). </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The Appeal – DPRK Regulations Charge</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Chinpo’s Submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">33 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Chinpo argues that Reg 12(b) requires the Prosecution to prove that it [</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">ie</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Chinpo] had </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">actually</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">known</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> that the Transfer was in relation to items </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">that could reasonably be used to contribute to the NRPA of the DPRK.

In the alternative, the Prosecution must prove that Chinpo had made the Transfer negligent as to the effects of the Transfer. This promotes the objects of the DPRK Regulations by obliging persons engaging in financial transfers to actively inquire as to the purposes of the transfers that they perform, yet upholds the principle that there should be no offence without a guilty mind. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">34 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Chinpo submits that it had no reason to suspect anything was amiss when it made the Transfer.

In making the remittances, Chinpo did not care to know what their purpose was and acted purely on the instructions of the DPRK entities, despite the various suspicious circumstances which should have led them to question the remittances. It also pro-actively assisted the DPRK entities in circumventing the sanctions by leaving out the [v]essel names from the remittance forms to avoid the funds being blocked.

First, different degrees of “strictness” might exist, in terms of the degree to which the Prosecution is spared from its burden of proving a mental element in respect of every physical element of the offence. Second, the physical and mental elements in an offence may overlap because some verbs may imply a state of mind in respect of a physical element of the offence. It may therefore be preferable to characterise the inquiry as one of whether the Prosecution bears the legal burden of proving a mental element on the part of the accused in respect of every physical element of the offence, rather than simply whether the offence is one of “strict liability”.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">50 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">To recapitulate, the relevant portion of Reg 12(b) reads:</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Prohibition against provision of financial services and other resources</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">12</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">.

The words, “that may reasonably be used to contribute”, qualify the nature of the financial assets/resources transferred; they do not impose a requirement of a mental state on the part of the accused in relation to the contribution of those financial assets/resources to the NRPA of the DPRK. The adverb, “reasonably”, in particular, connotes an objective standard by which the liability of the accused is to be assessed. Such a standard is incompatible with a requirement for a subjective mental element of “knowledge” on the part of the accused, leaving aside the fact that there is nothing in the language of Reg 12(b) to suggest that knowledge of the contribution of the Transfer to the NRPA of the DPRK must be proved. And this conclusion is reinforced by reading Reg 12(b) in light of Singapore’s obligations under Resolution 1874; specifically that of encouraging persons in Singapore to exercise greater vigilance to prevent the transfer of financial and other assets/resources to the DPRK.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">54 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The fact that Reg 12(b) creates a strict liability offence does not mean that the knowledge of the accused is irrelevant.

However, the s 79 defence is not applicable to Chinpo, which clearly made no checks or queries in relation to the Transfer. As the DJ found, Chinpo by the material time knew or ought to have known that OMM was a state-owned entity whose funds were under the control of the DPRK government. Yet Chinpo simply executed its remittance instructions “without delay” and without raising any queries (see [28] above). Counsel for Chinpo suggested before us that Chinpo had acted in good faith because its conduct in relation to the Transfer was consistent with its past dealings with OMM. However, we are unable to accept this contention because the past practice of Chinpo, as the DJ found, did not involve it exercising due care and attention by querying or otherwise verifying the nature of the remittance transactions that it had been asked to undertake on behalf of OMM.</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Physical requirements of Limb 12.2</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">56 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The DJ appears to have founded her conclusion that Limb 12.2 under the DPRK Regulations Charge had been made out on the bases that the Materiel could be said to reasonably contribute to the NRPA of the DPRK, and that the Transfer was a “necessary payment” for the transportation of the Materiel to the DPRK (at [27] above). However, the question under Reg 12(b) is whether the </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Transfer</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> could reasonably be used to contribute to the NRPA of the DPRK, rather than whether the </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Materiel</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> could do so. This is reflected in the language of the DPRK Regulations Charge, which refers to the Transfer of US$72,016.76 as the subject-matter that “may reasonably be used to contribute” to the </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">NRPA of the DPRK. What the Transfer was ultimately used to pay for, and the nature of and potential uses of the Materiel on board the Ship, are factors in the assessment of whether the Transfer could reasonably contribute to the NRPA of the DPRK. Nevertheless, the ultimate question remains that of the contribution (or effect) of the Transfer to the NRPA of the DPRK.

For example, a transfer that goes to the acquisition of a nuclear warhead would clearly fall within Limb 12.2.2. However, what about a transfer that goes to the payment of the transportation costs of the nuclear warhead? Or, as counsel for Chinpo contended before us, a transfer that goes to the payment of the medical expenses of the crew of the vessel that transported the nuclear warhead? Or, as is the case here, a transfer that goes to the payment of the passage of a ship carrying conventional weapons that could possibly be used in defence of the facilities in which the NRPA of the DPRK is carried out?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">59 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">On a separate note, adopting too broad and over-inclusive an interpretation of Limb 12.2.2 would have the effect of prohibiting all financial dealings with the DPRK generally rather than targeting those that may reasonably be used to contribute to the NRPA of the DPRK.

First, Limb 12.2.2 should be read no wider than that which is necessary to tackle the mischief that Reg 12(b) seeks to regulate, which is the acquisition by the DPRK of equipment, material, software, and technology directly used in the production of nuclear weapons. Second, Limb 12.2.1 further limits the transfers that fall within Reg 12(b) to those which “may reasonably be used” to achieve the purposes under Limb 12.2.2.

This is borne out in para 8(a)(ii) of Resolution 1718, by which the UNSC directed Member States to prevent the “supply, sale or transfer to the DPRK” of the assets set out on two lists, which had been prepared by France and supported by 36 other Member States. The UNSC believed that the assets set out on the two lists “could contribute to DPRK’s nuclear-related … programmes”. The two lists were adopted by the UNSC as Document S/2006/814 (United Nations Security Council, “Letter dated 13 October 2006 from the Permanent Representative of France to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council”, 13 October 2006). Document S/2006/814 makes it plain that the scope of the assets that can contribute to the NRPA of the DPRK is limited. It extends only to (a) “nuclear material, equipment and technology”; and (b) non-nuclear but “nuclear-related dual-use equipment, materials, software and related technology”.

</div><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> We are therefore unconvinced as to the contribution, for the purposes of Reg 12(b), of the SAMs and MiG-21s to the NRPA of the DPRK. More pertinently, Dr Ong-Webb appears to have taken the same expansive view that even the ammunition and miscellaneous arms-related materiel such as rifles and night-vision binoculars found on board the Ship could “contribute to the overall defence” of the DPRK. If we accept this opinion as conclusive of what “could reasonably be used to contribute” to the NRPA of the DPRK for the purpose of Reg 12(b), it would ultimately extend Reg 12(b) to even mundane logistics such as food and toiletries that facilitated the functioning of the NRPA of the DPRK. In our view, this is untenable, and it would exemplify the problem of over-inclusiveness that we have described (at [58]-[59] above). </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">74 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">We recognise that the opinion of Dr Ong-Webb was not challenged by Chinpo. However, the question of whether the shipment of the Materiel falls within the mischief of Reg 12(b) is essentially a legal inquiry. Likewise the question of the effect of the Transfer, which facilitated shipment of the Materiel. In our view, the Transfer fell outside the mischief of the DPRK Regulations.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">75 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">We are also of the view that the act of Chinpo in making the Transfer does not fall within the ambit of Limb 12.2.1. All that Chinpo knew, and as in fact appeared to be the case, was that the Transfer paid only for the passage of the Ship through the Panama Canal. Nothing suggests that Chinpo knew that the Transfer paid for a voyage that would have the effect of resulting in the shipment of the Materiel (even assuming that the shipment of the Materiel could contribute to the NRPA of the DPRK for Limb 12.2.2). The Materiel was loaded on to the Ship through the act of a separate third party, of which Chinpo had no knowledge. Although Chinpo knew that it was dealing with representatives of the DPRK government, it was unlikely to have been apparent to a reasonable person in the position of Chinpo that its transfer of funds to pay for the passage of the Ship through the Panama Canal (even with all the “red flags”, which was not the Prosecution’s case in any event) would have facilitated the shipment of the Materiel to the DPRK.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">76 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">For completeness, even if the sale of conventional weaponry would come within the blanket embargo under Reg 5 (as argued by Ms Tung),</span>

<p style="text-align: justify;">1     The appellant, Chinpo Shipping Company (Private) Limited (“Chinpo”), appealed against its convictions and sentences in the State Courts on two charges:</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p><span>2.     Chinpo was fined $80,000 in respect of the DPRK Regulations Charge and $100,000 in respect of the MCRBA Charge.</span></p>
<p><strong>Facts</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3     Chinpo carried on the business of ship agencies and ship chandlers. On 8 July 2013, it remitted US$72,016.76 to C.B. Fenton and Co. S.A., a shipping agent operating at the Panama Canal, from its Bank of China (“BOC”) account (the “Transfer”). This US$72,016.76 was used to pay the transit expenses for the passage of a DPRK-flagged vessel, the <em>MV Chong Chon Gang</em> (the “Ship”), through the Panama Canal <em>en route </em>to the DPRK. The Ship was administered by Ocean Maritime Management Company Limited (“OMM”), a DPRK ship operator, for whom Chinpo and its associated companies provided ship agency services. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4     <span>On 11 July 2013, the Ship was found with arms and related materiel (the “Materiel”) comprising (a) six trailers of SA-2 and SA-3 surface-to-air missile systems; (b) two MiG-21 aircraft and engines for them; and (c) ammunition and miscellaneous arms-related materiel such as rifles and night-vision binoculars. The Materiel was hidden under 10,500 metric tonnes of sugar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>5     </span><span>Separately, between 2 April 2009 and 3 July 2013, Chinpo had made 605 outward remittances on behalf of OMM and other DPRK entities from its BOC account, charging a fee of at least US$50 per remittance on most occasions. The total value of the 605 remittances was US$40,138,840.87.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span><strong>Judgment</strong></span></p>
<span><font size="3"></font></span>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6     The High Court allowed the appeal by Chinpo against the DPRK Regulations Charge, but dismissed the appeal by Chinpo against the MCRBA Charge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>DPRK Regulations Charge</strong></p>
<span><em><font size="3"></font></em></span>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7     In respect of the DPRK Regulations Charge, Reg 12(b) prohibits the transfer of financial assets or resources that “may reasonably be used to contribute to the nuclear-related, ballistic missile related, or other weapons of mass destruction related programs or activities of the [DPRK]” (the “NRPA of the DPRK”, for short).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">8     <span>Reg 12(b) does not require proof of knowledge on the part of the accused that the relevant transfer could reasonably be used to contribute to the NRPA of the DPRK. The word, “reasonably”, in particular, connotes an objective standard by which the liability of the accused is to be assessed. Such a standard is incompatible with a requirement for a subjective mental element of “knowledge” on the part of the accused. Nevertheless, an accused can avail itself of the defence in s 79 of the Penal Code of a mistake of fact by a person who has acted in good faith having exercised due care and attention to avoid the mistake. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>9     </span><span>In the present case, the s 79 defence was not applicable to Chinpo, which clearly made no checks or queries in relation to the Transfer. As the District Judge found, Chinpo simply executed the remittance instructions that it received, both in relation to the Transfer and past remittances, “without delay” and without raising any queries.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>10     </span><span>The question under Reg 12(b) is whether the <em>Transfer</em> could reasonably be used to contribute to the NRPA of the DPRK, rather than whether the <em>Materiel</em> could do so. What the Transfer was ultimately used to pay for, and the nature of and potential uses of the Materiel on board the Ship, are factors in the assessment of whether the Transfer could reasonably contribute to the NRPA of the DPRK. This had to be assessed as a factual matter and retrospectively, with all relevant information taken into account to determine whether (or not) the Transfer did (or did not) in fact contribute to the nuclear proliferation efforts of the DPRK. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>11     </span><span>Reg 12(b) imposes an objective standard by which the effect of the transfer of assets/resources falls to be assessed. The court must undertake this inquiry objectively – from the perspective of a reasonable person with the knowledge and in the circumstances of the accused – to assess whether such a person would have appreciated that the transfer could have the effect of contributing to the NRPA of the DPRK. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>12     </span><span>In the present case, the Transfer fell outside the mischief of the DPRK Regulations. A reasonable person in the position of Chinpo would not have appreciated that the Transfer could have had the effect of contributing to the NRPA of the DPRK. The Transfer was not for the acquisition of the Materiel but went purely to the payment of port fees and related charges for the passage of the Ship through the Panama Canal. Although the Materiel had been on board the Ship, this was not known to Chinpo when it made the Transfer. Hence, the Transfer was at least somewhat removed from a transfer of funds in direct support of the NRPA of the DPRK, which is the mischief that Reg 12(b) targets.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>13     </span><span>Reg 12(b) should not be construed so expansively as to effectively extend to all transfers <em>somehow</em> connected with the acquisition of <em>any</em> military equipment by the DPRK. To fall within Reg 12(b), a transfer must have a direct contribution to the NRPA of the DPRK. In the present case, the Materiel comprised only conventional weaponry, and a payment for the passage of a vessel (even one that, unknown to Chinpo, was carrying the Materiel) fell outside the scope of the assets that could “contribute” to the NRPA of the DPRK.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>14     </span><span>Accordingly, the DPRK Regulations Charge could not be sustained.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span><strong>MCRBA Charge</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span><em><font size="3"></font></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">15     In respect of the MCRBA Charge, s 6 of the MCRBA provides that no person shall carry on “remittance business” without a valid remittance license. Section 2(1) of the MCRBA defines “remittance business” as the business of accepting moneys for the purpose of transmitting them to persons resident in another country or a territory outside Singapore. Section 2(2) of the MCRBA further provides that a person shall be deemed to be carrying on remittance business if he offers to transmit money on behalf of any person to another person resident in another country.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">16     <span>In light of the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing objects of the MCRBA, the legislative focus is always on the result of a transaction: the delivery of funds on behalf of a payor to an intended payee. The licensing framework for “remittance businesses” under the MCRBA thus applies to an (upstream) entity that accepts moneys from a payor and then instructs a financial institution to transmit the moneys to the intended payee. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>17     </span><span>The 605 remittances involved Chinpo accepting the moneys of various DPRK entities and then engaging the BOC to deliver a total of US$40,138,840.87 to the intended payees via telegraphic transfers. Accordingly, the 605 remittances constituted “remittances” for the purpose of the MCRBA.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>18     </span><span> MCRBA prohibits the “business” of accepting moneys for transmission to persons outside Singapore rather than the mere act to that effect. The intent of Parliament is to regulate the remittance industry, which comprises persons who offer remittances as a service in its own right rather than simply as an incident to their core business. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>19      </span><span>Chinpo blindly received moneys from the DPRK entities and then paid the moneys to their intended payees, in respect of matters unconnected with its ship agency and ship chandelling services. Although Chinpo engaged the BOC to facilitate the 605 remittances, it had done so in its own name, thereby concealing the identity of the DPRK entities, which were the true payors. This was the very mischief that the MCRBA sought to avoid, and that Parliament sought to address through the licensing regime for remittance businesses under the MCRBA. Chinpo could not therefore rebut the presumption under s 2(2)(b) of the MCRBA that it had been carrying on a “remittance business”.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>20     </span><span>Chinpo was not in possession of a valid remittance license when it made the 605 remittances between 2 April 2009 and 3 July 2013. Accordingly, the MCRBA Charge had been established.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>21      </span><span>General deterrence is the main sentencing consideration for the MCRBA Charge. The objective of the system of licensing under the MCRBA is to bring all persons providing remittance services within the ambit of certain minimum legal and regulatory requirements and the supervision of the Monetary Authority of Singapore. In all, Chinpo performed 605 remittances without a licence over a period of about four years, which resulted in the remission of a staggering US$40,138,840.87. This was an offence of an unprecedented volume and over an unprecedented duration in Singapore. The maximum fine of S$100,000 was thus warranted.</span></p>
