The appeal centres on a point of law. The appellant argues that the District Judge erred in finding that the term “bookmaker”, as used in s 5(3)<span class="font-italic">(a) </span>of the Betting Act, applies to persons who provide Baccarat “insurance” to casino patrons. The respondent submits that the District Judge correctly interpreted the term “bookmaker” in accordance with both the plain and purposive reading of the relevant provisions of the Betting Act.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The undisputed facts and findings of the District Judge are set out in [13] to [65] of the GD. As the appellant is not challenging the District Judge’s factual findings, I will briefly set out only those background facts that are material to the present appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5  Sometime in 2010, the appellant and one Teo Chua Kuang (also known as “Meng Tee”) agreed to jointly receive Baccarat “insurance” bets from casino patrons at the RWS Casino. They offered the same odds as the RWS Casino. The appellant and Meng Tee agreed to split the winnings and losses, with Meng Tee taking a 30% share and the appellant taking a  larger 70% share, as he was providing the funds to back the bets. This enterprise of offering Baccarat “insurance” bets grew considerably to the extent that Meng Tee had to hire runners to help solicit and receive Baccarat “insurance” bets from casino patrons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Sometime in September 2010, the appellant recruited one Yong Tian Choy (“Yong”) to be his runner at the Maxims and Maxims Platinum Clubs at the RWS Casino. The appellant gave gaming chips to Yong and instructed him to approach casino patrons at the Baccarat tables and offer them the option of placing Baccarat “insurance” bets with the appellant instead of the casino. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 In June 2011, the RWS Casino discovered that the appellant was entering into bets with other casino patrons and prohibited him from entering the Maxims and Maxims Platinum gaming areas. Thereafter, the appellant’s wife, one Tan Saw Eng (“Tan”) took over the running of the Baccarat “insurance” operation in the casino. Tan ensured that the runners had sufficient chips to handle Baccarat “insurance” bets and also provided daily updates of their winnings and losses to various persons, including the appellant. Yong continued to receive the “insurance” bets from casino patrons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On 2 November 2011, the appellant and his accomplices were arrested by Police Officers from the Criminal Investigation Department’s Casino Crime Investigation Branch.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision below </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Before the District Judge, the respondent adduced evidence from a total of 15 witnesses, three of whom were involved in the conspiracy to offer Baccarat “insurance” bets to patrons of the RWS Casino. Three witnesses who were patrons of the RWS Casino testified that Yong had offered them “insurance” bets at the same odds as those offered by the RWS Casino, and that they had placed bets with Yong on multiple occasions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The appellant denied receiving “insurance” bets from the Baccarat players at the RWS Casino, and claimed that he was only sharing bets with friends as they all liked to gamble together.

</div> The appellant contends that the “bets or wagers” referred to in the definition of “bookmaker” in s 2(1) of the Betting Act are limited to bets or wagers in respect of horse-races or other sporting events, and do not cover bets on games of chance, such as Baccarat, that are played in casinos.

The respondent contends that the term “bets or wagers” should be interpreted in line with its plain, ordinary meaning and applies to “bets or wagers” on <span class="font-italic">any</span> event. Further, the respondent submits that there is no evidence that Parliament intended for the Betting Act to be read restrictively to cover only “bets and wagers” on horse-races and sporting events. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 There is essentially only one legal question in this appeal, and it is whether a Baccarat “insurance” bet, which is a bet on an event or contingency relating to the outcome in a Baccarat game, is a “bet” within the meaning of the definition of “bookmaker” in s 2(1) of the Betting Act (“the definition issue”). The appellant has also raised other issues (“the appellant’s other contentions”) pertaining to the District Judge’s findings of law which I will briefly address in the course of this judgment for completeness. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Having carefully considered the arguments, I am of the view that a Baccarat “insurance” bet is a “bet” within the meaning of the definition of “bookmaker” under s 2(1) of the Betting Act. I therefore affirm the District Judge’s findings that the appellant’s accomplices were “bookmakers” under the Betting Act, having received Baccarat “insurance” bets from patrons at the RWS Casino. My reasons are set out below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The definition issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Section 5(3)<span class="font-italic">(a)</span> of the Betting Act provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)  Any person who —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) acts as a <span class="font-italic">bookmaker</span> in <span class="font-italic">any place</span>;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not less than $20,000 and not more than $200,000 and shall also be punished with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The term “bookmaker” is defined in s 2(1) of the Betting Act as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…any person who, whether on his own account or as penciller, runner, employee or agent for any other person, <span class="font-italic">receives or negotiates</span> <span class="font-italic">bets or wagers</span> whether on a cash or on a credit basis and whether for money or money’s worth, or who in any manner holds himself out or permits himself to be held out in any manner as a person who receives or negotiates those bets or wagers; but does not include a club, its officers or employees or any other person or organisation operating or conducting a totalisator or pari-mutuel or any other system or method of cash or credit betting authorised under section 22; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 As mentioned, the appellant argues that the term “bets” in s 2(1) of the Betting Act only refers to bets placed with a bookmaker on horse-races or sporting events and not on games such as Baccarat which are played in casinos and gaming houses. The appellant further argues that Parliament, in enacting the Betting Act, did not intend to criminalise all forms of gambling in Singapore, but instead wanted to protect Singaporeans from the ills of unlicensed betting on horse-races and sporting events, and to exercise control over such gambling activities.

My reasons for concluding thus are founded on two main points of interpretation – first, relating to the ordinary meaning of a “bet” and second, relating to the definition of a “bookmaker”, within the context of the Betting Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 First, in their natural and ordinary meaning, “bets or wagers” can be placed on any future and uncertain event, regardless of the type of event. As a matter of logic and common sense, this must include a bet or wager on the result of a card game such as Baccarat. The <span class="font-italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span> (Oxford University Press, 2013) defines the word “bet” as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">a. The backing of <span class="font-italic">an affirmation or forecast by offering to forfeit, in case of an adverse issue</span>, a sum of money or article of value, to one who by accepting, maintains the opposite, and backs his opinion by a corresponding stipulation; the staking of money or other value on the event of a doubtful issue; a wager; also, the sum of money or article staked…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">b. <span class="font-italic">An amount staked on the result of a card-game</span>;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The same dictionary defines the word “wager” as: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3. a.

In <span class="font-italic">Goh </span><span class="font-italic">Gek Seng v Public Prosecutor</span> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 952 at [12], Yong Pung How CJ quoted a passage from <span class="font-italic">Police v </span><span class="font-italic">Thoms</span> [1966] NZLR 1008 at 1010, where Wilson J defined “bet” according to its natural and ordinary meaning. Citing this definition, Yong CJ held that the appellant had “betted on horse races”:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">12 In <span class="font-italic">Police v </span><span class="font-italic">Thoms</span> [1966] NZLR 1008 at 1010, Wilson J observed:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In ordinary understanding a bet is made when one person stakes money or some other valuable thing against money or other valuable thing staked by another person upon the condition that the person whose prediction as to the result <span class="font-italic">of the future uncertain event</span> proves incorrect forfeits his stake to him whose prediction proves correct. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">13 Despite the difficulties courts in various jurisdictions had in defining whether a contract is a wagering contract, for example, in <span class="font-italic">Carlill</span><span class="font-italic"> v The Carbolic Smoke Ball Company </span>[1892] 2 QB 484 and [<span class="font-italic">Police v</span>] <span class="font-italic">Thoms</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>I have no doubts that the appellant betted on horse races…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In <span class="font-italic">R v Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Keng Chuan</span> [1933] SSLR 187, a decision of the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements, the court was concerned with the meaning of the word “wagering” found in the definition of a “common-betting house” in s 2(1) of the Betting Ordinance No 133 (XVI of 1912) (“the Betting Ordinance 1912”). The court held that “wagering” bore the same meaning as that given to the term by Hawkins J in <span class="font-italic">Carlill</span><span class="font-italic"> v The Carbolic Smoke Ball Company</span> [1892] 2 QB 484 at 490:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…according to my view, a wagering contract is one by which two persons professing <span class="font-italic">to hold opposite views touching the issue of a future uncertain event</span>, mutually agree that, dependent upon the determination of that event, one shall win from the other, and that other shall pay or hand over to him, a sum of money or other stake; neither of the contracting parties having any other interest in that contract than the sum of money or stake he will so win or lose, there being no other real consideration for the making or such contract by either of the parties. It is essential to a wagering contract that each party may under it either win or lose, whether he will win or lose being dependent on the issue of the event, and, therefore, remaining uncertain until that issue is known. If either of the parties may win but cannot lose, or may lose but cannot win, it is not a wagering contract [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Interpreting the term “bet” according to its natural and ordinary meaning also accords with the views of Lord Hewart CJ in <span class="font-italic">Bennett v </span><span class="font-italic">Ewens</span> (1928) 2 KB 510, which was relied upon by the District Judge in reaching his conclusion that a bet on the outcome of a Baccarat game is still a “bet” within the meaning of the definition of a “bookmaker” in the Betting Act.

</div>
</div> In <span class="font-italic">Bennett v </span><span class="font-italic">Ewens</span>, the appellant had held a “whist drive” in his hall, which involved conducting several rounds of the card game whist. The appellant was charged with using a room for the purpose of money being received based on the happening of a certain event or contingency of and relating to a card game, an offence under s 1 of the Betting Act, 1853 (16 &amp; 17 Vic, c 119) (“UK Betting Act 1853”), which provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">No house, office, room or other place shall be opened, kept, or used for the purpose of the owner, occupier, or keeper thereof, or any person using the same, or any person procured or employed by or acting for or on behalf of such owner, occupier, or keeper, or person using the same, or of any person having the care or management or in any manner conducting the business thereof betting with persons resorting thereto; or for the purpose of any money or valuable thing being received by or on behalf of such owner, occupier, keeper, or person as aforesaid as or for the consideration for any assurance, undertaking, promise or agreement, express or implied, to pay or give thereafter any money or valuable thing on any event or contingency of or relating to any horse race, or other race, fight, game, sport, or exercise, or as or for the consideration for securing the paying or giving by some other person of any money or valuable thing on any such event or contingency as aforesaid; and every house, office, room or other place opened, kept, or used for the purpose aforesaid, or any of them, is hereby declared to be a common nuisance and contrary to law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The court below in that case held that there was no betting as the game of whist was not an “event or contingency of or relating to any horse race, or other race, fight, game, sport or exercise” within the meaning of the UK Betting Act 1853. On appeal, Lord Hewart CJ disagreed with this and explained that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…The justices came to the conclusion that <span class="font-italic">the game of whist was not an event or contingency within the meaning of the section</span>. <span class="font-italic">I agree that it was not;</span> but it was not the game itself which was said to be an event or contingency; the complaint was that a certain valuable thing was to be paid or given on the happening of a certain event or contingency relating to that game – in other words, victory or defeat. …It seems to me quite clear that the justices misdirected themselves and came to a wrong decision in point of law, that this appeal ought to be allowed, and that the case should go back to the justices with a direction to convict. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Although the court found that the game of whist was not an event or contingency within the meaning of the section, it held that bets were being taken in relation to the game of whist being played. I agree with the respondent’s submission that this involved “side bets” or “secondary betting” on the game itself and in that regard the factual context is on all fours with the present situation. As submitted by the respondent, there is no separate “game” involved as the bet takes place within a “secondary betting market” which hinges on the result of the Baccarat game played in the RWS Casino. The real focus in the present case is on the proper characterisation of a Baccarat “insurance” bet. In my view, it is plainly a bet on an event or contingency relating to an outcome in the Baccarat game. Hence, the District Judge had correctly characterised it as a “bet” within the meaning of the definition of a “bookmaker” in the Betting Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I also reject the appellant’s attempt to distinguish <span class="font-italic">Bennett v </span><span class="font-italic">Ewens </span>on the basis that the “bet” in that case related to a game of mixed skill and chance, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>whist.

</div>
</div> In my view, this misapprehends what the court held in <span class="font-italic">Bennett v </span><span class="font-italic">Ewens</span>, which was that the question of what amounts to a “bet” does not depend on whether the underlying game is one of pure chance, or mixed chance and skill but is instead dependent on whether “a certain valuable thing was to be paid or given <span class="font-italic">on the happening of a certain event or contingency relating to that game</span> – in other words, victory or defeat” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In support of a narrow definition of “bet”, the appellant cites the case of <span class="font-italic">Seay</span><span class="font-italic"> v Eastwood</span> [1976] 1 WLR 1117 (“<span class="font-italic">Seay</span><span class="font-italic"> v Eastwood</span>”), where the owner of a gaming machine was held not to be a “bookmaker” under Irish law. The appellant also cites the case of <span class="font-italic">Chua </span><span class="font-italic">Seong Soi v Public Prosecutor</span> [2000] 3 SLR(R) 271, claiming that the offender in that case was not charged under the Betting Act (Cap 21, 1985 Rev Ed) but under the Common Gaming Houses Act (Cap 49, 1985 Rev Ed), even though he allegedly “received” bets while gaming with his friends.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I agree with the respondent that these authorities do not assist the appellant. In brief, the decision in <span class="font-italic">Seay</span><span class="font-italic"> v Eastwood</span> was premised on settled law that gaming machines were “treated <span class="font-italic">in law</span> as a separate subject from betting”, and that the person who plays on a gaming machine was not betting with the owner of the machine (<span class="font-italic">Seay</span><span class="font-italic"> v Eastwood </span>at 1122–1124). This is because the owner of the gaming machine does not stake anything (at 1122).

The appellant has sought to rely on other provisions and definitions within the Betting Act which make express reference to horse-races and sporting events as a basis to support his interpretation of the term “bookmaker”. The definitions in s 2(1) of the Betting Act that the appellant relies on are:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“betting information centre” means any place kept or used for receiving or transmitting by telephone or other means any information relating to <span class="font-italic">any horse-race or other sporting event</span> for the purpose of betting or wagering in contravention of this Act;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“common betting-house” means – </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) any place kept or used for betting or wagering on <span class="font-italic">any event or contingency of or relating to any horse-race or other sporting event</span> to which the public or any class of the public has or may have access;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 To the same effect, the appellant further relies on ss 6 and 8(2) of the Betting Act

Any person who for the <span class="font-italic">purpose of betting or wagering</span> in contravention of this Act announces or publishes or causes to be announced or published in any manner <span class="font-italic">information relating to any horse-race or other sporting event</span> shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not less than $5,000 and not more than $50,000 and shall also be punished with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">8. - (1)…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Any person who settles or pays money or money’s worth in respect of <span class="font-italic">bets or wagers relating to a horse-race or any other kind of race</span> shall also be presumed until the contrary is proved to be acting as a bookmaker. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The provisions cited by the appellant do not assist him because these provisions expressly mention the terms “horse-race” or “sporting event”. Apart from those provisions where these specific terms are expressly incorporated, the Betting Act contains no other reference to these terms. Any such reference is also conspicuously absent from s 5(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), the provision in question. In my view, the absence of the words “horse-race” and “sporting event” in the definition of “bookmaker” in s 2(1) of the Betting Act indicates that Parliament did not intend to limit the applicability of <span class="font-italic">all</span> the provisions of the Betting Act to horse-races and sporting events, contrary to what the appellant submits. Had Parliament intended such a limitation, it would have expressly legislated for it, as it had done in the specific definitions and provisions cited by the appellant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Furthermore, I note that the term “betting or wagering” is expressly qualified by references to “horse-races” or “sporting events” in provisions such as s 8(2), which mentions “<span class="font-italic">bets or wagers relating to a horse-race or any other kind of race</span>”. This shows that the term, when used <span class="font-italic">without</span> further qualification, refers to a wide range of activities extending beyond just bets on “horse-races” or “sporting events”. Drawing from the well-loved children’s tale, an illustration might be the fabled race between the tortoise and the hare, which is neither a “horse-race” nor a “sporting event”. We are all well aware of its outcome based on the story as recounted; but it was not always going to be a foregone conclusion. This element of uncertainty in the future outcome is precisely why bets and wagers have taken place over such contingencies since time immemorial.  </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 There are other potential and readily-identifiable situations in which a person may have acted as a “bookmaker” in contravention of s 5(3)(<span class="font-italic">a) </span>of the Betting Act by receiving bets or wagers not relating to “horse-races” or “sporting events”.

</div>
</div> For example, bookmakers may conceivably receive or negotiate bets placed on the outcomes of government elections, beauty pageants, talent contests (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, music or dance competitions), or entertainment award ceremonies such as the Academy, Emmy or Grammy Awards. It is not far-fetched to imagine that there may even be bets or wagers on the weather or the outcomes of trial (or appellate) litigation. These are obviously not “horse-races” or “sporting events” nor are they games of mixed skill and chance, but to my mind there can be no question that bets or wagers received or negotiated in relation to these outcomes by bookmakers would fall foul of the Betting Act. These illustrations make it clear to me that it would not be appropriate to adopt the strained and narrow interpretation put forth by the appellant.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Finally, the appellant may not rely on the definition of “betting” under s 4(1) of the Remote Gambling Act 2014 (No 34 of 2014): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“betting” means the staking of money or money’s worth – </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) on the outcome of a horse-race or sporting event (whether or not the horse-race or sporting event has already occurred or been completed); </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) on any other event, thing or matter specified or described by the Minister, by notification in the <span class="font-italic">Gazette</span>, to be betting for the purposes of this Act; </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The term “betting” as defined in the Remote Gambling Act 2014 is limited to bets received in the context of horse-races, sporting events, and other events specified by the Minister, but such a definition of “betting” is not found in the Betting Act. The Remote Gambling Act was only passed by Parliament on 7 October 2014 and assented to by the President on 18 November 2014. In my judgment, had Parliament intended for the definition of “betting” in the Remote Gambling Act to apply as well to the Betting Act, it would have amended the Betting Act to reflect this. It would not have provided instead for a new s 2A in the Betting Act, which expressly provides that the provisions of the Betting Act do not apply to or in relation to any remote gambling within the meaning of the Remote Gambling Act 2014. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Legislative history of the Betting Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I now turn to consider Parliament’s intention in enacting the provisions of the Betting Act.

In fact, the legislative history fortifies my view that Parliament had not intended such a restrictive and narrow approach.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Parliament’s intention for the Betting Act (and its predecessor statutes) appears to be focused broadly on suppressing the proliferation of betting houses and betting in public places. The original predecessor statute to the Betting Act is the Betting Ordinance 1912 (supra [25]). The Betting Ordinance 1912 was passed in the Crown Colony of the Straits Settlements in 1912. In introducing the Bill in the Legislative Council of the Colony of the Straits Settlements, the Attorney-General Thomas de Multon Lee Braddell (“AG Braddell”) expressed the Government’s intention to tackle the “evils of betting” in the Colony by aligning the law in the Straits Settlements with the law of England.

The [Common Gaming Houses Act] deals more with “games of mixed chance and skill for money or money’s worth” which is reflective more of casino-style gambling while the [Betting Act] deals with “bets or wagering on any event or contingency of or relating to any horse race or other sporting event” which is reflective more of sports-type betting. This distinction is important because it differentiates the culpability of individuals who engage in online casino-type gambling as opposed to those who engage in online betting or wagering.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In my view, the excerpt from the LRC report, which is couched in broad and general terms, does not assist the appellant in his case. The statement made in the above quote that the Betting Act deals with “bets or wagering on any event or contingency of or relating to any horse race or other sporting event” appears to be a direct quotation from the definition of a “common betting-house” under s 2(1) of the Betting Act. Possibly owing to inadvertence or oversight, the LRC report does not appear to have considered the definition of “bookmaker”, which bears no reference to horse-races or sporting events, or the related offence of being a “bookmaker” under the Betting Act  (see the LRC report at para 56 and the absence of mention of the offence of being a “bookmaker” under the Betting Act):

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The [Betting Act] governs betting and wagering activities. Generally speaking, this Act makes it an <span class="font-italic">offence to operate or be involved in common betting house or betting information</span><span class="font-italic"> centre, and to publish information relating to any horse race or sporting event for the purpose of illegal betting</span>. Like the [Common Gaming Houses Act], customers of such place or activities are also caught under its criminal provisions. Also similar to the [Common Gaming Houses Act], the [Betting Act] permits exemptions, and the Tote Board and the Singapore Pools are exempted from it. [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 On the issue of the overlap between the regulatory regimes, the appellant submits that there would be “absurd consequences if every person who receives bets is a bookmaker”. Citing the example of a croupier in an illegal gaming house, the appellant argues that such an individual could be liable under both the Common Gaming Houses Act and the Betting Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I disagree with the appellant on this point. In my view, as was held in <span class="font-italic">Bennett v </span><span class="font-italic">Ewens</span>, such a croupier would not be caught by the definition of a “bookmaker” as he is part of the operation of the game itself, and receives bets which are part and parcel of how the game is played. On the other hand, someone who offers to receive or negotiate bets relating to the result of the game being operated by the croupier, would be a “bookmaker”. On the facts in the present case, the difficulty of an overlap between the two statutory regimes simply does not arise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Although a penal provision should be construed strictly and in favour of the accused where it could reasonably be read in two or more different ways, this should only be done as <span class="font-italic">a last resort</span> where all other interpretive tools have failed to resolve the ambiguity in the provision (see the remarks of V K Rajah JA in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Low </span><span class="font-italic">Kok Heng</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 183 at [38] and [57]). On the whole, considering the legislative history of the Betting Act and its predecessor statutes, I am of the view that Parliament had intended for the Betting Act to have a wide ambit to combat <span class="font-italic">all forms of betting and bookmaking</span> in Singapore, not limited to bets on horse-races and sporting events. The deliberate omission of the terms “horse-race” and “sporting events” from the definition of “bookmaker” in s 2(1) of the Betting Act comports with this intention.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appellant’s other contentions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Having considered the parties’ submissions, I am also of the view that the appellant’s other contentions are unmeritorious. These contentions are not germane to my decision, which is fundamentally concerned with the proper interpretation of the term “bet” under the Betting Act. Hence, I shall only briefly state my observations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Maintaining a “balanced book”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The appellant submits that the “traditional” bookmaker is “someone who takes bets on various possible outcomes of an event from multiple parties and engages in specific bookmaking activities … to ensure that for each event there is a net profit after paying off the winning bets”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, someone who maintains a “balanced book” (per Moses LJ in <span class="font-italic">R (William Hill) v Horserace Betting Levy Board</span> [2013] 1 WLR 3656 at [6]). On this basis, the appellant argues that a person who provides Baccarat “insurance” only plays one side of each hand and therefore is not a bookmaker as he is unable to build a “balanced book”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 There is no basis, either in law or on the evidence, for the appellant’s argument. The definition of a “bookmaker” in s 2(1) of the Betting Act contains no requirement that a person must build a “balanced book” in order to be considered a “bookmaker”. Further, the appellant’s argument completely ignores the evidence as to how the Baccarat “insurance” scheme was operated by the appellant and his accomplices. The patrons at the RWS Casino were offered odds by the appellant and his accomplices that mirrored those offered by the RWS Casino in their “insurance” bets. These patrons would receive a pay-out from the appellant and his accomplices if they lost in their Baccarat game on the RWS Casino’s Baccarat table. It is also undisputed that the appellant and his accomplices had entered into bets on the RWS Casino Baccarat table itself.

</div> Taken together, this can be construed, to some degree, as efforts undertaken by the appellant and his accomplices to maintain a “balanced book”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 On a separate but related note, the appellant suggested that the definition of “bookmaker” in s 2(1) of the Betting Act, which mentions “any person who … <span class="font-italic">receives or negotiates bets</span>”, would extend only to bets on horse racing and other sporting events where the odds are negotiable.

</div> Put another way, the appellant suggests that the word “or” within the definition should in fact be read as “and” <span class="font-italic">ie</span>. conjunctively rather than disjunctively. I am unable to see any merit in this argument. While it may sometimes be necessary “to read “and” in place of the conjunction “or”, and vice versa”, in order to give effect to Parliament’s intentions (see P St J Langan, <span class="font-italic">Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes</span> (N M Tripathi Private Ltd, 12th Ed, 1969) cited in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Low </span><span class="font-italic">Kok Heng</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 183 at [72]), this requires clear adequacy of context (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Low </span><span class="font-italic">Kok Heng</span> at [71] citing <span class="font-italic">Lam </span><span class="font-italic">Joon Shu v AG</span> [1993] 3 SLR(R) 156). In the present case, I find that there is no basis nor any requirement to read the word “or” in the conjunctive sense as the appellant contends. To the contrary, a disjunctive reading would be perfectly consistent with the plain and purposive interpretations of “bookmaker” and “bet” as adopted by the District Judge, which I fully endorse in this appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether “side bets” in casinos are covered under the Betting Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The appellant argues that Parliament had no intention to criminalise “side-betting” among patrons in casinos in Singapore, as there are neither any Parliamentary debates or statements relating to such “side-betting”, nor any other extrinsic material evidencing such an intention. The appellant further argues that as the casinos are able to control, through their own rules, “side-betting” among their patrons, there is no necessity to criminalise such “side-betting” in casinos.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I have explained above (at [28]) that an “insurance bet” is a “side bet” and is correctly characterised as a “bet” within the meaning of the definition of a “bookmaker” in the Betting Act. As s 5(3)<span class="font-italic">(a)</span> of the Betting Act plainly states, bookmaking in <span class="font-italic">any</span> place is an offence. In my judgment, s 5(3)<span class="font-italic">(a)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>evinces Parliament’s clear intention to suppress and criminalise bookmaking, regardless of the location. The absence of Parliamentary debates or statements specifically on “side-betting” does not undermine that. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 For the reasons above, I find that there is clearly no merit in the appellant’s submissions. I am satisfied that the District Judge was correct in finding the appellant guilty under s 5(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Betting Act on nine charges of engaging in a conspiracy to act as a bookmaker by providing Baccarat insurance to persons gambling at the RWS Casino. There is no appeal against the sentence. I therefore dismiss the appeal against conviction and affirm the District Judge's findings and conclusions.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">See Kee Oon<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ong Ying Ping, Lim Seng Siew and Chew Zijie (Ong Ying Ping Esq) for the appellant;<br/>Hon Yi (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
