Mface simultaneously commenced S 1052/2016 against Astoria, OAC, PGL and Poh Ching Yee for the repayment of $5,868,848.92 in loans made pursuant to the Mface Loans, as well as a further claim for $3,357,612.08.

Failure to meet this condition would result in judgment being entered for Mface. The defendants were also given unconditional leave to defend the further claim of $3,357,612.08. It transpired that the defendants in S 1052/2016 failed to satisfy the condition for leave to defend.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The Defendants filed Notices of Appeal to a Judge of High Court in Chambers on 27 March 2018, in respect of AR Li’s decision to grant summary judgment and conditional leave to defend in the Initial Suits. I gave leave to the Defendants to appeal out of time. The hearing for RA 79 and 80 was fixed for 16 July 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The Plaintiffs subsequently applied for summary judgment in respect of the sum of $13.75 million. At the hearing on 23 April 2018, AR Khng held that it would not be appropriate for her to give summary judgment in respect of $8,837,800.35, being the sum awarded under the summary judgments obtained in the Initial Suits, given that those orders for summary judgment were pending an appeal before me. Therefore, she granted unconditional leave to defend the sum of $8,837,800.35. Nevertheless, she held that the rest of the sums due under the Settlement Agreement could be severed from this sum, and gave the defendants in S 885/2017 conditional leave to defend the sum of $4,912,199.65, provided that they pay into court that sum of money by 18 June 2018. It is undisputed that this condition was not satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 On 7 May 2018, the Defendants filed a Notice of Appeal to a Judge of High Court in Chambers against the decision of AR Khng granting conditional leave to defend the sum of $4,912,199.65. I note that there was no cross appeal by the Plaintiffs in respect of AR Khng’s decision to give unconditional leave to defend the sum of $8,837,800.35.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The parties’ arguments before me are largely the same as those made at the hearings below. In respect of RA 79, the Defendants’ main argument is that the G1 Agreements are sham contracts which are used to disguise illegal moneylending transactions. As for RA 80, they similarly contend that the Mface Loans are illegal moneylending transactions. Therefore, this renders the G1 Agreements and the Mface Loans underlying the Initial Suits unenforceable pursuant to s 14(2) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed) (“MLA”).

</div> They submit that this is sufficient to raise a triable defence, and therefore they should have been given unconditional leave to defend the claims in the Initial Suits. The Defendants further argued that the summary judgment order granted in respect of S 1051/2016 should not be allowed to stand because it includes a double claim of $880,000 which is part of the claim in S 1052/2016.

The mere fact that the cash cheques were physically handed to PST does not necessarily mean that they were intended as personal loans to her. PST might have just been collecting the cash cheques on behalf of Bravo, which explains why the cheques were physically given to her and why she was able to produce a copy of the cheque. However, this does not mean that she kept the money for her own use. Indeed, the Defendants are not able to adduce any evidence of the money from the cash cheques going into PST’s personal account.

</div> which suggests that she herself accepted that those payments were intended for Bravo and were not personal loans. Therefore, even if the G1 Agreements were meant to disguise loans, these loans would not be illegal under the MLA.

The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sheagar s/o T M Veloo v Belfield International (Hong Kong) Ltd</span> [2014] 3 SLR 524 stated at [81] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[t]he MLA must not be seen by desperate defendants as a “legal panacea” to stave off their financial woes.

In the present case, the only evidence that the Plaintiffs have adduced to support their allegation that the Mface Loans were personal loans made to PST are bare, self-serving assertions made in PST’s own affidavit about an alleged oral agreement. This is contrasted with the contemporaneous documentary evidence that the Defendants have adduced <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the written agreements for the Mface Loans, which state clearly that the loans were between Mface and Astoria (see above at [9]). Even though there was no formal written agreement recording the tenth loan, there was documentary evidence to show that the loan was disbursed to Brilliant Tech Construction Pte Ltd which is also a corporation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The Defendants argue that pursuant to the oral agreement, the loans would be made to PST and she would be the one to decide how the funds would be subsequently disbursed to the various companies under her control.

</div> In my view, this alleged oral agreement appears to be a belated fabrication by the Defendants in an attempt to disqualify Mface from being an excluded moneylender. Indeed, counsel for the Plaintiffs stated that the entire narrative about the alleged oral agreement only came about after the amendment of the pleadings, which was more than a year after the original pleadings were filed.

On the whole, I find the evidence on that to be very weak and largely based on a bare assertion. Therefore, the Defendants’ assertion that the Mface Loans were illegal moneylending transactions do not present a reasonable probability of a real or <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> defence.

The Defendants allege that the seizure of the construction equipment on the premises of the Development was calculated to exert pressure on Astoria, because the Plaintiffs knew that Astoria had already overrun the contractual TOP and was incurring liquidated damages. Therefore, the Defendants were forced to enter into the Settlement Agreement so that the Plaintiffs would discontinue their enforcement proceedings. Otherwise, the TOP of the Development would continue to be delayed and Astoria would continue incurring liquidated damages. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The Plaintiffs cited <span class="font-italic">E C Investment Holding Pte Ltd v Ridout Residence Pte Ltd and another (Orion Oil Ltd and </span><span class="font-italic">another, interveners)</span> [2011] 2 SLR 232 at [51], where Quentin Loh J stated that the two elements for actionable duress are first, pressure amounting to compulsion of the will of the victim, and second, the illegitimacy of the pressure exerted.

The total value of the equipment seized only amounted to a few thousand dollars, and therefore it is inconceivable that the Defendants would have been compelled to enter into the Settlement Agreement for $13.8 million over the seizure of these equipment which would have been easily replaceable.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 It is clear from cl 1 that if the Defendants were to default on any of the instalment payments, the Plaintiffs would thereafter be entitled to resume all enforcement actions. Therefore, the question that remains is what the Plaintiffs’ obligations were <span class="font-italic">before</span> the default occurred, and whether their failure to withdraw the Attachment Orders would have resulted in a repudiatory breach at that point in time. I reproduce cl 1 of the Settlement Agreement for ease of reference:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">1. [G1 and Mface’s] OBLIGATIONS / CONSIDERATIONS</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[G1 and Mface] agree that they will:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) <span class="font-weight-bold">discontinue all proceedings enforcing their judgments</span> against Astoria, [OAC] and/or [PST] and/or [PGL] including the examination of judgment debtor proceedings against them,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) within 7 working days, give notice to the court to release the movable items seized by Mface in HC/WSS 16/2017, the shares of [OAC] seized by Mface in HC/WSS 5/2017, and the shares of [PST] seized by G1 in HC/WSS 19/2017,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) discontinue the law suit HC/S 1052/2016 in the High Court of Singapore, and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iv) not make any other antecedent claim against [Astoria, OAC, Ranesis and PST] (as this Agreement is intended to be a full and final settlement of all claims by [G1 and Mface] against [Astoria, OAC, Ranesis and PST] and [PGL] as at the date of this Agreement),</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">provided that there is no default at all by any one of [Astoria, OAC, Ranesis and PST] under this Agreement and/or under any Guarantee and Indemnity agreement mentioned below.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 It is apparent that cl 1 specifically provided for (1) the discontinuance of enforcement of judgment debtor proceedings, (2) giving notice to the court within seven days of entering into the Settlement Agreement to release the moveable items seized under the WSS and (3) the discontinuance of S 1052/2016. It is not disputed that the Plaintiffs had done all of these things. However, the issue is whether the Plaintiffs are also obligated to withdraw the Attachment Orders. I find that the obligation on the part of the Plaintiffs to “discontinue all proceedings enforcing their judgments against” the Defendants is broad enough to include the withdrawal of the Attachment Orders. After all, the Attachment Orders are made for the satisfaction of the judgments that the Plaintiffs had obtained in the Initial Suits. Therefore, the discontinuance of <span class="font-italic">all</span> enforcement proceedings would certainly have to include the withdrawal of the Attachment Orders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Be that as it may, I do not think that the Plaintiffs’ failure to withdraw the Attachment Orders alone is sufficient to terminate the Settlement Agreement, such as to allow the Defendants to avoid its payment obligations. It is trite that a breach of contract does not automatically discharge or bring a contract to an end. A breach merely gives the innocent party a right to bring a contract to an end, but the contract comes to an end only if it so chooses. An innocent party is only taken to have accepted a breach so as to discharge the contract if its words or actions clearly and unequivocally demonstrate this; and an innocent party may only be taken to have elected to affirm a contract if its words or actions clearly and unequivocally indicate that that was its intent: <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> (Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) (“<span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span>”) at paras 17.221 – 17.223. Therefore, even if the Plaintiffs had committed a repudiatory breach as the Defendants contend, the Defendants would still have had to make clear their intention to accept the breach and terminate the Settlement Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 To this end, the Defendants rely on a letter dated 13 September 2017 that was sent by their then solicitors to the Plaintiffs’ solicitors (the “13 September Letter”). The material portion of the 13 September Letter states as follows:

With respect, I disagree. The 13 September Letter merely states that the Settlement Agreement is “void and unenforceable”, which is different from saying that the agreement had been terminated because the Defendants accept the Plaintiffs’ repudiatory breach. In fact, nowhere in the letter is the fact of the repudiatory breach even mentioned. The only reference to the Attachment Orders is in para 8, but even then, that does not amount to an unequivocal acceptance of the Plaintiffs’ repudiatory breach. Simply stating that the Defendants were “not entitled” to the Attachment Orders falls short of informing the Plaintiffs that they have committed a repudiatory breach. There is also no further mention of an intention to accept this alleged breach and treat the contract as terminated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Furthermore, an unreasonable delay by an innocent party to take positive steps to communicate its decision to discharge the contract may permit an inference that the innocent party had elected to affirm the contract: <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> at para 17.223. The Defendants state that they had discovered the failure to withdraw the Attachment Orders on 4 August 2017.

</div> Yet there was no communication between the Defendants and the Plaintiffs on this alleged repudiatory breach until the 13 September Letter. If indeed this was such a fundamental term of the Settlement Agreement, one would have expected the Defendants to inform the Plaintiffs of it much more expediently. In any event, the 13 September Letter was only sent <span class="font-italic">after</span> the second instalment was due <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 30 July 2017.

</div> Therefore, by this time, the Defendants themselves would have been in breach of the Settlement Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Therefore, I am of the view that the Defendants’ defence of repudiation is also shadowy at best. Accordingly, there is no reason for me to disturb the decision of AR Khng and her decision granting the Defendants conditional leave to defend the sum of $4,912,199.65 in S 885/2017 stands. However, the question remains as to whether the Defendants are warranted in requesting for a reduction in the sum to be paid into court, to which I now turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the condition imposed should be reduced on account of the Defendants’ impecuniosity</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The Defendants seek to reduce the conditional leave sum to $1 million, on the basis that this is the maximum sum they can afford. They state that all the Defendants are in dire financial circumstances, and the only defendant with any asset of value is Astoria <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Development. However, Astoria would only be able freely withdraw the monies from the developer’s account when the TOP for the Development is obtained. Therefore, in the interim, Astoria does not have any accessible assets save for $2,933.63.

</div> In my view, it would be incumbent on Astoria to seek repayment of these loans to make payment of the conditional sum. No evidence is produced before me that they have tried to seek repayment of the loans to related companies. There is also no indication that they intend to seek repayment of these loans.

</div> Having reviewed the supporting documents, I agree with the Defendants that the same documents were used by the Plaintiffs to substantiate claims amounting to $880,000 in both S 1051/2016 and S 1052/2016. This therefore indicates that there is indeed a double claim of $880,000 in S 1051/2016. At the hearing before me on 16 July 2018, counsel for the Plaintiffs accepted the same. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 However, contrary to what the Defendants have suggested, I see no reason to set aside the entire summary judgment order on the basis of this double claim. In my view, the mistake can easily be remedied by reducing the amount of summary judgment granted in S 1051/2016 by $880,000. Therefore, I would allow the appeal in RA 79 in part and reduce the amount of summary judgment in S 1051/2016 to $2,088,951.43, with unconditional leave to defend the balance sum of $880,000.

I dismiss the appeal in RA 80, and amend AR Li’s order with respect to the date of payment of the conditional leave sum to 16 August 2018, 4.00pm.
