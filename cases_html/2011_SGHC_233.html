<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       It is a happy thing to be the father unto many
                        sons.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> That was true for most of the
                    life of the octogenarian Wong Yip Chong (“WYC”), the central
                    figure in this case, Suit No 607 of 2010 (“the Suit”). He was
                    the patriarch of the Wong family and a prominent psychiatrist in Singapore until
                    he was stricken with Alzheimer’s disease. WYC’s eldest son was Wong
                    Meng Cheong (“WMC”), the first plaintiff, while Wong Meng Leong
                    (“WML”), who is the second plaintiff was his second son. The
                    second defendant Wong Meng Weng (“WMW”), was WYC’s youngest
                    son. WMW was born to a different mother from the plaintiffs, namely to Patricia
                    Ling Ai Wah (“PL”), the first defendant. WMC and WML are the sons
                    of Tan Kim Yam (“TKY”), who was WYC’s wife. Besides the
                    three sons, WYC had a fourth son in Wong Meng Kong (“WMK”) a
                    psychiatrist, and a daughter, Wong Mei Sheong (“WMS”) who is an
                    artist, with TKY. Both appeared as witnesses for the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       This Suit started life on 2 July 2010 as an
                    originating summons (“OS 648 of 2010”) filed by WMC, WML and WMW
                    as the plaintiffs with PL as the sole defendant. It was converted to a writ on
                    11 August 2010 as the dispute raised highly contentious issues of fact. The
                    then plaintiffs had prayed that a transfer IA/54236J dated 8 December 2004
                    (“the Transfer”) in respect of a property situated at 5 Chancery
                    Hill Road, Singapore 309644 (“5CHR”) (whereby the manner of
                    holding had been changed to include PL as a joint tenant) be declared null and
                    void. After OS 648 of 2010 was converted to a writ, WMW declined to be a
                    plaintiff and he was therefore made a co-defendant to the Suit with
                PL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In their statement of claim, the plaintiffs
                    pleaded in the alternative that the joint tenancy of 5CHR should be severed and
                    the property sold if the Transfer was found to be valid. On 30 November
                    2010, before the Suit came on for trial, the plaintiffs filed two statutory
                    declarations in their capacities as WYC’s deputies. One of the statutory
                    declarations was to sever the joint tenancy of 5CHR. On 1 December 2010,
                    they followed that up with an application<sup></sup>in the Suit for a declaration that their statutory declaration to
                    sever the joint tenancy of 5CHR be declared valid. I dismissed this application
                    on 1 February 2011 because it raised the identical issue which was going to
                    be litigated at this trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Besides her defence, PL filed a counterclaim
                    against the plaintiffs on 20 September 2010. She prayed for a declaration
                    that she is the sole beneficial of 5CHR and another property located at No 50
                    Draycott Park, #28-01 Draycott Towers, Singapore 309644 (“the Draycott
                    Property”) which she had held in joint tenancy with WYC since 2002. The
                    plaintiffs had also attempted to sever the Draycott Property’s joint
                    tenancy – the other statutory declaration they filed on 30 November
                    2010 was for this purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In another action, Originating Summons No 1435
                    of 2005 (“the Originating Summons”), WMC, WML and WMW were
                    appointed as members of a committee of the person and estate of WYC (“the
                    CPE”) by the Court on 20 October 2005 under s 9 of the Mental
                    Disorders and Treatment Act (Cap 178, 1985 Rev Ed). When the Mental
                    Disorders and Treatment Act was repealed and the Mental Capacity Act
                    (Cap 177A, 2010 Rev Ed) (“the MCA”) came into force on
                    1 March 2010, the members of the CPE were deemed to be deputies appointed
                    by the Court under the MCA to act jointly to make decisions on WYC’s
                    behalf, pursuant to the savings provisions in the Third Schedule of the
                    MCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       After the CPE was constituted, it took out an
                        <em>ex parte</em> Summons No 5378 of 2006 on
                    23 November 2006 to seek repayment of a loan that WMC allegedly extended to
                    WYC on 30 January 1999 in a transaction which involved a company called
                    Synapse Company Pte Ltd (“Synapse”). Pursuant to this application,
                    which was made unanimously, the Court ordered that a sum of about $1m be
                    returned to WMC from WYC’s estate on 14 December 2006 (“the
                    Synapse Order”). On 7 April 2010, the three deputies of WYC took out
                    another <em>ex parte</em> Summons No 1542 of 2010. This
                    application was for them to be empowered to sell WYC’s properties. The
                    power to sell was granted on 13 May 2010 (“the 2010
                    Order”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 15 December 2010, WMW applied <em>via</em> three summonses to revoke the appointments of WMC
                    and WML as deputies of WYC; set aside the 2010 Order and set aside the Synapse
                    Order. The substance of these summonses filed by WMW in the Originating Summons
                    was the same as several of the reliefs prayed for in the counterclaims of both
                    defendants in the Suit. Given the substantial overlap in issues of fact and law,
                    the Originating Summons was consolidated with the Suit on 28 January 2011.
                    I also granted leave to PL and TKY, the second intervener, to intervene in the
                    issues arising from the Originating Summons under s 38(2), MCA and
                    O 99 r 2 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev
                    Ed) (“ROC”) . Both were sufficiently connected to WYC and clearly
                    had a real interest in the plaintiffs’ appointment and powers as
                    WYC’s deputies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       I had decided the following issues in the oral
                    judgment that I delivered on 8 August 2011 after the trial
                    concluded:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_i"></a>(i)     whether PL was the sole beneficial
                        owner of 5CHR;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     if PL was not the sole beneficial owner of 5CHR, whether the Transfer was
                        valid;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     if
                        the Transfer was valid, whether 5CHR’s joint tenancy should be severed
                        and the property sold;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     whether PL was the sole beneficial owner of the Draycott
                        Property;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_v"></a>(v)     whether the Synapse Order should be set aside;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_vi"></a>(vi)     whether the 2010 Order should be set aside;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_vii"></a>(vii)     whether
                        the plaintiffs’ appointments as deputies of WYC should be
                        revoked.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Essentially, I dismissed the plaintiffs’
                    claims in the Suit with costs and awarded judgment to the two defendants on
                    their counterclaim. As the plaintiffs have filed an appeal (in Civil Appeal No
                    104 of 2011) against my decision, I shall now set out the grounds of my judgment
                    in full.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether PL was the sole beneficial owner of 5CHR</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       WYC met PL sometime in 1969 while she was his
                    clinic assistant. They developed a friendship. In or around 1972, WYC told PL
                    that he had developed feelings for her. He disclosed to her that TKY suffered
                    from schizophrenia. PL was initially reluctant to begin a relationship with WYC
                    in view of his married status. I should point out that WYC was also 22 years
                    older than PL. WYC’s sincerity however eventually won PL over. He promised
                    PL that he would take care of her and treat her as his wife. He also bought her
                    two rings and hosted a dinner with PL’s parents and siblings to formalise
                    their union as husband and wife, albeit not in a legally valid way since WYC
                    never divorced TKY. Soon after that, WYC and PL began cohabitating, initially at
                    a house in Jalan Novena Selatan. After they began living together, TKY and her
                    children continued to live in another house at 37 Goldhill Avenue
                    (“37GHA”). However, WYC visited TKY and his children at 37GHA
                    daily.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In 1975, WMW was born. A year later, WYC
                    bought a property at 7 Whitley Road (“7WR”) for PL to effectuate
                    his promise of taking care of her. The plaintiffs submitted that 7WR was not
                    beneficially owned by PL as its purchase was funded by WYC, and that gave rise
                    to a presumption of resulting trust in favour of WYC: <em>Lau
                        Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye Terence</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 at
                        <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a>. I found that the presumption of
                    resulting trust was rebutted. I accepted PL’s evidence that 7WR was
                    intended by WYC to be a gift to her. WYC and PL were not married to each other,
                    and PL would have had no claim against WYC for her maintenance if their
                    relationship ended. Under those circumstances, it was reasonable that WYC sought
                    to assure PL of the security of their relationship by providing her with a house
                    in which they could raise their child. The gift was perfected when 7WR was
                    bought in PL’s sole name. WYC, PL and WMW lived there together, and PL
                    considered it her “matrimonial home”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Sometime in 1981, WYC and PL decided to
                    purchase a new property for their occupation as 7WR was not a conducive place to
                    raise WMW. They chose 5CHR. 5CHR was acquired in this way. 7WR was sold on or
                    about 3 April 1982 for $670,000. Since 5CHR was purchased before the sale
                    of 7WR, WYC borrowed monies from Wong Yip Chong Pte Ltd (“WYCPL”)
                    to pay for the purchase price of $790,000 first. WYCPL was a company
                    incorporated by WYC in 1972 to run his psychiatric hospital, which was then
                    called the Singapore Nursing Home and situated at Dunearn Road.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In a letter dated 5 May 1981, WYC gave
                    specific instructions to the vendor of 5CHR that it should be transferred to PL
                    on completion. Those instructions were also conveyed to the vendor’s
                    solicitors. Pursuant to the instructions, 5CHR was transferred to PL’s
                    sole name on 17 July 1981. Because 5CHR was to be extensively renovated and
                    hefty costs would be incurred in the process, WYC asked PL whether she was
                    willing to transfer 5CHR to WYCPL as a temporary measure. On 18 March 1982,
                    PL transferred 5CHR to WYCPL for a sum of $770,000 which was in fact never paid
                    to her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     I found that the parties’ common
                    intention, immediately after 5CHR was transferred to WYCPL, was for PL to own
                    the beneficial interest of 5CHR solely. The parties had intended for PL’s
                    interest in 7WR to be replaced by her interest in their new “matrimonial
                    home”, 5CHR. To this end, on 13 September 1982, PL transferred the
                    sale proceeds of 7WR to WYC for the payment of 5CHR’s purchase. This was
                    reflected in the flow of funds set out in PL’s and WYC’s bank
                    passbooks. A common intention constructive trust had arisen, and it therefore
                    did not matter that the purchase price of 5CHR exceeded the proceeds obtained
                    from selling 7WR. WYCPL, which was then under the control of WYC, held 5CHR on
                    trust for PL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 11 February 1985, however, WYC caused
                    WYCPL to transfer 5CHR to himself solely. This transfer was motivated
                    principally by tax considerations as there was a tax concession for
                    owner-occupied properties. PL did not explain in her affidavit of
                    evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) why 5CHR was transferred to WYC rather
                    than herself despite her assertion of being the sole beneficial owner of 5CHR
                    even after 11 February 1985. At the trial, PL revealed that the transfer
                    was made to WYC instead of to her in order to pre-empt TKY’s relatives
                    from alleging that WYC was favouring her as TKY was not the owner of 37GHA. This
                    reason was also stated in a document called “the Christmas
                    Recommendations” which will be discussed below. It was a reasonable
                    explanation which I accepted. At that point in time, the renovated 5CHR (at a
                    cost in excess of $300,000) was also a superior residence to 37GHA, and had a
                    swimming pool.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     PL testified that their mutual understanding
                    was that WYC would eventually transfer 5CHR back to her. However, PL could not
                    adduce any evidence to show whether WYC and PL agreed that this transfer of
                    5CHR’s beneficial interest back to PL was to take place at a specific date
                    or even during WYC’s lifetime. On the balance, I found that PL had
                    acquiesced to giving up the whole of her beneficial interest in 5CHR to WYC in
                    1985, and there was a common intention between them that WYC was to be its new
                    beneficial owner solely.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     This common intention could be inferred from
                    how WYC was able to unilaterally deal with 5CHR after 1985. These dealings were
                    documented over the years. First, in the wills WYC made prior to the Transfer,
                    his expressed intention was for 5CHR to be transferred to PL upon his death. The
                    wills were dated 11 May 1997 (updated on 27 September 2000 and
                    27 January 2001) and 4 September 2003. There was no reason to think
                    that WYC was not referring to PL’s beneficial interest in 5CHR in those
                    wills.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Further, in April 2002, WYC spoke to his
                    solicitor Tan Yah Piang about effecting a transfer of 5CHR to PL as joint
                    tenants. The plaintiffs learnt of this intended transfer and on 2 July 2002
                    organised a meeting with WYC and Tan Yah Piang. PL was notified of this meeting
                    by WYC and attended it. At the meeting, the plaintiffs objected to WYC’s
                    decision to transfer 5CHR to PL as a joint tenant for many reasons, one of which
                    was that WYC should continue to hold 5CHR in his sole name in case funds were
                    required to bail out WYCPL. On 3 July 2002, the plaintiffs visited WYC at
                    5CHR to reiterate their objections in the presence of PL. As a result, WYC
                    instructed Tan Yah Piang to put the intended transfer on hold. It was in this
                    context that PL stated in her AEIC that she “was at a loss to understand
                    why [the plaintiffs] took such pains to prevent me from having title over a
                    property, which was always intended to be mine.” In an e-mail she sent to
                    WMW dated 3 July 2002, she described this aborted transfer:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… My [<em>ie</em> PL’s] question to the
                        lawyer is what if [5CHR] is mortgaged or sold before the will [bequeathing
                        5CHR to PL] could be effected … Yah Piang confirms that it will only
                        be useful if there is something to be given at [WYC’s] passing on.
                        … [WMC] went further to say that if [WYC] were to give me the 50% now
                        I may desert him. … On my part my reasons for wanting to have 1/2 the
                        house is simply for my immediate and future security. … Not having
                        the property now is ok …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Both her AEIC and that e-mail to WMW showed
                    that PL treated WYC as the sole beneficial owner of 5CHR in 2002, and the
                    transfer which did not materialise was meant to give her some share in the
                    property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Thirdly, before the Transfer took place, WYC
                    was entitled to use 5CHR to raise funds without PL’s consent. From 2001 to
                    the middle of 2004, WYC shouldered heavy financial burdens. After WMC became
                    actively involved in WYCPL in 1995 and took over its management, he caused WYCPL
                    to become a property investment company. WYC became the personal guarantor for
                    $13m worth of loans which WYCPL took to purchase numerous properties as WMC
                    embarked on ambitious property acquisitions. This personal guarantee became a
                    perennial worry of WYC and after 2000, he was constantly thinking of ways to
                    alleviate this concern in order to retire with peace of mind. WYC’s worry
                    about the personal guarantee was well known to the family members and expressed
                    in e-mails and notes over those years. Various arrangements were contemplated to
                    address the concern.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In early 2001, following failed negotiations
                    for a sale of WYC’s psychiatric hospital Adam Road Hospital Pte Ltd
                    (“ARHPL”), the financial strain on WYCPL increased. WMC promptly
                    found another potential purchaser of ARHPL in Pacific Healthcare Holdings Pte
                    Ltd (“PHH”), in June 2001. A deal was struck in December 2001
                    between WYCPL and PHH for the sale of 80% of ARHPL’s shares to PHH
                    (“the PHH deal”). This, however, did not free WYCPL and
                    correspondingly WYC, from financial difficulties because the substantial part of
                    the deal pertained to the sale of 19 Adam Road, the land on which ARHPL sat.
                    This sale which would have netted WYCPL $11m was not completed until June 2004.
                    In the interim period, there were real risks that the PHH deal would fall
                    through. WYC also endured a genuine prospect of the guarantee being called upon,
                    especially during 2003 when poor market conditions meant that WYCPL’s
                    property investments fared badly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In the light of his financial commitments, WYC
                    handed to PL a personal note on 19 January 2003 to explain his decision to
                    postpone the transfer of 5CHR to her as joint tenant. Part of the note
                    read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">While I was going downstairs I heard you reading to the grandchildren
                        [WML’s children]. In what would be a dark moment in your life that you
                        still cared for them signifies a sincerity in your attachment to the
                        Wong’s family.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For this reason apart from others, you deserve [5CHR].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Accordingly in the next few days, subject to my satisfying myself that the
                        current financial crisis with regard to my property investment, will not be
                        likely to bankruptise me, I will get my lawyers to work on the transfer of
                        50% or thereabouts to you.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My hesitation is because of my anxiety largely in respect of my finances
                        facing a severe downturn in the present negative market condition especially
                        were it to worsen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     This note stated unequivocally that WYC
                    thought that any transfer of 5CHR was “subject to” his own
                    financial security. WYC’s financial position did not improve over the next
                    few months. In fact, WMC caused WYC to cross-guarantee a further sum of $7.92m
                    in August 2003. But WYC was determined to ensure that his promise to PL would
                    eventually be fulfilled. Hence, he wrote to Tan Yah Piang on 6 October 2003
                    and repeated his wish to bequeath 5CHR to PL. He also enquired about the effect
                    of lodging a caveat in favour of her:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I understand a caveat would protect Patricia’s interest. However,
                        Meng Leong understands that by doing so, I am giving up my total rights to
                        the house even before my death i.e. if the Bank demands payment; I have no
                        right to sell the house. Is this so please?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It was clear from the quoted portion of the
                    above letter that WYC was entitled to use 5CHR to satisfy his liabilities if
                    they crystallised without first having to obtain PL’s consent. This showed
                    that it was WYC and not PL who solely owned 5CHR beneficially up till the time
                    the Transfer was executed in December 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     During cross-examination, PL persisted in
                    stating that WYC never regarded himself as having at least some beneficial share
                    in 5CHR because “he knew it all along” that 5CHR was intended to
                    be hers eventually. PL’s lay understanding was natural, but it was
                    mistaken as well. The couple’s shared understanding that 5CHR would
                    “eventually” be PL’s did not in itself give PL a beneficial
                    interest in 5CHR. The eventuality was also subject to the abatement of
                    WYC’s financial liabilities. That only happened some months before the
                    Transfer took place. Hence, I held that PL was not the sole beneficial owner of
                    5CHR.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Transfer was valid</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did WYC have the mental capacity to execute the Transfer?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In the absence of other vitiating factors, the
                    Transfer’s validity depended on whether WYC had the requisite mental
                    capacity to execute it. After reviewing the applicable law, and the factual and
                    medical evidence, I decided that WYC was competent to execute the Transfer at
                    the material time. WYC was unlikely to be suffering from Alzheimer’s
                    disease then. Even if I was wrong and he did suffer from an impairment of the
                    mind in December 2004, I found that WYC was still able to make a decision for
                    himself regarding the execution of the Transfer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     WYC’s conduct which preceded the
                    execution of the Transfer showed that his decision was not merely rational in
                    its outcome, but was carefully taken. WYC made his decision after he had
                    identified and weighed the respective interests of parties who would be
                    potentially affected, including his own. The activities which he continued to
                    engage in and the various corporate documents he signed after December 2004 also
                    rendered the allegation that he lacked the capacity to execute an instrument in
                    the nature of the Transfer implausible.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The law on mental capacity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Although the MCA had not come into force when
                    WYC executed the Transfer in December 2004, the statutory test for capacity can
                    be applied here. The statutory test is consistent with the common law
                    definitions which were applied to determine whether decisions made in other
                    contexts should be upheld: <em>eg </em><em>George Abraham Vadakathu v Jacob George</em> [2009]
                    3 SLR(R) 631 at [29] which
                    states the test for testamentary capacity. The common law definitions uphold the
                    value of autonomy because capacity is a necessary condition for an individual to
                    behave autonomously. In a similar vein, the underlying philosophy of the MCA
                    emphasises an individual’s autonomy and the right to decide for himself.
                    For example, the MCA provides that decisions cannot be taken on behalf of
                    another person unless it is established that he lacks statutorily-defined
                    capacity in relation to the specific matter. As a corollary, if a person
                    possessed statutorily-defined capacity, his decision should stand as it is an
                    autonomous one, assuming that other vitiating factors are absent. Given that the
                    MCA was enacted to guide proxy decision-making and not to alter the pre-existing
                    conception of autonomy embodied in the common law, its concept of capacity was
                    not different from the common law’s.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The MCA’s test is found in s 4(1).
                    It states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For the purposes of this Act, a person lacks capacity in relation to a
                        matter if at the material time he is unable to make a decision for himself
                        in relation to the matter because of an impairment of, or a disturbance in
                        the functioning of, the mind or brain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Section 5(1) of the MCA defines a person as being “unable to
                    make a decision for himself” if he is unable to understand the
                    information relevant to the decision; to retain that information; to use or
                    weigh that information as part of the process of making the decision; or to
                    communicate his decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The MCA’s test for capacity can
                    therefore be reduced into two components. There is a diagnostic threshold of an
                    impairment of brain or mind function, and that must result in a functional
                    inability to make a decision due to the lack of any of the elements in
                    s 5(1) of the MCA. These two components were adopted from the equivalent
                    United Kingdom legislation. The requirement for a functional inability directs
                    our attention to the person’s decision-making process rather than the
                    outcome of his decision. This focus is reinforced by s 3(4) of the MCA
                    which states that a person is not to be considered incapacitated merely because
                    he makes an unwise decision. Because a purely functional approach may still
                    overreach, the Law Commission of England and Wales recommended an additional
                    diagnostic threshold to be satisfied in order for incapacity to be established:
                        <em>Mental Incapacity</em> (1995) (Law Com No 231)
                    London: HMSO at pp 34 to 36. This threshold serves to prevent individuals
                    from being caught by the MCA’s provisions simply for making unwise or
                    eccentric decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The plaintiffs also bore the burden of proving
                    on a balance of probabilities that WYC lacked capacity at the material time
                    because s 3(2) of the MCA provides that a person “must be assumed to
                    have capacity unless it is established that he lacks capacity”. This
                    allocation of the burden of proof is unlike a case which concerned testamentary
                    capacity since that is for the propounder of a will to prove: <em>Chee Mu Lin Muriel v Chee Ka Lin Caroline (Chee Ping Chian Alexander and
                        another, interveners)</em> [2010] 4 SLR 373 at [52].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">WYC’s functional abilities to make decisions around the time of
                the Transfer</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">WYC’s conduct in the period surrounding the Transfer</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Shortly before he signed the Transfer, WYC had
                    attempted to transfer 5CHR in a different manner of holding. On or about
                    17 November 2004, WYC approached one G D Balakrishnan
                    (“Balakrishnan”), a senior lawyer to act for him in the transfer
                    of the entire beneficial interest in 5CHR to PL and WMW as tenants-in-common
                    holding a 60% and 40% share respectively. Balakrishnan was WYC’s neighbour
                    since 1968 when he moved to 39 Goldhill Avenue. Over the years, he became
                    WYC’s close friend. Balakrishnan testified that WYC telephoned him to
                    prepare the necessary documents for the transfer of 5CHR in the manner of
                    tenancy-in-common. During the period from 17 November 2004 to
                    3 December 2004, they kept in regular contact and WYC was generally prompt
                    in providing Balakrishnan with the relevant information for the transfer.
                    Balakrishnan observed that WYC’s responses to his queries were always
                    clear, coherent and concise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     On 5 December 2004, Balakrishnan brought
                    the transfer documents he had prepared to 5CHR. According to Balakrishnan, WML
                    and PL were present at this meeting before he arrived. Balakrishnan testified
                    that because WML objected to the transfer strenuously at that meeting, he
                    advised WYC to take time to reconsider the matter, before taking the transfer
                    documents away with him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The plaintiffs disputed Balakrishnan’s
                    account. WML’s version of what took place on the evening of
                    5 December 2004 was diametrically different from PL’s and
                    Balakrishnan’s. In his AEIC for OS 648 of 2010, WML claimed that WYC had
                    called him, sounding “anxious”, sometime towards the end of 2004,
                    and asked him to go to 5CHR immediately and “help him to look over some
                    documents that he had been asked to sign.” WML alleged that WYC told him
                    that he “sensed the documents were of some importance and wanted [WML] to
                    be there with [WYC].” This implied that WYC did not even know the nature
                    of the documents that were placed before him at that time. WML described what
                    happened next as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When I got there, I noticed that a lawyer, Mr Balakrishnan was also
                        there together with [PL]. … I noticed that the document my father was
                        about to sign was a [t]ransfer relating to [5CHR]. I asked my father if he
                        knew what he was signing and tried to explain it to him. My father was
                        muddled and confused. At that point in time, Mr Balakrishnan then said
                        something to the effect that “we don’t have to do this now if
                        you want to consider it”. Mr Balakrishnan then left with the
                        document not signed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     At the trial, WML embellished his account. He
                    claimed to have been awakened by a telephone call from WYC early in the morning
                    of 5 December 2004, and rushed to 5CHR where he distinctly recalled seeing
                    Balakrishnan’s car already parked when he arrived. I found WML’s
                    version of what took place on 5 December 2004 to be unlikely to be true.
                    First, Balakrishnan explained that the meeting which took place on a Sunday
                    could not have been in the morning because as a Christian, he would have been in
                    church at that time. Balakrishnan was also unlikely to be wrong about the date
                    of the meeting because it was corroborated by PL’s account. Secondly,
                    Balakrishnan testified that the transfer documents were kept in an envelope and
                    were not taken out and shown to WYC at all during the meeting. Hence, WML could
                    not have read them. This meant that WML went down to 5CHR not to assist a
                    confused WYC but because WYC had informed him of his intention to transfer 5CHR
                    to the defendants, and WML wanted to stop the transaction. Thirdly, Balakrishnan
                    testified that WYC was attentive and it was obvious from WYC’s demeanour
                    that he fully understood the implications of transferring 5CHR to the
                    defendants. Fourthly, Balakrishnan’s evidence showed that the only
                    pressure that was applied during the meeting was by WML. WML repeatedly urged
                    WYC not to execute the transfer by raising issues such as WYC’s fiscal
                    commitments and the rights of TKY. This evidence was consistent with the
                    contents of a contemporaneous note that PL made during that meeting which stated
                    that WML objected to the transfer because, “my father is much older; if
                    father is infirm, I don’t want Pat to have the house,
                    ‘bedrock’ to hang on” and “I prefer after his life
                    time”. This note was dated 5 December 2004 and WML did not deny that
                    he said those words at that meeting. PL testified that WML insisted that WYC
                    continued to “have a stake” in 5CHR, in the event WYC’s
                    finances dipped in the future. WML even asked Balakrishnan about the possibility
                    of a joint tenancy instead of the proposed tenancy- in-common. Finally, it could
                    be inferred that WYC understood what took place on 5 December 2004 from his
                    actions shortly after that. WYC informed PL that he had carefully considered
                    WML’s remonstrations and decided to transfer 5CHR to PL as a joint tenant
                    with himself. This fresh decision to transfer 5CHR to PL as a joint tenant was
                    an ample demonstration of WYC’s ability in December 2004 to listen to
                    competing arguments, weigh them and arrive at a decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Balakrishnan also inferred that WYC understood
                    the nature of the transpired events because WYC called him some time after the
                    5 December 2004 meeting, and told him WMC was similarly trying to influence
                    him on the same issue. WYC told Balakrishnan that he had considered the matter
                    and decided to transfer 5CHR to PL and himself as joint tenants. Balakrishnan
                    prepared the necessary documents and met WYC at 5CHR again.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     At this meeting on 7 December 2004, WYC
                    signed the transfer instrument in Balakrishnan’s presence. Balakrishnan
                    testified that throughout this meeting, it was clear that WYC was fully aware of
                    the implications of what he was doing, and neither appeared muddled nor
                    confused. The instructions WYC gave to Balakrishnan were very clear and concise.
                    That same night, PL overheard WYC informing WML that he signed the said
                    documents. WML disputed learning of the execution of the Transfer on that night.
                    But what transpired the day after showed that news of the Transfer had reached
                    the plaintiffs on 7 December 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     On the morning of 8 December 2004, WMC
                    telephoned Balakrishnan’s office before 9am to request a meeting. The call
                    was diverted to his secretary’s handphone. WMC then called a second time
                    shortly after 10am and demanded to see Balakrishnan. He then turned up,
                    unscheduled and unannounced, at Balakrishnan’s office to object to the
                    Transfer on various grounds. However, among his many objections, WMC never once
                    said to Balakrishnan that WYC could not understand the nature of the Transfer.
                    Instead, he informed Balakrishnan that he would return later that day with WML
                    and WYC. WMC initially claimed emphatically that he did not make that morning
                    visit to Balakrishnan’s office. He later changed his evidence in
                    cross-examination. His memory was supposedly jolted by a drive past
                    People’s Park where Balakrishnan’s office is presently located.
                    WMC’s explanation was untrue because in December 2004,
                    Balakrishnan’s office was at Robinson Road.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Balakrishnan called WYC after WMC left that
                    morning to inform him of the objections WMC had registered with him. WYC
                    instructed Balakrishnan to proceed with the Transfer nevertheless. WYC also sent
                    a fax and a letter to Balakrishnan to confirm his oral instructions to
                    “proceed with the transfer of [5CHR] with immediate
                    effect”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Just as WMC had intimated to Balakrishnan, a
                    second meeting took place in the afternoon of 8 December 2004 at the
                    latter’s office. The plaintiffs attended together with WYC. I found that
                    WYC probably attended this meeting to placate the plaintiffs. Once again, the
                    plaintiffs rehearsed their objections to the Transfer and argued that leaving
                    5CHR in the <em>status quo</em> would be most convenient
                    for it to be used as collateral for WYCPL’s business. WMC originally
                    denied any recollection of this second meeting but eventually admitted to it.
                    However, he refused to give a direct answer on whether WML was present as well
                    because WML had categorically denied in his AEIC to visiting
                    Balakrishnan’s office at all. Upon hearing that Balakrishnan’s
                    secretary would be called as a rebuttal witness, WML was compelled to change his
                    evidence and admitted his statement in his AEIC was untrue. After that afternoon
                    meeting, WYC again called Balakrishnan to proceed with registering the Transfer
                    which he had executed. It was evident that WYC was resolute not to give in to
                    the plaintiffs’ objections any more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Because Balakrishnan was apprised by WMC that
                    WYC was “forgetful” and was sensitive to the dynastic squabble
                    surrounding the Transfer, he prudently took the extra step of checking with WYC,
                    on or about 23 December 2004, whether WYC could remember the Transfer and
                    asked WYC to repeat his instructions of the previous fortnight. WYC did so and
                    even agreed to put those instructions in a statutory declaration. On
                    23 December 2004, WYC went to Balakrishnan’s office and read the
                    draft statutory declaration in his presence before meeting a Commissioner for
                    Oaths, one B Rengarajoo who had an office in the same building, to affirm the
                    same. Balakrishnan emphasised that this was only a precautionary measure because
                    he had no doubts at all that WYC understood exactly what he did regarding the
                    Transfer. The transfer instrument was eventually lodged with the Land Titles
                    Registry in March 2005 after the title deeds of 5CHR were found.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">WYC understood and signed many complex corporate and financial
                documents up till 2006</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     It was undisputed that WYC signed corporate
                    documents on behalf of WYCPL around and after the date of the Transfer. Many of
                    those documents were co-signed by the plaintiffs. They included, amongst others,
                    consents to short notice (3 February 2004, 30 September 2004);
                    directors’ resolutions (3 February 2004, 1 March 2004,
                    16 September 2004, 11 October 2004, 15 December 2004,
                    30 December 2004, 22 August 2005 and 19 January 2006); a
                    certified extract of resolutions passed at a WYCPL directors’ meeting on
                    16 February 2004 which WYC signed as chairman of the meeting; a
                    supplemental deed between WYCPL and PHH as part of the PHH deal (25 June
                    2004); a deed of gift (25 June 2004); a deed of release (25 June
                    2004); minutes of the annual general meeting (30 September 2004); a
                    directors’ resolution relating to the sale of 19 Adam Road (4 July
                    2005); minutes of an extraordinary general meeting (19 July 2005); a letter
                    of consent (30 December 2004); and the financial statements of WYCPL for
                    the year ended 31 March 2005. The plaintiffs were shown those documents at
                    trial and admitted that WYC was able to read and understand all of
                them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Because such corporate documents were
                        <em>prima facie</em> equal to or greater in complexity
                    than the Transfer, WMC sought to explain away their significance. He asserted
                    that they were nothing more than a follow-through of earlier decisions taken in
                    2001 when WYC was mentally unimpaired, whereas the Transfer was not. This
                    distinction was unsustainable. The directors’ resolution of WYCPL dated
                    30 December 2004, for example, was not a follow-through of any prior
                    decision. It was actually one of the decisions carried out pursuant to the
                    proposals contained in the Christmas Recommendations which were prepared for WYC
                    in December 2004. The resolution of 30 December 2004 bore the
                    plaintiffs’ signatures in addition to WYC’s. It diluted WYC’s
                    shareholding in WYCPL from 90% to 15%. It also allowed the plaintiffs, WMK and
                    WMW to acquire shares in WYCPL for the first time. It was undisputed that
                    WYC’s consent was essential for this to take place. The plaintiffs said
                    they would not have allowed WYC to sign the resolution if they thought that WYC
                    was unable to understand it. It was untenable for the plaintiffs to maintain
                    that WYC could understand a share issuance transaction which diluted his
                    shareholdings in a company of some worth but could not understand the workings
                    of a simple transfer for which he had consulted with his solicitor and
                    contemplated for years.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">WYC practised successfully as a psychiatrist until he retired in
                mid-2005</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     WYC was engaged in an active medical practice
                    and saw patients on his own until his retirement on 3 May 2005, five months
                    after he executed the Transfer. WMC himself exhorted WYC to delay his retirement
                    because the PHH deal required ARHPL to satisfy certain revenue targets. In an
                    e-mail to PL, WMC told PL that the “optimum time” for WYC to
                    retire would be between April and June 2005. This implicitly affirmed that WYC
                    was mentally robust to withstand the rigours of medical practice. WMC’s
                    confidence in his father was vindicated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Throughout 2004, WYC had performed
                    electro-convulsive therapy, prescribed medication and attended to challenging
                    patients. No patient of WYC had made malpractice claims against him regarding
                    any treatment he provided in 2004. The financial statements of ARHPL showed that
                    WYC saw a total of 7,821 patients in 2004, averaging 650 patients each month
                    that year. He saw 727 outpatients in December 2004 on top of inpatients. He was
                    the highest earner at ARHPL by far for each and every month in 2004 for both
                    inpatients and outpatients, earning an income of about $80,000 in December 2004
                    alone. Dr Francis Ngui (“Dr Ngui”), the medical director
                    of ARHPL who was then in active practice himself, testified that WYC saw more
                    patients than him that month. Dr Ngui also testified that WYC could have
                    seen complicated cases even after June 2004, and he was unaware that WYC was
                    diagnosed with dementia in December 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     There was also documentary evidence which
                    showed that WYC handled fetch cases in June and August 2004. Fetch cases
                    required WYC to attend at the patients’ home with some nurses. He would
                    have had to administer medication, coax the agitated and uncooperative patients
                    into the ambulance (which he drove), and speak with the patients’ families
                    in those scenarios.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">WYC continued to drive, swim and engage in social activities until
                2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Apart from his professional life, WYC was also
                    functioning normally in his daily life up until at least 2008. There were
                    various sources of evidence to confirm this. I begin with the evidence of WMS.
                    She had written an e-mail to PL and WYC on 3 September 2004 to explain her
                    personal plight and she requested financial assistance from WYC. She testified
                    that she felt WYC was able to understand her situation (she was in the midst of
                    divorce proceedings) and competent enough for her to be asking him for money at
                    that time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     WYC’s niece Patsy Graieg, who is based
                    in Australia, was an important witness. She visited Singapore about twice a year
                    from 1997 to 2008 and met up with WYC and his family each time. In 2004, Patsy
                    Graieg visited Singapore thrice, in February, August and November. She was a
                    trusted relative of WYC with whom WYC periodically consulted from 1997 to 2006
                    on financial issues regarding his retirement, business succession and the PHH
                    deal, as she was a trained accountant. She testified that she had no doubt that
                    WYC fully understood the complex issues surrounding the business deal in 2001,
                    and he continued to display his trademark intelligence and high level of mental
                    sharpness in the years leading up to the execution of the
                Transfer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     According to Patsy Graieg, from 1997 until
                    2004, WYC told her that he was dissatisfied that PL’s name was not
                    included in the title deed of 5CHR. She recalled WYC telling her that he wanted
                    to transfer 5CHR to PL because PL had always treated him well and had made many
                    sacrifices for the family over the years; there was more than one such
                    discussion. Patsy Graieg was also told that a transfer was not carried out
                    because one of WYC’s sons was strenuously opposing it. Significantly, she
                    recalled that during the Chinese New Year of 2005, WYC informed her of the
                    Transfer, and he felt very proud of his deed. This testimony which I accepted to
                    be true and accurate showed two things. First, it was WYC’s long-held
                    intention for PL to have a share of 5CHR and the Transfer was not impulsively
                    carried out. Second, WYC remembered his decision for at least a month after he
                    made it and was very satisfied with it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Patsy Graieg continued to interact with WYC on
                    several occasions after 2005. She recalled that in 2007, WYC had engaged in a
                    meaningful conversation with her on the Kosovo war. In March 2008, they
                    celebrated the birthdays of WYC and Patsy Graieg’s father at a restaurant
                    called Spring Court. Patsy Graieg recollected that WYC was perfectly capable of
                    interacting with various people at the luncheon, and had spoke with the
                    restaurateur on Spring Court’s history.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Whilst Patsy Graieg was a witness for the
                    defendants, I did not doubt the veracity and impartiality of her evidence. It
                    was undisputed that she had always been and still was on good and close terms
                    with the plaintiffs, who were her first cousins. She also regarded the
                    defendants well. She had no self-interest in the matter, and had chosen to give
                    evidence as a matter of conscience because WYC could not speak for
                    himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     WYC was also driving his car as at August 2005
                    and gave up his driver’s licence only on 22 May 2006. PL confirmed
                    that WYC would drive alone most of the time for as long as he had a
                    driver’s licence and she would have stopped him immediately if she thought
                    that it was unsafe for him to do so. Patsy Graieg also testified that WYC
                    regularly picked her up from Changi Airport and drove her to her sister’s
                    place at Club Street after he had retired from ARHPL in mid-2005. WYC did not
                    get lost on those occasions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     WML, who was a medical doctor, also certified
                    WYC to be fit to drive on 5 November 2003. WML knew that this medical
                    certification was valid for three years. In the medical examination form, the
                    only remark which WML thought was pertinent to make was that WYC had undergone a
                    coronary artery bypass grafting surgery in 1992. He declared WYC to not show
                    “any evidence of psychiatric disorder” and accepted that WYC was
                    not suffering from any “mental disability”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     WYC also continued with other daily activities
                    including attending various appointments with doctors and the barber, and having
                    lunches with friends. He held a coherent discussion on 26 February 2004
                    with his doctor. He continued to swim without assistance in August 2008. WYC
                    attended social functions in 2007, as evidenced by a letter one Oei Hong Leong
                    had sent to him on 8 February 2007 which stated that WYC had
                    “contributed to the sparkle and cheer” at a wedding which WYC had
                    attended the previous month. WYC went on a ten-day trip to Japan in 2005 with
                    WMW, PL and WMK’s family, and visited WMK’s family in Hong Kong in
                    2007. Critically, both Patsy Graieg and PL testified that WYC appeared to have
                    faltered in his ability to manage his personal affairs only sometime in late
                    2008 or early 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The plaintiffs’ allegations with respect to their
                father’s functional abilities</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Against this abundant and corroborated
                    evidence that WYC possessed sufficient functional dexterity to discharge his
                    professional duties as a clinical psychiatrist, drive a car with passengers and
                    socialise with third parties after the Transfer was executed, the
                    plaintiffs’ allegations of their father’s deficient mental state at
                    the material time could not be countenanced. WML’s statement in his AEIC
                    for OS 648 of 2010 that, “For years prior to the execution of the
                    Transfer, my father could not even tell the time of day” was therefore
                    patently untrue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">WYC’s medical condition at the time of the Transfer</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The plaintiffs’ experts’ evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The plaintiffs’ experts were
                    Dr Alexander P Auchus (“Dr Auchus”) and
                    Dr Christopher Chen (“Dr Chen”). They were also the
                    treating physicians of WYC. Dr Auchus was the neurologist who first saw WYC
                    at the Singapore General Hospital (“SGH”) on 3 December 2002
                    and again on 28 February 2003 and 25 July 2003. Shortly thereafter,
                    Dr Auchus relocated to the United States and Dr Chen was the
                    neurologist who took over the care of WYC. Dr Chen saw WYC at SGH on five
                    occasions altogether – on 23 October 2003, 26 February 2004,
                    17 March 2005, 23 March 2005 and 1 June 2005. Clinical notes were
                    recorded in all eight visits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Three neuropsychology reports (“the
                    Neuropsychology Reports”) were rendered on WYC’s condition pursuant
                    to various neuropsychological tests which were carried out on three visits with
                    Drs Auchus and Chen. They were dated 3 December 2002, 25 July 2003 and
                    23 March 2005. The first two Neuropsychology Reports were co-signed by
                    Dr Auchus and a neuropsychologist.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In the Suit, Dr Auchus and Dr Chen
                    each produced an expert’s report dated 18 May 2011 and 13 May
                    2011 respectively (collectively “the plaintiffs’ Expert’s
                    Reports”). The plaintiffs’ Expert’s Reports considered the
                    issue of whether WYC was able to make a decision for himself to execute the
                    Transfer at the material time. Previously, Dr Auchus and Dr Chen had
                    also each issued a medical report for the purposes of the appointment of the CPE
                    in the Originating Summons. These medical reports were dated 3 September
                    2005 (“the 3 September 2005 Medical Report”) and
                    15 September 2005 (“the 15 September 2005 Medical
                    Report”) respectively, and were annexed to the plaintiffs’
                    Expert’s Reports.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     I found that the plaintiffs’
                    Expert’s Reports which had been prepared for the Suit did not satisfy the
                    requirements laid down by O 40A r 3(2) of the ROC for the following
                    reasons. First, an expert owes his duty to the Court (O 40A r 2, ROC)
                    and this requires him to disclose any special relationship between the party who
                    called him and the expert because the expert must not only be impartial but must
                    also appear to be so: <em>Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd v S Y
                        Technology Inc and another appeal</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 491
                        (“<em>Pacific Recreation</em>”) at
                        <a href="#p1_73">[73]</a>. Hence, the expert should avoid
                    being the witness of a party with whom he has a special relationship. If that
                    was unavoidable, he must disclose the relevant facts. On this point, there must
                    be absolute transparency from the expert witness and their legal advisers as
                    both are officers of the court: <em>Gunapathy Muniandy v Khoo
                        James</em> [2001] SGHC 165 at [12.16], followed in <em>Pacific Recreations</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     It emerged at the trial that both Drs Auchus
                    and Chen enjoyed a fairly close relationship with the plaintiffs which they had
                    failed to disclose in the plaintiffs’ Expert’s Reports.
                    Dr Auchus did not say in his report that when he was employed at the
                    Neurology Department of the SGH from 1998 to 2003, WMC was the head of
                    department for most of that period. It was a small department and Dr Auchus
                    worked closely with WMC. They had collaborated on research projects during his
                    time at the SGH and continued to collaborate on numerous research publications
                    after he left Singapore. Dr Auchus also admitted that the person who
                    referred WYC to him for consultation in the first place was probably
                WMC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Dr Chen failed to disclose, in both his
                    AEIC and expert’s report, his friendship with WMC. In fact, he had been
                    friends with WMC for 17 years; WMC was Dr Chen’s head of department
                    at the Neurology Department at the SGH for eight years; WMC was
                    Dr Chen’s first superior on Dr Chen’s return to Singapore
                    from his studies and work in the UK; in the past 17 years, they collaborated in
                    approximately 50 research projects; those collaborations continued even after
                    WMC ceased to be the head of department. On the day he testified at the trial,
                    Dr Chen was jointly writing three papers with WMC and he had received a
                    hamper from WMC’s wife on or about 1 February 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Dr Chen was also friends with WML. He
                    even addressed WML by his nickname “Merng” in correspondence. It
                    emerged that Dr Chen had met WML through his wife at least a decade
                    earlier. His children played with WML’s children and he had visited 5CHR
                    for WML’s daughter’s birthday party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Given the extent of the personal and
                    professional relationships of Dr Auchus and Dr Chen with the
                    plaintiffs, it should have been plain to the plaintiffs and/or their solicitors,
                    that the two doctors should not have been briefed as expert witnesses. Paragraph
                    4.8.4 of the Code of Practice: Mental Capacity Act 2008 (“the
                    Code”) issued by the Office of the Public Guardian, which applied by
                    virtue of s 41(6) of the MCA, also stated that, to avoid any conflict of
                    interest the doctor who conducts the mental assessment capacity of a person
                    “should not be related to … the individual seeking the formal
                    assessment of the person.” That was in substance what had transpired in
                    this case when WMC first referred WYC to Dr Auchus for diagnosis, and
                    subsequently when Dr Auchus and Dr Chen were asked to opine on
                    WYC’s capacity in the application for the CPE’s appointment, the
                    Originating Summons and the Suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Secondly, apart from any appearance of bias, I
                    found that both of the plaintiffs’ experts did display instances of
                    partiality to the plaintiffs’ case. They were selective in the
                    presentation of the relevant medical evidence as they had highlighted only
                    material which supported the plaintiffs’ case and omitted to mention
                    matters adverse to it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In his Expert’s Report and in the
                    3 September 2005 Medical Report which was annexed to the Expert’s
                    Report, Dr Auchus mentioned that his examination of WYC on 3 December
                    2002 “revealed marked impairment of memory function with 0/3 objects
                    recalled at 5 minutes, as well as disorientation of day and date”. What
                    was not mentioned was that Dr Auchus had asked WYC other questions which
                    WYC could answer. Dr Auchus’s clinical notes indicated that WYC had
                    “good attention, January to December and December to January without
                    errors. Good language, follows three step commands, names” and
                    “good attention … accurate clock face” and these were not
                    referred to in the Expert’s Report although Dr Auchus testified that
                    they were relevant matters. He chose instead to select from the many questions
                    he had asked WYC and stated those that supported the opinion he was trying to
                    convey. This was unjustified because all the questions he had quoted were
                    actually parts of one standard questionnaire test, called the mini-mental state
                    examination (“MMSE”), which was commonly used to screen for
                    dementia. WYC had scored 26 out of 30 for the MMSE, and any score above 22 was
                    in the normal range of MMSE scores.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The MMSE, in turn, was one of the various
                    neuropsychological tests that were carried out in order to render each
                    neuropsychology report. The manner in which Dr Auchus referred to the
                    contents of the 2003 Neuropsychology Report in his Expert’s Report was
                    also misleading. He had quoted from the 2003 Neuropsychology Report as a basis
                    to say that WYC was impaired in verbal memory and visual memory. But he did not
                    point out that the same neuropsychology report stated that WYC’s
                    “global dementia screening scores”, “language”,
                    “visuoconstruction and visuomotor speed task performances” were
                    unimpaired, and WYC’s “attention” not only was unimpaired
                    but registered an improvement when compared with the results in the 2002
                    Neuropsychology Report. It was also significant that Dr Auchus did not
                    annex the 2002 and 2003 Neuropsychology Reports to his Expert’s Report,
                    when both of them did not support his diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and
                    the latter of which he had quoted from selectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Dr Chen was not impartial as well. He
                    testified that he had no independent recollection of the consultations WYC had
                    with him seven years ago except for what his clinical notes recorded. His
                    Expert’s Report, however, gave a slanted interpretation of those clinical
                    notes. While no mention of any decline in WYC’s cognitive abilities were
                    recorded in Dr Chen’s notes taken between October 2003 and March
                    2005, Dr Chen stated in his Expert’s Report without qualification
                    that WYC’s cognitive functions were declining during that period.
                    Dr Chen claimed that the 2005 Neuropsychology Report supported his view
                    that WYC had deteriorated. But not only was this neuropsychology report not
                    annexed to his Expert’s Report, Dr Chen also did not point out that
                    it had concluded that WYC’s “neuropsychological profile showed
                    generally stable cognitive status”. The results of the various
                    neuropsychological tests done in 2005 were in fact the same or better for more
                    than half of the tests done in 2002.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     There was also no mention by Dr Chen that
                    the 2005 Neuropsychology Report indicated that WYC was
                    “ADL-independent” (which meant that WYC was able to perform
                    activities of daily living independently) and his attention was unimpaired. Most
                    importantly, Dr Chen failed to inform the Court that WYC had obtained a
                    full score on the “Frontal Assessment Battery” test (“the
                    FAB test”) which indicated that there were no problems with WYC’s
                    executive functioning as at March 2005. The significance of the FAB test will be
                    elaborated on below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Nothing in Dr Chen’s Expert’s
                    Report alluded to his observation in February 2004, that WYC was able to make
                    decisions for himself and coherently discuss his medical practice, social events
                    and driving, all of which were found in the clinical notes. Dr Chen
                    admitted that those were relevant facts, especially since what he was doing in
                    his Expert’s Report was to extrapolate from the limited information he
                    gathered from the five consultations WYC had with him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Thirdly, an expert’s report must give
                    details of any literature or other material on which the expert witness had
                    relied in making the report (O 40A r 3(2)(<em>b</em>),
                    ROC) and, where there is a range of opinion on the matters dealt with in the
                    report, summarise the range of opinion and give reasons for his opinion (O 40A
                        r 3(2)(<em>e</em>), ROC).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Both of the plaintiffs’ Expert’s
                    Reports did not fulfil the mandatory criteria because they did not attempt to
                    explain the contradictory objective medical evidence which I found to be highly
                    relevant on the basis of PL’s expert’s evidence. Dr Auchus and
                    Dr Chen had merely provided the Court with their factual accounts of
                    consultations with WYC and stated their bare conclusions in support of the
                    plaintiffs’ case. Both appeared to have written their Expert’s
                    Reports under the mistaken belief that their opinions would be accepted because
                    they were WYC’s treating physicians.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     With respect to Dr Auchus, his
                    Expert’s Report did not explain why he claimed to have diagnosed WYC with
                    Alzheimer’s disease on 3 December 2002 when the conclusion of the
                    2002 Neuropsychological Report he co-signed had indicated otherwise. An
                    explanation was warranted since he acknowledged that neuropsychological tests
                    were an objective tool that was useful in making a diagnosis of
                    Alzheimer’s disease. Dr Auchus also accepted that he had selectively
                    excluded reference to information which did not support the plaintiffs’
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Dr Chen’s clinical notes on the
                    first four visits by WYC (from October 2003 to March 2005) recorded that WYC
                    only had clinically “mild” and not moderate or severe dementia. He
                    agreed that a person who had mild dementia was usually able to make decisions
                    for himself. But he offered no reasons in his Expert’s Report and at trial
                    for concluding that WYC was, unusually, unlikely to be able to make a decision
                    for himself to execute the Transfer. Dr Chen also did not explain how he
                    arrived at his conclusions when the neuropsychology reports showed that
                    WYC’s cognitive status was generally stable between December 2002 and
                    March 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Fourthly, neither of the plaintiffs’
                    experts was able to give a reliable expert opinion on the issue of WYC’s
                    mental capacity in December 2004. Dr Auchus stated candidly in his AEIC
                    that he was unable to express a definitive opinion on the issue. He confirmed
                    this position at trial. He also said he had no reason to challenge
                    Dr Chen’s view that WYC was still able to make decisions for himself
                    in February 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     I was of the view that Dr Chen’s
                    conclusions on WYC’s mental state in December 2004 were unreliable. At
                    trial, Dr Chen stood by his opinion that WYC was able to make rational and
                    coherent decisions in February 2004, which was the last occasion Dr Chen
                    examined WYC before the Transfer took place. There were serious deficiencies in
                    the analysis Dr Chen undertook to then conclude that WYC became mentally
                    incompetent about nine months later. Dr Chen admitted that there was a gap
                    in the information he had because he had no contemporaneous medical records of
                    WYC in December 2004, and had instead extrapolated towards a conclusion. He also
                    accepted that the rate of deterioration for patients with dementia was not
                    constant. Despite these undisputed propositions, he gave a definitive opinion in
                    favour of the plaintiffs’ case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Further, Dr Chen admitted that he did not
                    consider any other facts or documents relating to what WYC was able to do in and
                    after December 2004. Although he had asked for them, the plaintiffs did not
                    provide him with any of that information. Thus, he had based his opinion on
                    incomplete information. The plaintiffs denied him information such as the tasks
                    WYC was doing professionally as a doctor, a company director and socially.
                    Dr Chen agreed that such information was relevant in the determination of
                    WYC’s mental competence. Even the information he relied upon and found in
                    his clinical notes was not completely accurate. For example, WYC was still
                    driving independently in June 2005 despite what was recorded in the clinical
                    notes of 1 June 2005. Hence, I rejected the plaintiffs’
                    Expert’s Reports and attached no weight to the opinions expressed therein.
                    I only took into account the factual aspects of the evidence of Dr Auchus
                    and Dr Chen.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The first defendant’s expert’s evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     PL’s expert, Dr Chong Piang Ngok
                    (“Dr Chong”), provided a more useful expert’s report.
                    Dr Chong opined that although WYC had mild dementia, he was unlikely to be
                    suffering from Alzheimer’s disease in December 2004, and that it was
                    highly unlikely that WYC was incapable of understanding the nature of the
                    Transfer. In his report and at trial, he carefully explained how he came to his
                    conclusion. Dr Chong first showed why the plaintiffs’ experts’
                    opinions on WYC’s medical condition and functional ability were not
                    supported by the objective medical evidence such as the neuropsychology reports
                    and other scan results. He then elucidated why a clinical assessment of WYC in
                    December 2004 also should not have diagnosed WYC with Alzheimer’s
                    disease.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The objective medical evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In September 2000, WYC had undergone magnetic
                    resonance imaging (“MRI”) and positron emission tomography
                    (“PET”) scans of the brain, and also consulted one Dr Tommy
                    Chan (“Dr Chan”), a clinical psychologist in Hong Kong.
                    Dr Chan found WYC to be weak in short-term memory but did not consider it
                    to be pathological for his age. WYC was assessed to have exceptional
                    performances in comprehension of social conventions, abstract thinking,
                    integration and perceptual ability. Dr Chan found no significant signs of
                    dementia in WYC and concluded that the findings did not fulfil the full
                    diagnostic criteria for dementia (Alzheimer’s type or vascular) as defined
                    by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
                    (“DSM-IV”). The MRI scan results were interpreted by one
                    Dr Hector T G Ma to show that “[t]he total changes are consistent
                    with normal aging process with atherosclerosis of the brain. Serial follow-up is
                    worthwhile to see if the pace of deterioration is quicker than in a normal aging
                    brain or not.” The report of the PET scan results prepared by one
                    Dr Kevin K M Tse stated, “In a patient presented with dementia-like
                    picture, the possible diagnosis may include an early case of Pick’s
                    disease.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Dr Chong reasoned that since Dr Chan
                    had ruled out dementia at that point in time, the “possible
                    diagnosis” of Pick’s disease was inapplicable. Dr Chong then
                    highlighted the aforementioned deficiencies in the analysis of the
                    plaintiffs’ experts and how the plaintiffs’ experts’ opinions
                    were inconsistent with the objective medical evidence. He testified that due
                    weight should be given to formal objective and quantifiable information in this
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     I accepted Dr Chong’s reasons for
                    placing emphasis on the objective medical evidence. First, the
                    neuropsychological tests were conducted by specialised professionals in an
                    unrushed environment as opposed to a brief examination by a doctor in a busy
                    clinic. Dr Chen, for example, admitted that he was in a rush during
                    WYC’s consultation with him on 23 March 2005. Dr Auchus also
                    conceded under cross-examination that the 2002 neuropsychological tests were
                    performed after WYC’s consultation on 3 December 2002. Hence, whilst
                    Dr Auchus wrote “mild [Alzheimer’s disease] likely” in
                    his clinical notes, little weight should be given to that because he co-signed
                    the 2002 Neuropsychology Report which contradicted this possibility. Secondly,
                    evidence from the various factual witnesses showed that different people had
                    arrived at opposing conclusions on WYC’s mental state. Patsy Graieg and
                    WMS who had made periodic visits to WYC gave differing descriptions of his
                    mental state. Unlike Dr Auchus, Dr Chen said that WYC only had mild
                    cognitive impairment. In the face of these disagreements, the neuropsychological
                    test results had to be given greater weight. Above that, given the relationships
                    between the plaintiffs’ experts and the plaintiffs and the instances of
                    bias I had found in the plaintiff’s Expert’s Reports, it was only
                    correct for a fact-finder to rely more heavily on the objective medical
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The criteria for a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease were not
                satisfied</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Dr Chong also testified that based on the
                    contemporaneous clinical notes, a subjective approach would similarly turn up no
                    valid grounds for diagnosing WYC with Alzheimer’s disease in December
                    2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of
                    Alzheimer’s disease were described in the Ministry of Health’s 2007
                    clinical guidelines for dementia with which both Dr Auchus and Dr Chen
                    were familiar. In order to satisfy the DSM-IV criteria for Alzheimer’s
                    disease, a patient must have memory impairment and deficits in one other
                    cognitive domain (<em>ie</em> aphasia, apraxia, agnosia and
                    executive dysfunctioning) of sufficient severity to cause impairment in
                    occupational or social function. Dr Chen’s claim at the trial that
                    WYC fulfilled these criteria because he avoided taking on complicated cases in
                    his medical practice and drove only on familiar routes was incorrect. As noted
                    above at <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a>, the evidence showed that WYC
                    was handling fetch cases by himself in 2004 and driving from Changi Airport to
                    Club Street in 2005. Even if WYC could only drive on familiar routes, it
                    indicated a loss of memory and not apraxia since WYC retained the ability to
                    drive and apraxia was a condition characterised by an inability to perform a
                    learnt function. WYC did not suffer from aphasia as he could hold coherent
                    discussions with Dr Chen about his social and professional activities. He
                    could not have suffered from agnosia since he had no difficulty recognising
                    familiar faces or items.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Dr Chong was fair to note that by
                    15 September 2005, WYC’s condition could have progressed to clinical
                    Alzheimer’s disease. In the light of the objective medical evidence and
                    Dr Chong’s opinion, I did not think WYC was suffering from
                    Alzheimer’s disease at the time when he executed the Transfer. I also
                    found that it was more probable than not that Dr Auchus had made the
                    diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease retrospectively, when he wrote the
                    3 September 2005 Medical Report, while Dr Chen merely embraced that
                    incorrect diagnosis in the 15 September 2005 Medical Report without
                    evaluating the facts himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Immaterial even if WYC had Alzheimer’s disease</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Even if I was wrong and WYC had
                    Alzheimer’s disease or any other impairment of mind such as mild dementia
                    at the material time, I was satisfied that the impairment did not cause him to
                    lose the functional ability required for him to execute the
                Transfer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     All three expert witnesses agreed that someone
                    with Alzheimer’s disease may still be capable of making a decision for
                    himself. For example, Dr Chen recorded in his clinical notes of
                    23 October 2003 that WYC was competent to make a will. This was also
                    consistent with Dr Chong’s evidence that WYC’s short-term
                    memory deficits would not have affected his ability to understand the nature of
                    the Transfer. With respect to the Transfer, however, WYC’s patchy
                    forgetfulness was immaterial against the context of Balakrishnan’s
                    evidence that WYC could remember his own instructions more than a fortnight
                    later and Patsy Graieg’s evidence that WYC recounted proudly to her during
                    the Chinese New Year period the following year about having executed the
                    Transfer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     WYC’s executive functioning was also the
                    subject of Dr Chan’s report dated 18 October 2000 and the 2005
                    Neuropsychology Report. Drawing from their findings, Dr Chong said that
                    WYC’s higher order thinking was unimpaired on 23 March 2005, and it
                    was highly unlikely that WYC was incapable of understanding the documents
                    relating to the Transfer. The 2005 Neuropsychology Report showed that WYC
                    achieved a maximum score on the FAB test in March 2005. Dr Auchus
                    acknowledged that this indicated that WYC’s executive functioning was
                    intact. Dr Auchus explained that executive functioning referred to the
                    ability to make decisions, to follow through, to stay focussed and to shift
                    topics. During re-examination, Dr Auchus elaborated on how
                    “executive dysfunction” was related to the ability to make
                    decisions. He said, “executive function is … largely a result of
                    proper functioning of the frontal lobes of the brain … it is important in
                    decision-making and in this case, Dr Wong scored, ah, well on this
                    test.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Dr Auchus also testified that he would
                    not have waited till the last moment in his patient’s decline to stop him
                    from treating patients of his own; and as at 28 February 2003,
                    Dr Auchus did not feel a need to stop WYC from practising medicine.
                    Notably, none of the doctors who had dealt with WYC, including Dr Ngui and
                    the plaintiffs, had reported to the Singapore Medical Council in 2004 that WYC
                    was unable to practise medicine although they were under a professional and
                    ethical duty to report such doctors to the authorities. Instead, WMC prevailed
                    upon WYC to postpone his retirement. WMC clearly did not think WYC was going to
                    bungle the patients’ treatments at ARHPL and jeopardise the PHH
                    deal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Dr Chong stated that the ability to
                    practise medicine, administer treatments and prescribe medication required WYC
                    to understand, distinguish and analyse difficult issues. Dr Auchus stated
                    that a doctor who attended to a fetch case such as the ones WYC did would have
                    been required to make judgment calls on how best to manage the patient in a
                    dynamic environment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The factual and medical evidence together left
                    me with no doubt that WYC was able to understand the nature and consequences of
                    the Transfer which he executed on 7 December 2004. I found that the
                    plaintiffs had not discharged their burden of proving their allegations to the
                    contrary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was the Transfer was procured by undue influence?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     The plaintiffs argued that even if WYC was
                    competent to execute the Transfer at the material time, it should still be set
                    aside because it was procured by undue influence exerted by PL. At law, the
                    plaintiffs bore the burden of proving that actual undue influence was exercised.
                    But they sought to have the burden of proof reversed by relying on presumed
                    undue influence. Before there can be presumed undue influence however, the
                    plaintiffs must first show two elements existed: (i) a relationship of trust and
                    confidence and (ii) the transaction concerned was inexplicable; neither was
                    proven.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     With respect to the first element, there is
                    ordinarily no presumption of trust and confidence applicable in a husband and
                    wife relationship: <em>Howes v Bishop and wife</em> [1909]
                    2 KB 390 and <em>Barclays Bank plc v Khaira and
                        another</em> [1992] 1 WLR 623 at 632. As the plaintiffs had
                    repeatedly stressed, the relationship between WYC and PL was not even one of
                    husband and wife even though they did live together as a couple. The plaintiffs
                    were also unable to convince me that WYC reposed actual confidence in PL or that
                    she had acquired “domination” over him: <em>Goldsworthy v Brickell and another</em> [1987] 1 Ch 378 at
                    404. This was evident from the way WYC consistently prioritised his own
                    financial security ahead of his wish for PL to have a share of 5CHR. Even if I
                    was wrong on the first element, the Transfer was readily explicable in the light
                    of the long-held intention of WYC that PL should eventually have 5CHR. This was
                    an intention which had its roots in the purchase of 5CHR itself. Hence, I
                    rejected the contention that the plaintiffs could rely on presumed undue
                    influence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The plaintiffs failed to show that PL had
                    exercised any undue influence or exerted illegitimate pressure on WYC to execute
                    the Transfer. Conversely, the evidence showed that it was the plaintiffs who had
                    mounted a sustained campaign which stretched from 2002 until the date of the
                    trial, to prevent any interest in 5CHR from being transferred by WYC to PL in
                    any way, whether <em>via</em> an <em>inter
                        vivos</em> transfer or a will. They blocked WYC from instructing Tan
                    Yah Piang to execute a transfer of 5CHR; forced WYC to worry about his fiscal
                    fitness; counselled him on the seeming prudence of keeping 5CHR under his sole
                    ownership; caused him to believe that PL might leave him once she had 5CHR;
                    persuaded WYC to revoke his will in late 2003 which had left 5CHR to PL; and
                    tried to prevent WYC from instructing Balakrishnan on the execution of the
                    Transfer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The plaintiffs’ pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     In any case, the plaintiffs’ pleadings
                    on this issue were insufficient to support a claim of undue influence. The only
                    reference to any alleged pressure exerted by PL on WYC was in paragraph 23 of
                    the statement of claim which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As WYC’s cognitive functions declined, [PL] began to harangue and
                        urge WYC to transfer assets to her. Between 2000 and 2006, [PL] made WYC pay
                        for or reimburse her for her various insurance premiums. [PL] also arranged
                        for WYC to change the beneficiaries of two of his own life insurance
                        policies, which were purchased in December 1968 and November 1970
                        respectively, from that of the estate to [PL] and [WMW] on or about
                        16 October 2002. [PL] had threatened to leave WYC if he did not give in
                        to her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The allegations in relation to the insurance
                    premium payments and the policies’ beneficiaries bore no connection to the
                    issue of whether WYC had executed the Transfer due to PL’s alleged undue
                    influence. PL also provided a reasonable explanation why WYC took over the
                    payments of her insurance premiums – she had lost her job at that time.
                    The sole allegation of undue influence that could be identified in the statement
                    of claim was that PL had threatened to leave WYC if he did not give in to her.
                    However, in the further and better particulars furnished by the plaintiffs, they
                    were unable to state what PL had allegedly demanded from WYC. The plaintiffs
                    said they “were not present when [PL] made demands to WYC. However, from
                    the heated quarrel between [PL] and WYC, the plaintiffs understood [PL’s]
                    threat to be related to [PL’s] demand for assets”. Therefore, they
                    had no personal knowledge of the substance of any alleged demands made by PL.
                    They did not call any other witness with personal knowledge of the alleged
                    demands to testify.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The alleged undue influence exerted by PL</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Quite apart from the deficient pleadings, the
                    plaintiffs’ allegations were not founded on any credible evidence. WML
                    described the quarrel referred to in the plaintiffs’ further and better
                    particulars as having taken place in 2003. He claimed to have received a
                    telephone call from WYC to go to 5CHR, and when he arrived, he inferred from the
                    tense atmosphere that WYC and PL had just quarrelled. Even if I were to accept
                    WML’s word at face value, the problem was that he did not witness the
                    quarrel and had no inkling of what had transpired. PL testified that the quarrel
                    arose because of the stress she experienced from the plaintiffs’
                    unrelenting pursuit of information on her finances. She naturally felt aggrieved
                    at repeated intrusions into her privacy. Her subsequent decision to leave 5CHR
                    that evening to cool down was therefore unrelated to the Transfer. I accepted
                    her explanation. WYCPL was facing financial pressures at that time and that
                    caused the plaintiffs to attempt to identify which of PL’s assets they
                    could take from her if they deemed necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     WML attempted to show that the Transfer was
                    inexplicable by alleging in his AEIC for OS 648 of 2010 that WYC had expressed
                    the intention to always retain 5CHR in his name. But this was contradicted by
                    WYC’s attempts to transfer an interest in 5CHR to PL over the years. It
                    was also contradicted by several notes WYC wrote in 2003. WML, however, claimed
                    that those notes written in 2003 revealed the pressure PL was putting on WYC to
                    transfer 5CHR to her. In cross-examination, WML was forced to admit that none of
                    the notes demonstrated what he asserted at all. They only reflected WYC’s
                    clear intention that PL should have 5CHR at some point in time. In the note
                    dated 19 January 2003 (see above, at <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>), WYC had written that PL “deserve[d]” 5CHR
                    because he was moved by a scene he had witnessed of PL reading to his
                    grandchildren. In another note dated 3 September 2003, WYC penned,
                    “Transfer house through will to Pat + MR. Pat’s worry: if will is
                    ‘changed’ she gets nothing.” WML conceded that this only
                    indicated that PL was worried and did not display any pressure being applied on
                    WYC. WML also agreed that a third note dated 10 September 2003, where WYC
                    had jotted down, “Spoke with ML that I give No. 5 to Pat + Rong.
                    Will effect it on Saturday” did not reveal any pressure exerted by PL. A
                    fourth note dated 20 September 2003 exhibited a rational thought process
                    applied by WYC to deal with his assets and showed that he was capable of making
                    decisions about his affairs in September 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Finally, the plaintiffs also alleged that PL
                    had threatened to leave WYC unless he transferred assets to her. The
                    plaintiffs’ counsel suggested to her, with reference to an e-mail to WMW
                    dated 3 July 2002 (also referred to above, at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>), that she had left Singapore to visit WMW in 2002 to
                    “put pressure” on WYC. In the e-mail, she wrote that she wished to
                    “hop over” to WMW’s place in the United States for “a
                    short while” before returning to live in Singapore on her own. However,
                    the e-mail to WMW did not evince any real intention of PL leaving WYC for good
                    if the circumstances under which it was written were taken into account. PL
                    explained that the e-mail was written in a moment of deep frustration and
                    sadness because she was emotionally drained and had thought that she could no
                    longer put up with the plaintiffs’ high-handed treatment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Her actions subsequent to the e-mail
                    buttressed her explanation. PL did not leave Singapore until two months later.
                    In fact, WYC was supposed to accompany her on that trip to visit WMW, but could
                    not do so because WMC insisted that WYC remained in Singapore to generate
                    revenue for ARHPL. WMS took his place. Eventually, the visit lasted only three
                    weeks. WMS testified that it was originally intended to last three months and
                    was “part of PL’s plan to make a stand against [WYC] in a bid to
                    get him to transfer assets to her.” I rejected the evidence of WMS that
                    PL had an ulterior motive behind this trip apart from that of wishing to visit
                    her son who was studying in the United States. WMS’s allegation was pure
                    speculation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     In fact, substantial parts of WMS’s AEIC
                    were speculative and discussed matters that were not within her personal
                    knowledge as she was based in Australia since 1988, and only returned to
                    Singapore annually for three weeks each time. It also contained highly
                    scandalous and irrelevant allegations on the characters of her father and PL.
                    She was a noticeably partisan witness. The fact that she was called by the
                    plaintiffs merely to be their mouthpiece was accentuated by the language she
                    used in her testimony at trial. Under cross-examination it became apparent that
                    she was coached by the plaintiffs to say what they had prepared for her
                    especially with respect to the issues on the Christmas
                Recommendations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The plaintiffs’ campaign to prevent any interest in 5CHR from
                being transferred to PL</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     The plaintiffs were keenly aware that WYC had
                    always wanted to transfer 5CHR to PL at some point in time. Over the years, they
                    had made many successful efforts to thwart WYC’s attempts to do so. On
                    24 April 2002, WYC sought advice from Tan Yah Piang about the transfer of
                    5CHR to PL and himself as joint tenants. PL accompanied WYC to meetings with Tan
                    Yah Piang for this purpose. She testified that she understood from those
                    meetings that a transfer of 5CHR to a joint tenancy would protect it from the
                    banks in that she would have to be kept informed if the plaintiffs wanted to
                    sell 5CHR to raise funds. A sale of 5CHR was a possibility around that time
                    because WYCPL’s financial health became worrisome through the property
                    investments it had made. PL also testified that whilst 5CHR was originally
                    intended to be bequeathed in WYC’s will, Tan Yah Piang had advised against
                    it because a will could be contested. WYC then gave Tan Yah Piang instructions
                    to transfer 5CHR to PL as a joint tenant. In a letter dated 2 May 2002 to
                    WYC, Tan Yah Piang explained how the right of survivorship operated in a joint
                    tenancy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    But WYC’s plan to transfer 5CHR to PL
                    was derailed in July 2002 because of strenuous objections by the plaintiffs (see
                    above, at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>). On 2 October 2002,
                    another meeting with Tan Yah Piang was held and attended by WYC, PL and the
                    plaintiffs. Again, the plaintiffs objected to the transfer of 5CHR. The
                    plaintiffs’ rude behaviour toward Tan Yah Piang eventually caused him to
                    discharge himself in relation to that matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Sometime in August 2003, WMC approached WYC
                    to provide a personal guarantee for $7.92m in relation to an investment in
                    shop-houses at Tras Street. WYC agreed. Although WYC once again had to postpone
                    the transfer of 5CHR as immense financial liabilities weighed on his mind, he
                    was always certain of executing the instrument once he was financially secure.
                    Eventually, on 25 June 2004, WYCPL entered into an agreement with Medilane
                    Pte Ltd (a wholly-owned subsidiary of PHH), to sell 19 Adam Road at $10.8m. By a
                    deed of guarantee dated 25 June 2004, PHH’s directors guaranteed the
                    due performance of the obligations of Medilane Pte Ltd. Hence, by late 2004, the
                    cloud over WYC’s financial liabilities had largely lifted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Another strategic manoeuvre of the
                    plaintiffs was to plant the fictitious idea in WYC’s mind that PL might
                    leave him once he effected an <em>inter vivos</em> transfer
                    of 5CHR to her. They advised him to carry out any transfer of 5CHR to PL only
                        <em>via</em> his will. WYC’s fears that PL would
                    leave him was documented in several of his handwritten notes around 2002 and
                    2003. PL testified that she had no idea why he would think that. Apart from
                    visiting WMW in the United States in September 2002 which was a trip WYC was
                    supposed to make as well, she had never left WYC – he was the man she
                    loved and around whom her life revolved for decades. I found that it was very
                    likely that WYC expressed worries about PL leaving him only because the
                    plaintiffs had repeatedly made that suggestion to him. There was no proof of
                    PL’s intentions to leave WYC once she obtained 5CHR. In reality, PL did
                    not leave WYC after 5CHR was transferred to her as a joint tenant in December
                    2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Finally, as described earlier at <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a> and <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a>,
                    the plaintiffs also attempted to block WYC’s instructions to Balakrishnan
                    in late 2004 to effect the Transfer, although that ultimately failed. In
                    cross-examination, it was put to WMC that he applied pressure on WYC on how to
                    deal with his assets. WMC’s reply was telling. He said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I---put pressure---or rather I put con---expressed my concerns to my
                        father that when he had dementia and when he did not understand the extent
                        of his liabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was clear to me that WMC was not only putting pressure on WYC on
                    what liabilities to assume but also on how to deal with the latter’s
                    assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Having considered the entire history leading
                    up to the Transfer, which included the plaintiffs’ many strenuous
                    objections to their father, I was of the view that it was implausible that WYC
                    transferred 5CHR to PL out of undue influence. The plaintiffs’ (unpleaded)
                    allegation which they introduced in their opening statement, <em>ie</em> the Transfer was executed under duress, was likewise
                    untenable. No facts had been pleaded or evidence adduced to show the existence
                    of a wrongful or illegitimate threat or pressure by PL that left WYC with no
                    practical alternative but to execute the Transfer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether 5CHR’s joint tenancy should be severed and the property
                sold</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">How should 5CHR’s joint tenancy be dealt with?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    The authority conferred on the plaintiffs as
                    WYC’s deputies was subject to the provisions of the MCA and in particular,
                    s 3 (“the principles”) and s 6 (“best
                    interests”): s 25(5), MCA. Therefore, in deciding what to do with
                    5CHR’s joint tenancy, the plaintiffs must act in WYC’s “best
                    interests”. Section 6 of the MCA provides a checklist of factors which a
                    proxy decision-maker such as a deputy must “consider” or
                    “take into account” without limiting his general duty to consider
                    “all the relevant circumstances” in deciding what was in the best
                    interests of the person.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Deputies are also bound by the Code by
                    virtue of s 41(5), MCA. Paragraph 9.8.9 of the Code stated that deputies
                    must act in good faith, with honesty and integrity; and para 9.8.7 stated
                    that deputies are under a fiduciary duty not to take advantage of their position

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Determining WYC’s best interests</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Sections 6(3) to 6(8) of the MCA specified
                    certain steps which a deputy must take in construing what were in the best
                    interests of the person of which they are deputies. The relevant subsections
                    state:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Best
                        interests</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6. - …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(7) [A deputy] must consider, so far as is reasonably ascertainable

                        wishes and feelings (and, in particular, any relevant written statement made

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>b</em>) the beliefs and values that would be
                        likely to influence his decision if he had capacity; and</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">as to what would be in the person’s best interests and, in
                        particular, as to the matters mentioned in subsection (7).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    On the whole, the concept of best interests
                    as prescribed by the MCA suggests that the proxy decision-makers who are
                    WYC’s deputies in this case, must weigh the relevant factors and the
                    circumstances to arrive at an outcome that maximally promotes the welfare of the
                    incapacitated person. There may be cases where there are conflicting interests
                    that must be balanced against each other. For example, an incapacitated
                    person’s present feelings could be different from his past
                wishes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    The present case was not such a complicated
                    case because there was no evidence that WYC felt any differently in December
                    2004 with respect to how 5CHR should be held as compared to his earlier
                    decision. Hence, I gave much weight to WYC’s expressed intentions in
                    relation to 5CHR while he was still able to decide for himself. If his
                    intentions were for 5CHR to be held as a joint tenancy, then a severance and
                    sale of 5CHR would <em>prima facie</em> not promote his
                    welfare. The plaintiffs must prove that severance was necessary for some
                    legitimate reason, <em>eg</em> that WYC faced a shortage of
                    funds for his medical treatment and there were no alternative sources of funds
                    to meet those needs. Otherwise, the manner of 5CHR’s holding must remain
                    as it is.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">WYC’s expressed intentions with respect to 5CHR</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Transfer</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    In the absence of any invalidating factors,
                    WYC’s execution of the Transfer <em>per se</em> was
                    conclusive evidence of his intentions. Where a property was put in joint tenancy
                    after its owner received legal advice from his solicitor on its effect, that was
                    indicative of the owner’s intention for survivorship to operate in respect
                    of the property: <em>Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye Terence and
                        another</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 at [115]. It was undisputed that WYC had
                    received legal advice on the effects of a joint tenancy from both Tan Yah Piang
                    and Balakrishnan. The Transfer therefore confirmed that WYC had intended for PL
                    to own 5CHR as a joint tenant in his lifetime and solely upon his demise. WYC
                    chose this manner of transfer after he had carefully considered the various ways
                    to give 5CHR to PL, taking into account the plaintiffs’ forceful
                    objections over the years and his own financial security.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The wills of WYC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    WYC had made two wills prior to December
                    2004. One was executed on 11 May 1997 (“the 1997 Will”),
                    which he revised on 27 September 2000 and 27 January 2001. Another was
                    executed on 4 September 2003 (“the 2003 Will”). With respect
                    to 5CHR, the 1997 Will and its revisions provided that it was to go to
                    “my wife Patricia and Meng Rong (Weng).” The 2003 Will provided
                    that 5CHR was to be given to “Patricia Ling Ai Wah and Wong Meng Weng,
                    free of any tax or duty arising in respect of [WYC’s] death, if they
                    survive [WYC] in equal share, absolutely.” Thus, it could not be said
                    that WYC had always wanted to keep 5CHR for himself without making at least one
                    important qualification to that statement – WYC had also consistently
                    wanted a share of 5CHR to be given to PL upon his death.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The revocation of wills in 2003</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    In October 2003, WYC liaised with Tan Yah
                    Piang to execute a new will which provisions were to be substantially the same
                    as those of the 2003 Will. The differences between them pertained to a change of
                    the executor to WYC’s half-brother, Wong Yip Yan, gifts to be given free
                    of estate duty and an inclusion of TKY as a beneficiary of 37GHA in addition to
                    WML and WMK. However, the draft will that Tan Yah Piang prepared, dated
                    16 October 2003, was never executed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Instead, after Dr Chen assessed WYC on
                    23 October 2003 to be of “sound mind &amp; can make rational,
                    coherent decisions” for the purposes of making a will, WML brought WYC to
                    see one Yeoh Lam Hock, a lawyer, on or around 3 November 2003. This was for
                    WYC to revoke his previous wills in the presence of Yeoh Lam Hock and another
                    lawyer Johnny Cheo. There was no evidence before the court on who instructed
                    Yeoh Lam Hock and why the draft will prepared by Tan Yah Piang was never
                    signed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    There was, however, a note which WYC wrote
                    on 1 November 2003, two days before the revocation was carried out, which
                    recorded his plan to “Prepare a Will”. There was also no
                    legitimate reason for WML to bring WYC to Yeoh Lam Hock to have the 2003 Will
                    revoked since the plaintiffs knew from a meeting they attended together with WYC
                    and Tan Yah Piang on 2 October 2003, that WYC had already instructed Tan
                    Yah Piang to draft a new will which he would be executing very
                shortly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Those events led me to believe that the
                    plaintiffs procured the revocation of the 2003 Will as part of their overall
                    plan to obtain 5CHR for themselves. On the one hand, they had attempted to
                    prevent WYC from making an <em>inter vivos</em> transfer of
                    5CHR by taking various measures which included creating the false impression
                    that PL would leave WYC once the property was hers, and that it would be more
                    prudent to bequeath it instead. On the other hand, they forced WYC to revoke the
                    2003 Will and not sign the draft will dated 16 October 2010 which
                    bequeathed 5CHR to PL and WMW.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    The plaintiffs were fully aware that WYC
                    would never bequeath 5CHR to them in the light of his long-held intentions and
                    the association of 5CHR with PL and WMW. Save for time spent overseas, WMW had
                    lived there with his mother since 1981. Therefore, in order to secure 5CHR for
                    themselves, one prong of the plaintiffs’ plan was to have WYC pass away
                    intestate. PL and WMW would not be entitled to any part of WYC’s estate
                    under intestacy laws, and the nature of their relationship with WYC meant that
                    they would not have <em>locus standi</em> to make a claim
                    under the Inheritance (Family Provision) Act (Cap 138, 1985 Rev Ed).
                    The merits of their claim even if they had <em>locus
                        standi</em> would be very weak. The other prong of the
                    plaintiffs’ plan, which had been put into motion in these proceedings, was
                    to challenge WYC’s competence if he made an <em>inter
                        vivos</em> transfer of 5CHR. Both prongs of their plan were
                    encapsulated in a paragraph of their opening statement which claimed
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Plaintiffs were, at the time, unaware that a will had purportedly been
                        executed by WYC in December 2004. As with the Transfer, the
                        Plaintiffs’ position is that WYC did not have sufficient capacity to
                        make the purported will.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Christmas Recommendations </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    The last two documents which recorded
                    WYC’s intentions regarding 5CHR were the 23rd version of the “Wong
                    Yip Chong Christmas Recommendations” dated 24 December 2011
                    (referred to above as “the Christmas Recommendations”) and the
                    will which WYC executed pursuant to it (“the 2004 Will”). They are
                    dealt with in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    The Christmas Recommendations came about in
                    this way. In 2004, WMW who was then based overseas returned to Singapore from 7
                    to 13 May. During this trip, WMC asked WMW to work on a document which was
                    to contain a plenary review of WYC’s assets and liabilities and propose
                    actions to be taken in relation to them. It was contemplated that the drafting
                    of this document would entail discussions among WYC’s immediate family
                    members (<em>ie</em> all of WYC’s children, TKY and
                    PL). Drafts of the document were to be circulated amongst them for review and
                    comment in order to gather unanimous agreement. WMC had asked WMW to work on it
                    on an urgent basis so that the document could be presented to WYC before
                    Christmas. WMC also weighed in on the process to be taken. In an e-mail dated
                    11 May 2004, he wrote to WMW:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear Rong,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When u craft your document, a preamble may be useful. You could say that
                        all five children want to minimise potential discord, especially family
                        member fighting family member over money.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Suggest Step One, u get all 5 children to agree. Then Step Two, for them
                        to get their mothers to agree. Once all 7 agree, it will be easier for Dad
                        to agree. And he deserves the rest of his life, without conflict.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Let us work hard to find a roughly fair type agreement. Please align all
                        our interests rather than against each other.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I pray you succeed and we can go back to enjoying our family’s
                        company without this painful stuff. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Meng Cheong</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Due to the tight schedules of the
                    peripatetic parties, they were unable to complete the document in May 2004. WMC
                    sent WMW another e-mail on 30 November 2004 to remind him of the
                    preparation of the document:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But first we need to agree amongst ourselves (i.e the five siblings),
                        which I think is do-able, as I believe that each of the five just want
                        reasonable fairness and minimal acrimony. After the five of us agree (and we
                        can use my phone to call those who might be in HK [WMK] or in Adelaide
                        [WMS]), and we should try to agree completely unanimously, it will help us
                        do the next step. The next step is to get our mothers to endorse and support
                        our agreement. I believe if we are reasonable to all, this is do-able. Once
                        we have the unanimous agreement of all 5 kids and 2 mothers, we need to get
                        Dad’s agreement. I think that if all are unanimous, and he can see
                        that this outcome will generate least acrimony, Dad’s agreement is
                        do-able. Once we have agreement of ALL 8, the rest is easy implementation by
                        professionals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    WMW finally completed the document in
                    December 2004, when he returned to Singapore for a three-week visit from around
                    8 to 25 December. In total, WMW prepared about 23 versions of the Christmas
                    Recommendations. As was planned, several of the versions were circulated through
                    e-mails to the plaintiffs, WMK and WMS for their review and input from 17 to
                    24 December 2004. All four persons received at least the 17th and 22nd
                    versions of the Christmas Recommendations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    WYC was also apprised of the preparation of
                    the Christmas Recommendations and raised no objection to the process. During its
                    preparation, WMW presented the second version of the Christmas Recommendations
                    to WYC on 18 December 2004 at a dinner. WMW asked WYC what his wishes were
                    and WYC wrote on the document in his own hand, “Good hardworking children
                    with a good dose of social and moral responsibility. May these qualities
                    reverberate through the generations.” On 21 December 2004, WMW
                    informed WMC and WMK that he spent three hours discussing the proposals in the
                    document with WYC and PL that day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    The 23rd version, which was the final
                    version of the document, was signed by WMW and the plaintiffs on
                    24 December 2004 and PL on 7 January 2005. WMK and WMS were not in
                    Singapore during that time, and communicated their approval of its contents to
                    WMW by telephone on 24 December 2004 for him to sign it on their behalf.
                    WMS also sent an e-mail to confirm the same. With respect to TKY, who was
                    residing with WML at 37GHA, WML e-mailed WMW on 7 January 2005 and said,
                    “received Christmas document signed by Pat and my mum has signed”.
                    Contrary to the appearance that unanimous agreement was obtained and recorded,
                    it would later be discovered that TKY’s signature was not on the Christmas
                    Recommendations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    WMW had rushed to complete the Christmas
                    Recommendations and secure the agreement of the concerned parties because WYC
                    was due to travel overseas soon thereafter; WMW himself was due to leave
                    Singapore on 25 December 2004. Further, WMC had told WMW several times that
                    the Christmas Recommendations should be finalised by 22 December 2004. WMW
                    presented the Christmas Recommendations to WYC in the afternoon or early evening
                    of 24 December 2004, with the assurance that there was consensus amongst
                    the family members and that the signatures from TKY and PL would be
                    forthcoming.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    The final version of the Christmas
                    Recommendations assembled a list of WYC’s assets and liabilities,
                    delineated proposals to distribute and discharge them respectively under an
                    “Actions” section and attached a draft of WYC’s revised will
                    which WYC would later execute to become the 2004 Will. The Christmas
                    Recommendations and its various versions consistently stated that 5CHR was to be
                    held in joint tenancy between WYC and PL, with everybody else to disclaim
                    interest in it. WMC had even written an e-mail on 20 December 2004 to state
                    that he preferred WMW to be added as a joint tenant of 5CHR along with
                    PL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    In the Suit, the plaintiffs and their
                    witnesses did a <em>volte face</em> on the Christmas
                    Recommendations. WML affirmed (untruthfully in my view) in his AEIC:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I never considered the Christmas Recommendations to be a legally binding
                        document of any sort. Rather, I believe it was treated by all as a tentative
                        first step towards achieving some family amity for my father’s sake.
                        At most, it was intended to set out the broad outlines for further
                        discussion between PL, WMW, my mother, my siblings and me. … I signed
                        it in the hope that this would be the first step towards family harmony and
                        despite my reservations as to the fairness of the proposals. … I had
                        never really read through any of the drafts circulated by WMW in detail, as
                        I had never considered the Christmas Recommendations to be a legally binding
                        document. … I believe that [TKY] never signed the official
                        transmittal letter [of the Christmas Recommendations]. … I do not
                        remember her signing the document, nor ever having presented it for her
                        signature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In WMC’s AEIC, he agreed fully with WML’s stated position.
                    The plaintiffs and their siblings tried to diminish the importance of the
                    Christmas Recommendations with two main theories: the document was not legally
                    binding and WYC could not understand its contents so as to have adopted
                    them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    The plaintiffs cavilled that the proposals
                    in the Christmas Recommendations were not legally binding because their
                    mother’s signature was absent on the “Official Transmittal
                    Letter” page, which stated “Signatures are not binding unless all
                    other signatures are also present”. But this was a paralogism. The
                    defendants had not asserted that the Christmas Recommendations were a legally
                    binding agreement in the nature of a contract, deed or estoppel. It was apparent
                    that nobody’s legal rights, including WYC’s, would be altered by the
                    document even if it was signed by everybody concerned. It was meant to contain
                    the family members’ proposals to WYC, which WYC could then accept or
                    reject. Hence, those who signed it had agreed with the proposals therein even if
                    others had not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    The plaintiffs’ second theory was that
                    WYC was unable to understand the Christmas Recommendations or act upon it in
                    December 2004 because he was mentally incapacitated. The ancillary aspects of
                    this theory were that the Christmas Recommendations did not make it clear that
                    the Transfer had already been executed; that WYC himself did not even realise
                    that he had executed the Transfer; if WYC had known that he had executed the
                    Transfer, he would not have accepted the Christmas Recommendations. I rejected
                    all those contentions in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    First, for the same reasons as given earlier
                    in relation to the Transfer, WYC comprehended the contents of the Christmas
                    Recommendations. PL also testified that in her discussions with WYC about the
                    Christmas Recommendations, WYC was happy that the issue of 5CHR was resolved,
                    meaning that the property would devolve to her upon his demise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    Second, in the draft revised will attached
                    to the 17th version of the Christmas Recommendations which was received by all
                    of WMW’s half-siblings on 23 December 2004, it was stated that PL was
                    on her way to becoming a registered joint tenant of 5CHR:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The property known as 5 Chancery Hill Road, Singapore 309644, comprised in
                        Lot 1245W of Mukim 17, is held in joint tenancy with Patricia. As a joint
                        tenant, she enjoys the right of survivorship on this property. It is my
                        intention that title should pass to her.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the paperwork involving joint tenancy filed in December 2004 does not
                        succeed, I give her this property free of any tax or duty arising in respect
                        of my death, absolutely.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There was no doubt that by then, the plaintiffs and their two siblings
                    knew that PL was in the process of being registered as a joint tenant of
                    5CHR.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    Third, the argument of the plaintiffs and
                    their witnesses that they treated the Christmas Recommendations as a mere
                    prefatory step to achieving family harmony was refuted by the effort they
                    themselves had invested in its drafting process. At the time it was prepared by
                    WMW, WMC purportedly wanted to use the Christmas Recommendations to definitively
                    resolve the tussles over WYC’s assets. Likewise, their claim that they did
                    not know that the Transfer had already been executed because they did not take
                    the Christmas Recommendations seriously and had not looked at the numerous
                    versions of the document sent by WMW was farcical.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    WMS initially said that she had only given
                    her “cursory approval” of the Christmas Recommendations. Under
                    cross-examination, it was shown that she had gone through the document
                    carefully, informed WMW of possible typographical errors, made specific
                    suggestions to its contents, and even provided details of her children to enable
                    WMW to draft the revised will that was annexed to the Christmas Recommendations.
                    In an e-mail to WMW on 24 December 2004, she also acknowledged that 5CHR
                    had always been PL’s home.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    WMK claimed that he did not know that some
                    of the items in the Actions section were going to be implemented by way of
                    testamentary disposition. His lie was quickly exposed. Item 10 of the Actions
                    section expressly stated that WYC would be signing another will. WMK had also
                    actively corresponded with WMW through e-mail regarding this revised
                    will:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_132-p2_i"></a>(i)     on 21 December 2004, in
                        response to WMW’s call for comments on the “proposed new
                        will”, WMK asked “why the difference in wycpl % under action
                        cf will”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_132-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     on 23 December 2004, WMK provided his children’s
                        particulars to WMW to prepare the revised will in an e-mail titled
                        “Re: drafting dad’s will”; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_132-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     on that same day, WMK responded
                        to WMW’s request for him to review the Actions section of the
                        Christmas Recommendations and the proposed revised will. WMK added that he
                        was “glad to be substitute executor”!</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Confronted with this evidence, WMK conceded that he knew all along that one of
                    the objectives of the Christmas Recommendations was to help WYC to execute a
                    revised will.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    WMK also admitted that he had read the 17th
                    version of the Christmas Recommendations and that the commitment to have 5CHR
                    and the relevant paperwork effecting the Transfer completed sometime in December
                    2004 was stated therein. Despite giving comments to various versions of the
                    Christmas Recommendations, WMK never once wrote an e-mail to say that 5CHR
                    should not be held in joint tenancy between WYC and PL. He was unable to give an
                    intelligible answer as to why he did not object to 5CHR being held in joint
                    tenancy in December 2004 but was objecting to the Transfer in these proceedings.
                    I found that WMK’s attempts in the Suit to distance himself from his
                    agreement to the Christmas Recommendations’ proposals in December 2004 to
                    be wholly indefensible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    It was patently clear that TKY’s
                    children were now attempting to renege on their agreement to certain proposals
                    in the Christmas Recommendations. Every member of WYC’s family had
                    actually been provided for by the proposals, but the plaintiffs were now
                    objecting to items in the Actions section which only benefited PL. For example,
                    the children benefited from, among others, WYC’s shares in WYCPL and
                    investment companies. TKY was to receive a share of 37GHA. The plaintiffs
                    readily executed those other proposals in the Christmas Recommendations. On
                    7 January 2005, one Foo Siew Shan who was an accountant at WYCPL wrote an
                    e-mail to WYC’s children and PL in which she stated that WMW had requested
                    that she prepare paperwork to transfer ownership of all investment companies
                    from the family members to WYCPL pursuant to item 7 in the Actions section. None
                    of the children responded to this e-mail to inform Foo Siew Shan that they had
                    not agreed to the Christmas Recommendations. On 11 April 2005, WMK e-mailed
                    the plaintiffs and the defendants and opined that to reduce financial risks to
                    WYC, “we need to fully implement the Christmas
                agreement”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    The current cherry-picking of the proposals
                    invariably called into question the plaintiffs’ motives for causing the
                    Christmas Recommendations to be prepared. WMW had been tasked to labour over an
                    impossible task of aligning agendas he never knew existed, for the document was
                    likely to be nothing more than the plaintiffs’ ruse to reap WYC’s
                    assets for themselves with the least resistance. They had led the defendants and
                    WYC to believe that everyone concerned was satisfied with the document’s
                    proposals and bided their time till WYC could not speak for himself before
                    carrying out the latter part of their hidden agenda, which was to claw back what
                    had been given to PL. Although we did not hear from TKY the reasons for her not
                    signing the document as she chose not to appear in Court (despite the Court
                    being earlier informed by her counsel that she was well), the plaintiffs were
                    likely to have had manipulated their own mother to act as a safeguard against
                    the implementation of all of the Christmas Recommendations’ proposals.
                    They had either not informed her of the document or prevented her from signing
                    it. This inference could be drawn from WML’s inability to give a cogent
                    reason why he told WMW that TKY had signed it despite her not having done so.
                    WML also could not offer a reason why TKY, who lived with him, did not sign it.
                    Throughout the drafting process, WML had also not told WMW that TKY objected to
                    any of the proposals in the document although he well knew that WMW relied on
                    him to communicate the proposals to his mother.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The 2004 Will</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    On the same day WYC received the Christmas
                    Recommendations, he executed the draft will that was annexed to it which became
                    the 2004 Will. In the light of my findings regarding the plaintiffs’
                    extensive involvement in preparing the Christmas Recommendations, I rejected
                    WMC’s claim that he was unaware that WYC executed the 2004 Will pursuant
                    to the Christmas Recommendations and that he only saw the 2004 Will after the
                    commencement of these proceedings. His feigned ignorance was another step in the
                    plaintiffs’ plan to ensure WYC died intestate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    The 2004 Will explicitly acknowledged that
                    5CHR was held in joint tenancy with PL and its title should pass to PL by the
                    operation of survivorship. Balakrishnan and one Jessica Lirazan, who was
                    WYC’s long-time domestic helper, witnessed WYC’s execution of this
                    will. Balakrishnan testified (and Jessica Lirazan corroborated) that WYC was his
                    usual self on the day he executed the 2004 Will.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">WYC’s needs </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    The plaintiffs prayed for a sale of 5CHR if
                    the Court ordered that its joint tenancy be severed so that the sale proceeds
                    could be applied towards WYC’s maintenance and upkeep. The plaintiffs
                    asserted that such a course of action was necessary because WYC’s cash
                    reserves were depleted and his medical expenses were mounting. At the trial,
                    they confirmed that to be the only pleaded basis for a severance and sale of
                    5CHR.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Other available sources of funds to meet WYC’s needs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    It was not difficult to see through the
                    plaintiffs’ charade of beneficence. Not only did WYC have other sources of
                    funds which he could have drawn upon but for the plaintiffs’ actions, the
                    plaintiffs had also not attempted to monetise any of WYC’s unencumbered
                    assets. This refuted their claim that WYC needed cash urgently. For example, at
                    the hearing on 1 February 2011 of the plaintiffs’ application for a
                    declaration that their statutory declaration to sever 5CHR’s joint tenancy
                    be declared valid, the option of mortgaging 37GHA was put forth. WMW also
                    suggested this alternative to the plaintiffs at meetings of the CPE. However,
                    even at the trial, the plaintiffs had not considered mortgaging 37GHA to raise
                    funds for WYC’s upkeep. WYC owned 37GHA solely and funds could have been
                    more readily obtained by mortgaging the property than to seek a severance and
                    sale of 5CHR.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Plaintiffs’ plan to starve WYC of liquidity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    The evidence established that WYC’s
                    other sources of funds were wrongfully withheld or withdrawn from his estate by
                    the plaintiffs. I found that the plaintiffs had done all this either to directly
                    benefit themselves or to contrive an excuse to target PL’s
                    properties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Improperly withdrawing monies from WYC’s estate: the Synapse
                Order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    On 14 December 2006, the CPE obtained
                    the Synapse Order which caused a sum of about $1m (“the sum”) to
                    be paid from WYC’s estate to WMC. This application was made on WMC’s
                    allegation that a sum of $1,151,105.20 had previously been lent to WYC by
                    himself and TKY, the shareholders of Synapse. I need not enter into the merits
                    of WMC’s allegation in this decision. It sufficed to set out the
                    procedural flaws in the process of obtaining the Synapse Order which justified
                    setting it aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    First, whilst the relevant summons
                        (<em>ie</em> Summons No 5378 of 2006) had prayed for
                    $1,220,000 to be paid to WMC and TKY, the Synapse Order was for $1,060,105.20 to
                    be paid to WMC alone. Eventually, a slightly lower amount constituting the sum
                    was paid out. WML was unable to give an acceptable explanation for the
                    discrepancy between the wording of the Summons and the resultant Order. He
                    merely said that TKY did not ask for the money. This suggested that WML did not
                    examine the merits of the application at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    Secondly, contrary to what WMC claimed in
                    his AEIC, it turned out that he did not furnish all the material facts to the
                    other CPE members regarding his alleged loan before he made the application.
                    WML’s testimony disclosed that in 2006, the CPE had not conducted any
                    proper investigation into WMC’s claim and had only relied on WMC’s
                    representations and some casual discussions with the family, excluding PL.
                    WMW’s attempts to investigate the issue failed. On 30 March 2006, he
                    e-mailed WMC (with WML and WMK as co-addresses) to seek the plaintiffs’
                    confirmation that the alleged loan was undocumented. WMW further stated that if
                    the loan agreements were oral, the CPE could document the terms of those
                    agreements and ratify them. WMC replied that there were no loan documents, but
                    he did not say that there was an oral loan agreement. WMC admitted that he did
                    not answer WMW’s query. However, WMC claimed that he had answered most of
                    WMW’s questions verbally. The transcripts of a meeting of the CPE on
                    16 April 2011 showed that this was highly improbable. At this meeting held
                    more than four years after the Synapse Order was made, WMW revived the issue and
                    pointedly asked WMC whether WYC had understood that he had to repay that alleged
                    loan. WMC refused to give a direct answer to that question. Instead, he launched
                    into a tirade on his relationship with WMW. When WMW pressed for an answer, WMC
                    evaded the question again, although he incriminatingly remarked to WMW that
                    “this is one little blip”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    Thirdly, because the CPE failed to ascertain
                    the material facts which surrounded the alleged loan to WYC, the Court was not
                    provided with a full and frank disclosure of the facts when the application was
                    heard and allowed. At the trial, the plaintiffs emphasised that the application
                    was made pursuant to a unanimous decision of the CPE. Indeed, at the time of the
                    application, WML, WMW and WMK had filed affidavits to confirm that they did not
                    object to the CPE’s proposal to repay the sum to WMC. But this unanimity
                    was irrelevant to the issue of whether there was full and frank disclosure.
                    Apart from WMC, none of them had personal knowledge of the particulars of the
                    alleged loan. Numerous documents which were relevant to the issue were not
                    exhibited in affidavits filed in Court. Significantly, the application was not
                    served on PL even though WMC knew that she had personal knowledge about the
                    workings of Synapse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    On 6 March 2008, PL’s solicitors
                    wrote to the plaintiffs’ solicitors to ask the CPE to apply to set aside
                    the Synapse Order because she discovered that WMC’s affidavits filed for
                    the application had contained material inaccuracies. There was no response to
                    this letter. WMC was also given many opportunities while he was on the stand to
                    agree to the setting aside of the Synapse Order and the immediate return of the
                    monies he had received thereunder for WYC’s use. He declined to do so.
                    However, after WMC’s initial refusal to budge, the plaintiffs changed
                    their minds and agreed to have the Synapse Order set aside and to return the sum
                    to WYC when the trial concluded on 5 August 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    The return of the sum by WMC would go a long
                    way towards paying for WYC’s medical expenses and other needs. It would
                    also restore WYC’s liquidity status to levels as envisaged by the
                    Christmas Recommendations. As WMK conceded, item 11 of the Actions section
                    clearly stated that a then existing sum of approximately $1m in WYC’s cash
                    accounts was to remain as a cash reserve for WYC’s peace of mind and to
                    meet emergency expenses. Stipulated therein was also a process to be followed
                    before those funds may be paid out. It was therefore reprehensible of WMC to
                    procure a payment of this very sum to himself in disregard of the family’s
                    agreement, on top of failing to prove his entitlement to the
                Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Reclassifying a $3.7 million debt owed to WYC by WYCPL</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    Since 1999, an amount of about $4m had been
                    recorded in the accounts of WYCPL as a loan owing to WYC from the company. In
                    2008, the plaintiffs as directors and shareholders of WYCPL caused this loan to
                    be reduced to $3.7m on the basis that WYC had earlier borrowed $300,000 from
                    TKY. (This $3.7m loan due to WYC is hereafter referred to as “the
                    Loan”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    At the trial, the plaintiffs were shown
                    WYCPL’s financial statements for the years 2007 to 2010 which they had
                    signed and which recorded the Loan as owing to WYC alone. On or about
                    29 April 2010, the plaintiffs acting as a majority of the board of WYCPL
                    instructed WYCPL’s accountant Phoebe Sim, to reclassify the Loan as owing
                    to both WYC and TKY. WMC also instructed Phoebe Sim in an e-mail that same day
                    not to entertain any requests to apportion the sum between WYC and TKY. He
                    claimed that the sum was part of a legally indivisible matrimonial estate. This
                    invented justification to Phoebe Sim was bizarre and is unacceptable. It also
                    contradicted the underlying basis of reducing the Loan by $300,000 in
                    2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    The plaintiffs justified the
                    reclassification by arguing that monies for the Loan had come from a bank
                    account held jointly by WYC and TKY. In WMC’s AEIC, he exhibited a letter
                    dated 1 March 2010, ostensibly written by his mother, addressed to WYCPL to
                    request the Loan to be reclassified. A cursory examination of the letter’s
                    contents alone showed that the amounts which were stated as having been paid
                    from WYC and TKY’s joint POSB current account no XXX-XXXXX-X (“the
                    POSB current account”) did not add up to $3.7m. Yet, the plaintiffs and
                    WMK agreed to reclassify the Loan, while WMW objected. Apart from the letter of
                    1 March 2010, the plaintiffs sought to rely on bank statements of the POSB
                    current account and some e-mails between the directors of WYCPL, who were then
                    the plaintiffs, WMK and WMW.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    There was no valid basis for the
                    reclassification. First, WMC was the mastermind of the 1 March 2010 letter,
                    not TKY. WML admitted that WMC “played some part in the construction of
                    the phrasing” and “helped in the execution” of the letter.
                    WMC himself confirmed that he had helped to draft the letter in February 2010.
                    Under intense cross-examination, he twice referred to the letter as “my
                    letter”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    Secondly, the origin of the funds was
                    conclusively demonstrated to be WYC’s sole POSB personal account no
                    XXX-XXXXX-X (“WYC’s personal POSB account”), which meant
                    that he was the beneficial owner of the funds that were used to advance the
                    Loan. The POSB current account was merely a current account with a zero balance.
                    Shortly after a cheque was drawn on the POSB current account to reduce its
                    balance to a negative value, there would be a corresponding deposit of funds
                    from WYC’s personal POSB account to restore the POSB current
                    account’s balance to nil.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    WMC claimed that he was unsure of the origin
                    of the funds that were used to maintain the zero balance of the POSB current
                    account because PL had withheld WYC’s banking documents from the CPE. He
                    also claimed that he did not instruct WYCPL’s accountant to investigate
                    the origin of those funds. I disbelieved him. As I had observed during the
                    trial, in a bank document which WMC had exhibited in his AEIC to prove a payment
                    of $2m from the POSB current account on 30 August 2000, it was clearly
                    identified that WYC’s personal POSB account was the source of these
                    monies. WMC’s reply was that he did not have the documents relating to
                    WYC’s personal POSB account in order to confirm that it was the source.
                    That again was an untruth. The plaintiffs themselves had disclosed excerpts from
                    the passbooks of WYC’s personal POSB account which showed that the
                    following monies came from that account:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_152-p2_i"></a>(i)     $2m lent on 4 February
                        1999;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_152-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     $500,000 lent on 10 April 1999;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_152-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     $2m lent on 30 August 2000;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_152-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     $150,000
                        lent on 19 February 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Moreover, on
                    20 February 2004, WMC signed a confirmation that a cheque no 805733 for
                    $150,000 was a loan from WYC to WYCPL. An OCBC Bank deposit slip for that sum of
                    $150,000 also recorded it as a “[Transfer] from Dr WYC”. The
                    documents were in the plaintiffs’ possession since 2006. Furthermore, the
                    words “Loan to Wong Yip Chong Pte Ltd” had been annotated against
                    the entries in the passbooks of WYC’s personal POSB account regarding the
                    transfer of the monies on 10 April 1999 and 30 August 2000 to the POSB
                    current account for the loan to WYCPL. Confronted with the documents, WMC
                    asserted that the documents had been kept with his accountants. This was another
                    prevarication. He had in fact relied on the very same page of the passbook of
                    WYC’s personal POSB account (which reflected the transfer of $2m to the
                    POSB current account on 4 February 1999) to support the application for the
                    Synapse Order in 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    WMC’s last-ditch attempt at justifying
                    the reclassification was that from an accounting perspective, the origin of the
                    funds was irrelevant. He argued that the Loan could be reclassified as long as
                    the monies were transferred to WYCPL from the POSB current account. But WMC is
                    no accountant. Phoebe Sim, WYCPL’s accountant who had carried out the
                    reclassification on the plaintiffs’ instructions, testified that she did
                    not think it would necessarily be accurate or correct from an accounting
                    perspective to ignore the source documents for the monies constituting the Loan.
                    She also testified that if she had seen the excerpts of the passbooks of
                    WYC’s personal POSB account which showed that the Loan originated
                    therefrom, she would not have reclassified it without
                clarification.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    Thirdly, this reclassification was a
                    manoeuvre to put the monies out of WYC’s reach to enable the plaintiffs to
                    target 5CHR and the Draycott Property as properties which needed to be sold to
                    raise funds for WYC’s maintenance. Just two weeks after WYCPL received the
                    letter of 1 March 2010, the CPE filed an application to obtain the 2010
                    Order. The plaintiffs did not disclose to the Court in that application, which
                    was to seek a power to sell WYC’s properties, that the Loan was owing to
                    WYC and an issue of its reclassification had cropped up.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    The plaintiffs had repeatedly wrongfully
                    rebuffed WMW’s attempts to get the Loan repaid. Whenever WMW brought up
                    the subject, the plaintiffs deliberately gave him nonsensical responses. WML
                    admitted that WMC was trying to stonewall WMW, and he did nothing. At the time
                    of the trial, no request had been made by the CPE to WYCPL to seek repayment of
                    the $3.7m to WYC. At a meeting of the CPE on 17 February 2011, WMW asked
                    WMC to look into this issue. WMW received a ludicrous response – WMC
                    replied that it was inappropriate for him (<em>ie</em> WMC)
                    to look into the matter because he was only one of four directors of WYCPL. WML
                    gave an equally absurd response. He said, “You go and ask my mother,
                    right, to go and return things while you protect your mother’s assets. Go,
                    go. I suggest this! That he be tasked to spearhead a subcommittee to go and ask
                    Mrs Wong to return assets. Would you do that?” At another meeting on
                    20 April 2011, WMW suggested “squeezing out” $100,000 of the
                    $3.7m to meet WYC’s immediate needs. The plaintiffs rejected this
                    proposition, saying that it would “favour the mistress”. When WMW
                    mentioned that he would like to approach TKY as WYC’s deputy and ask for
                    her permission to disburse some of the $3.7m, WMC informed WMW that he would
                    advise his mother not to do so. Subsequently, WMW’s solicitors wrote to
                    TKY’s solicitors on 29 April 2011 to request that TKY authorise the
                    repayment of $200,000 to WYC out of the reclassified loan. This request went
                    unanswered. A further request on 13 May 2011 met with
                silence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    On 10 May 2011, WMW wrote to the
                    plaintiffs to request a board meeting to be held at short notice before
                    14 May 2011 to consider and approve a repayment of $200,000 out of the Loan
                    to WYC from WYCPL to meet WYC’s immediate needs. The plaintiffs brushed
                    off WMW’s suggestions at a meeting of the CPE that same day. WML
                    commented, “So you want my mom to…you want to call the board of
                    directors to go and release money back to the thing, whereas at the same time
                    the house and all that are reserved for your mom?” When counsel for the
                    first defendant asked WML if he had ever considered bringing the issue of the
                    reclassification of the Loan to Court, WML said that the reclassification was
                    raised as a “rebuttal” to WMW’s opinion that the Loan should
                    be repaid to WYC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    WMW had also asked for the repayment of the
                    Loan to WYC years before the reclassification took place. For example, in a
                    meeting of the CPE on 6 November 2008, WMW’s minutes recorded that
                    WMC would allow funds to come out of WYCPL “over [his] dead body”
                    unless PL agreed to make payment for her share in 5CHR and the Draycott
                    Property. In another meeting of the CPE on 23 April 2008, TKY’s claim
                    to a proportion of the $3.7m was discussed. WMW requested a copy of TKY’s
                    claim to be made in writing and wanted to bring it to the Court’s
                    attention. However, WMC was against it as he thought it would “open up a
                    whole can of worms”. Such conduct was clear evidence that the plaintiffs
                    applied irrelevant considerations when they refused to accept WMW’s
                    legitimate requests to repay the Loan. The plaintiffs had never denied that
                    WYCPL was able to repay the Loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    The plaintiffs’ actions also evinced
                    an utter disregard for their father’s well-being. In order to maintain the
                    excuse to target PL’s properties, WMC was unwilling to consent to have
                    even $3,000 of the Loan monies repaid to WYC. They chose to jeopardise their
                    father’s life instead of acceding to or considering requests that funds
                    which belonged to WYC be released from WYCPL. On 20 April 2011, WYC was
                    initially refused admission into the intensive care unit at the Accident and
                    Emergency department of a private hospital despite being in a serious condition,
                    because his medical bills were unpaid. The plaintiffs’ game of
                    brinkmanship was iniquitous.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Writing off directors’ fees due to WYC from various
                individuals</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    WMW had testified that the accounts of
                    WYC’s estate showed that a sum of $595,000 was due to WYC for
                    director’s fees that were being held by others. This allegedly arose from
                    a family arrangement whereby all directors’ fees paid to WYC’s
                    family members were supposed to be returned to WYC. There was evidence that WYC
                    would even reimburse his sons for the extra income tax they incurred because of
                    the fees they received on his behalf. Whether those director’s fees should
                    be called in was discussed at a meeting of the CPE on 6 January 2011.
                    According to WMW, WMC asked Phoebe Sim to write off all such fees that may be
                    due to WYC with WML’s concurrence. The unsigned draft minutes of this
                    meeting contained a paragraph which said: “Directors fees – owing
                    by Mrs Wong ($310k)?, wml ($50k)?, wmk ($235k)? PS [Phoebe Sim] informed
                    the [CPE] Finance will not include the above amount in Dr WYC’s
                    statement of affairs as Finance has no documentation to support it though it was
                    reflected in WYC accounts as maintained by previous book-keeper.” The
                    signed version of those minutes omitted that paragraph. I found that the
                    insouciant manner in which the plaintiffs wrote off the sum of $595,000 without
                    investigating whether WYC had a valid claim against TKY, WMK and WML for its
                    repayment to be against the interests of WYC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Voting against WYC’s participation in a share buyback
                scheme</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    WYC was entitled to participate in a share
                    buyback scheme in WYCPL in February 2010. Had he participated in it, he would
                    have received at least $70,000 as of the date of the trial. During the meeting
                    of the CPE on 8 February 2010, WMW voted for WYC to participate in the
                    scheme, but he was outvoted by the plaintiffs. The minutes of the meeting
                    revealed that there was only $10,132 left in WYC’s cash account at that
                    point, and the CPE had to lend monies to WYC’s estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    The only reason that WMC stated in his AEIC
                    for the way he voted was the existence of an alleged verbal agreement that had
                    been reached with PL to sell the Draycott Property for funds to maintain WYC. I
                    found that there was no such agreement and the plaintiffs themselves did not
                    believe that there was such an agreement. WMC admitted that he had not even
                    heard personally from PL about the proposed sale of the Draycott Property. The
                    minutes of the CPE’s meeting on 8 February 2010 also showed that they
                    already faced difficulties obtaining from PL a copy of the tenancy agreement of
                    the Draycott Property. On 22 and 23 February 2010, PL’s solicitors
                    wrote to the plaintiffs’ solicitors to highlight that the CPE was not
                    authorised to sell “any property”. It was evident to the
                    plaintiffs by then that PL was not agreeable to sell the Draycott Property. Yet,
                    the plaintiffs did not revisit the share buyback scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">What was the real reason behind the plaintiffs’ attempts to
                sever 5CHR’s joint tenancy?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    I had held that the statutory declaration to
                    sever 5CHR’s joint tenancy was invalid because it was not in WYC’s
                    best interests to have 5CHR’s joint tenancy severed. It was also wrong for
                    the plaintiffs to execute the statutory declaration and file an urgent
                    application to have it declared valid in December 2010 for another reason. On
                    2 July 2010, the plaintiffs had already commenced the present proceedings
                    by way of OS 648 of 2010 (which was converted into the Suit on 11 August
                    2010). The plaintiffs knew full well that the severance and sale of 5CHR was a
                    live issue in the Suit which needed to be ventilated at trial. I surmised that
                    their statutory declaration and the related application were made to steal a
                    march on PL and to circumvent a full hearing on the issue. Any urgent need for
                    funds to maintain WYC, which was what allegedly motivated the plaintiffs to
                    issue the statutory declaration, was deliberately engineered by
                them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Plaintiffs’ selfish motives</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    It was also clear to me that the
                    plaintiffs’ real reasons for seeking a severance and sale of 5CHR were not
                    to benefit WYC at all. They were also not trying to safeguard his or TKY’s
                    interests. Their actions were aimed at increasing their share of what they felt
                    was a potentially large inheritance. And if that could not be achieved, they
                    wished to deprive PL of her properties by selling them. Such actions were
                    egregious breaches of paras 9.8.7 and 9.8.9 of the Code (see above, at
                        <a href="#p1_106">[106]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    A recording of the CPE meeting of
                    28 February 2011 which WMW obtained, and which accuracy was undisputed,
                    reflected those were the plaintiffs’ intentions:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[WMC]: We haven’t started our CoP meeting. So we are about to start
                        when Phoebe comes in. But we are not yet in the CoP meeting. I’m going
                        to make one comment. The way things are going to go, you are going to be the
                        richest inheritor by far of all the children. That’s mathematic. You
                        know, if let’s say 5CHR goes to your mother, at $1,500 psf,
                        that’s $12M headed to you. If 37GHA goes to Mrs Wong, and she has
                        four children (called Meng Cheong, Mei Sheong, Meng Leong, and Meng Kong),
                        maybe one a quarter of that goes to them, and if Draycott goes somewhere or
                        the other, at least half to Patricia Ling and half to Dr Wong, then
                        Rong [<em>ie</em> WMW], your bounty in this, your
                        inheritance, is much more than any of your siblings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">WMC admitted during cross-examination that the above passage
                    demonstrated that he was looking to inherit some part of 37GHA from his mother.
                    WMW testified that the plaintiffs saw their mother, TKY, as a
                    “conduit” through which they and their own families and children
                    would inherit assets. They wanted 5CHR and the Draycott Property because those
                    properties were not going to TKY or themselves upon WYC’s death. I
                    accepted WMW’s testimony as an accurate description of the state of
                    affairs – WMC had treated WYC “as the source of all the family
                    funds and the two wives as the conduits through which the bounty would
                    eventually flow to the next generation and it was foremost in his mind to
                    calculate the inheritance that would flow to him and to the other
                    siblings.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">WYC had always treated and provided for all his loved ones
                fairly</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    At the trial, the plaintiffs attempted to
                    characterise PL pejoratively and continually described her as the
                    “mistress” who had “overreached” by taking more than
                    she deserved. The plaintiffs asserted that PL had “designed certain
                    transfers to her … beyond [WYC’s] intentions”. This was far
                    removed from the truth. The two properties which the plaintiffs had set their
                    sights on were the only properties which PL held jointly with WYC. The
                    backgrounds to those properties were innocuous – 5CHR was PL’s
                    “matrimonial” home with WYC for more than three decades, whilst
                    the Draycott Property was her investment property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    In the course of his testimony, WMC preached
                    the themes of “fairness” and “equity” in supposed
                    contradistinction to how PL had gradually acquired more than she deserved and
                    supplanted WYC’s other family members. WMC’s speeches on this issue
                    were empty rhetoric. The evidence showed that WYC had made adequate provisions
                    for TKY and her children. WYC ensured that TKY was well maintained and would
                    always have a home at 37GHA as evidenced in all the wills he made. He had also
                    given her an apartment at Novena Ville (which she chose to sell according to
                    PL). He had even resisted giving PL an interest in 5CHR originally, out of
                    respect for TKY and her family. And to equalise PL’s subsequent
                    acquisition of an interest in 5CHR, WYC gave a share of 37GHA to TKY in the 2004
                    Will.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    WYC also helped TKY’s children to
                    finance their private property purchases. He gave WMS an apartment in Paris. WMC
                    received a house a stone’s throw away from 5CHR at Padang Chancery, as
                    well as monies to purchase an apartment in New York. WYC also agreed to give WMC
                    one-third of all profits in respect of WYCPL’s shop-house investments.
                    Further, pursuant to the Christmas Recommendations’ proposals, some of
                    which were implemented by the 2004 Will, all of WYC’s shares in the
                    shop-house investments were transferred to WYCPL. This was followed by a
                    reduction of WYC’s shareholding in WYCPL from 90% to 15% by a
                    redistribution of his shares to his children. This transfer of 75% of
                    WYCPL’s shareholdings to his children for $47,000 was in substance a gift
                    because WYCPL had a net asset value of over $50m. PL had received none of those
                    shares because she turned them down. Having regard to the full picture, it was
                    disingenuous for the plaintiffs to claim that WYC would not have wanted 5CHR to
                    devolve to PL through survivorship because he would have wanted a fairer
                    distribution of his assets. The plaintiffs’ argument only manifested
                    animus or avarice or a mixture of both. It would be the most unkindest cut of
                        all<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> if the plaintiffs were allowed to
                    sever 5CHR’s joint tenancy on their father’s behalf when their
                    motives for doing so were <em>mala fide</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether PL was the sole beneficial owner of the Draycott
                Property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    I found that PL was the sole beneficial
                    owner of the Draycott Property and granted her prayer for a declaration of the
                    same. First, the funds that were used to purchase the Draycott Property could be
                    traced back to a gift of money in a POSB joint account, XXX-XXXXX-X (“the
                    POSB joint account”), which WYC opened with PL in 1982. Although the
                    account was in their joint names, WYC had gifted the monies in it totalling
                    $200,000 to PL to help her build up an investment portfolio for her own
                    financial security. The first property she purchased was at Angullia Park
                    (“the Angullia Park Property”) which she sold to purchase a
                    property at Four Seasons Park (“the Four Seasons Property”). Part
                    of the sale proceeds of the Four Seasons Property were then used to purchase the
                    Draycott Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    PL’s account was supported by
                    documentary evidence. On or about 23 March 1983, PL purchased the Angullia
                    Park Property using funds from the POSB joint account and a bank loan. PL
                    testified that she included WYC’s name on the title deed so that if
                    anything untoward happened to her, WYC would be able to take over the property
                    and hold it for WMW who was then a young child. I accepted her testimony that
                    she was unconcerned about the manner of the legal title of the property at that
                    point in time and she did not know the difference between a joint tenancy and a
                    tenancy-in-common. The Angullia Park Property was sold in 1991 and the sale
                    proceeds went towards purchasing the Four Seasons Property. She continued with
                    the practice of holding the property in two names although she could not
                    remember if it was in joint tenancy or tenancy-in-common as it was immaterial to
                    her. PL testified that WYC had always recognised her sole beneficial ownership
                    of the Four Seasons Property. The Four Seasons Property was sold in 1994 and the
                    sale proceeds belonged to her solely. In December 1994, PL purchased the
                    Draycott Property. She chose to fund this purchase from the Four Seasons
                    Property’s sale and a housing loan. Following her established practice,
                    she put the legal title of the property in a tenancy-in-common with WYC. PL
                    retained its beneficial ownership solely.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    Secondly, PL had managed all the aspects of
                    the investments, the tenancy agreements and the sale and purchase of the series
                    of properties. Balakrishnan testified that when he acted in the sale of the
                    Angullia Park Property, he was acting only for PL, and WYC was not involved at
                    all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    Thirdly, consistent with the common
                    intention that PL had sole beneficial ownership of the Draycott Property, she
                    received all the rental income accruing therefrom since the time of its purchase
                    to date. She was also entitled to the rental proceeds arising from the previous
                    properties. For example, her entitlement to all rental proceeds arising from the
                    Angullia Park Property was communicated to the Inland Revenue Authority of
                    Singapore (“IRAS”) by way of letter dated 4 April 1984, in
                    which she informed the authorities that although the property was held in joint
                    names, she was the person who paid fully for the property. She explained that
                    half of the rental income accruing from the Draycott Property was later reported
                    in WYC’s income tax forms only because this was a requirement prescribed
                    by the IRAS. PL also incurred almost all of the expenses relating to the
                    maintenance and upkeep of the Draycott Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    Fourthly, the tenancy-in-common of the
                    Draycott Property was transferred to a joint tenancy in February 2002 on the
                    advice of Tan Yah Piang to protect PL’s sole beneficial ownership of the
                    property. At that time, there was a prospect that the plaintiffs were going to
                    mortgage the property to raise monies for investments. Prior to the threat of
                    this occurrence, PL had not concerned herself with legal terminologies and did
                    not care if the properties in her chain of investments leading to the purchase
                    of the Draycott Property were held in joint tenancies or tenancies-in-common. In
                    those premises, I declared the statutory declaration the plaintiffs had filed on
                    30 November 2010 to change the manner of holding the Draycott Property to
                    be invalid and of no effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">What did the plaintiffs’ attempt to sever the Draycott
                Property’s joint tenancy show of their motives?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    I needed to address the issue of the
                    plaintiffs’ attempted severance of the Draycott Property’s joint
                    tenancy despite holding that the property was beneficially solely-owned by PL
                    because it was relevant to the plaintiffs’ conduct as WYC’s
                    deputies. The plaintiffs had failed to show any valid basis for trying to sever
                    this joint tenancy. Hence, even if I was wrong and the Draycott Property was not
                    solely beneficially owned by PL, its joint tenancy should not be
                severed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    The plaintiffs did not cite any reason in
                    their pleadings or AEICs for trying to sever the Draycott Property’s joint
                    tenancy in November 2010. At the trial, the plaintiffs gave two explanations for
                    their decision. The first was to raise funds for WYC. For the same reasons
                    stated above in relation to why a severance of 5CHR’s joint tenancy was
                    not required to raise funds for WYC, I rejected this ground without
                more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    The second explanation was that the
                    plaintiffs were unable to obtain WYC’s alleged share of the rental
                    proceeds derived from the Draycott Property. Not only was this not pleaded as
                    part of the plaintiffs’ case, PL had also shown that she was the
                    beneficial owner of the property and was therefore entitled to all its rental
                    proceeds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    Further, it would be inconsistent with
                    WYC’s intentions to sever the Draycott Property’s joint tenancy over
                    issues about its rental proceeds. By way of an e-mail dated 6 June 2006,
                    Foo Siew Shan who was WYC’s accountant informed the CPE that WYC had
                    called her that afternoon to instruct her not to include the Draycott
                    Property’s rental income in his estate’s portfolio. Foo Siew Shan
                    also wrote that WYC had “stressed that these rental income are meant for
                    Ms Ling, his effective wife.” Taking WYC’s intentions as
                    expressed in that e-mail together with PL’s evidence that she had always
                    received the rental proceeds and managed the tenancies of the Draycott Property,
                    I drew an adverse inference against the plaintiffs for failing to call Foo Siew
                    Shan to give evidence. I found that WYC had intended for PL to receive all the
                    rental proceeds of the Draycott Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    The plaintiffs had acted for ulterior
                    purposes in making their belated claim for a share of the rental proceeds. Two
                    things pointed to this. At the trial, Phoebe Sim testified that WMC only raised
                    the issue of obtaining the rental proceeds from PL when WMW asked for repayment
                    of the Loan owing by WYCPL to WYC. The plaintiffs also did not dispute that WYC
                    was able to understand and execute the transfer of the Draycott Property to a
                    joint tenancy in 2002. They acknowledged at trial that WYC intended for it to be
                    held in joint tenancy. If the plaintiffs had honestly believed that WYC was
                    entitled to the rental proceeds of the Draycott Property, the obvious and proper
                    course of action was to claim for the rental proceeds and not to sever the
                    property’s joint tenancy. Hence, I held that the attempted severance was a
                    move to defeat yet another of WYC’s clearly expressed intentions, which
                    was for PL to enjoy the right of survivorship over the Draycott Property. The
                    plaintiffs were pursuing a vendetta rather than WYC’s best interests when
                    they signed the statutory declaration for severance of the Draycott Property on
                    30 November 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the 2010 Order should be set aside</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    On 18 February 2010, the
                    plaintiffs’ solicitors wrote to PL to seek details of the lease on the
                    Draycott Property and informed her that the plaintiffs intended to sell the
                    property. PL responded by asserting that she was its sole beneficial owner.
                    Despite that, in March 2010, the plaintiffs took out an <em>ex
                        parte</em> Summons No 1542 of 2010 and obtained the 2010 Order, which
                    conferred on them the power to sell 5CHR and the Draycott Property. PL was
                    neither informed of the application nor was she served the court papers until
                    the 2010 Order was extracted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    In his affidavit filed on 7 April 2010
                    for this application, WML stated that the CPE was seeking an order to empower
                    them to sell and dispose of WYC’s shares and interest and title in all his
                    assets because the CPE anticipated that in the near future, WYC’s funds
                    would be insufficient to maintain him. The affidavit did not identify the
                    properties that were intended to be sold. On 8 April 2010, the Court
                    directed that a supplementary affidavit be filed to state the properties the CPE
                    proposed to sell, whether there were any other family members who may object to
                    the application and whether there was any need to inform any other family
                    members of the application and serve the summons on them. WML filed the
                    supplementary affidavit on 30 April 2010, but the summons was not served on
                    PL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    When WML was questioned on the failure to
                    serve the summons on PL, he advanced a defence of pedantry and defined
                    “family members” to exclude PL. I found his explanation to be
                    specious. In any event, WML’s affidavit of 30 April 2010 specifically
                    listed 5CHR and the Draycott Property properties which the CPE was seeking a
                    power to sell. PL was their co-owners at that time and she should have been
                    notified if the CPE was trying to acquire a power to sell her properties, even
                    if the exercise of the power would eventually need PL’s consent. WML also
                    tried to explain away the plaintiffs’ omission to serve the summons on PL
                    by saying that he relied on WMW to inform PL. He eventually conceded that WMW
                    did not know that the plaintiffs intended to sell 5CHR.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    The second irregularity of the application
                    was more serious. The papers filed in support of this application conspicuously
                    failed to mention the other sources of funds that WYC had access to even though
                    the basis of the application was that WYC’s funds were running out. Both
                    affidavits of WML made no reference at all to the Loan owed to WYC. As at
                    7 April 2010, the Loan was not even wrongfully reclassified by the
                    plaintiffs yet. The plaintiffs also omitted to tell the Court that WYC was
                    entitled to participate in a share buyback scheme in WYCPL in February 2010
                    which would have netted him at least $70,000. This was a grave failure to give
                    full and frank disclosure of material facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    The plaintiffs had also inflated WYC’s
                    expenses. In WML’s affidavit filed on 7 April 2010, he itemised what
                    he claimed were the monthly expenses of WYC. It showed that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_182-p2_i"></a>(i)     WMC was charging WYC $4,000 as
                        WYC’s share of the $10,000 rent of an apartment at Wing on Life
                        Gardens, to which WMC moved his family of four to (after removing WYC from
                        5CHR on 10 February 2010 to live with him);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_182-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     the plaintiffs were using an
                        existing employee of WYCPL to do the accounts of WYC’s estate but had
                        charged the estate $2,675 for the work. That employee, Phoebe Sim, testified
                        that she was not paid for the work she did for WYC’s estate and her
                        salary was not increased because of the additional work she
                    did;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_182-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     a sum of
                        $1,200 was listed as TKY’s accommodation and utilities at 37GHA even
                        though it included the charges for utilities that WML and his own family
                        were incurring; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_182-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     a sum of $1,300 was included and described as property
                        tax and maintenance fees for the Draycott Property although PL was paying
                        for them in April 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">WML inevitably conceded that he
                    had given the Court an exaggerated figure of the cost of maintaining WYC in
                    April 2010. The plaintiffs further conceded that they had not given the Court an
                    accurate picture of WYC’s financial situation when they filed the summons.
                    I set aside the 2010 Order for those reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the plaintiffs’ appointments as WYC’s deputies
                should be revoked</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    Under s 20(8), MCA, the Court may
                    revoke the appointment of a deputy of a person if it is satisfied that the
                    deputy has behaved, or is behaving, in a way that is not in the person’s
                    best interests. Deputies must take certain steps in construing what was in the
                    best interests of the person: see above, at <a href="#p1_105">[105]</a>. Section 6(10), MCA also provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the case of an act done, or a decision made, by a person other than the
                        court, there is sufficient compliance with this section if (having complied
                        with the requirements of subsections (1) to (8)) he reasonably believes that
                        what he does or decides is in the best interests of the person
                        concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    I found that not only did the plaintiffs
                    completely ignore the precepts of s 6(7) and (8), MCA, they had no belief
                    at all that they were acting in WYC’s best interests with respect to the
                    actions they took as WYC’s deputies. The extent of their improper conduct
                    was scandalous. They made a <em>mala fide</em> application
                    to procure the 2010 Order without disclosing material facts to the Court, and
                    then used the power they obtained to try to wrest from her properties which PL
                    co-owned with WYC. They also used the power improperly to attempt to sever the
                    joint tenancies of those properties. They procured the Synapse Order by
                    withholding material facts from the Court which caused WYC’s cash reserves
                    to be depleted. They wrongfully reclassified the Loan to put $3.7m out of
                    WYC’s reach. They wrongfully wrote off directors’ fees that may be
                    owed to WYC from various family members. They voted against WYC’s
                    participation in the share buyback scheme without justification. They attempted
                    to sever the joint tenancies of 5CHR and the Draycott Property against
                    WYC’s express intentions. Finally, they instituted these proceedings in
                    bad faith. In short, they were acting purely for collateral and improper
                    purposes. The plaintiffs sought to benefit their own interests at the expense of
                    WYC’s well-being. Their actions were reprehensible breaches of their
                    fiduciary duty to act in WYC’s best interests. I felt compelled to revoke
                    their appointments as WYC’s deputies. I also ordered an account of
                    WYC’s assets and liabilities to be provided by the plaintiffs to WMW from
                    the date the CPE was appointed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">What was wrong with the application to have the CPE
                appointed?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    In the light of the medical evidence and the
                    evidence of WYC’s functional abilities which I had accepted (see above, at
                        <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> to <a href="#p1_88">[88]</a>), the affidavit filed by the plaintiffs and WMW on
                    7 October 2005 to support their joint application to have the CPE appointed
                    and for them to become members of the CPE was shown to contain
                    misrepresentations. It was falsely alleged to the Court that WYC had
                    “difficulty with the simple activities of daily living such as using his
                    telephone, finding and operating light switches” and the brain scans done
                    on WYC in 2000 revealed “abnormal results”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    The plaintiffs had also concealed material
                    information from the Court. In their 7 October 2005 affidavit, it was
                    claimed that “[a]ll members of the family, including Wong Yip
                    Chong’s wife and his five children, unanimously agree that he is
                    significantly cognitively impaired and is unable to manage his personal and
                    financial affairs.” The plaintiffs also claimed that it was the unanimous
                    view of WYC’s family that the plaintiffs and WMW should form the CPE. They
                    gave the Court the impression that everyone who ought to have been notified of
                    the application had actually given their written consent to it. This was a false
                    impression. PL was not told of the application although, as WML conceded, she
                    was living together with WYC and would have been the best person to know whether
                    WYC could manage his daily affairs. PL could have offered highly relevant
                    evidence on WYC’s functional abilities to the Court. Shockingly, PL was
                    neither mentioned in the application nor in the 7 October 2005 affidavit.
                    At the hearing, the Court was not even told of PL’s existence. The failure
                    to apprise PL of the application was aggravated by the fact that in that
                    application, the plaintiffs also sought the power to sell and dispose of 5CHR.
                    The plaintiffs did not tell the Court that PL had been living at 5CHR for 25
                    years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    The plaintiffs attempted to justify their
                    omission to inform PL of the application. First, they argued that they had
                    assumed that WMW would have informed PL of the application. This was hard to
                    believe. WMW was in the United States at the time the application was made. On
                    the other hand, PL was in Singapore and the plaintiffs knew her well. I found
                    that there was no reason why the plaintiffs could not have told PL of the
                    application except for wishing to keep it from her. Secondly, WMC claimed that
                    PL was mendacious when she said that she was surprised to find out in January
                    2006 about the application and the Order of Court to form the CPE. WMC claimed
                    that PL knew about the application. WML also claimed that he had been
                    transparent with PL about this application. The plaintiffs relied on an e-mail
                    that WMC had sent to the family members, which included PL, on 3 June 2005
                    to support their contentions. The relevant part of the e-mail said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please let me know if you have a preference of choice of lawyers; we can
                        discuss any of your suggestions of a lawyer, but all 7 of us ([TKY], PL,
                        WMC, WMS, WML, WMK, WMW) need to be informed about any choice of lawyer and
                        the entire process …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This e-mail thus refuted the plaintiffs’ claims because it would
                    have given PL the impression that she would be kept updated of the
                    “entire” application. Despite this assurance from the plaintiffs
                    in June 2005, she was not notified of the filing of the application. It was with
                    much reluctance during cross-examination that WMC finally admitted that PL was
                    “not aware of the Court application”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    PL confirmed in Court that she only knew of
                    the appointment of the CPE in January 2006 and was “very upset”
                    that the application was made without her input. She explained that she had not
                    applied to set aside the Order appointing the CPE then because she thought she
                    lacked the standing to do so. When she was queried as to why she did not take
                    issue with the timing of the application for a CPE to be appointed, PL explained
                    that she had trusted WMC’s judgment as he was a neurologist.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    The premature application to appoint the CPE
                    and the clandestine manner in which it was carried out suggested sinister
                    motives on the part of the plaintiffs to supplant their father as soon as they
                    could. I found that WMW did not participate in the surreptitious acts. He was
                    based in the United States at the time of the application and had trusted his
                    half-siblings who were medical professionals to do the right thing. It was
                    highly likely that the plaintiffs had placed WMW on the CPE for two reasons.
                    First, it was to give a veneer of propriety. With respect to actions that the
                    CPE would propose that were against WYC’s interests, WMW would always
                    either be deceived into making an unanimous application together with the
                    plaintiffs or outvoted when he opposed it. Secondly, WMW would be a convenient
                    excuse should it be alleged that the plaintiffs kept certain actions of the CPE
                    away from PL. WMW is PL’s son and the plaintiffs shrewdly but mistakenly
                    calculated that it would naturally be presumed he would convey relevant
                    information to her in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Who should become WYC’s deputy or deputies?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    I decided against appointing new deputies
                    for WYC. Any new appointment was undesirable because the expenses and potential
                    complications involved would outweigh any benefits to WYC – I believed
                    that WYC would not be with his loved ones for much longer (which proved to be
                    the case as he passed away three weeks after oral judgment was delivered). I
                    directed that WMW should remain as WYC’s sole deputy. I found that WMW was
                    completely disinterested in his father’s assets unlike his half siblings;
                    he was only interested in his computer business which by all accounts was
                        <del>s</del>uccessful. WMW had put in his
                    best efforts to attempt to resolve the disputes regarding his father’s
                    assets between PL and the plaintiffs amicably. For example, he took time off to
                    work hard on the Christmas Recommendations by coordinating the views and input
                    from all the family members which he sincerely believed was going to be a
                    definitive solution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_191"></a>191    WMW was also largely neutral towards the
                    plaintiffs and PL until he was forced to take an adversarial stance against the
                    plaintiffs in these proceedings. Even then, it was primarily out of his
                    father’s interest than anything else. The contents of the transcripts of
                    the CPE meetings showed that he was not biased towards PL and was genuinely
                    looking out for WYC’s interests. Although the transcripts were supplied by
                    WMW, the plaintiffs had not challenged their accuracy nor alleged that
                    WMW’s behaviour became any different after he had started recording the
                    proceedings of the CPE without the plaintiffs’ knowledge. Their only
                    complaint was that they were unaware the recordings were being made. WMW had
                    explained that he took to recording the entire proceedings of the meetings
                    because he found that the minutes prepared at the plaintiffs’ behest were
                    inaccurate and/or incomplete.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the plaintiffs should bear the costs of the Suit
                personally</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    Order 99 rule 13, ROC provides that the
                    costs of proceedings under the MCA shall be paid by the deputised person or
                    charged to his estate, unless the Court otherwise directs. Section 40(2), MCA
                    provides that the Court has full power to determine by whom and to what extent
                    the costs are to be paid. The issue of costs was therefore at the Court’s
                    discretion. The plaintiffs’ counsel submitted that if the
                    plaintiffs’ claims in this action are dismissed and the defendants’
                    counterclaims succeed which was my judgment (save that I did not grant one of
                    PL’s counterclaims regarding the beneficial ownership of 5CHR), the Court
                    should apply the general rule that a trustee who sues for the protection of
                    trust property against a third party will be indemnified against his costs; and
                    therefore, costs of these proceedings should be borne by WYC’s estate. I
                    accepted the authority of this general rule because the fiduciary relationship
                    between a deputy and the person is akin to that of trustee and beneficiary. But
                    this rule is qualified, and the plaintiffs fell within the
                qualification.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    In <em>In re Beddoe; Downes v
                        Cottam</em> [1893] 1 Ch 547, the English Court of Appeal
                    held (at 558) that a trustee is entitled as of right to full indemnity out of
                    his trust estate against all his costs, charges and expenses if they were
                    “properly incurred” in an action respecting the trust estate.
                    Bowen LJ stated (at 562) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The principle of law to be applied appears unmistakeably clear. A trustee
                        can only be indemnified out of the pockets of his <em>cestuis
                            que trust</em> against costs, charges, and expenses properly
                        incurred for the benefit of the trust—a proposition in which the word
                        “properly” means reasonably as well as honestly
                        incurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The CA distinguished reasonableness from <em>bona
                        fides</em>. Before the costs could be considered
                    “proper”, the trustee must satisfy two tests, reasonableness and
                        <em>bona fides</em>. The Court also warned that while
                    the fact that the trustee had acted on counsel’s opinion would be relevant
                    to the reasonableness of the action, it will not guarantee it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a>194    Bowen LJ also stated (at 562):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If there be one consideration again more than another which ought to be
                        present to the mind of a trustee, especially the trustee of a small and
                        easily dissipated fund, it is that all litigation should be avoided, unless
                        there is such a chance of success as to render it desirable in the interests
                        of the estate that the necessary risk should be incurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The trustee will not be unfairly burdened with the issue of risk
                    assessment because a trustee who was uncertain about the desirability of
                    litigation had an available solution, which later came to be called a <em>Beddoe</em> application:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If a trustee is doubtful as to the wisdom of prosecuting or defending a
                        lawsuit, he is provided by the law with an inexpensive method of solving his
                        doubts in the interest of the trust. He has only to take out an originating
                        summons, state the point under discussion, and ask the Court whether the
                        point is one which should be fought out or abandoned. To embark in a lawsuit
                        at the risk of the fund without this salutory precaution might often by to
                        speculate in law with money that belongs to other people.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I accepted all these propositions of law to apply in this
                case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_195"></a>195    The plaintiffs had clearly not acted
                    properly in commencing this litigation. The litigation was not carried out
                        <em>bona fide</em>. I had earlier detailed why the
                    plaintiffs’ attempt to set aside the Transfer was not to protect
                    WYC’s interests but to pursue their own private agenda.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196"></a>196    The litigation was also patently
                    unreasonable. First, they had commenced this action despite the objections of a
                    co-deputy. The substance of WMW’s objections was that the
                    plaintiffs’ claims would be inconsistent with WYC’s wishes and there
                    were other sources of funds for WYC’s maintenance that could and should
                    have been used. WYC’s wishes were something that WYC’s deputies were
                    obliged to have regard to in the discharge of their fiduciary duties. The
                    plaintiffs also knew that the alternative sources of funds existed. Thus,
                    WMW’s objections were well-founded. In <em>In Re
                        England’s Settlement Trusts; Dobb v England</em> [1918]
                    1 Ch 24, a trustee commenced an action in the name of himself and his
                    co-trustee to recover damages from the tenants of a house which was trust
                    property. Although the trustee succeeded in recovering some measure of damages,
                    he was found to have acted unreasonably and disentitled from costs from the
                    estate. The trustee had failed to make a <em>Beddoe</em>
                    application and did not consult his co-trustee before taking the decision to
                    sue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a>197    The plaintiffs in the present case had acted
                    more wrongfully than the trustee in <em>Dobb v England</em>
                    since they ignored well-founded objections from a co-deputy. After they learnt
                    of this difference in opinion, the plaintiffs ought to have at least made a
                        <em>Beddoe</em> application before pursuing their
                    claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a>198    Secondly, the costs of commencing the action
                    were entirely out of proportion to the amount of liquid funds available in
                    WYC’s estate at the time the proceedings were initiated. As at
                    30 June 2010, shortly before the commencement of the action on 2 July
                    2010, WYC’s estate was left with only $11,617.25 in cash. Because of
                    WYC’s medical condition, the use of those remaining funds should have been
                    prioritised for WYC’s medical care. In this context, the costs incurred
                    were therefore not only extravagant but perverse. Consequently, I ordered the
                    plaintiffs to pay costs personally.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Should the plaintiffs pay costs on an indemnity basis?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_199"></a>199    The Court is conferred the discretion to
                    decide the extent of costs to be borne by each party under O 59
                    r 2(2), ROC. Order 59 r 5 of the ROC sets out the relevant factors the
                    Court shall take into account in exercising this discretion. The conduct of the
                    parties, including conduct before and during the proceedings is a relevant
                    factor. In <em>Macmillan Inc v Bishopgate Investment Trust plc
                        and others (No 3)</em> [1995] 3 All ER 747, Millett J
                    delivered an unreported ancillary judgment on the award of costs. The relevant
                    portion of Millett J’s judgment is quoted in <em>Takako
                        Sakao (f) v Ng Pek Yuen (f) &amp; Anor (No 2)</em> [2010]
                    2 MLJ 181 at [8]. It
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The power to order taxation on an indemnity basis is not confined to cases
                        which have been brought with an ulterior motive or for an improper purpose.
                        Litigants who conduct their cases in bad faith, or as a personal vendetta,
                        or in an improper or oppressive manner, or who cause costs to be incurred
                        irrationally or out of all proportion as to what is at stake, may also
                        expect to be ordered to pay costs on an indemnity basis if they lose, and
                        have part of their costs disallowed if they win. Nor are these necessarily
                        the only situations where the jurisdiction may be exercised; the discretion
                        is not to be fettered or circumscribed beyond the requirement that taxation
                        on an indemnity basis must be “appropriate”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Based on the above principles enunciated by Millett J, I ordered the
                    plaintiffs to pay costs to PL on an indemnity basis. Apart from those
                    particulars which I had listed above with respect to the plaintiffs’ lack
                    of <em>bona fides</em> and reasonableness in commencing the
                    action, the manner in which they had conducted the litigation left much to be
                    desired.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200"></a>200    First, they did not provide their main
                    expert witness, Dr Chen, with the necessary documents or information from
                    December 2004 for him to form a reliable expert’s opinion despite
                    Dr Chen asking for them. Dr Auchus, the plaintiffs’ other expert
                    witness was unable to provide an expert opinion on the relevant issue. The
                    plaintiffs had also sought to bring in additional expert’s opinions in the
                    form of the AEICs of two of their factual witnesses who were medical doctors.
                    This resulted in much wasted costs since the defendants’ counsel had to
                    deal with four experts’ opinions, none of which were useful.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201"></a>201    Secondly, the plaintiffs and their two
                    siblings frequently prevaricated in the witness stand. Instead of being
                    forthright, they chose to argue with counsel in cross-examination and regularly
                    delivered irrelevant and lengthy speeches. Because of their (at times)
                    untruthful testimony, the proceedings were unnecessarily lengthened. I highlight
                    one example – a rebuttal witness had to be called by PL to disprove
                    WML’s statement that he had never been to Balakrishnan’s
                    office.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_202"></a>202    Finally, the plaintiffs were a little more
                    than kin and less than kind.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> In
                    the negotiations prior to the Suit, they had threatened PL in the hope that she
                    would capitulate to their unfair terms. PL alleged that WML had intimidated her
                    in an attempt to persuade her to relinquish her rights in the Draycott Property.
                    During cross-examination, PL testified that WML threatened her with seven years
                    of litigation, which WML thought would see PL to the end of her life, if she did
                    not agree to sell the Draycott Property and give the plaintiffs half of the sale
                    proceeds. This testimony was not challenged. She further testified that by
                    January 2010, she decided to engage legal counsel because she could not stomach
                    the intimidation any longer. PL’s testimony was corroborated by WMW, who
                    testified that WML and WMK had “made [his] mother cry” during
                    preliminary stages of the negotiation in relation to the contemplated sale of
                    the Draycott Property in early 2010. Crucially, under cross-examination and
                    re-examination, WMC did not deny that he had expressed his desire to go through
                    “four bruising rounds in court” with the defendants in relation to
                    the contested assets during a meeting of the CPE on 28 February 2011, and
                    was “very happy” to litigate against the defendants. The conduct
                    of the entire action was therefore an exercise in oppressing the defendants in
                    general and PL in particular.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_203"></a>203    I therefore ordered PL’s costs of this
                    action to be paid by the plaintiffs to PL on an indemnity basis. These costs
                    were to include those incurred in respect of the Originating Summons and the
                    applications by WMW therein, which PL intervened in and which were consolidated
                    with the Suit. WMW’s costs of this action, including the Originating
                    Summons and the applications filed in the Suit were to be paid by the plaintiffs
                    to him on a standard basis. The shortfall between WMW’s costs recovered on
                    a standard basis and his own solicitor’s costs were to be paid out of
                    WYC’s estate as he had acted reasonably in these proceedings as his
                    father’s deputy. The second intervener, TKY, was to bear her own
                    costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_204"></a>204    The poignant opening lines of <em>Anna Karenina</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own
                        way.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">were quoted in the Christmas Recommendations. Tolstoy had surely
                    written it in the present tense instead of his usual past tense to urge his
                    readers to philosophise about family happiness. In that tradition and in view of
                    the unique circumstances of this family (described by WML as
                    “unconventional”), I ruled that PL’s wishes were to prevail
                    over the wishes of all the other family members, including those of WMW’s,
                    with respect to decisions concerning the care of WYC for the rest of his
                    remaining time here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_205"></a>205    While this case should never have come to
                    Court, the tragedy that it was looks set to continue for a while longer. I note
                    that the plaintiffs chose to file their appeal against my judgment on
                    29 August 2011, the day their father passed away.</p>
