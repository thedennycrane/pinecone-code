</div> In his defence, Kwan described this as a “loan of $250,000”; at the same time, he also pleaded that the first interest payment of $25,000 was deducted from the amount borrowed and therefore “the principal amount to be repaid was $275,000”. Kwan claimed that he subsequently paid the interest for the next three months from July to September 2015.

Kwan’s version was contradicted by his own police report against Teo dated 25 June 2018 as to  (i) the first loan amount that he claimed to have borrowed from Teo, (ii) the total amount that he claimed to have borrowed from Teo, and (iii) the total amount that he claimed to have paid to Teo. In the police report, Kwan also claimed that he was forced to issue a cheque for $500,000 to Teo but there was no evidence of any such cheque. The Judge found these inconsistencies to be stark especially since Kwan claimed to have a spreadsheet (which he did not produce) recording the cash loans from Teo and his repayments in cash to Teo. In addition, Kwan gave inconsistent versions of the amounts he borrowed from Teo in his defence, his affidavit of evidence-in-chief and his oral testimony.  The Judge found that Kwan’s inconsistencies and explanations for the inconsistencies damaging to his credibility.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Kwan’s explanation for the six cheques that he gave to Teo was that he had been made to issue cash cheques to Teo regularly as collateral for the interest-bearing loans that he took from Teo, which were rolled into new loans each time Kwan failed to meet a payment. Kwan relied on WhatsApp messages which showed Teo reminding him to issue cheques for specified sums on specified dates. Teo explained that the messages referred to a loan that Kwan had taken from Malaysian loan sharks. Teo testified that Kwan continued to ask Teo for loans after end-2017. Teo informed Kwan that he was unable to extend any more loans to Kwan and at Kwan’s insistence, Teo asked his Malaysian friends who were loan sharks to lend Kwan $800,000 (the “Malaysian Loan”). Teo acted as a middleman between Kwan and the Malaysian loan sharks.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Kwan disputed the Malaysian Loan. However, the Judge accepted Teo’s explanation and found that the WhatsApp messages had nothing to do with the Loans. The amounts mentioned in the messages did not correspond to either party’s account of the amount of the loans given by Teo to Kwan. The messages also made numerous references to a third party. One message from Teo reminded Kwan that the moneys were owed to “them” and “they are not as good like me”. In another message, Teo told Kwan that he was “just getting [f––] from them”. Further, the messages were for the period from end 2017 to 2018, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, after the last of the Loans given by Teo to Kwan on 20 October 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 We are satisfied that the Judge’s finding that Teo did make the Loans to Kwan cannot be said to be against the weight of the evidence or plainly wrong. In particular, we agree with the Judge that the six cheques issued by Kwan were strong evidence of the Loan. The Judge (in our view, correctly) rejected Kwan’s explanation for these cheques. In addition to the inconsistencies that were noted by the Judge, Kwan failed to produce any record of the alleged loans and payments. Neither did Kwan explain how his alleged repayments related to his version of the loans. Kwan claimed to have a spreadsheet containing such records, but no such spreadsheet was produced in court. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Judge’s finding that Teo was not an unlicensed moneylender</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Kwan submitted that the presumption in s 3 of the MLA applied because Teo had only ever made interest-bearing loans to him. However, Kwan’s version of interest-bearing loans from Teo had been rejected. Kwan’s reliance on the WhatsApp messages referred to in [19] and [20] above did not help him as these messages referred to the Malaysian Loan. There were no WhatsApp messages from Teo referring to or demanding payment of interest during the entire period from 13 November 2014 (Loan No 1) to 20 October 2017 (Loan No 7). There was no other evidence that Teo had extended interest-bearing loans to Kwan. The six cheques given by Kwan to Teo only covered the total principal amount of the Loans.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In the circumstances, the Judge’s finding that Teo was not an unlicensed moneylender was clearly not against the weight of the evidence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 We dismiss the appeal for the above reasons.
