<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal by the Public Prosecutor
                    against the sentences imposed by a District Judge (“the DJ”) on
                    the respondent, Ang Seng Thor (“Ang”), in respect of District
                    Arrest Case (“DAC”) Nos 20434 and 20435 of 2010
                    (respectively, “DAC 20434” and “DAC 20435”). Ang
                    pleaded guilty to those two charges, both of which concerned offences of
                    corruptly giving gratification to agents contrary to s 6(<em>b</em>) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241,
                    1993 Rev Ed) (“PCA”), which carries a maximum sentence of
                    five years’ imprisonment or a fine of $100,000 or both. Two other
                    corruption charges under the same section and two charges of giving false
                    statements under s 57(1)(<em>k</em>) of the
                    Immigration Act (Cap 133, 1997 Rev Ed) were taken into consideration
                    for the purposes of sentencing. The DJ sentenced Ang to a fine of $100,000 (the
                    maximum fine) for each charge, in default five months’ imprisonment
                    per charge. The total sentence imposed by the DJ for the two charges was
                    therefore a fine of $200,000, which Ang has paid in full. The DJ also noted that
                    by operation of law under s 154(1) read with s 154(4)(<em>a</em>) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“Companies Act”), Ang would be disqualified from acting as a
                    director of a company or foreign company for five years from the date of his
                    conviction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       After hearing submissions by the Prosecution and
                    Ang, I allowed the appeal and varied the sentence to a term of six weeks’
                    imprisonment and a fine of $25,000 per charge, with both imprisonment terms to
                    run consecutively. The total sentence was therefore 12 weeks’ imprisonment
                    and a fine of $50,000. By operation of law, Ang was also disqualified from
                    acting as a director from the date of conviction to the end of a period of five
                    years from the date of his release from prison (pursuant to s 154(1) read
                    with s 154(4)(<em>b</em>) of the Companies Act).
                    Having given brief oral grounds at the hearing, I now set out the detailed
                    grounds of my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Ang’s offences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       At the time of the offences, Ang was the chief
                    executive officer (“CEO”) and, together with one Tok Kian You
                    (“Tok”), joint managing director of AEM-Evertech Holdings Ltd
                    (“AEM”). Tok was also the executive chairman of AEM. AEM was a
                    company in the business of supplying equipment and precision tools to
                    semiconductor manufacturers and had been listed on the mainboard of the
                    Singapore Exchange since 19 December 2000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Sometime in 2003, Ang was introduced to one Ho
                    Sze Khee (“Ho”), an assistant engineer employed by Seagate
                    Technology International (“Seagate”), by one Ng Soon Chai Ven
                    (“Ven”), the AEM sales manager in charge of the Seagate account.
                    Ven informed Ang that Ho wanted kickbacks in exchange for Seagate ordering goods
                    from AEM, and told Ang that he could contact Ho directly about such an
                    arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Ang contacted Ho and acceded to Ho’s
                    request for a 15% kickback payment for each purchase order raised by Seagate to
                    AEM. Ho had hinted that he would refer Seagate’s business to other
                    companies if he did not receive such kickbacks. Ang admitted that he intended to
                    corruptly pay these bribes to Ho, an agent of Seagate, in exchange for Ho
                    showing favour to AEM through his influence over Seagate’s
                orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Sometime in March 2005, Ang met Ho at a car park
                    near Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10, Singapore. Ang handed Ho $97,158 in cash in
                    recognition of purchase orders received by AEM from Seagate with an aggregate
                    sales value of $647,720. This act of giving gratification to Ho was the subject
                    of the charge (the “Seagate Charge”) in DAC 20434 under
                        s 6(<em>b</em>) of the PCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The two corruption charges taken into
                    consideration similarly concerned Ang giving Ho gratification of the sums of
                    $24,650.10 on 19 October 2004 (DAC No 20432 of 2010) and $35,700 on
                    1 February 2005 (DAC No 20433 of 2010).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The other charge proceeded with concerned an
                    earlier incident. In early 2003, AEM wanted to sell four inspection machines to
                    Infineon Technologies Malaysia Sdn Bhd, Malacca (“Infineon”). This
                    sale was worth about $1m. Tok learned that there were many competitors
                    interested in supplying such machines to Infineon. Tok and Ang therefore
                    discussed the issue and agreed that they would offer a bribe of $50,000 to one
                    Tan Gek Chuan (“GC Tan”), a director of Infineon, to secure
                    the sale of four inspection machines by AEM to Infineon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       With the common intention to induce GC Tan,
                    an agent of Infineon, to show favour to AEM by influencing Infineon’s
                    purchasing decision, Tok and Ang met GC Tan at a hotel in Malacca,
                    Malaysia. The three of them discussed the sale of the inspection machines. At
                    the end of their meeting, Tok handed GC Tan $50,000 in cash, while Ang
                    excused himself to avoid embarrassment to GC Tan. GC Tan indicated
                    that he would ensure that Infineon would order the four inspection machines from
                    AEM, which Infineon subsequently did. This act of giving gratification to
                    GC Tan was the subject of the charge (the “Infineon Charge”)
                    in DAC 20435 under s 6(<em>b</em>) read with
                    s 37(1) of the PCA, read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224,
                    2008 Rev Ed).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Under the proceeded charges, a total of
                    $147,158 in bribes was given. If the bribes in the charges taken into
                    consideration were included, the total would be $207,508.10.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Ang’s disclosures</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Because of their relevance to Ang’s
                    mitigation, I will set out the events that followed Ang’s offences in some
                    detail. On 26 October 2005, Ang wrote a letter to the chairman of
                    AEM’s board of directors which was copied to the company’s
                    non-executive directors. In this letter he referred to his earlier notification
                    of the board of certain “grave and troubling discoveries” that he
                    had made in relation to certain officers in AEM, which he proceeded to
                    elaborate. Among the issues that he highlighted was an unauthorised trip by one,
                    Kammy Choo and one, CM Wong, to Bangkok, Thailand. He believed this was for
                    the purpose of instructing the representative of a company referred to as
                    “Halotech” to engage in suspicious business practices on behalf of
                    AEM – these included creating retrospective documents concerning certain
                    commissions which were not to be discussed with anyone at AEM. In addition, Ang
                    produced a table highlighting various irregular invoices for payments to
                    Halotech covering commission payments to a number of companies (including
                    Infineon and Seagate). Significantly, Ang emphasised that the main approving
                    authority for these questionable payments was Tok. Ang also alleged in his
                    letter that Tok had made unauthorised purchases of a vehicle and real property
                    using AEM’s funds and that Tok had also made unauthorised reimbursement
                    claims to AEM for personal travel and entertainment. Ang ended his letter by
                    encouraging AEM’s board of directors to immediately investigate the
                    matters he had raised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 14 November 2005, AEM sent a letter to
                    Ang terminating his employment and appointments in AEM and in the AEM Group of
                    companies. Between November 2005 and 7 July 2006, Ang sent a number of
                    follow-up letters to AEM’s board inquiring as to what action the company
                    would take in relation to Tok and Kammy Choo based on Ang’s
                    reports.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Between July and October 2006, AEM engaged the
                    firm of Ernst &amp; Young (“EY”) to investigate the allegations
                    made by Ang. Between 10 October 2006 and 20 November 2006, a number of
                    letters were exchanged between Drew &amp; Napier LLC (solicitors for Ang),
                    who were requesting a copy of EY’s report and associated updates, and
                    Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP (solicitors for AEM), who maintained AEM’s
                    position that Ang was not entitled to view EY’s report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In or around December 2006, Ang made a series
                    of disclosures to ST Microelectronics Group (“ST Micro”), a
                    client of AEM. In correspondence up to at least 26 May 2007, Ang provided
                    ST Micro with information about its employees who took bribes from AEM. Ang also
                    named AEM officers and employees who were involved in this scheme of bribery,
                    including Tok.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     ST Micro notified the Corrupt Practices
                    Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”) of the matters disclosed by Ang.
                    CPIB proceeded to commence investigations into the conduct of AEM and a number
                    of its officers. Ang was among those placed under investigation and was
                    interviewed by CPIB on 8 May 2007. Ang cooperated with CPIB’s
                    investigations, volunteering (through his solicitors) evidence relevant to acts
                    of corruption carried out within AEM. Ang also offered himself as a prosecution
                    witness in proceedings arising from these investigations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision of the District Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The DJ’s decision was set out in his
                    written Grounds of Decision (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Ang Seng
                        Thor</em> [2010] SGDC 454 (“the GD”)), which
                    included an Appendix restating his brief oral grounds (“the
                    GD Appendix”). His grounds are summarised in the following
                    paragraphs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The DJ interpreted the case of <em>Lim Teck Chye v Public Prosecutor</em> [2004]
                    2 SLR(R) 525 (“<em>Lim Teck
                    Chye</em>”) at [67]–[68] as
                    supporting two separate sentencing benchmarks for corruption offences. For
                    corruption involving public servants and public bodies, the benchmark was a
                    custodial sentence. For private sector or commercial corruption, the benchmark
                    was a fine unless the corruption had an impact on the public (the “public
                    service rationale”), in which case a custodial sentence was appropriate
                    (see [17] of the GD and [9] of the GD Appendix).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The DJ distinguished the precedents cited by
                    the Prosecution in favour of a custodial sentence on the basis that such
                    sentences were imposed on receivers of bribes rather than givers of bribes. The
                    DJ relied on the case of <em>Chua Tiong Tiong v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 515 (“<em>Chua Tiong Tiong</em>”) at [21] to support this approach. The DJ
                    considered that the size of Ang’s bribe ought not to correlate directly to
                    the punishment as he did not personally benefit more from larger bribes (see
                        [20] of the GD and [13]–[17] of the GD Appendix).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The DJ regarded Ang’s culpability as low
                    as he was not the initiator of the bribe in the Seagate Charge and had been
                    threatened with the loss of Seagate’s business for AEM. In relation to the
                    Infineon Charge, the DJ regarded Ang as playing a “passive role”,
                    not being the “pivotal figure in the transaction” as compared to
                    Tok, who played a more substantial role (see [10]–[11] of the
                    GD Appendix).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The DJ considered the size of the bribes,
                    noting that normally the sums involved would justify a custodial sentence as the
                    maximum fine would be an inadequate punishment. However, the DJ considered it
                    unfair to impose a custodial sentence here as (see [12]–[17] of the
                    GD Appendix):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     Ang was a giver of bribes and not a
                        receiver, and therefore did not gain any additional benefit from the large
                        size of the bribes;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     although the sums making up the bribes were fairly substantial, this
                        was due to the large size of the underlying transactions;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     the bribes were for AEM’s
                        benefit and did not translate into direct benefit for Ang, despite his
                        position as CEO; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_d"></a>(d)     Ang would bear any punishment under these charges even though the
                        money for the bribes came from AEM, not him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The DJ regarded Ang’s status as CEO and
                    the fact that AEM was a listed company as aggravating factors (see [18] of the GD Appendix). However, the DJ
                    considered that there were a number of mitigating factors in Ang’s favour,
                    including his cooperation with the authorities, agreement to be a prosecution
                    witness and an early plea of guilt (see [19] of the GD Appendix).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     An important point in mitigation was the
                    DJ’s finding that Ang was a “whistleblower” whose voluntary
                    disclosure of corrupt transactions in AEM had made a vital contribution towards
                    the discovery and punishment of the corruption. The DJ found that Ang had done
                    this out of a “commitment to do the right thing”. This was treated
                    as a crucial factor tipping the sentencing decision in favour of a non-custodial
                    punishment (see [22] of the GD and
                        [21]–[23] of the GD Appendix).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Taking all these factors into account, the DJ
                    arrived at the final sentence of the maximum fine of $100,000 for each charge,
                    in default five months’ imprisonment per charge, to give a total sentence
                    of $200,000 in fines, in default ten months’ imprisonment. A five-year
                    disqualification from acting as a director was also imposed on Ang by operation
                    of law under s 154(1) read with s 154(4)(<em>a</em>) of the Companies Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Public Prosecutor’s appeal against sentence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Public Prosecutor appealed for a short
                    custodial sentence to be imposed on Ang in addition to the imposition of a fine
                    and disqualification to act as a director. The reasons given for the appeal were
                    that the DJ had erred in:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)     finding that Ang was a passive or
                        non-pivotal actor in the offences;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)     finding that Ang did not benefit from the
                        offences;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_c"></a>(c)     giving insufficient weight to the size of the bribes;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_d"></a>(d)     giving excessive weight to Ang’s
                        status as a “whistleblower”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_e"></a>(e)     finding that Ang’s culpability was reduced
                        as he was a giver of bribes and not a receiver;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_f"></a>(f)     failing to find that the public service
                        rationale had been engaged on the facts; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_g"></a>(g)     not giving enough weight to the aim of general
                        deterrence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Prosecution also made the general
                    argument that the sentences imposed on Ang were manifestly
                inadequate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In response, Ang submitted that the DJ was
                    justified in imposing a non-custodial sentence because that correctly accorded a
                    mitigating premium to Ang’s acts of whistleblowing, and because the DJ had
                    accurately calibrated the aggravating and mitigating factors in arriving at his
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Reasons for allowing appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In <em>ADF v Public Prosecutor
                        and another appeal</em> [2010] 1 SLR 874 (“<em>ADF</em>”) at [17]–[18], I
                    restated the well-known standard for appellate intervention in sentencing
                    decisions as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17    In <em>PP v UI</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 500, this
                            Court summarised the legal principles relating to appellate review of
                            sentences. The Court stated at [12] that an appellate court will not
                            ordinarily disturb the sentence imposed by the trial court except where
                            it is satisfied that:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    the trial judge erred with respect to the
                                proper factual basis for sentencing;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    the trial judge failed to appreciate the
                                materials placed before him;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    the sentence was wrong in principle;
                            or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    the sentence was manifestly excessive or
                                manifestly inadequate, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18    In relation to the question of what is manifestly
                            excessive or manifestly inadequate, this Court accepted that the
                            threshold would only be met if there was a need for a substantial
                            alteration to the sentence rather than an insignificant correction to
                            remedy the injustice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In this case, I found that the DJ had erred in
                    both his treatment of the facts relevant to sentencing and his interpretation of
                    the applicable sentencing principles. I will address the latter
                first.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Relevance of the public-private distinction in corruption
                offences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The DJ held that there was a hard-edged
                    distinction between public sector corruption and private sector corruption which
                    justified different sentencing benchmarks or starting-points (at [17] of the GD):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">What are the existing guidelines and judicial concerns governing this
                        case? In the case of <em>Lim Teck Chye v PP</em> [2004]
                        2 SLR(R) 525, the then Chief Justice Yong Pung How used the term
                        “public service rationale” to refer to the concern in
                        corruption cases where the integrity of public service and the
                        administration of justice would be jeopardized by the act of corruption
                        involved. The Chief Justice recognized the apparent dichotomy of corruption
                        cases occurring in the private sector or taking place in a
                        ‘commercial’ context which usually are adequately punished with
                        substantial fines, and corruption cases involving public servants and public
                        bodies which warrant custodial sentences. He went on to distil the essence
                        of this bifurcation and how it is to be applied properly …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The DJ then quoted from <em>Lim Teck Chye</em> at
                        [67]–[68] (set out at <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> below) before continuing (at [18] of the GD):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Guided by the analysis given in the case of [<em>Lim Teck
                            Chye</em>], there is clearly a discernible difference in the
                        sentencing of cases involving private commercial transactions and those
                        where there is a public service rationale involved. Based on the facts and
                        circumstances of our case (these had been highlighted in my oral grounds at
                        paragraph 9 of [the GD Appendix), which occurred in a commercial context, I
                        came to the conclusion that the corrupt actions of the accused did not have
                        a negative bearing upon the public service rationale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The DJ stated at [9] of the
                    GD Appendix that “[i]n the absence of a public service rationale,
                    the sentence leans towards a non-custodial punishment.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     It is first necessary to clarify what the
                    phrase “public service rationale” meant as it was used in
                        <em>Lim Teck Chye</em>, which will put the DJ’s
                    reasoning in the proper light. Yong Pung How CJ mentioned in <em>Lim Teck Chye</em> at [66] that the public service rationale was articulated in his
                    judgment in <em>Chua Tiong Tiong</em>. That case concerned
                    the appeal against sentence of an infamous illegal moneylender who had been
                    convicted of corruptly giving gratification to a police officer in exchange for
                    assistance concerning his illegal moneylending activities. In <em>Chua Tiong Tiong</em> at [17], Yong CJ stated of:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I accepted the grave issue of public interest at stake in the
                        present case. Eradicating corruption in our society is of primary concern,
                        and has been so for many years. This concern becomes all the more urgent
                        where public servants are involved, whose very core duties are to ensure the
                        smooth administration and functioning of this country. Dependent as we are
                        upon the confidence in those running the administration, any loss of such
                        confidence through corruption becomes dangerous to its existence and
                        inevitably leads to the corrosion of those forces, in the present case the
                        police force, which sustain democratic institutions. I highlighted this in
                            <em>Meeran bin Mydin v PP</em> …, approving
                        the words of the trial judge in that case (at [18]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">… Acts of corruption must be effectively and decisively dealt
                            with. Otherwise the very foundation of our country will be seriously
                            undermined. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Simply put, the public service rationale as
                    framed in <em>Chua Tiong Tiong</em> is a restatement of the
                    common-sense proposition that corruption offences involving public servants are
                    especially harmful because they erode the public’s confidence in the
                    essential institutions of government. In the case of <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Chew Suang Heng</em> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 127
                        (“<em>Chew Suang Heng</em>”) Yong CJ
                    described the application of this proposition in the sentencing context (at
                        [9]–[11]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9    … There is no doubt that attempting to bribe
                            a law enforcement officer and interfering in the proper course of police
                            investigations is a serious offence. Generally, corruption offences
                            involving law enforcement officers or other public servants attract
                            harsher penalties and custodial sentences as compared to similar
                            offences committed in commercial dealings and in the private
                            sector.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10    For corruption offences under the PCA which involve
                            government servants, the norm is a custodial sentence and it is departed
                            from where the facts are exceptional. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11    There is no doubt that an element of public
                            interest exists in corruption offences involving the bribery of a public
                            servant and that the courts have taken a stern view of such offences. In
                            view of this public interest in stamping out bribery and corruption in
                            the country, especially in the public service, a deterrent sentence for
                            such offences is justified. The severity of the sentence imposed,
                            however, would depend on the facts of each individual
                        case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In <em>Lim Teck
                    Chye</em>, the appellant relied on [9] of <em>Chew Suang Heng</em> to submit
                    that “corruption offences that occur in a commercial context generally
                    attract non-custodial sentences” (see <em>Lim Teck
                        Chye</em> at [62]). The facts
                    of <em>Lim Teck Chye</em> concerned the appellant’s
                    participation in a conspiracy to pay corrupt gratification to certain marine
                    surveyors in exchange for false survey reports. These reports stated that the
                    appellant’s bunkering company had supplied the correct quantity and
                    quality of marine fuel to its customers, when in fact it had not. Yong CJ
                    rejected the appellant’s argument and stated the general principles
                    governing whether a corruption offence had crossed the custody threshold at
                        [65]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The appellant had also cited <em>PP v Yeoh
                            Hock Lam</em> [2001] SGDC 212, unreported judgment dated
                        9 July 2001. The district judge presiding in that case had juxtaposed
                        corruption in the public arena with that in the private sector (at [22] and [24]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Where the amount of gratification received is relatively low, and
                            where it is not in excess of $30,000, a substantial fine will <em>usually be adequate</em> punishment. The offender
                            will have to forfeit his ill-gotten gratification as well. This is the
                            established sentencing practice where the offenders are not public
                            officers and there is no taint on the integrity of the public service. I
                            did not see any justification to impose a different sentence on the
                            accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It was clear that the district judge’s statements did not stand for
                        the proposition that corruption in a commercial context <em>cannot</em> be punished with imprisonment, although it <em>usually</em> is adequate [to impose a substantial fine].
                        Indeed, the PCA expressly provides for the imposition of imprisonment
                        sentences regardless of whether the offence was committed in the public
                        arena. <b><em>Of course, whether a custodial sentence is
                            warranted in a particular case is determined upon a careful
                            consideration of sentencing principles such as the public interest and
                            other policy considerations, as well as the gravity of the offence
                            including the particular facts and circumstances thereof</em></b>:

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This balancing approach was similar to that taken recently in
                        <em>Zhao Zhipeng v Public Prosecutor</em> [2008]
                    4 SLR(R) 879 (“<em>Zhao
                    Zhipeng</em>”), which was decided in the context of football
                    match-fixing corruption. At [32] of that
                    case, Chan Sek Keong CJ cited with approval, <em>Sentencing
                        Practice in the Subordinate Courts</em> (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed,
                    2003) at p 814, which stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In deciding if the custody threshold has been breached, the main
                        determinant would be the mischief or likely consequence of the payment or
                        acceptance of the bribe (<em>eg</em> did the corruption
                        undermine the administration of justice, <em>etc</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     After making the above statement, Yong CJ
                    then proceeded to clarify the application of the public service rationale in
                        <em>Lim Teck Chye</em> at [66]–[68]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">66    The distinction
                            drawn by the appellant between corruption offences in the context of the
                            private sector and/or commercial dealings <em>vis-à-vis</em> corruption offences involving government
                            servants and officers of public bodies was stiff and artificial. The
                            general statement that I made in [<em>Chew Suang
                                Heng</em>] was based on the presumption that public servants
                            and officers of public bodies who commit a corruption offence in the
                            course of their duties would have breached the public service rationale
                            articulated in [<em>Chua Tiong Tiong</em>]. This
                            presumption was adopted by the Legislature in s 8 of the PCA, which
                            provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Where in any proceedings against a person for an offence under
                            section 5 or 6, it is proved that any gratification has been paid
                            or given to or received by a person in the employment of the Government
                            or any department thereof or of a public body by or from a person or
                            agent of a person who has or seeks to have any dealing with the
                            Government or any department thereof or any public body, that
                            gratification shall be deemed to have been paid or given and received
                            corruptly as an inducement or reward as hereinbefore mentioned unless
                            the contrary is proved.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">67    It cannot, however, be said that only corruption
                            offences committed by public servants or officers of public bodies run
                            afoul of the public service rationale. Corruption offences committed in
                            the private sector may do so as well, although there is no similar
                            presumption that they do. Private corporations today provide many public
                            service functions; the direct and indirect impact that these private
                            sector organisations have on the lives of our citizens as well as the
                            smooth running and administration of this country can be palpable. An
                            example where a private sector organisation can have a direct impact on
                            such matters is where it is awarded the tender for a government contract
                            for the provision of public services and/or utilities. The impact of
                            corruption offences on the public service rationale, as articulated in
                                [<em>Chua Tiong Tiong</em>], may therefore be
                            similarly applied to include instances where it is directly or
                            indirectly infringed by private sector organisations. Of course, there
                            will be cases where corruption offences in the private sector have
                            little, if any, bearing on the public service rationale, and these cases
                            will naturally be treated more leniently. These considerations make it
                            untenable to draw a strict line between corruption offences committed in
                            the private sector and those committed in the public
                        arena.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">68    I was of the view that the corrupt actions of the
                            appellant, although in the context of the private sector, had a negative
                            bearing upon the public service rationale. As the district judge found,
                            the appellant’s actions had the potential to adversely affect
                            public confidence in the independence of marine surveyors and
                            Singapore’s bunkering industry. His actions were particularly
                            reprehensible given that the appellant was a prominent member of the
                            bunkering industry. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In these passages, Yong CJ drew an analogy with the
                    presumption concerning criminal liability in s 8 of the PCA to explain the
                    sentencing approach taken in <em>Chew Suang Heng</em> for
                    offences where the public service rationale was relevant. <em>He
                        also extended that rationale to cover certain private sector
                        offences</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     I would summarise the somewhat lengthy
                    discussion at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>–<a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above into the following propositions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a>(a)     The public service rationale refers
                        to the public interest in preventing a loss of confidence in
                        Singapore’s public administration (see <em>Chua Tiong
                            Tiong</em> at [17]–[19]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"></a>(b)     Where there is a risk of this harm occurring, a custodial sentence is
                        normally justified (see <em>Chew Suang Heng</em> at
                            [9]–[11]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_c"></a>(c)     This sentencing principle is presumed to apply
                        where the offender is a government servant or an officer of a public body,
                        but it may also apply to private sector offenders where the subject-matter
                        of the offence involves a public contract or a public service. This includes
                        private sector offences that concern regulatory or oversight roles such as
                        marine surveying (see <em>Lim Teck Chye</em> at
                            [66]–[68]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_d"></a>(d)     Although triggering the public service rationale
                        is one way in which a private sector offender may be subject to a custodial
                        sentence, it is not the <em>only</em> way: the custody
                        threshold may be breached in other circumstances, depending on the
                        applicable policy considerations and the gravity of the offence as measured
                        by the mischief or likely consequence of the corruption (see <em>Lim Teck Chye</em> at [65] and <em>Zhao Zhipeng</em> at
                            [32]). In addition, factors such
                        as the size of the bribes, the number of people drawn into the web of
                        corruption and whether such conduct was endemic will all be relevant to the
                        consideration of whether a custodial sentence is
                    justified.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">At the end of the day, it must be borne in mind
                    that the main sentencing considerations in corruption cases are deterrence and
                    punishment (see, to similar effect, <em>Regina v Gordon
                        Foxley</em> (1995) 16 Cr App R (S) 879 at 885). Indeed, the
                    preservation of a corruption-free environment has always been a cornerstone of
                    governance in Singapore. It would not be wrong to say that in Singapore
                    deterrence is always a relevant sentencing consideration in corruption
                    cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I should briefly point out that although
                    Yong CJ suggested in <em>Lim Teck Chye</em> at
                        [68] that the public service
                    rationale included cases occasioning a loss of confidence in a strategic
                    industry such as the bunkering and maritime industry, subsequent cases such as
                        <em>Wong Teck Long v Public Prosecutor</em> [2005]
                    3 SLR(R) 488 (“<em>Wong Teck
                    Long</em>”) and <em>Zhao Zhipeng</em> have
                    clarified that such facts form a separate aggravating factor justifying general
                    deterrence (see <em>Wong Teck Long</em> at [36] in reference to the banking and finance
                    industry). This factor often but <em>not always</em>
                    justifies a custodial sentence (see <em>Zhao Zhipeng</em>
                    at [30]–[34] in the context of professional football).
                    To bring this factor under the definition of the public service rationale
                    strikes me as making the latter too wide.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Proposition (d) at <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> above was especially relevant to the present
                    appeal. It should be clear at this stage that the DJ made the same error as the
                    appellant in <em>Lim Teck Chye</em>, which was to draw a
                    “stiff and artificial” distinction between public and private
                    sector corruption for the purposes of sentencing (to use Yong CJ’s
                    words in <em>Lim Teck Chye</em> at [66]). The error lay in treating the public
                    service rationale as an exhaustive or even the primary ground for imposing a
                    custodial sentence on a private-sector corruption offender. In fact, the correct
                    approach should have been the familiar balancing exercise described in <em>Lim Teck Chye</em> at [65] (see <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> above), for
                    the following reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     At common law, the offence of bribery was
                    limited to persons acting in an <em>official</em> capacity
                    or performing <em>public</em> functions (see David Lanham
                        <em>et al</em>, <em>Criminal
                        Fraud</em> (The Law Book Company Limited, 1987), at pp 202 to
                    204). Although most jurisdictions have since statutorily extended the offence to
                    private sector bribery (while the United Kingdom itself has, in the Bribery Act
                    2010 (c 23) (UK) (“Bribery Act 2010”), ceased to draw a
                    distinction between public and private sector bribery), the historical roots of
                    the offence may still be observed in legislative provisions such as s 8 of
                    the PCA which provide for a presumption of corruption in cases involving public
                    servants or bodies. However, the fact that, historically, there was a
                    public-private distinction in the <em>definition</em> of
                    the offence of bribery did not translate into a similar distinction when it came
                    to the <em>sentencing</em> of the offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     For instance, the sentencing approach of the
                    English courts in corruption cases prior to the Bribery Act 2010 did not
                    distinguish between public sector and private sector corruption (see
                    Colin Nicholls <em>et al</em>, <em>Corruption and Misuse of Public Office</em> (Oxford University Press,
                    2006) at para 2.71). Similarly, the Court of Appeal of Hong Kong in
                        <em>R v Wong Tat-Sang &amp; ors</em> [1985]
                    HKCA 196 declared forcefully (at [4]) that, for the purposes of sentencing, it could not
                        “<em>for a moment accept the suggestion that bribery
                        in the private sector is in any way to be regarded as less culpable than
                        bribery in the public sector</em>” [emphasis added]; see also
                        <em>HKSAR v Lau Yee Lai</em> [1999]
                    HKEC 351.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Further support for a consistent approach to
                    sentencing in both private and public sector corruption cases was to be found in
                    the case of <em>Chua Kim Leng Timothy v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 513 (“<em>Timothy Chua</em>”). This appeal was heard and decided
                    on the same day as <em>Lim Teck Chye</em> by the same
                    judge, <em>viz</em>, Yong CJ. The grounds of decision
                    in both cases were later released on the same day. Their subject matter was very
                    similar: both cases involved bunkering companies paying corrupt gratification to
                    independent surveyors in exchange for favourable survey reports which would be
                    used to disguise dishonest business practices. The appellant in <em>Timothy Chua</em>, like the one in <em>Lim
                        Teck Chye</em>, attempted to rely on <em>Chew Suang
                        Heng</em> to argue that no custodial sentence should be imposed on him
                    as his offences were committed in a purely commercial context. Yong CJ, as
                    he did in <em>Lim Teck Chye</em>, rejected the artificial
                    distinction between the public and private contexts underlying this argument and
                    upheld a custodial sentence based entirely on the high culpability of the
                    appellant. In doing so he did not make any reference to the public service
                    rationale (see <em>Timothy Chua</em> at [23]–[27]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     To conclude this discussion, I would say that
                    the public-private distinction in corruption cases has sometimes been
                    overstated. It should be absolutely clear that there is no presumption in favour
                    of a non-custodial sentence for private sector corruption cases. While
                    Yong CJ stated at [65] of <em>Lim Teck Chye</em> that such cases are “<em>usually</em>” [emphasis in original] adequately dealt
                    with through substantial fines, that was an endorsement of the District
                    Court’s approach of <em>Public Prosecutor v Yeoh Hock
                        Lam</em> [2001] SGDC 212 (“<em>Yeoh Hock
                        Lam</em>”) (at [24])
                    specifically for cases “[w]here the amount of gratification received is
                    relatively low”. It was certainly not intended to be a general statement
                    of principle. The DJ misinterpreted <em>Lim Teck Chye</em>
                    in stating otherwise at [17] of the GD
                    (see <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     I take the view that there is a firm need for
                    the courts to set the correct moral tone for business. There are different, and
                    sometimes overlapping, theories as to what makes bribery morally wrong and
                    therefore worthy of criminalisation (see generally Stuart P Green,
                    “What’s Wrong with Bribery”, in <em>Defining
                        Crimes, Essays on the Special Part of the Criminal Law</em>
                    (R A Duff and Stuart P Green eds) (Oxford University Press,
                    2005) at p 143). P Alldridge, “The Law Relating to Free
                    Lunches” (2002) 23 Company Lawyer 264, has suggested (at p 267)
                    that the harm of private sector corruption lies in the distortion of the
                    operation of a legitimate market, preventing competition in the market from
                    functioning properly, to the detriment of the eventual consumer, who will have
                    to bear the cost of the bribe. The Law Commission of England and Wales,
                        <em>Reforming Bribery</em> (Law Com No 313) (The
                    Stationery Office, 2008), took the view (reflected in the Bribery Act 2010) that
                    the harm of bribery was ultimately referable to the improper conduct of the
                    recipient of the bribe, in performing a function or activity in breach of the
                    good faith, impartiality or trustworthiness reasonably expected of
                him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Both these perspectives are persuasive, and,
                    in my opinion, there is clearly a public interest in the private sector
                    maintaining a reputation for being corruption free, with business being
                    conducted in a fair and transparent manner so as to ensure that the
                    public’s legitimate expectations of <em>bona
                        fides</em>, commercial even-handedness and economic welfare are not
                    prejudiced, and the efficient operation of the market is not disrupted. These
                    being key factors in attracting and keeping both domestic and foreign investment
                    in our country, the health and stability of the wider economy would be harmed if
                    a culture of corruption was allowed to take root here (see Paolo Mauro,
                    “Corruption and Growth” (1995) 110 Quarterly Journal of
                    Economics 681, and Paolo Mauro, “The Persistence of Corruption and
                    Slow Economic Growth” (International Monetary Fund, IMF Working Paper,
                    WP/02/213)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     With this in mind, I would say that where
                    cases of private sector corruption involve managers (especially senior managers)
                    or concern corrupt influence over large or otherwise important business
                    transactions, this would add greatly to the seriousness of the offence. Courts
                    should then seriously consider imposing custodial sentences to deter the
                    establishment of a corrupt business culture in Singapore. Aggravating factors
                    that tend to trigger the same deterrent reasoning include the fact that offences
                    were systematic (as with a company or even industry-wide scheme of corruption)
                    or that they occurred over a long period of time, as opposed to one-off
                    incidents. There may or may not be many such cases, and all the facts must be
                    taken into account, but there must be no suggestion that the courts are more
                    indulgent with private sector offenders in serious corruption cases merely
                    because the public service rationale is not directly relevant.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The DJ drew what he perceived to be a clear
                    distinction in punishment between givers and receivers of bribes at [20] of the GD, which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It has to be noted that the sentencing precedents cited by
                        the Prosecution in support of a custodial sentence (at paragraphs 18 to
                        23 of Prosecution's Submissions on Sentence and in Annex K to the
                        Prosecution's Bundle of Authorities) for cases involving substantial sums of
                        monies <em>were all for the sentencing of receivers of
                            bribes</em>. It suffices for us to bear in mind the words of the
                        former Chief Justice Yong Pung How in [<em>Chua Tiong
                            Tiong</em>]:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">“21    ...There are cases where a giver will
                                not warrant a similar punishment as that of the receiver, such as
                                when a giver was under compulsion or some form of pressure to give.
                                ...”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Further explanation of the DJ’s
                    reasoning was set out in the GD Appendix at [13], where he stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When we consider the significance of the size of a bribe in a corruption
                        case, there is a discernible difference to be noted for the giver and the
                        receiver. I know it takes two hands to clap and I am fully aware of the
                        starting position that the giver and receiver should be equally culpable.
                        But that is only the starting position. It is always important to examine
                        the circumstances of each case in order to get the right balance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">He then proceeded to propose that for <em>receivers</em> of bribes, “the size of the bribe received has
                    a direct bearing on the punishment to be meted out” (at [14] of the GD Appendix) as it represents
                    the benefit received from the offence and therefore their culpability. However,
                    for <em>givers</em> of bribes, at least on these facts, the
                    size of the bribe ought not to be “linked directly to the punishment to
                    be borne” (at [17] of the
                    GD Appendix), for the reasons summarised at <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Despite his professed awareness of the
                    principle that givers of corrupt gratification generally bear equal culpability
                    to receivers (as stated by Yong CJ in <em>Chua Tiong
                        Tiong</em> at [21]), the DJ
                    seems to have unfortunately strayed from this principle. To the extent that his
                    view was based on a finding of fact that Ang, as a giver of bribes, did not
                    benefit directly from the offences, I did not accept the DJ’s reasoning as
                    correct, and my reasons are set out at <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a>
                    below. It would suffice to state at this juncture that taken to its logical
                    conclusion, his reasoning seemed to imply a general rule that a giver of a bribe
                    is always less culpable than a receiver of the same bribe, since the
                    blameworthiness of the giver is not proportional to the size of the bribe. This
                    distinction would be, if nothing else, a direct contradiction of the principle
                    stated in <em>Chua Tiong Tiong</em>, a decision which was
                    binding on the DJ. In addition, however, I considered that the distinction was
                    wrong in principle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     First of all, I should point out that the size
                    of the bribes in a corrupt gratification offence is not only linked to the
                        <em>culpability</em> of the offender. Rather, it is
                    also related to the <em>harm</em> caused by the offence
                    (see the discussion of harm and culpability as basic sentencing factors in
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang</em>
                    [2007] 4 SLR(R) 753 at [46]–[50]). One of
                    the reasons for the prohibition on corruption is society’s expectation
                    that transactions and decisions, whether in the private or public sphere, are
                    carried out fairly and transparently (see <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> above). This expectation is intrinsically linked with the
                    public interest in such fair dealing. The higher the amount of a bribe, the
                    greater the corrupt influence exerted on the receiver. This in turn
                    presumptively leads to a greater subversion of the public interest: larger
                    bribes generally lead receivers into graver transgressions. For this reason, the
                    size of a bribe is assessed along with the importance of the transaction sought
                    to be influenced as an important factor relating to the harm caused by a
                    corruption offence. As an objective harm-related factor, the size of the bribe
                    is equally relevant to the sentencing of givers and receivers of bribes,
                    contrary to the DJ’s approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     As for the relevance of the size of bribes to
                    culpability, the DJ seemed to have fallen into a basic misunderstanding of the
                    giver’s interest in the enterprise of corrupt gratification. In most
                    cases, the size of the bribe demanded or accepted reflects the greed of the
                    receiver for monetary gain and therefore his culpability (see <em>Zhao Zhipeng</em> at [37]–[39], where a
                    receiver of bribes was found to be less culpable due to a lack of personal
                    greed). In addition, it usually and equally reflects the level of influence or
                    advantage the giver wishes to secure through the bribe. Larger bribes are almost
                    always given to obtain greater illegitimate advantages from the receiver, which
                    normally reflects more personal gain sought by the giver. Such a motivation
                    would ordinarily indicate a higher degree of culpability. Of course, the link
                    between the size of the bribes and culpability would have to be established on
                    the facts of each case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The size of the bribe may be material to
                    sentencing in another way. In cases of corruption involving large sums of money,
                    the offenders are often persons of some means, to whom the threat of a monetary
                    fine of up to $100,000 (as prescribed by s 6 of the PCA) would be a mere
                    slap on the wrist that is insufficiently punitive or deterrent to meet the
                    relevant sentencing considerations in corruption cases. As I said in <em>Public Prosecutor v Wang Ziyi Able</em> [2008]
                    2 SLR(R) 1082 (at [29]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It should be acknowledged that fines for the well heeled often fail to
                        amount to either sufficient or meaningful deterrence. … Sentencing
                        judges should painstakingly seek to ensure that the punishment adequately
                        addresses the harm caused by the offence in these circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Beyond erring in principle in this area, the
                    DJ was also mistaken in applying the applicable authorities. While it is true
                    that the cases referred to at <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> of the GD
                    and cited by the Prosecution below all related to custodial sentences imposed on
                    receivers of bribes, the Prosecution’s submissions also referred to
                        <em>Lim Teck Chye</em>, which concerned a giver of
                    bribes in the private sector who was given a custodial sentence. The DJ seemed
                    to have overlooked this significant aspect of <em>Lim Teck
                        Chye</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Factual basis for sentencing</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Ang’s culpability</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Having addressed the areas where the
                    DJ’s sentencing approach were wrong in principle, I turned to his findings
                    on the relevant facts. The first set of findings concerned Ang’s level of
                    culpability in the offences. The DJ made two findings relevant to culpability.
                    The first of these was that the particular roles played by Ang in the Seagate
                    Charge and the Infineon Charge pointed to a low level of culpability (see
                        <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     I did not agree with this finding. With
                    respect to the Seagate Charge, one ought to note that Ang was the only person
                    from AEM involved in the decision to give the bribe. He took the initiative to
                    contact Ho to accede to the latter’s request for kickbacks. While there
                    may have been an element of commercial pressure involved (which may partly
                    explain the DJ’s reference to [21]
                    of <em>Chua Tiong Tiong</em>, cited at <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> above), I did not think that this pressure
                    was sufficient to substantially reduce Ang’s culpability. After all, it is
                    part of the normal cut and thrust of business that clients or suppliers often
                    threaten to take their business elsewhere in order to extract favourable
                    concessions. The situation was not at all comparable with, for instance, that in
                        <em>Zhao Zhipeng</em>. There, mitigation was granted
                    because the offending football player, a foreigner, was found to have accepted
                    bribes under the “dominion” of his team manager, on whom he was
                    largely or entirely dependent for his livelihood in Singapore, and in
                    circumstances where the offender was far away from his support network of
                    friends and family (see <em>Zhao Zhipeng</em> at [38]–[39]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     As for the Infineon Charge, while Tok might
                    have played a major role in the transaction, Ang admitted that the decision to
                    give a bribe was jointly taken between him and Tok, who were both joint managing
                    directors of AEM. Both of them travelled to Malacca to carry out the corrupt
                    transaction. Ang fully participated in the whole process of bribing short of
                    physically handing the money over to GC Tan. For these reasons, I found that for
                    both charges, Ang’s role disclosed a high degree of
                culpability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The DJ’s second finding on culpability
                    was that Ang’s culpability did not have direct correlation to the size of
                    the bribes indicated (see <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above). I did
                    not accept his reasoning. As discussed above at <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a>–<a href="#p1_49">[49]</a>, the DJ was
                    wrong in principle in finding that the culpability of givers of bribes does not
                    correspond with the size of the bribes. The DJ also made the related finding
                    that Ang did not benefit directly from the bribes, besides some potential
                    reputational gain on his part as CEO of AEM. This was not correct. In the course
                    of submissions, I was informed by counsel for Ang that Ang was the owner of 10%
                    of the shares of AEM at the material times. Under AEM’s profit-sharing
                    scheme, he was entitled to a maximum of 15% of a certain percentage of
                    AEM’s net profit before tax (ranging from 6% to 12%). He personally stood
                    to benefit monetarily from any illicit business advantage gained by AEM through
                    the bribes. All these considerations indicated a higher degree of culpability
                    than that assessed by the DJ.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Finally, the DJ stated that the
                    “principle of proportionality” should operate as between Ang and
                    AEM considering that the money came from AEM for AEM’s benefit. I could
                    only infer that the DJ was making a comparison between the relative
                    blameworthiness of AEM and Ang, but if so, I did not quite see the point of such
                    a comparison. For one thing, AEM’s part in this affair, if any, has not
                    been determined and is therefore irrelevant for present purposes. Moreover, any
                    potential culpability on the part of AEM is separate from that of Ang.
                    Ang’s high degree of culpability was shown in his role in giving the
                    bribes (see <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a>–<a href="#p1_52">[52]</a> above); the source of the money was
                    immaterial to that issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Aggravating and mitigating factors</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The DJ acknowledged that Ang’s position
                    as CEO of AEM and the fact that AEM was a listed company were aggravating
                    factors. He also recognised several mitigating factors, such as Ang’s
                    cooperation with the authorities, his agreement to be a prosecution witness and
                    his early plea of guilt (see <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above). I
                    saw no reason to disagree with these findings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     However, it was the DJ’s
                    characterisation of Ang as a “whistleblower” deserving a weighty
                    discount in mitigation that caused me grave concern. The DJ thought that Ang,
                    motivated by altruism, had voluntarily disclosed information that started a
                    process of investigation into AEM’s affairs, eventually leading to the
                    uncovering of secret corruption within the company (see <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The mitigating value in an offender
                    surrendering himself to the authorities even before investigations have caught
                    up with him was recognised by Yong CJ in <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Siew Boon Loong</em> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 611 at
                        [15]–[18]. It stands to reason that if there is
                    mitigating value in proactively disclosing one’s own crimes to the
                    authorities, there must be even more in disclosing the crimes of one’s
                    accomplices at the same time. The public interest in such disclosures,
                    especially for crimes which are usually difficult to detect, is obvious and
                    needs no further elaboration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     It is true that our courts have not previously
                    had the opportunity to consider in detail what exact mitigating value should be
                    given for whistleblowing. However, I took the view that this was not a case that
                    required an explication of the applicable principles for such cases. The reason
                    for this was that I did not accept that Ang, factually speaking, deserved the
                    honorific distinction of being called a “whistleblower”. While I
                    do not propose to offer an exhaustive definition of the term here, some key
                    features distinguished Ang from the archetypical whistleblower.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     First of all, Ang did not directly implicate
                    himself in his initial October 2005 disclosures to AEM’s board of
                    directors. Those disclosures focused mainly on alleged wrongdoings by Tok and to
                    a lesser extent Kammy Choo. He only admitted personal wrongdoing directly when
                    he was placed under investigation by CPIB later in May 2007. Secondly, Ang did
                    not at any point voluntarily contact CPIB or any other appropriate authority.
                    After his October 2005 disclosures, AEM began a slow process of internal
                    investigation, the details of which it persistently refused to release to Ang.
                    This dragged on until December 2006 with Ang taking no action to contact the
                    authorities. At the end of that period, Ang (when AEM failed to respond to his
                    queries) did not choose to contact any law enforcement agency but instead
                    informed ST Micro, a client of AEM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The significance of these facts was that they
                    did not paint the picture of a genuinely remorseful offender motivated by a
                    desire to come clean and reverse the wrongdoings he had participated in. Rather,
                    Ang seemed mainly motivated by a personal vendetta against Tok which appeared to
                    have arisen in the context of boardroom intrigue at AEM. Any effect his
                    disclosures would have in exposing wrongdoing on his or anyone else’s part
                    to appropriate scrutiny struck me as incidental to his plan at best. If
                    Ang’s real purpose was to engage the due process of law regarding the
                    illegal acts he would have contacted the relevant authorities at an earlier
                    stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     For these reasons, I did not accord Ang any
                    additional mitigation beyond recognising his high degree of cooperation with
                    CPIB <em>after</em> he was placed under investigation as
                    well as his early plea of guilt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Application of the precedents</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Turning to the precedents relating to
                    corruption in a private sector commercial setting, I was conscious of
                    Yong CJ’s statement in <em>Soong Hee Sin v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 475 (at [12]) that sentencing involves a
                    “hotchpotch” of varied factors and that the unique combinations of
                    facts in the precedents may therefore not permit straightforward application.
                    However, a broad pattern can be discerned from the existing precedents. Cases
                    involving a small number of charges and/or small amounts of gratification given
                    or received tended to be punished with fines. Examples include <em>Kwang Boon Keong Peter v Public Prosecutor</em> [1998]
                    2 SLR(R) 211 (gratification of $7,000 in three charges), <em>Yeoh Hock Lam</em> (gratification of $10,000 in one charge),
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Subramaniam s/o Muneyandi</em>
                    [2003] SGDC 259 (gratification of $50,000 in two charges) and <em>Public Prosecutor v Fong Kit Sum</em> [2008] SGDC 58 (gratification
                    of $34,869.21 in four charges, upheld on appeal in Magistrate’s Appeal
                    No 128 of 2007/02-03).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In contrast, sentences of imprisonment were
                    imposed where (and this is a non-exhaustive list) the amounts of gratification
                    were higher or the offences were committed over a long period of time (as in
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Chang Kar Yang</em> [2006] SGDC
                    85, notwithstanding the relatively low total gratification of $18,000 in six
                    charges). Custodial sentences have also been imposed based on special policy
                    considerations such as the public service rationale (as in <em>Lim Teck Chye</em>, where the total gratification was $6,300 in six
                    charges) or the protection of a certain industry from corruption (see <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> above). In <em>Lim Teck
                        Chye</em> it was also made clear at [78] that combinations of
                    aggravating factors could also bring a case above the custody
                threshold.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The District Court in <em>Yeoh
                        Hock Lam</em> attempted (at [24]) to suggest a specific amount of gratification (<em>viz</em>, $30,000) below which the custody threshold would
                    generally not be breached. On my part, I do not think the factual complexities
                    of the sentencing process permit such a precise figure to be provided. However,
                    I agree that the amount of gratification is an important factor in determining
                    whether the sentence should be custodial or not as it has a correlation with the
                    harm caused by an offence (see <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a> above)
                    and the potential need to deter the creation of a corrupt business culture at
                    the highest levels of commerce (see <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>
                    above). On the facts of this case, I found that the size of the bribes and the
                    high position of Ang in AEM’s hierarchy justified the imposition of a
                    custodial sentence. For the reasons discussed above, the DJ had erred both on
                    the facts and the applicable legal principles in finding that a non-custodial
                    sentence was appropriate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     With this in mind, I compared the present case
                    where the charges proceeded with involved bribes totalling $147,158, with
                    relatively recent precedents involving similar amounts. One such case was
                        <em>Wong Teck Long</em> (see <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> above), where the appellant was an assistant vice-president
                    and manager of private banking of a foreign bank who accepted corrupt
                    gratification of about RM300,000 (approximately S$150,000) in exchange for him
                    facilitating the granting of large credit facilities to certain individuals who
                    did not have the necessary net worth. In that case, Yong CJ found (at
                        [33]–[36]) that the high gratification sum, the
                    substantial loss of RM72.5m caused to the bank as a result of the corruption,
                    the element of abuse of trust, and the public interest in protecting the
                    reputation of Singapore’s banking industry justified a heavy deterrent
                    sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment in addition to a penalty of $150,000
                    under s 13(1) of the PCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     It was plain that the court in <em>Wong Teck Long</em> gave weight to a number of disturbing
                    factors that were not present in this case, such as a massive financial loss
                    caused to the bank employing the offender. In contrast, in this case there is no
                    evidence that the bribes, though of similar size, resulted in similar tangible
                    harm. The strategic importance of Singapore’s growing banking and finance
                    industry was also invoked (see <em>Wong Teck Long</em> at
                        [36]) to justify additional general
                    deterrence. Although Ang’s offences were very serious, there was no
                    evidence that such considerations were relevant in this case. <em>Wong Teck Long</em> was therefore distinguishable on its
                    facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Another relevant precedent was <em>Public Prosecutor v Tang See Meng</em> [2001] SGDC 161,
                    the facts and result of which were summarised in <em>Wong Teck
                        Long</em> at [37] as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>PP v Tang See Meng</em> [2001] SGDC 161
                            ("<em>Tang See Meng</em>"), the accused, while
                        acting as his employer's contracts manager, corruptly received gratification
                        sums on five occasions totalling $140,000 for recommending an award of a
                        sub-contract. He was convicted of five charges under s 6(<em>a</em>) PCA and sentenced to a total of six months’
                        imprisonment, and a penalty of $140,000, in default, four months’
                        imprisonment, was imposed on him. The accused's appeal against the sentence
                        was dismissed in Magistrate's Appeal No 62 of 2001.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Another case involving a similar amount of
                    gratification was <em>Wong Loke Cheng v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2003] 1 SLR(R) 522 (“<em>Wong Loke Cheng</em>”). This case was summarised in
                        <em>Wong Teck Long</em> at [40] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I also considered the case of [<em>Wong Loke
                            Cheng</em>]. In that case, the appellant, who was the executive
                        director of his employer company, was convicted of nine charges under
                            s 6(<em>a</em>) PCA for corruptly receiving a
                        total of US$90,377 (S$157,255.98) for recommending the charter of a vessel
                        to his employer. The appellant was sentenced to ten months' imprisonment,
                        and a penalty of S$157,255.98, in default, 18 months and six weeks'
                        imprisonment, was imposed on him. His appeal against conviction and sentence
                        was dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Although the facts in <em>Tang
                        See Meng</em> and <em>Wong Loke Cheng</em> seemed
                    more similar to the present case than those in <em>Wong Teck
                        Long</em>, certain differences were nevertheless of great relevance.
                    First, the offenders in those cases did not occupy such senior positions in
                    their respective companies as Ang did in AEM, aggravating Ang’s
                    culpability relative to those offenders. Second, the offenders in those cases
                    had claimed trial while Ang had pleaded guilty at an early stage. Third, I found
                    that Ang’s high degree of cooperation with CPIB’s investigations,
                    while not “whistleblowing”, deserved significant recognition; this
                    element was not present in <em>Tang See Meng</em> or
                        <em>Wong Loke Cheng</em>. Considering all the facts,
                    including the charges taken into consideration, I found that a sentence of six
                    weeks’ imprisonment for each of Ang’s charges, running consecutively
                    to give a total of 12 weeks’ imprisonment, would appropriately reflect the
                    need for general deterrence of such offences while accounting for the balance of
                    mitigating and aggravating factors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     There were three main reasons why I imposed
                    consecutive, rather than concurrent, sentences on Ang. First, although s 18
                    of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) did not apply,
                    since Ang was convicted of only two offences, that did not mean that Ang had
                    only <em>committed</em> two offences: he had been charged
                    with two other counts of corruption, to be taken into consideration for the
                    purposes of sentencing (see <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above). It
                    would not, in these circumstances, be an exaggeration to consider Ang a
                    “persistent or habitual offender” (see <em>ADF</em> at [146]). Second (but related to the first), it appeared
                    that there was a habit, if not culture, of corrupt business practice being
                    implemented by the top leadership at AEM, and as CEO, Ang had to take his fair
                    share of responsibility for this. Finally, the charges which were proceeded with
                        (<em>ie</em>, the Seagate Charge and the Infineon
                    Charge) pertained to distinct offences that were unrelated both in time and in
                    fact (see <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> and <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above). As such, consecutive custodial sentences were
                    required to give effect to an appropriately punitive and deterrent
                    sanction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     On the facts, I felt that the offences were
                    also serious enough to justify fines in addition to custodial sentences.
                    However, I believed that the fines imposed by the DJ were unjustifiably high.
                    The DJ had imposed the maximum fines available under the PCA for each charge. As
                    I stated in <em>Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 653 at [87], it is only
                    justified to impose a maximum sentence or near to it is if that particular
                    offence figures among the worst type of cases falling within that prohibition.
                    In relation to the sentence ordered by the DJ, I applied that principle to find
                    that the DJ’s sentence would only be justified if Ang’s offences
                    were among the worst type of corruption offences <em>that fell
                        below the custody threshold</em>. The DJ did not give any such
                    justification for imposing the maximum fines, nor could I find any. For this
                    reason, I set aside the fines imposed by the DJ and substituted fines of $25,000
                    for each of the charges against Ang.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In the light of the reasons described above, I
                    allowed the Public Prosecutor’s appeal. I set aside the sentence of the DJ
                    and substituted a sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of
                    $25,000 on each charge, each sentence of imprisonment to run consecutively. This
                    amounted to a total sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of
                    $50,000. As Ang had already paid a fine of $200,000 in accordance with his
                    sentence below, I ordered that the balance of $150,000 be refunded to him. By
                    operation of law, Ang was also disqualified from acting as a director from the
                    date of conviction to the end of a period of five years from the date of his
                    release from prison pursuant to s 154(1) read with s 154(4)(<em>b</em>) of the Companies Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     I allowed Ang’s request that he be
                    allowed to commence his sentence on 1 June 2011, and that he also be
                    permitted to travel on business in the interim. However, I increased his bail
                    amount from $100,000 to $150,000 (the amount to be refunded to
                him).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Finally, it remains for me to express my
                    gratitude to all counsel involved in this appeal for their helpful and
                    comprehensive submissions.</p>
