<p class="Judg-Author">
        Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the judgment of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal raises the question as to who was
                    responsible for a motor accident involving Gajentheran Marimuthu
                    (“Gajentheran”), who was riding a motorcycle and T Johaselvan
                    (“Johaselvan”), who was driving a lorry and, if it was Johaselvan
                    who was responsible, whether there was contributory negligence on the part of
                    Gajentheran. Gajentheran is the plaintiff in the action and the first respondent
                    in this appeal. Johaselvan is the second defendant in the action and his
                    employer, the first defendant. The first and the second defendants are the
                    appellants in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       As a result of the accident, Gajentheran was
                    seriously injured. The collision took place between 5.10pm and 5.20pm on 1
                    February 2013 at the junction of Tuas West Road and Tuas Link 4. Gajentheran was
                    riding his motorcycle along Tuas West Road in the direction of Tuas Checkpoint.
                    Following behind him, on a second motorcycle, was Mohd Rosli Wadi bin Mat Nor
                    (“Rosli”), and a pillion rider, Mohd Daud bin Mat Nor
                    (“Daud”). And following behind them, on a third motorcycle, was
                    Mohd Paqmi bin Md Arifin (“Paqmi”). Paqmi and Rosli were joined as
                    third parties in the action and are, respectively, the second and third
                    respondents in this appeal. We should mention that all the three motor-cyclists
                    and the pillion rider were, at the time, colleagues working for the same
                    employer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       When the motor-cyclists were about to proceed
                    into the junction, the lorry driven by Johaselvan made a right turn into Tuas
                    Link 4 from the opposite direction. The lorry cut into the path of the
                    motor-cyclists. Gajentheran, riding on the first motorcycle, collided with the
                    middle part of the left side of the lorry and skidded underneath the lorry.
                    Rosli and Daud, riding on the second motorcycle, collided with the front part
                    (also on the left side) of the lorry.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>
                    Paqmi, riding on the third motorcycle, claimed to have swerved right and thus
                    avoided the lorry entirely. The trial judge accepted Paqmi’s evidence.
                    However, the appellants maintain that Paqmi collided with the lorry as well. We
                    will return to this dispute later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In any event, all three motor-cyclists and the
                    pillion rider sustained injuries and damages to their motorcycles. Four actions
                    were instituted by them – these proceedings, which concern only the claims
                    of Gajentheran, and three other proceedings in the State Courts which concern
                    the claims of Rosli, Daud and Paqmi. Notwithstanding these separate actions, the
                    parties have appropriately agreed to be bound by the findings of fact made in
                    these proceedings.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       It is common ground that there are three
                    straight-going lanes on Tuas West Road in the direction the motor-cyclists were
                    travelling. Nearer to the junction itself, there is an additional lane for
                    vehicles which wish to turn right. For convenience, we shall refer to the lanes,
                    counting from the left side of the road (taking bearing from the direction the
                    motor-cyclists were travelling) as lanes 1, 2 and 3. The turning lane will be
                    referred to as lane 4. It is also common ground that at the relevant time,
                    traffic was heavy. According to Gajentheran, Rosli, Paqmi and Daud, there was a
                    traffic jam on lanes 2 and 3.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The circumstances giving rise to the accident is
                    disputed. The main dispute is on the question of in whose favour the traffic
                    lights were at the material time. Johaselvan says that he made the right turn
                    when the green turning arrow of the traffic lights lit up in his favour and the
                    lights were red against traffic going straight in both directions. He says that
                    the vehicles at lanes 1, 2 and 3 on the opposite side had already stopped and
                    were not proceeding into the junction. Thus he made the turn. He says that
                    Gajentheran and the other two motor-cyclists beat the red traffic lights which
                    were against them when they crossed into the junction. However, Gajentheran,
                    Rosli and Paqmi give a different story; they say that the traffic lights were
                    still green in their favour. They accept that Johaselvan also faced green
                    traffic lights, which meant that he could make a right turn across the junction
                    if it was safe to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       So the first issue we have to determine is
                    whether the green arrow for turning was in fact lit up in favour of Johaselvan
                    when he made the right turn. The trial judge found against Johaselvan. But
                    counsel for the appellants sought to argue that as the vehicles from the
                    opposite side had come to a halt at the stop line, that necessarily suggested
                    that the red lights had appeared and that the green arrow had also appeared
                    allowing Johaselvan to make the right turn. She emphasised, in particular, that
                    there is no yellow box at the junction so motorists were not required to stop
                    before the junction even if there was a jam ahead. She said it was unlikely that
                    motorists would be so considerate as not to proceed into the junction on their
                    own volition so as not to block it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The other evidence relevant to this dispute is:
                    (a) Johaselvan’s affidavit evidence that he sighted “a few other
                    motor cycles which rode past the front and rear of the lorry” after he
                    alighted from the lorry following Gajentheran’s motorcycle’s
                    collision with the lorry,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> (b) Johaselvan’s admission during
                    his cross-examination that the traffic lights were green “for the
                    motorcyclists” at the point of collision;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> and (c)
                    Johaselvan’s retraction of that admission and his further explanation
                    during re-examination that the traffic lights merely “changed to
                    green” after the collision.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> In their written submissions,
                    the appellants acknowledge that the presence of oncoming traffic would mean that
                    the traffic lights were green for the motor-cyclists, but argue that the traffic
                    lights had changed from red to green between the time of the accident and
                    Johaselvan’s observation of the oncoming traffic.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The appellants rely on
                    Johaselvan’s statement during re-examination that the traffic lights
                    “changed to green”, which they say is the “truthful
                        statement”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The respondents reject this argument.
                    Counsel for Rosli and Paqmi point out that at least 25s must have elapsed from
                    the point when the steady green arrow appeared to the moment when the traffic
                    lights changed to green for the vehicles coming from the same direction as the
                    motor-cyclists. Essentially, the counterargument is that the accident could not
                    have occurred when the green turning arrow lit up because Johaselvan would not
                    have taken 25s to make the right turn, apply the emergency brakes, check the
                    left wing mirror, and pull up the handbrake before making the crucial
                    observation of the oncoming traffic as he walked to the right rear of the
                        lorry.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In our view, this contention is at best
                    speculative as there is hardly any objective evidence to indicate whether 25s
                    would have passed while these events took place. Estimates as to time of this
                    nature can be most unreliable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     But what remains unexplained is
                    Johaselvan’s admission at one point of the cross-examination that the
                    traffic lights were green “for the motorcyclists”. That line of
                    cross-examination began with a reading of a Johaselvan’s affidavit.
                    Johaselvan’s attention was drawn to his own evidence that a few other
                    motorcycles rode past the front and the rear of the lorry to avoid it.
                    Johaselvan then agreed with counsel for Rosli and Paqmi that <em>at the point of collision and in the seconds after the collision, the
                        lights were showing green</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> To our
                    minds, this is cogent evidence of the traffic lights at the material
                    time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     As earlier mentioned, the appellants’
                    explanation for that condition is that the traffic lights were already red
                    against the motor-cyclists and those vehicles coming from the same direction.
                    Thus they stopped. In support of this claim, they point to the evidence from the
                    three motor-cyclists and Daud that vehicles on the lanes to their right
                        (<em>ie</em>, lanes 2 and 3) had stopped.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The other explanation,
                    advanced by the respondents, is that there was a build-up of traffic or a
                    “traffic jam at the front”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> which discouraged
                    vehicles from entering into the junction, even though there is no yellow box at
                    the junction to prohibit vehicles from remaining stationary within the junction.
                    Both explanations are possible. But when the evidence of the vehicles having
                    stopped is weighed together with Johaselvan’s momentary admission that the
                    traffic lights were green “for the motorcyclists” as well as the
                    improbability of the three motor-cyclists beating the red lights sequentially,
                    we think that the respondents’ explanation is likelier. On a balance of
                    probabilities, we find that the traffic lights were green when the three
                    motor-cyclists proceeded into the junction. In any event, we do not find that
                    the weight of the evidence is so compelling as to require us to hold that the
                    finding of the trial judge was necessarily wrong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The second point of dispute is whether the
                    three motor-cyclists were riding on the road shoulder or on lane 1. This issue
                    is closely intertwined with the aftermath of the accident, which we will now
                    briefly describe. The final resting position of the lorry was just immediately
                    before the pedestrian crossing at Tuas Link 4; the front wheels of the lorry
                    were just inches away from the dotted pedestrian crossing line.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> From the
                    measurements taken of the lorry and the junction,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> and the images of the
                        junction,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> we have observed that the front of
                    the lorry was in line with the grass verge and the back of it was in line with
                    the road shoulder. No part of the lorry protruded into the area in front of lane
                    1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The appellants advance the argument that the
                    final resting position of the lorry and the two spots on the left side of the
                    lorry, where Gajentheran’s and Rosli’s motorcycles collided with it,
                    indicate where both of them were travelling from before their respective
                    collisions with the lorry. They rely on Johaselvan’s evidence that the
                    latter “immediately stopped”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> upon feeling an impact
                    on the left side of the lorry. Since the lorry stopped in front of the road
                    shoulder, and no part of the lorry protruded into the area in front of lane 1,
                    they say that all the three motor-cyclists must have been riding along the road
                    shoulder before Gajentheran and Rosli collided with the lorry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     We find this argument to be improbable in
                    relation to Gajentheran. There would have been a time lapse between experiencing
                    the impact and the lorry actually stopping. The normal reaction time for
                    surprised drivers is between 1.41s and 1.84s.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Johaselvan was a
                    surprised driver. On Johaselvan’s own account, he did not see the traffic
                    on his left as he made the right turn.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> He reacted to stop only
                    when he felt a collision. At a speed of 10km/h to 15 km/h, the expert, Dr
                    Shane Richardson (“Dr Richardson”), stated that the distance
                    travelled during the reaction time would have been 3.9m to 7.7m. He also stated
                    that upon applying the emergency brakes, the lorry could have travelled a
                    further distance of 0.8m to 1.8m before coming to a complete halt. In total, the
                    point of the collision is probably 4.5m to 9.4m away from the rest
                        position.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> That seems correct to us.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The significance of Dr Richardson’s
                    report is that it explains how the lorry could have been in front of lane 1 when
                    Gajentheran collided with it. It supports Gajentheran’s case that he came
                    into the junction from lane 1 and collided with the lorry that was in front of
                    lane 1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Although the photographs of the site of the
                    accident show a concentration of debris in front of the grass verge and the road
                    shoulder, this does not weaken our inference that Gajentheran’s collision
                    occurred while the lorry was still in the position in front of lane 1. First, it
                    is common ground that there were at least two collisions. Assuming that the
                    debris resulted from a collision, there is no evidence that the debris came from
                    Gajentheran’s motorcycle. Second, after the accident, the traffic from
                    Tuas West Road (<em>ie</em>, from the same direction as the
                    motorcyclists) continued to move ahead despite the accident. The same
                    photographs show vehicles proceeding across the junction from lane 1. These
                    photographs were taken sometime after the accident – between the time of
                    the arrival of the first ambulance and the second ambulance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> Any
                    debris in front of lane 1 caused by Gajentheran’s collision with the lorry
                    would undoubtedly have been disturbed by the incessant moving traffic. What
                    debris that remained on the road after a while would have little probative value
                    in determining the spot at which Gajentheran’s motorcycle collided with
                    the lorry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     A corollary of our finding that
                    Gajentheran’s collision occurred in front of lane 1 is that he and his
                    motorcycle must have been dragged forward by the momentum of the lorry to its
                    final resting position. We recognise the lack of evidence, such as blood streaks
                    or gorge marks, to show that Gajentheran and his motorcycle were so dragged.
                    However, the alternative would be to hold that Gajentheran and his motorcycle
                    were not dragged at all because the lorry came to an instantaneous stop. In our
                    view, that could not have been the case because it would mean that there was no
                    need for any reaction time, which is physically impossible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     As for Rosli and Paqmi, their positions are
                    different. We find that they were riding on their motorcycle on the road
                    shoulder just before Rosli’s collision or Paqmi’s swerve to the
                    right. We rely on Rosli’s oral evidence that his motorcycle hit the front
                    part of the lorry.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> As we have mentioned
                    earlier, when the lorry came to a complete halt, the front of the lorry was in
                    line with the grass verge. We also rely on the fact that the lorry was likely to
                    be close to its final resting position by the time of Rosli’s collision.
                    Very shortly after Gajentheran’s motorcycle collided with the lorry,
                    Johaselvan applied emergency brakes. This could be just before or after
                    Rosli’s collision with the lorry. But, once the emergency brakes were
                    applied, the evidence from Dr Richardson establishes that the lorry would have
                    moved only minimally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Taking all these circumstances into account,
                    we find that the part of the lorry which Rosli collided with was in line with
                    the road shoulder. Consequently, Rosli could not have been riding on lane 1; if
                    he was riding on lane 1, he would not have collided with the lorry; this is
                    because the lorry would not have been in his way.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The same position applies to the third
                    motor-cyclist, Paqmi. By the time Paqmi entered into the junction, the lorry
                    would have been even closer to its final resting position, if it had not already
                    stopped. Therefore, if Paqmi was riding on lane 1, the lorry would not have been
                    in his way and he need not have swerved right to avoid colliding with the lorry.
                    The trial judge found that he had so swerved. The damage to his motorcycle is
                        slight.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> That is consistent with his claim that the
                    damage was sustained from a fall onto the road. Accordingly, we find that Paqmi
                    was also riding on the road shoulder immediately before he entered the road
                    junction and therefore had to swerve right to avoid a collision with the
                    lorry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The third point of dispute concerns the
                    possible aggravation of Gajentheran’s injuries by Rosli and Paqmi. The
                    appellants argue that Rosli and Paqmi should be responsible for some of
                    Gajentheran’s injuries because they were caused by the further impacts
                    from Rosli’s and Paqmi’s collisions with the lorry. The scope of
                    this argument is necessarily constrained by our earlier findings. Paqmi must be
                    immediately ruled out as having caused any aggravation of Gajentheran’s
                    injuries since he did not collide with the lorry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     This leaves Rosli to be considered. Johaselvan
                    presents an account of how he saw that one of the wheels of Rosli’s
                    motorcycle hit Gajentheran’s midriff as a result of Rosli’s
                    collision with the lorry. Johaselvan also says that the wheel of Rosli’s
                    motorcycle was pushed further underneath the lorry and on top of Gajentheran by
                    the impact from Paqmi’s motorcycle.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> However, we
                    have difficulties with this account. First, Paqmi did not collide with the
                    lorry. Second, Rosli could not have collided with Gajentheran who was underneath
                    the lorry, if the position of Gajentheran was near the letters
                    “CO” of the phrase “JOO YONG CO., (PTE) LTD” painted
                    on the side of the lorry carriage,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> and the point
                    of Rosli’s collision with the lorry was to the left of the first letter
                        “J”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> Third, Johaselvan did not see
                    Rosli’s collision. This must be pitted against Rosli’s evidence that
                    his motorcycle hit neither Gajentheran nor Gajentheran’s
                        motorcycle.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> In the circumstances, given
                    the irreconcilable testimonial evidence and the limited physical evidence
                    available, it is far too speculative for us to hold that Rosli aggravated
                    Gajentheran’s injuries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     We now turn to the second main issue –
                    the question of contributory negligence on the part of Gajentheran. We find that
                    he, as well as Rosli and Paqmi, were travelling at an excessive speed. The
                    undisputed fact is that traffic was heavy at the time of the accident. Even
                    though the three motor-cyclists were travelling within the speed limit, they
                    were not travelling at a safe speed in the given conditions. Gajentheran’s
                    own evidence is that he was riding at 80 km/h. Rosli and Paqmi said their speed
                    then was 60km/h to 70km/h.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> We think it more likely than not that
                    they were travelling at 70 km/h, trying to keep up with Gajentheran who was
                    riding at 80 km/h. They were obviously anxious to get to their homes in Johor as
                    soon as possible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Speeding is specifically pleaded by the
                    appellants. We find in favour of the appellants that the three motor-cyclists
                    were negligent in approaching the junction in a heavy traffic situation at that
                    kind of speed, especially Gajentheran who was going at 80 km/h. If they had
                    ridden at a lower speed, they might well have avoided the collision.
                    Paqmi’s near-miss illustrates the point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     It follows from our finding of contributory
                    negligence on the part of Gajentheran that he may not recover his damages
                    entirely from the appellants. But Rosli’s and Paqmi’s negligence had
                    no bearing on the damages sustained by Gajentheran. Naturally, they should not
                    have to contribute to the damages Gajentheran claims against the
                    appellants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In the result, we reduce the appellants’
                    liability to Gajentheran by 15% to take into account the latter’s
                    contributory negligence. We allow the appeal in part to this
                extent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Finally, on the question of costs, parties are
                    requested to let us have their submissions on it within two weeks.</p>
