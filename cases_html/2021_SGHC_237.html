This was the question in Summons No 4004 of 2021 (“SUM 4004”). I held that by virtue of O 3 r 3 of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”), the Writ of Summons had not expired when served on the following Monday. As there does not appear to be any local decision on this point, I set out my reasons below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The material facts are not disputed. The first defendant, Dr Quek Swee Chong (“Dr Quek”) is a Senior Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist with the second defendant, ASC Clinic for Women Pte Ltd (the “Clinic”). The plaintiff, Ms Chantell Glenville (“Ms Glenville”) was a patient of Dr Quek and the Clinic. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Ms Glenville alleged that Dr Quek and/or the Clinic breached their contractual duties and/or were negligent in the medical examination, diagnosis, advice, treatment and care rendered to her. She therefore applied for a Writ of Summons (the “Writ”), which was issued on 1 February 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 On 29 July 2021, Ms Glenville’s lawyers, Braddell Brothers LLP (“BB”) informed the defendants’ lawyers, Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP (“Dentons”) that Ms Glenville had commenced Suit No 117 of 2021 against the defendants, and asked Dentons to confirm if Dentons had instructions to accept service of the Writ on behalf of either or both of the defendants.

</div> They submitted that while a writ of summons (that is issued for service within the jurisdiction) should be served within six months beginning with the date of its issue, this is not because there is any provision in the ROC that prescribes that a plaintiff <span class="font-italic">must</span> serve the writ of summons within six months. Instead, this is but a logical consequence of the fact that: (a) a writ of summons must be served on each defendant (O 10 r 1(1) of the ROC); and (b) for the purposes of service (within jurisdiction), a writ of summons is only for a period of six months at first instance (O 6 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC).

</div> The plaintiff submitted that O 3 r 3 of the ROC was one such rule to which O 6 r 4 of the ROC was subject to.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 I was unable to agree with the defendants that the ROC does not prescribe a time by which a writ of summons must be served. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Order 6 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC states that the validity period of six months in the first instance for a writ is “for the purposes of service”. In other words, the ROC prescribes that for the purposes of service, a writ <span class="font-italic">must</span> be served within six months in order to be valid. The thrust of the defendants’ submission was that there is no explicit language that the plaintiff “must” serve the Writ within six months. However, O 6 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC effectively requires that. It was, after all, the basis on which the defendants objected to the plaintiff’s failure to serve the Writ by 31 July 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Let me take another provision of the ROC as an example. Order 12 r 4(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the ROC states that in the case of a writ served within jurisdiction, “the time limited for appearing” is “[eight] days after service of the writ”. That provision does not use the explicit phrasing that the defendant “must” appear within eight days after the service of the writ, but it is clear from O 12 r 4(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the ROC that if the defendant wants to appear, he <span class="font-italic">must</span> do so within eight days after the service of the writ. The defendants acknowledged that O 3 r 3 of the ROC could apply to O 12 r 4(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the ROC. But there is little material difference between O 12 r 4(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the ROC and O 6 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC. Both contain a specified period for an action, without explicitly mandating that a certain act <span class="font-italic">must</span> be done within a certain time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Further, <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2021 </span>vol 1 (Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2021), at para 3/3/2 (which relates to O 3 r 3 of the ROC) recognises that “[i]f a period of limitation expires on a day which is not a working day, a writ issued on the next available working day will still be in time and within the relevant limitation period”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 That same paragraph also cites <span class="font-italic">Pritam Kaur v </span><span class="font-italic">S. Russell &amp; Sons Ltd</span> [1973] QB 336 (“<span class="font-italic">Pritam Kaur</span>”). The question there, before the English Court of Appeal, was whether the writ was issued within the time required by s 2 (1) of the Limitation Act 1939 (c 21) (UK) (“Limitation Act 1939”), which states: “The following actions shall not be brought after the expiration of three years from the date on which the cause of action accrued …” The limitation period there expired on a non-working day and the writ was served on the next working day in the court offices. The court thus had to decide whether the writ was validly served. Whilst the court was concerned with the Limitation Act 1939, it drew a parallel with the English Rules of Court. At p 349, Lord Denning said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The nearest parallel is the case where a time is prescribed by the Rules of Court for doing any act. The rule prescribed in both the county court and the High Court is this: If the time expires on a Sunday or any other day on which the court office is closed, the act is done in time if it is done on the next day on which the court office is open. I think we should apply a similar rule when the time is prescribed by statute. By so doing, we make the law consistent in itself: and we avoid confusion to practitioners. So I am prepared to hold that when a time is prescribed by statute for doing any act, and that act can only be done if the court office is open on the day when the time expires, then, if it turns out in any particular case that the day is a Sunday or other dies non, the time is extended until the next day on which the court office is open.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The limitation period in <span class="font-italic">Pritam Kaur</span> should have expired on 5 September 1970, which was a Saturday. However, Lord Denning held that the plaintiff had until 7 September 1970 (a Monday) to issue her writ and so the issuance of the writ on 7 September 1970 was valid. The other judges agreed with Lord Denning.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The court in <span class="font-italic">Pritam Kaur</span> was concerned with the <span class="font-italic">validity</span> of the writ, because after the limitation period expires, there is no cause of action open to the plaintiff. In the present case, we are also concerned with the <span class="font-italic">validity</span> of the writ, albeit in relation to the six-month validity period under O 6 r 4 of the ROC. For all material purposes, there is no difference between the two situations. If anything, the willingness of the court in <span class="font-italic">Pritam Kaur</span> to treat the writ as valid when served on the next working day, thereby avoiding the expiry of the limitation period, when there was no such saving provision in the Limitation Act 1939, reinforces the argument here that where there is O 3 r 3 of the ROC, O 3 r 3 of the ROC should operate to allow the validity of the writ to similarly be preserved for the purposes of O 6 r 4(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC, for service on the next working day.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Accordingly, my view is that on a plain reading of O 3 r 3 of the ROC, the validity of the Writ would have been extended to Monday, 2 August 2021.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Legal regime relating to the validity and renewal of a writ of summons under O 6 r 4 of the ROC</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The defendants’ second argument was that O 6 r 4(2) of the ROC sets out a regime whereby the six-month validity period is absolute and does not countenance the operation of O 3 r 3 of the ROC. Order 6 r 4(2) of the ROC reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Subject to paragraph (2A), where a writ has not been served on a defendant, the Court may by order extend the validity of the writ from time to time for such period, not exceeding 6 months at any one time, beginning with the day next following that on which it would otherwise expire, as may be specified in the order, if an application for extension is made to the Court before that day or such later day (if any), as the Court may allow.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The defendants submitted that under O 6 r 4(2) of the ROC, even if the writ expires on a Saturday, the writ must be renewed so as to remain valid from the next day, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Sunday.

</div> They also argued that a writ of summons can be served on a non-working day, including Saturday and Sunday. Therefore, if a plaintiff cannot serve the writ on the Saturday on which the writ expires, he has to renew the writ.

There is nothing in the language that suggests that O 6 r 4 of the ROC creates an “absolute” regime.

Nor does the operation of O 3 r 3 of the ROC undermine the legal regime set out in O 6 r 4 of the ROC. The effect of O 3 r 3 of the ROC is that where the validity of the writ expires on a Saturday, which is a non-working day, it can be validly served on the next working day, which is the following Monday. But in situations where the writ expires and O 3 r 3 of the ROC is unable to assist, a plaintiff would need to seek extension of the validity of the writ as provided for under O 6 r 4(2) of the ROC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Accordingly, my view is that the legal regime under O 6 r 4 of the ROC does not exclude the operation of O 3 r 3 of the ROC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">History of the amendments to O 3 r 3 of the ROC</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The defendants’ third argument was that under the old ROC (Rules of Court (1997 Rev Ed)), the previous version of O 3 r 3 of the ROC would not have applied to writs of summons because the service of the writ need not be done at the Registry.

</div> A defendant’s right to rely on the defence of limitation would also accrue on that same day. If the current O 3 r 3 of the ROC were to now apply to extend the validity of writs of summons which expired on a non-working day, it would significantly alter a defendant’s legal right, as the defendant can now only rely on the defence of limitation on the next working day. The Rules Committee that proposed the amendments would surely have expressly made it clear if it intended to do so. That the Rules Committee was silent on the amendments to O 3 r 3 of the ROC would therefore strongly suggest that a defendant’s right to rely on the defence of limitation did not change after the amendments to the ROC.

First, unlike the old O 3 r 3, the current O 3 r 3 of the ROC clearly does not contain any language limiting its application to acts to be done <span class="font-italic">at the </span><span class="font-italic">Registry</span> – rather, the current O 3 r 3 applies to “any act” for which a certain time has been prescribed by the ROC or by any judgment, order, or direction. Second, unlike the old O 3 r 3, which only concerned days when the Registry was closed, the current O 3 r 3 clearly does not contain any language limiting it to Registry closures. The courts have also applied the current O 3 r 3 without such constraints. For example, in <span class="font-italic">CSR South East Asia Pte Ltd (formerly known as CSR Bradford Insulation (S) Pte Ltd) v Sunrise Insulation Pte Ltd</span> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 1079, the court applied the current O 3 r 3 of the ROC in relation to the defendants’ obligation to make payment to the plaintiffs directly following a consent order (at [4], [11]). This does not involve the Registry. Similarly, there is no prohibition against applying the current O 3 r 3 of the ROC to extend the validity of a writ, a situation which also does not involve the Registry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 It would also be onerous to expect a Rules Committee to state all the potential legal implications arising from an amendment, failing which it does not extend into that legal area, even if the plain language of that provision allows for it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Accordingly, my view is that the history of the amendments of O 3 r 3 of the ROC does not support the argument that O 3 r 3 of the ROC does not have the effect of deeming a writ that has expired on a Saturday to be valid for service on the next working day.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 For the reasons given above, I dismissed SUM 4004 and found the Writ to have been validly served on 2 August 2021.
