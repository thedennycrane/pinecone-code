<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an application by Mdm Toh Seok
                    Kheng (“the plaintiff”) for, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, a declaration that the marriage entered into between Ms
                    Huang Huiqun (“the defendant”) and the late Mr Yeo Sze Heng
                    (“the deceased”) on 20 December 2005 (“the
                    marriage”) was a sham marriage. Having heard the submissions of counsel
                    for both parties, I dismissed the application. I now give the reasons for my
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The material and undisputed facts were these.
                    The plaintiff was the mother of the deceased who died intestate on 9 June
                    2009. The defendant was a Chinese national. The deceased had entered into the
                    marriage without informing his family of it although he was close to them and
                    had been living with his parents for over forty years. After the marriage, the
                    deceased continued to live with his family and apart from the defendant. Up to
                    his death, he did not disclose his marital status to his family. After the
                    deceased’s unexpected demise, the defendant appeared at his funeral and
                    revealed to his family that she was his wife. The deceased’s family was
                    shocked and did not accept the legitimacy of the marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff applied for a grant of letters of
                    administration of the deceased’s estate (“the estate”) on
                    15 July 2009. On 7 October 2009, the defendant lodged a caveat in
                    court because she too intended to apply for a grant of letters of
                    administration. The plaintiff responded by making the present
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Submissions, analysis and decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In the plaintiff’s submissions, it was
                    argued that the marriage was a sham marriage for the following reasons. First,
                    it was alleged that the purpose behind the marriage was to facilitate an
                    application for Singapore permanent residency status for the defendant.
                    Secondly, it was asserted that even after the marriage, the deceased had
                    conducted his life as though he was a bachelor, and had never introduced the
                    defendant as his wife to the rest of his family. Thirdly, it was alleged that
                    the deceased was compelled by the defendant to enter into the
                marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The defendant disputed the plaintiff’s
                    allegations relating to the first and third reasons for the marriage to be
                    declared a sham marriage. Her rebuttals, however, were irrelevant because, even
                    assuming all the allegations and assertions made by the plaintiff were true,
                    Singapore law does not recognise any such creature as a “sham
                    marriage”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Before dealing with the plaintiff’s
                    arguments proper, a preliminary issue must be addressed. The plaintiff’s
                    counsel argued that what was being sought here was not a “declaration to
                        <em>invalidate</em> the marriage” between the
                    defendant and the deceased, but a declaration that the marriage was a
                        “<em>sham marriage</em> in keeping with public
                    policy considerations” [emphasis added]. I did not accept this artificial
                    construction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Ignoring for a moment the non-existence of a
                    legal concept of “sham marriage” which entails legal consequences,
                    the plaintiff had for the purposes of this application clearly argued for the
                    existence of a sham marriage as a means to <em>invalidate</em> the marriage or to render it <em>void</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       This was apparent from a comparison between the
                    second and third prayers of the application. The second prayer was for an order
                    for the estate to be distributed according to s 7 r 5 of the Intestate
                    Succession Act (Cap 146, 1985 Rev Ed) (“ISA”) if the
                    court was to find the marriage to be a sham marriage. In the alternative, the
                    third prayer was for an order for the estate to be distributed according to
                    s 7 r 4 of the ISA, if there was <em>no</em> sham
                    marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Although rule 5 is subject to the rights of the
                    surviving spouse as provided in rule 4, its purpose is to address the situation
                    where a deceased left behind a parent or parents but no descendants. It is rule
                    4 which expressly contemplates the situation where the deceased left behind both
                    a spouse and a parent or parents. If the plaintiff thought that a declaration of
                    a sham marriage would not amount to a declaration of a void marriage, then she
                    would not have asked for a distribution according to rule 5 where there was a
                    sham marriage; or where there was no sham marriage, for a distribution according
                    to rule 4. In both cases, assuming that a sham marriage does not amount to a
                    void marriage, it was rule 4 that would be applicable. By comparing the nature
                    of the alternative reliefs claimed, it was clear that what was being sought was
                    in substance either a declaration to invalidate the marriage or a determination
                    that the marriage was void, on the ground that it was a sham
                marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sham marriage</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Neither the term “sham marriage”
                    nor its synonym “marriage of convenience” has been defined locally
                    by statute or case law. What is certain is that it is pejorative. The concept of
                    a sham marriage probably arises as a corollary to the socially constructed idea
                    of an “authentic marriage”. The idea that marriage has a special
                    moral status and involves established moral obligations is both commonly held
                    and philosophically contentious.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     As the idea of marriage as a contract achieves
                    prominence, questions have been posed as to how far its obligations and the
                    motives for entering into it can be amenable to individual choice. The
                    contractual perspective of marriage implies that spouses can choose marital
                    obligations to suit their interests, and can choose to get married for myriad
                    reasons. To others, however, the good of marriage consists precisely in the
                    restrictions it imposes on individual choice. This institutional perspective of
                    marriage holds that the purpose of the institution sets out its obligations and
                    overrides the spouses’ wills. What these institutionally-mandated
                    obligations consist of remains contested; and the tension between the
                    contractual and institutional perspectives of marriage upon which the concept of
                    a sham marriage rests cannot be resolved by the courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     For present purposes, I need not enter into
                    the debate as to what amounts to a sham marriage. Insofar as the plaintiff was
                    relying on there being a sham marriage as a ground to invalidate the marriage,
                    the legal position is both clear and settled – the court cannot declare a
                    marriage void on a ground other than those provided for in s 105 of the
                    Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the
                    Charter”). It was held in <em>Tan Ah Thee and another
                        (administrators of the estate of Tan Kiam Poh (alias Tan Gna Chua),
                        deceased) v Lim Soo Foong</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 957
                        (“<em>Tan Ah Thee</em>”), that the
                    grounds for holding a marriage to be void are exhausted by s 105 of the
                    Charter. Those grounds do not include annulling a marriage because it was
                    entered into pursuant to motives which some might consider improper and may
                    therefore render it a sham marriage in their eyes. Nor do they include annulling
                    a marriage in which spouses continue to conduct their respective lives as though
                    they were unmarried.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The law as it stands abstains from prescribing
                    the “proper” motives for marriage and does not allow the
                    spouses’ private motives to undermine the validity of their marriage. In
                        <em>Vervaeke (formerly Messina) v Smith and others</em>
                    [1983] AC 145, the parties married for the singular purpose of
                    allowing the female party to continue working in England as a prostitute. The
                    House of Lords held that, as “horrible and sordid” as the marriage
                    was, the marriage was valid. Likewise the Singapore Court of Appeal in <em>Kwong Sin Hwa v Lau Lee Yen</em> [1993] 1 SLR(R) 90
                    (at [33]) approved of P Coomaraswamy J’s statement in <em>Ng Bee Hoon v Tan Heok Boon</em> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 335 (at
                    [49]) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my view, if a man and a woman (who are not barred from marrying each
                        other) exchange consents to marry with due formality before a person
                        lawfully authorised to solemnise a marriage under the Charter, intending to
                        acquire the status of married persons, it is immaterial that they intend the
                        marriage to take effect in some limited way or that one or both of them may
                        have been mistaken about, or unaware of, some of the incidents of the status
                        which they have created. To hold otherwise would impair the effect of the
                        whole system of law regulating marriage in Singapore, and gravely diminish
                        the value of the system of registration of marriages on which so much
                        depends. Marriage status is … of great public concern.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     While it might be thought legitimate to
                    prevent an abuse of marriage, it is crucial that what amounts to actionable
                    abuse, the measures to be taken against such abuse and whether such abuse, if it
                    exists, impinges on the <em>validity</em> of the marriage
                    are issues which are not to be determined by judicial fiat. These issues are
                    matters of public policy and are non-justiciable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     If there should be a public policy to exclude
                    persons from the rights they are entitled to on the basis of their marriage on
                    the premise that their marriage is perceived as not authentic because it does
                    not correspond to an assumed pattern of an authentic marriage, that public
                    policy is properly reserved to Parliament for articulation, delineation and
                    enactment. In relation to this point, counsel for the plaintiff referred to some
                    local cases (<em>eg</em>, <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Ng Ai Hong</em> [2007] SGDC 68) where the
                    parties involved were convicted for corruption for entering into “sham
                    marriages” for the purposes of facilitating one party’s acquisition
                    of immigration or residency benefits whilst the other party obtained monetary
                    gratification in return. The plaintiff’s counsel brought up those cases to
                    attempt to show that sham marriages are generally against public
                policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     However, I did not find them to be relevant.
                    Those cases are not authority for the proposition that the <em>validity</em> of a marriage, which must be determined solely
                    according to the Charter’s precepts, can be affected by the motives of the
                    spouses for entering into marriage. Those cases did not hold that contracting
                    such a “sham marriage” in itself offends against general public
                    policy and, <em>a fortiori</em>, nor did they hold that it
                    rendered the marriages in question void. The tenor of those cases was that when
                    parties used their validly constituted marital status to obtain something
                    available only to authentically married couples, they might be in breach of
                        <em>specific</em> laws which uphold <em>specific</em> public policies, which in those cases were immigration
                    policies. The outcome in those cases depended on whether the elements of those
                    laws were satisfied, and not on whether there was a sham marriage <em>per se</em>. The label of “sham marriage”
                    attached to those objectionable transactions served merely a descriptive
                    function in the course of analysis of whether those laws were
                breached.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     As the discussion above indicates, while
                    judges have used the term sham marriage, it is not a term of art and does not
                    create any legal implications in and of itself. Whether or not there are
                    actionable consequences flowing from a putative sham marriage would depend on
                    the existence of other laws which prohibit its incidents. Even then, unless the
                    particulars of the sham marriage involved the requirements stipulated by
                    s 105 of the Charter, the <em>validity</em> of the
                    marriage would remain unaffected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Hence, the deceased’s reasons for
                    entering into the marriage and how he behaved after marriage, even if they were
                    proved to be as the plaintiff asserted, were irrelevant in considering whether
                    the marriage was valid or not. The argument of a sham marriage to invalidate the
                    marriage therefore failed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Lack of valid consent by the deceased</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     To the extent that it was alleged that the
                    deceased did not validly consent to the marriage thereby rendering the marriage
                    a sham marriage which was void, the argument failed for the same reasons as
                    stated above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The plaintiff’s counsel did not seek to
                    argue that the alleged lack of valid consent rendered the marriage voidable
                    under s 106(<em>a</em>) of the Charter and should be
                    declared void. Had he done so, the argument was bound to fail for the reasons
                    stated in <em>Tan Ah Thee</em> (at [21], [26], [28], [30]
                    and [31]). First, the declaratory jurisdiction of the court could not be used to
                    declare a voidable marriage prospectively void because that would be to
                        <em>alter</em> the status of the marriage. Secondly,
                    s 104 of the Charter does not allow a stranger to the marriage to seek a
                    judgment of nullity. Thirdly, a judgment of nullity only operates from the time
                    the judgment was made final. This meant that the defendant, as the
                    deceased’s wife immediately prior to his death, qualified as his
                    “spouse” within the meaning of s 7 of the ISA. Hence, she
                    would still be entitled to her share of the estate even if a declaration of
                    nullity on the basis of a voidable marriage was obtained on the
                    plaintiff’s application, and she would also retain her prior right to
                    apply for letters of representation as the deceased’s widow. Finally, the
                    marriage between the deceased and the defendant had already been dissolved by
                    the death of the deceased under s 7(<em>a</em>) of the
                    Charter. Since the marriage was no longer in existence, it could not be declared
                    void for the future.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Grant of letters of administration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I did not grant the relief sought by the
                    plaintiff in her third prayer, which was to be allowed to be the sole
                    administrator of the estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The statutory provision governing the grant of
                    letters of administration is s 18 of the Probate and Administration Act
                    (Cap 251, 2000 Rev Ed) (“PAA”). The relevant
                    sub-sections state:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Although where a person dies intestate, the
                    court has a discretion under s 18, PAA as to whom to appoint as the
                    administrator of the deceased’s estate, the starting point is that the
                    person who is most suitable among the beneficiaries to be the administrator is
                    determined according to the priorities of entitlement to the deceased’s
                    estate under the laws of intestate succession. This is because the beneficiary
                    with the greatest entitlement to the deceased’s estate will naturally be
                    the person most interested in the estate of the deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The defendant, being the deceased’s
                    surviving spouse, had priority of entitlement to the estate by virtue of
                    s 7 of the ISA and she had a corresponding prior right over the plaintiff,
                    who was the deceased’s parent, in obtaining a grant of letters of
                    administration of the estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In fact, the defendant had taken steps to
                    apply for letters of administration at the time of the plaintiff’s
                    application. She had filed a caveat which gave her time to file an application
                    for the letters to be granted to her in preference to the plaintiff, who had
                    previously applied. The defendant had also expressed her intention to obtain the
                    letters of administration. Hence, the plaintiff’s application to be the
                    sole administrator of the estate failed on the merits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The plaintiff’s application to be made
                    the sole administrator of the estate was also wrong procedurally. If the
                    plaintiff wished to bring an interest action to contest the suitability of the
                    defendant to be the administrator despite the defendant’s prior right, she
                    was of course free to do so. However, a contentious action for the grant of
                    letters of administration is a “probate action” within the
                    definition of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed), O 72
                    r 1(2). As such, the procedural rules under O 72 which regulate
                    probate actions must be observed. It was held in <em>Jigarlal
                        Kantilal Doshi and another v Damayanti Kantilal Doshi (executrix of the
                        estate of Kantilal Prabhulal Doshi, deceased) and another</em> [1997]
                    2 SLR(R) 167 (at [21]) that the requirement for a probate action to be
                    begun by writ is mandatory and if the wrong procedure was adopted, it could be
                    said to be a “fairly serious error” that would justify a striking
                    out if such an application was made. It was thus an abuse of process for the
                    plaintiff to apply in an originating summons for a declaration to be made the
                    sole administrator of the estate in the face of a known contesting applicant for
                    letters of administration. The third prayer of the application was therefore
                    dismissed.</p>
