<p class="Judg-Author">
        V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Two persons in an intimate relationship, whether
                    married or otherwise, often acquire real property for communal and/or familial
                    and/or investment purposes. The property may be put in one person’s name
                    only (a “single-name” case) or in the names of both persons (a
                    “joint-names” case). One person may have contributed more to (or
                    even all of) the purchase price of the property, or it may be that both have
                    contributed equally. Alternatively, the parties may have had discussions on how
                    much of a stake each of them should have in the property. Suppose that some (or
                    many) years later, the relationship breaks down, and the parties then disagree
                    over who is entitled to the beneficial ownership of the property. Suppose,
                    further, that the legal owner(s) of the property never executed a declaration of
                    trust in relation to the property. What then is the legal
                position?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       If the parties are married and they initiate
                    matrimonial proceedings, matrimonial legislation applies, and each party will
                    secure what the court determines is just and equitable from the pool of
                    matrimonial assets (see s 112(1) of the Women’s Charter
                    (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed)). If the parties are not married, then the
                    dispute over the beneficial ownership of the property is simply determined by
                    the usual applicable common law principles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Disputes of this nature –
                    <em>viz</em>, disputes over the beneficial ownership of
                    property which is used by parties in a marital, quasi-marital, familial or other
                    intimate relationship, where the legal title to the property is vested in one or
                    more of the parties – are the focus of this judgment. For conciseness, we
                    shall, where appropriate in this judgment, refer to such disputes as
                    “property disputes”, and as “domestic property
                    disputes” specifically where they arise in a domestic context, <em>ie</em>, in relation to property which is used for domestic
                    purposes (“domestic property”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In the present case, two octogenarians were
                    involved in a tussle over the beneficial ownership of 24 Chancery Lane
                    (“the Property”). The Property is registered in the wife’s
                    sole name. It is said to be currently worth about $20m. An unusual feature of
                    these proceedings is the fact that neither the wife nor the husband commenced
                    – or indicated any intention to commence – matrimonial proceedings.
                    The question of who is entitled to the beneficial ownership of the Property
                    therefore falls simply to be decided by the applicable common law principles,
                        <em>ie</em>, the law of trusts. For completeness, we
                    should mention that, sadly, the wife passed away after the appeal was heard.
                    Counsel nevertheless agree that this development has no bearing on the outcome
                    of this appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       At a broader level, this case provides an
                    opportunity to revisit <em>Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye Terence
                        and another</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 (“<em>Lau Siew Kim</em>”). Over the course of the last few years,
                    some issues have arisen in a number of High Court decisions as to the proper
                    application of <em>Lau Siew Kim</em>. This appeal provides
                    a useful opportunity for clarifying the legal position on those issues. We shall
                    also examine a number of recent developments in this area of the law, some of
                    which were canvassed by the trial judge (“the Judge”) in his
                    judgment below (reported in <em>See Fong Mun v Chan Yuen
                        Lan</em> [2013] 3 SLR 685 (“the
                Judgment”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The appellant, Mdm Chan Yuen Lan
                    (“Mdm Chan”), and the respondent, Mr See Fong Mun
                    (“Mr See”), married in 1957. Their three children,
                    Mr See Hang Chong (“SHC”), Ms See Seow Meng
                    (“SSM”) and Mr See Hung Yee (“SHY”), were born
                    in 1958, 1960 and 1962 respectively. The children grew up in Singapore, but
                    received their tertiary education abroad. SHC returned to Singapore in 1979;
                    SSM, in 1982; and SHY, in 1984. Mr See, by his own admission, also had a
                    mistress. He said that the affair started in 1988, while Mdm Chan said that
                    her husband’s infidelity began in 1979 or 1980. To this day, Mr See
                    still lives with his mistress.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Mr See is a self-made man. He developed and
                    owned an engineering business, and in 1955, he bought his first property, a
                    house at 11 Borthwick Drive (“the Borthwick property”). He
                    met Mdm Chan, a hairdresser, and married her in 1957. Mdm Chan quit
                    her job to become a full-time homemaker in or around January 1958. Initially,
                    Mr See and Mdm Chan lived in a rented unit at 15A Lorong 40
                    Geylang, but in 1967, this unit and the unit below (15 Lorong 40
                    Geylang) were purchased for $20,000 in Mdm Chan’s sole name. The
                    units were subsequently sold in 1972 for $60,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In 1969, Mr See bought two properties in
                    his sole name. One was a house at 100 Joo Chiat Walk (“the Joo Chiat
                    property”), while the other was a house at 41 Goldhill Avenue
                    (“the Goldhill property”). According to Mr See, the Goldhill
                    property was used as the family home. In the same year, Mr See incorporated
                    See’s Engineering Company Pte Ltd (“SEPL”) to take over his
                    engineering business. Mr See initially held 35% of SEPL’s shares and
                    Mdm Chan, 20%, with the remaining 45% shareholding dispersed among
                    Mr See’s extended family members.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In November 1975, Mr See executed a written
                    declaration of trust over part of his SEPL shares in favour of his three
                    children. Mdm Chan did the same over part of her SEPL shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Earlier, Mr See had in 1974 incorporated
                    Tat Mun Pte Ltd (“TMPL”) to hold his property investments.
                    Initially, Mr See and Mdm Chan held one share each in TMPL, but 50,000
                    shares were allotted to Mr See in 1975, making him the majority shareholder
                    of TMPL. In that same year, the Borthwick property and the Joo Chiat property
                    were transferred to TMPL. In 1980, all the SEPL shares held by
                    Mr See’s extended family members were transferred to TMPL, making
                    TMPL a 45% shareholder of SEPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In late 1983, the Property was purchased in
                    Mdm Chan’s name alone. The events surrounding this purchase
                    (“the Purchase”) are described in greater detail below at
                    [12]–[18].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events surrounding the Purchase </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The circumstances surrounding the Purchase
                    form the nub of the present dispute. In January 1983, Mr See turned 55. He
                    became entitled to withdraw his Central Provident Fund (“CPF”)
                    monies amounting to some $490,000, which he did. His affidavit evidence was that
                    he wished at that time to purchase a bungalow where his entire immediate family
                    could live together, so he instructed his eldest son, SHC, to begin looking for
                    a suitable property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In August 1983, SHC located the Property. The
                    asking price was $1.38m for the Property itself, with an additional $400,000
                    payable if the furniture and fittings were purchased as well. Mr See
                    instructed SHC to take an option to purchase the Property for $1.78m. Such an
                    option was duly given by the seller to SHC “and/or his nominee”.
                    The option was exercised by SHC in September 1983.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     An important meeting then took place between
                    Mr See, Mdm Chan and SHC around September or October 1983 (“the
                    1983 Meeting”). This was before completion of the Purchase. It is
                    undisputed that the parties agreed at that meeting that the Property would be
                    purchased in Mdm Chan’s sole name, and that Mdm Chan agreed then
                    to provide a sum of around $250,000 (her estimate of her life savings at the
                    time) for the Purchase.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Mr See’s case (supported by SHC)
                    was that the stated intention at the time of the 1983 Meeting was to minimise
                    the amount he would have to borrow from banks, in order to avoid paying
                    unnecessary interest. As a result, it was agreed at the 1983 Meeting that
                    Mdm Chan would provide an interest-free <em>loan</em>
                    of her life savings to Mr See, which would be repaid “in a year or
                    two”. It was also agreed – on one condition – that the
                    Property would be put in Mdm Chan’s sole name because Mdm Chan
                    had expressed a desire to tell her friends that she had a house in her name. The
                    condition was that Mdm Chan should acknowledge Mr See as the true
                    owner of the Property. Mr See said that Mdm Chan agreed to this
                    condition, and he then told SHC to instruct the lawyers to prepare the
                    “appropriate documents”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Mdm Chan, on the other hand, narrated a
                    very different version of the material events. She said that in exchange for
                    providing her entire life savings for the Purchase, the Property was to be owned
                    by her absolutely. There was no reason otherwise for her to take out all her
                    life savings to fund the Purchase. Contrary to what Mr See contended, the
                    money which she provided was not a loan. Indeed, at the 1983 Meeting,
                    Mdm Chan had referred to the Property as “My Money. My
                    House.” She needed the Property for financial security because of
                    Mr See’s infidelity, and not because she had any intention of
                    bragging to her friends that she owned a property in her name. According to
                    Mdm Chan, Mr See agreed to this to appease her over his affair and his
                    infidelity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     After the 1983 Meeting, but three days before
                    completion of the Purchase on 18 October 1983, Mdm Chan executed a
                    power of attorney (“POA”) in respect of the Property. By this POA,
                    Mdm Chan authorised Mr See and SHC to (among other things)
                    “take charge of, manage and improve my property” and, in
                    particular, sell the Property for such consideration as they saw fit and give
                    receipts for the monies received.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On 18 October 1983, the Purchase was
                    completed. A contemporaneous handwritten note was prepared by SHC, who listed
                    down the sources of the purchase price of the Property, which totalled
                        $1,831,758.90.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The breakdown recorded was as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     $290,000 from Mdm Chan (it
                        turned out that Mdm Chan had more than $250,000 in her life
                        savings);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     $400,000 from a HSBC Bank term loan in Mdm Chan’s name
                        (“the HSBC Term Loan”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     $400,000 from TMPL’s overdraft facility with HSBC

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events after the Purchase </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The parties and their three children moved
                    into the Property soon after it was purchased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In July 1984, TMPL became the sole shareholder
                    of SEPL. In November 1984, Mr See transferred all except one of his shares
                    in TMPL to SHC, SSM and SHY.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In 1986, about three years after the Purchase,
                    TMPL sold the Joo Chiat property for $265,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     On 21 August 1988, Mr See
                    purportedly dictated a memo (“the First Memo”) in which he stated
                    that he was the owner of the Property, and that Mdm Chan was only holding
                    the Property on his behalf (the full text of this memo can be found in the
                    Judgment at [6]). In the First Memo, Mr See also instructed his three
                    children not to make any direct or indirect claim against Mdm Chan in
                    connection with the Property. The signatures of all three children – but
                        <em>not</em> Mdm Chan – appeared at the
                    bottom of this memo. On the same day, Mr See purportedly dictated another
                    memo (“the Second Memo”) in which he stated that he had decided to
                    distribute the shares in TMPL and SEPL to his children and sought, <em>inter alia</em>, confirmation from them that they would not
                    remove him from his position as chairman and managing director of these
                    companies. Again, the signatures of the three children appeared at the bottom of
                    the Second Memo. At the trial below, SHC confirmed that he wrote the First Memo
                    and the Second Memo (collectively, “the two Memos”). According to
                    him, Mr See dictated the text to him in Cantonese and he then wrote it down
                    in English.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In the proceedings below, Mdm Chan (with
                    the support of SHY, one of the signatories of the two Memos) disputed the
                    creation of the First Memo. Her case was that the fictitious contents of that
                    memo were written in only <em>after</em> the
                    children’s signatures were executed so as to buttress Mr See’s
                    position in the action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     For many years, the status quo prevailed
                    – the Property remained in Mdm Chan’s sole name, and the POA
                    remained in force. Then, on 5 April 2011, Mdm Chan revoked the POA
                    (she claimed that SHC was trying to obtain the title deeds to the Property in
                    order to sell the Property). The revocation of the POA prompted Mr See to
                    seek a declaration that the Property belonged to him beneficially.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In his pleadings, Mr See averred that he
                    had provided the whole of the purchase price of the Property (SHC seemed content
                    to accept that the monies contributed by him could be attributed to
                    Mr See). According to Mr See, the sum of $290,000 which he had
                    obtained from Mdm Chan was merely a loan which was repaid about three years
                    after the Purchase, when the Joo Chiat property was sold in 1986 (see [21]
                    above) and the sale proceeds of $265,000 paid to Mdm Chan. Mr See also
                    denied that the presumption of advancement applied in favour of Mdm Chan,
                    relying on the 1983 Meeting, with the POA and the First Memo as evidence of this
                    meeting. Mr See thus sought a declaration that Mdm Chan held the
                    Property under a resulting trust for him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Mdm Chan conceded that she did not
                    provide the entire purchase price of the Property. According to Mdm Chan,
                    the Property was a gift from Mr See. She claimed that it was agreed that
                    she would own the Property absolutely, and this was evidenced by her willingness
                    to: (a) provide $290,000 in cash; and (b) allow her salary, bonuses
                    and dividends from SEPL and TMPL, as well as possibly her CPF funds, to be
                    applied towards the repayment of the HSBC Term Loan. In the alternative,
                    Mdm Chan resisted Mr See’s claim on the basis that the
                    presumption of advancement applied in her favour. Mdm Chan therefore
                    counterclaimed for a declaration that she was the true owner of the
                    Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In relation to the purchase price of the
                    Property, the Judge found that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_a"></a>(a)     The $290,000 provided by
                        Mdm Chan to Mr See for the Purchase was a loan which had been
                        repaid in full to Mdm Chan. In making this finding, the Judge noted
                        that Mr See was not able to produce any receipts evidencing repayment
                        of the $290,000, but commented (at [8] of the Judgment) that that was
                        “unsurprising” since the alleged repayment took place more
                        than two decades ago. The Judge placed greater emphasis on the fact that
                        Mdm Chan did not adduce any evidence refuting Mr See’s claim
                        that the $290,000 had been repaid in full, and also did not allude to any
                        requests for repayment over the years which were ignored by Mr See. The
                        $290,000 therefore <em>did not</em> represent a direct
                        contribution by Mdm Chan to the purchase price of the Property (see the
                        Judgment at [8]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_b"></a>(b)     Even though the HSBC Term Loan was taken out in Mdm Chan’s
                        name (see [18(b)] above), it was in fact Mr See who repaid that loan in
                        full. The Judge also found that it had been agreed at the time of the
                        Purchase that Mr See would be the one to repay the HSBC Term Loan.
                        Therefore, the amount represented by this loan should be taken as
                        Mr See’s direct contribution to the purchase price of the
                        Property (see the Judgment at [8]–[9]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_c"></a>(c)     Although TMPL was the borrower in name in
                        relation to the TMPL Overdraft (see [18(c)] above), it was undisputed that
                        Mr See controlled TMPL. For all intents and purposes, TMPL could be
                        equated with Mr See, and it would be entirely artificial to consider
                        that the liability undertaken for the TMPL Overdraft was not a direct
                        contribution from Mr See (see the Judgment at [9]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_d"></a>(d)     There was no credible evidence to
                        indicate that Mdm Chan had in fact contributed to the repayment of
                        either the HSBC Term Loan or the TMPL Overdraft. While SHY claimed that it
                        was well known that Mdm Chan had contributed a “substantial
                        sum” towards the Purchase either through “immediate financial
                        contributions at the time of acquisition or subsequent repayment of the
                        loans” (see the Judgment at [10]), SHY had no personal knowledge of
                        this, having returned to Singapore only after the Purchase (see, likewise,
                        [10] of the Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_e"></a>(e)     In view of the above, the Judge was satisfied that
                        Mr See had paid the whole of the purchase price of the Property (see
                        the Judgment at [10]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In relation to the presumption of advancement,
                    the Judge found that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"></a>(a)     The presumption of advancement was
                        rebutted on the facts. There was no convincing reason why Mr See would
                        spend so much money and incur substantial financial risks so that he could
                        give a large house to a woman with whom his marriage existed in name only. A
                        man nearing retirement age who had just fallen in love with another woman
                        was unlikely in the circumstances to scrape together $1.8m from multiple
                        sources to buy a house, which would undoubtedly have been his most expensive
                        acquisition, as a gift to his wife in name (see the Judgment at
                        [11]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"></a>(b)     The POA,
                        when viewed in the light of the circumstances at the time of the Purchase,
                        supported Mr See’s account that he did not intend to make an
                        outright gift of the Property to Mdm Chan and that Mdm Chan
                        accepted this arrangement (see the Judgment at [12]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_c"></a>(c)     Mdm Chan’s account that
                        Mr See took from her $290,000, which was less than 20% of the purchase
                        price of the Property, in exchange for placing the Property in her sole name
                        was neither realistic nor credible (see the Judgment at
                [12]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In relation to the First Memo (see [22]
                    above), the Judge found that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_a"></a>(a)     It was not possible from the face of
                        the First Memo to conclude that it was forged. The only evidence on the
                        authenticity or otherwise of this memo was the evidence of SHC (who had
                        transcribed the memo and who said that it was genuine) and SHY (who said
                        that the memo was a forgery and that he had never seen it until discovery).
                        The Judge found SHC a more measured and candid witness than SHY, and saw no
                        positive reason to believe SHY’s bare allegations (see the Judgment at
                        [7]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_b"></a>(b)     In any
                        event, the First Memo was of little probative value as it was executed five
                        years after the Purchase and was of limited relevance in discerning either
                        Mr See’s or Mdm Chan’s intentions at the time of the
                        Purchase (see the Judgment at [12]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Judge then went on to observe that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a>(a)     The facts of the case
                        “indicated a classic situation of a common intention constructive
                        trust – the defendant holding the legal title [o]n trust for the
                        plaintiff pursuant to an express agreement as to beneficial ownership prior
                        to the acquisition of the matrimonial home” (see the Judgment at
                        [17]). The constructive trust analysis was “a sounder solution [than
                        the resulting trust analysis] where proven express common intentions of the
                        parties [were] concerned” (see the Judgment at
                    [19]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a>(b)     Even though
                        Mr See’s pleaded claim was based on a resulting trust rather than
                        a constructive trust, he was still entitled to the Property. He had
                        contributed the entirety of the purchase price of the Property and had not
                        intended to give full beneficial ownership to Mdm Chan; the beneficial
                        interest in the Property thus resulted back to him (see the Judgment at
                        [19]–[20]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The arguments on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     On appeal, Mdm Chan submitted that the
                    Judge erred when he relied primarily on the credibility of the witnesses in
                    arriving at his decision that Mr See had full beneficial ownership of the
                    Property. She contended that the Judge failed to appreciate the significance of
                    the objective evidence in the form of certain contemporaneous documents (namely,
                    the POA and handwritten notes by SHC). The inference properly drawn from those
                    documents was that Mr See had agreed to gift the Property to Mdm Chan
                    in return for the latter contributing her life savings and her future income
                    from SEPL and TMPL to the Purchase – and the evidence showed that
                    Mdm Chan had indeed paid a substantial part of the purchase price of the
                    Property. In the alternative, Mdm Chan submitted, if there was no such
                    agreement to gift the Property to her, she was still entitled to rely on the
                    presumption of advancement, which was not rebutted by the objective
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In contrast, Mr See’s position on
                    appeal was that the Judge rightly found that: (a) Mdm Chan had agreed
                    to Mr See being the person who would repay the HSBC Term Loan; and
                    (b) the $290,000 contributed by Mdm Chan was meant to be a loan which
                    would be repaid by Mr See. Therefore, it was Mr See who had paid the
                    entire purchase price of the Property, and the presumption of resulting trust
                    arose in his favour. Independently of this presumption, Mr See submitted,
                    there was also direct evidence, in the form of the POA as well as his and
                    SHC’s evidence of what transpired at the 1983 Meeting, that he intended to
                    retain beneficial ownership of the Property. Thus, Mr See never intended to
                    benefit Mdm Chan, which was significant in two ways: it rebutted any
                    presumption of advancement which Mdm Chan said arose in her favour, and
                    more importantly, it gave rise to a resulting trust in Mr See’s
                    favour.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Notably, in his submissions before this court,
                    Mr See abandoned any serious reliance on the First Memo, preferring instead
                    to focus on the POA, SHC’s handwritten notes and the oral evidence given
                    by himself and SHC. Mr See’s counsel conceded that the First Memo was
                    hardly conclusive since Mdm Chan was not a signatory to it; moreover, it
                    was executed five years after the Purchase. We should point out here that the
                    Judge’s observation (at [12] of the Judgment) that the First Memo was
                    adduced primarily to support Mr See’s original pleading that SHY was
                    exercising undue influence on Mdm Chan was inaccurate. On the contrary, it
                    was clear from Mr See’s own pleadings that he was relying on the
                    First Memo to bolster his account of what took place at the 1983
                        Meeting.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">
<em>Lau Siew Kim</em> revisited</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     As mentioned earlier, the arguments deployed
                    before us centred on the device of the resulting trust. In particular, both
                    parties relied on this court’s decision in <em>Lau Siew
                        Kim</em> to bolster their submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In <em>Lau Siew Kim</em>,
                    the appellant married the respondents’ father (“the father”)
                    in December 2000. In April 2000, shortly before their marriage, the appellant
                    and the father bought a property as joint tenants. This property was their
                    matrimonial home, and a mortgage in both their names was taken out to
                    part-finance the purchase. In March 2004, the appellant and the father bought
                    another property as joint tenants. Again, a mortgage in both their names was
                    obtained to part-finance the purchase. The father passed away intestate in
                    November 2004, and the appellant, as the survivor, became the sole legal owner
                    of both properties. The respondents, who were the father’s sons, sought a
                    declaration that the appellant held the properties on trust for the
                    father’s estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     This court approved of the view that a
                    presumption of resulting trust arose when a person made a voluntary payment to
                    another person or paid (wholly or in part) for the purchase of property which
                    was vested in the other person (see <em>Lau Siew Kim</em>
                    at [34] and [46]). Since the appellant and the father had contributed unequally
                    to the purchase price of the properties, the presumption of resulting trust
                    arose. However, on the facts, a strong presumption of advancement (due to the
                    spousal relationship) also arose, which was not rebutted. Thus, the presumption
                    of advancement <em>itself</em> rebutted the presumption of
                    resulting trust, and the appellant held the properties absolutely (see <em>Lau Siew Kim</em> at [142] and [146]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In the proceedings below, Mdm Chan and
                    Mr See sought to prove that they had each contributed financially towards
                    the Purchase – Mdm Chan, that she had provided her life savings of
                    $290,000 plus her dividends, salary and bonuses from TMPL and SEPL; and
                    Mr See, that he had paid the whole of the purchase price of the Property.
                    As mentioned earlier (at [27(e)] and [28] above), the Judge found that
                    Mr See had contributed the whole of the purchase price, and that the
                    presumption of advancement was rebutted on the evidence. Accordingly, he ruled
                    that Mdm Chan held the whole of the Property on a resulting trust for
                    Mr See.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">What does the resulting trust respond to?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Professor Robert Chambers
                    (“Prof Chambers”), in his seminal book <em>Resulting Trusts</em> (Clarendon Press, 1997), argues that the
                    resulting trust is a response to a <em>lack of
                        intention</em> on the part of the person providing the purchase price
                    to benefit the recipient (the “lack-of-intention analysis”). In
                    other words, according to Prof Chambers, a resulting trust would arise
                    whenever the intention of the transferor to benefit the recipient is vitiated or
                    absent. This view has the judicial support of Lord Millett, who stated in
                    the Privy Council case of <em>Air Jamaica Ltd and Others v Joy
                        Charlton and Others</em> [1999] 1 WLR 1399 (at 1412):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Like a constructive trust, a resulting trust arises by operation of law,
                        though unlike a constructive trust, it gives effect to intention. But it
                        arises whether or not the transferor intended to retain a beneficial
                        interest – he almost always does not –since it responds to the
                        absence of any intention on his part to pass a beneficial interest to the
                        recipient.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Proponents of the lack-of-intention analysis
                    argue that it adequately explains why the different types of resulting trusts
                    arise. For example, it explains both: (a) the purchase price resulting
                    trust; and (b) the resulting trust that arises on the failure of an express
                    trust to exhaust the entire beneficial interest. However, critics have argued
                    that the lack-of-intention analysis expands the scope of resulting trusts beyond
                    acceptable bounds (see Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <em>Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough
                        Council</em> [1996] AC 669 (“<em>Westdeutsche</em>”) at 708–709). For example, if a
                    resulting trust arises whenever the intention to benefit the recipient is
                    vitiated, it is possible to argue that <em>whenever</em> X
                    pays Y money while labouring under a mistake, a resulting trust would arise over
                    the money because X’s intention to benefit Y has been vitiated by the
                    mistake. Indeed, under a wider thesis espoused by the late Prof Peter Birks
                    (in <em>Unjust Enrichment</em> (Oxford University Press,
                    2nd Ed, 2005) at p 305) and Prof Chambers (in <em>Resulting Trusts</em> at p 225) based on the lack-of-intention
                    analysis, a resulting trust would arise as a proprietary response to certain
                    instances of unjust enrichment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The other main competing (and more classical)
                    view of the nature of resulting trusts was espoused by
                    Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <em>Westdeutsche</em>. In
                        <em>Westdeutsche</em>, a bank transferred substantial
                    amounts of money to a local authority pursuant to swap agreements which were
                    subsequently held to be <em>ultra vires</em> the local
                    authority. Although it was not disputed that the bank was entitled to recover
                    the monies, the question arose as to whether compound or simple interest was
                    payable by the local authority. This in turn depended on whether the local
                    authority held the monies as a trustee at the point of receipt on the basis of a
                    resulting trust. In concluding that a resulting trust did not arise over the
                    monies, Lord Browne-Wilkinson rejected the lack-of-intention analysis of
                    the resulting trust. Instead, he explained (at 708) that a resulting trust arose
                    from the presumed <em>common intention</em> of the parties
                    (the “positive-intention analysis”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Under existing law a resulting trust arises in two sets of circumstances:
                        (A) [W]here A makes a voluntary payment to B or pays (wholly or in
                        part) for the purchase of property which is vested either in B alone or in
                        the joint names of A and B … (B) Where A transfers property to B
                        on express trusts, but the trusts declared do not exhaust the whole
                        beneficial interest … Both types of resulting trust are traditionally
                        regarded as examples of trusts giving effect to the common intention of the
                        parties. A resulting trust is not imposed by law against the intentions of
                        the trustee (as is a constructive trust) but gives effect to his presumed
                        intention. … [emphasis in original omitted]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     It has been suggested, however, that the
                    positive-intention analysis is not easy to reconcile with the case law on
                    resulting trusts. For instance, it is difficult to square this approach with the
                    cases in which the transferor had a clear intention to part with the beneficial
                    interest (<em>eg</em>, <em>Vandervell v
                        Inland Revenue Commissioners</em> [1967] 2 AC 291). Further,
                    there is no reason in principle why the recipient’s intention is relevant
                    to the creation of a resulting trust, and Lord Browne-Wilkinson’s
                    explanation blurs the distinction between resulting trusts and common intention
                    constructive trusts. Extra-judicially, Lord Millett has also criticised
                    Lord Browne-Wilkinson’s approach to resulting trusts in <em>Westdeutsche</em> as an “<em>unduly
                        narrow view</em>” [emphasis added] (see Peter Millett,
                    “Review Article: Resulting Trusts” (1998) 6 RLR 283 at
                    p 284).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The Judge, at [18] of the Judgment, expressed
                    the opinion that “<em>Lau Siew Kim</em> was
                    equivocal on whether the court was concerned with the transferor’s
                    intentions or both parties’ presumed intentions under a resulting trust
                    analysis”. In doing so, it appears that the Judge was alluding to the
                    fact that this court in <em>Lau Siew Kim</em>, while
                    endorsing Prof Chambers’ lack-of-intention analysis of the resulting
                    trust, also referred to the decision of Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <em>Westdeutsche</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     With respect, we disagree that <em>Lau Siew Kim</em> was equivocal. This court quite firmly
                    stated (at [35] of <em>Lau Siew Kim</em>) that a resulting
                    trust may arise independently of the presumption of resulting trust so long as
                    it can be shown that the transfer <em>was not intended to benefit
                        the recipient</em>, and conversely, a resulting trust may not arise if
                    it can be shown that the transfer was indeed intended to benefit the recipient.
                    The intention of the recipient is therefore irrelevant to the question of
                    whether a resulting trust has arisen. <em>Westdeutsche</em>
                    was referred to in <em>Lau Siew Kim</em> for the limited
                    purpose of illustrating the circumstances in which a resulting trust is presumed
                    to arise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     As can be seen from [38]–[41] above,
                    much ink has been spilt on the correct doctrinal basis of the resulting trust
                    (see, for example, Prof Chambers’ views in <em>Resulting Trusts</em>; William Swadling, “Explaining Resulting
                    Trusts” (2008) 124 LQR 72; and John Mee, “Presumed Resulting
                    Trusts, Intention and Declaration” [2014] CLJ 86). We are of the view
                    that going forward, the lack-of-intention analysis may potentially provide a
                    more sensible basis for the principled yet pragmatic development of this
                    equitable doctrine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In this regard, we note that several High
                    Court cases have already interpreted <em>Lau Siew Kim</em>
                    as an endorsement of the lack-of-intention analysis. For example, in <em>Yong Ching See v Lee Kah Choo Karen</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R)
                    957, Lai Siu Chiu J held at [41]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Lau Siew Kim</em> is significant as it clarifies
                        that first, a lack of consideration required for the presumption [of
                        resulting trust] is not a requirement for the resulting trust and secondly,
                        that the lack of intention to benefit the recipient required for the
                        resulting trust is precisely the fact being inferred when the presumption is
                        applied. … With an absence of intent to transfer beneficial
                        ownership, this operates to establish defective consent by the transferor.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Similarly, in <em>Lin Chao-Feng
                        v Chuang Hsin-Yi</em> [2010] 4 SLR 427, Judith Prakash J
                    held at [16]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The text, <em>Resulting Trusts</em> by
                        Robert Chambers (Clarendon Press, Oxford 1997), states at p 32 that the
                        facts which give rise to a resulting trust are:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    a transfer of property to
                            another,</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    in circumstances in which the provider does
                                not intend to benefit the recipient.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This statement of the law was accepted by the Court of Appeal in <em>Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye Terence</em> [2008]
                        2 SLR(R) 108 (“<em>Lau Siew
                        Kim</em>”) at [35].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     And more recently, Belinda Ang Saw Ean J
                    held in <em>United Overseas Bank Ltd v Giok Bie Jao and
                        others</em> [2012] SGHC 56 at [14]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Court of Appeal in <em>Lau Siew Kim</em>
                        explained that where a transfer of property to another takes place for which
                        the recipient does not provide the whole of the consideration, the lack of
                        intention to benefit the recipient on the part of the purchaser is the fact
                        that is being inferred when the presumption of resulting trust is applied.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     That said, we are mindful that the courts
                    should tread carefully in this area of the law because an unduly wide doctrine
                    of resulting trusts and the potential blurring of the distinction between claims
                    based on unjust enrichment and claims based on resulting trusts might have
                    unsettling effects on the rights of third parties and the security of commercial
                    transactions. For example, Prof Graham Virgo has pointed out in <em>The Principles of the Law of Restitution</em> (Oxford
                    University Press, 2nd Ed, 2006) at p 598:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [I]f the absence of intention analysis [of resulting trusts] is
                        to be recognized, it is vital to define the notion of the vitiation of the
                        claimant’s intent restrictively. … [J]ust because the
                        claimant’s intention to benefit the defendant has been vitiated for
                        the purposes of identifying a ground of restitution for unjust enrichment,
                        it does not necessarily mean that the claimant’s intention to benefit
                        the defendant has been vitiated for the purposes of identifying a resulting
                        trust. A more restrictive interpretation of when the claimant’s
                        intention will be vitiated needs to be adopted before a resulting trust can
                        be recognized.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The relevance of presumptions when there is direct evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Another issue which has arisen is the
                    relevance of the twin presumptions of resulting trust and advancement where
                    there is direct evidence of the intentions of the transferor. In the present
                    case, the Judge’s conclusions on the parties’ intention were made on
                    the basis of direct evidence adduced before him, and not through recourse to
                    either the presumption of resulting trust or the presumption of advancement (see
                    the Judgment at [16]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In <em>Lau Siew Kim</em>
                    at [59], this court expressed the view that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Just like the presumption of resulting trust, the presumption of
                        advancement is “no more than a long stop to provide the answer when
                        the relevant facts and circumstances fail to yield a solution”
                        … It should be treated as “an evidential instrument of last
                        resort where there is no direct evidence as to the intention of the parties
                        rather than as an oft-applied rule of thumb”: see <em>Teo Siew Har v Lee Kuan Yew</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 410
                            (“<em>Teo Siew Har</em>”) at [29].
                        … It is therefore apparent that the presumption of advancement will
                        operate only where there is no direct evidence that may reveal the intention
                        of the parties; only then will there be any necessity to <em>infer</em> or <em>presume</em> intention.
                        [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The above passage was subsequently read by
                    Lai J in <em>Neo Hui Ling v Ang Ah Sew</em> [2012]
                    2 SLR 831 (at [25]) as suggesting that “the two presumptions of
                    resulting trust and advancement should only operate when there is no evidence
                    from which to prove or infer the intention of the transferor”. We are in
                    broad agreement with Lai J on this point. It is true that there can
                    generally be no justification to resort to presumptions, however much they may
                    reflect the norms, customs and mores of society, if the court is faced with the
                        <em>actual</em> intentions and desires of the
                    transferor. In <em>Lau Siew Kim</em>, the father was no
                    longer alive; thus, it was necessary to rely on the presumptions and the
                    circumstantial evidence in order to divine his intentions with respect to his
                    contributions towards the purchase price of the properties in
                question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     However, the question in every case where the
                    claim is based on the existence of a resulting trust is still whether there is
                    any direct <em>evidence that may adequately reveal the intention
                        of the transferor</em>. In this regard, we endorse the observations of
                    Chan Seng Onn J in <em>Lim Chen Yeow Kelvin v Goh Chin
                        Peng</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 783 (at [116]) concerning the role of
                    presumptions where the evidence, although available, is unsatisfactory or
                    equivocal:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the court could discern a clear intention on the part of the deceased
                        to gift all the moneys in the joint account to the survivor from the
                        evidence before it, then there should be no need to apply any presumption of
                        a resulting trust to aid the fact-finding or decision-making process. Only
                        when the court is not able to find any clear intention or if the evidence is
                        inconclusive either way as to what the deceased’s real intention might
                        be, then in this rather limited and exceptional situation (where the
                        evidence is so finely balanced on either side) should the court apply the
                        evidential presumption of a resulting trust to tilt the balance in favour of
                        the estate of the deceased (who solely contributed the moneys in [the] joint
                        account).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The type of contribution which gives rise to the presumption of
                resulting trust</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In <em>Lau Siew Kim</em>,
                    this court affirmed (at [112]–[113]) that: (a) a resulting trust
                    crystallised at the time the property in question was acquired; and (b) as
                    a result, strict orthodoxy required the quantification of each party’s
                    share of the beneficial interest in the property to be determined by reference
                    to his financial contributions to the purchase price of the property at the time
                    the property was acquired. This court then considered (at [114]–[117])
                    what amounted to a “direct” contribution to the purchase price and
                    referred, <em>inter alia</em>, to the dicta of Peter
                    Gibson LJ in the English Court of Appeal case of <em>Curley
                        v Parkes</em> [2004] EWCA Civ 1515 (“<em>Curley</em>”) at [14]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Because of the liability assumed by the mortgagor in a case where
                        monies are borrowed by the mortgagor to be used on the purchase, the
                        mortgagor is treated as having provided the proportion of the purchase price
                        attributable to the monies so borrowed. Subsequent payments of the mortgage
                        instalments are not part of the purchase price already paid to the vendor,
                        but are sums paid for discharging the mortgagor’s obligations under
                        the mortgage …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Notwithstanding the conceptual straitjacket
                    limiting the types of payments which can be treated as “direct”
                    contributions to the purchase price of a property, this court sought to draw a
                    distinction (at [116] of <em>Lau Siew Kim</em>) between:
                    (a) contributions made to the repayment of a mortgage on the basis of an
                    agreement made when the mortgage was taken out; and (b) payments made
                    towards discharging a mortgage without any prior agreement, holding that only
                    the situation in (a) could give rise to a beneficial interest in the property
                    concerned by way of a resulting trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     On further reflection, we are minded to
                    consider whether this ought to be relaxed further to take into account the
                    realities of mortgage repayment. In <em>Modern Land
                        Law</em> (Routledge, 9th Ed, 2014), Dr Martin Dixon
                    (“Dr Dixon”) criticises the narrow view of mortgage
                    repayments taken by <em>Curley</em> (<em>viz</em>, that mortgage repayments can never count as contributions
                    towards the purchase price of the property), and argues persuasively that (at
                    p 176):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [I]t is not immediately apparent why repayment of a mortgage (or
                        the financing of its debt if the mortgage is interest-only) that was used to
                        purchase the property cannot be regarded as making a contribution to its
                        acquisition at the relevant time. It takes only a little imagination to
                        regard the mortgagee as the agent of the purchasers, paying at the time of
                        purchase, with the mortgagee being repaid as agent with interest by the
                        contributors. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>He reiterates these views in his article “Resulting and

                        79 (at pp 82–83) concerning the nature of mortgage
                        repayments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     We also note that in <em>Stack
                        v Dowden</em> [2007] 2 AC 432 (“<em>Stack</em>”), a case which we return to in much greater detail
                    below, Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury suggested (at [117]) that equitable
                    accounting could be invoked “in a suitable case” as a possible
                    mechanism for retrospectively adjusting, after the date of acquisition of the
                    property, the parties’ respective shares of the beneficial interest in the
                    property in a manner which was consistent with the resulting trust
                    analysis:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [L]iability under a mortgage … will normally be a
                        relevant, often a very important, factor, because, as Lord Walker
                        points out, the overwhelming majority of houses and flats are acquired with
                        the assistance of secured borrowing. There is attraction in the notion that
                        liability under a mortgage should be equivalent to a cash contribution. On
                        that basis, if a property is acquired for £300,000, which is made up of
                        one party’s contribution of £100,000, and both parties taking on
                        joint liability for a £200,000 mortgage, the beneficial interest would
                        be two-thirds owned by the party who made the contribution, and one-third by
                        the other. If one party then repays more of the mortgage advance, equitable
                        accounting might be invoked to adjust the beneficial ownerships at least in
                        a suitable case. Such an adjustment would be consistent with the resulting
                        trust analysis, as repayments of mortgage capital may be seen as
                        retrospective contributions towards the cost of acquisition, or as payments
                        which increase the value of the equity of redemption.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The strict rule concerning the attribution of
                    mortgage repayments (as evinced by, <em>inter alia</em>,
                        <em>Curley</em>) was once again questioned by
                    Lord Neuberger, this time sitting in the English Court of Appeal, in
                        <em>Laskar v Laskar</em> [2008] 1 WLR 2695
                        (“<em>Laskar</em>”) (discussed briefly
                    below at [141]). In considering how a £43,000 mortgage taken out in joint
                    names ought to be treated in a resulting trust situation, Lord Neuberger
                    observed at [27]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is obvious force in the claimant’s contention that, as she and
                        the defendant took out a mortgage in joint names for £43,000, for which
                        they were jointly and separately liable, in respect of a property which they
                        jointly owned, this should be treated in effect as representing equal
                        contributions of £21,500 by each party to the acquisition of the
                        property. It is right to mention that I pointed out in
                        paras 118–119 in [<em>Stack</em>] that,
                        although simple and clear, such a treatment of a mortgage liability might be
                        questionable in terms of principle and authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues arising in this appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In our view, considering that the parties
                    pleaded their cases based solely on the doctrine of resulting trust, the
                    following issues arise for our decision in this appeal:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_a"></a>(a)     Did Mr See pay the whole of the
                        purchase price of the Property
                    (“Issue 1”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_b"></a>(b)     Did Mr See intend to benefit Mdm Chan by the
                        contributions which he made to the purchase price of the Property
                        (“Issue 2”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_c"></a>(c)     If the evidence on Issue 2 is unsatisfactory and
                        inconclusive, did the presumption of advancement operate to rebut any
                        presumption of resulting trust
                (“Issue 3”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     As mentioned earlier, although the Judge
                    decided that Mdm Chan held the Property on a resulting trust for
                    Mr See, he suggested (at [17] of the Judgment) that the facts also
                    indicated “a classic situation of a common intention constructive
                    trust”. In view of the upheaval in this area of the law in England, we
                    propose to examine this suggestion briefly after considering the facts of the
                    instant case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Some preliminary observations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     As a preliminary point, we feel constrained to
                    make some observations on the state of the evidence and the witnesses in this
                    case. First, the daughter, SSM, was not called upon to testify at the trial. Her
                    evidence would have been of assistance in relation to the question of the
                    authenticity of the First Memo, of which she was a signatory.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Second, the lawyer who drafted the POA was not
                    called on to give evidence. According to Mr See, the lawyer no longer had
                    any personal recollection of the POA. His evidence, if available, would have
                    been of much assistance to the court in ascertaining the purpose of preparing
                    the POA and what Mdm Chan understood by executing the POA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Third, SHY was studying abroad in 1983 and
                    only returned to Singapore in 1984. He therefore had no personal knowledge of
                    any of the events leading up to the Purchase and could not offer any admissible
                    evidence on those events. As a result, Mdm Chan’s case rested
                    principally on her own evidence and her submissions of law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Fourth, and as adverted to by the Judge
                        (<em>eg</em>, at [10] of the Judgment), the oral
                    testimony of Mdm Chan was not very helpful to the court as she had lost
                    most, if not all, of her memory of the relevant events which transpired. Her
                    common refrain in cross-examination was that she had forgotten or did not know
                    what had happened at the material time. This is <em>not</em>, of course, meant to be a criticism of her in any
                    way.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Mdm Chan’s memory deficit
                    underscores the fifth point that we wish to make here, which is that the events
                    surrounding the Purchase took place some three decades earlier. That was a very
                    long time ago. It was therefore understandable that the documentary evidence in
                    this case was not complete. That said, we note that some potentially vital
                    evidence was not adduced (whether due to the effluxion of time or to other
                    reasons).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     We are acutely aware that an appellate court
                    should be slow to overturn a trial judge’s findings of fact, especially
                    where they hinge on the trial judge’s assessment of the credibility and
                    veracity of witnesses, unless: (a) the findings can be shown to be plainly
                    wrong; or (b) the conclusions reached by the trial judge are against the
                    weight of the evidence; or (c) the inferences drawn by the trial judge are
                    not supported by the primary or objective evidence on record. With regard to the
                    trial judge’s assessment of the credibility and veracity of witnesses,
                    this court very recently held in <em>Sandz Solutions (Singapore)
                        Pte Ltd and others v Strategic Worldwide Assets Ltd and others</em>
                    [2014] SGCA 27 (at [50]–[56]) apropos cases where the material events took
                    place a long time ago:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">50    … [A] witness’s ability to recollect
                            the material events and the accuracy of his recollections are inversely
                            proportional to the length of time that has elapsed from the occurrence
                            of the events to his appearance on the witness stand. …
                            <em>A court should thus be slow to label a witness
                                untruthful where there are gaps in his recollection of events after
                                a significant period of time has elapsed between the occurrence of
                                the events in question and the trial.</em> As a rule of thumb,
                            the longer the lapse of time between the happening of the event or
                            matter being recollected and the witness’s appearance on the
                            witness stand, the less the reliance that should be placed on pure oral
                            evidence and the more searching the court ought to be in assessing and
                            testing that evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">54    Witnesses are also particularly vulnerable and
                            susceptible to suggestion and misinformation where the passage of time
                            has allowed the original memory to fade. As pithily observed by
                            Elizabeth F Loftus in “When A Lie Becomes Memory’s
                            Truth: Memory Distortion After Exposure to Misinformation” (1992)
                            1 Curr Dir Psychol Sci 121, “[i]n its weakened condition,
                            memory – like the disease-ridden body – becomes especially
                            vulnerable to repeated assaults on its very essence” (at
                            p 121). …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">56    The above is meant to highlight the danger of
                            over-reliance on the recollection of witnesses in the witness stand.
                            Conversely, a witness should not be found to be less credible merely
                            because of gaps in his memory, particularly where a long period of time
                            has passed since the occurrence of the events in question. We reiterate
                            that ultimately, the trial judge has to consider the <em>totality</em> of the evidence in determining the veracity,
                            reliability and credibility of a particular witness’s evidence.
                            This includes contemporaneous objective documentary
                        evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In reaching his decision, the Judge, having
                    found SHY and Mdm Chan to be unreliable witnesses, was much more willing to
                    give Mr See and SHC the benefit of the doubt whenever there were
                    difficulties with their evidence. In contrast, difficulties with
                    Mdm Chan’s evidence were not charitably assessed and were taken to
                    buttress Mr See’s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     This brings us to our sixth observation. Our
                    review of the evidence inclines us to respectfully disagree with the
                    Judge’s assessment of Mr See’s and SHC’s credibility. We
                    agree with counsel for Mdm Chan, Ms Engelin Teh SC, that whether
                    the First Memo was fabricated had a material impact on the credibility of
                    Mr See’s and SHC’s evidence. Mdm Chan contended that the
                    First Memo was fabricated by Mr See and SHC to support Mr See’s
                    version of what transpired at the 1983 Meeting. In support of this contention,
                    SHY pointed out that the two Memos were both written on paper purporting to be
                    “Circular Resolutions”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> of a
                    company which was not named, and that he, SHC and SSM, being directors of SEPL
                    and TMPL, were in the habit of pre-signing blank directors’ circular
                    resolutions. SHY averred that the text of the First Memo was written only after
                    the memo had been pre-signed by SHC, SSM and him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The Judge held (at [7] of the Judgment) that
                    since “neither [SHC’s nor SHY’s] account was inherently
                    unbelievable”, his finding as to whether the First Memo was fabricated
                    “could only be based largely on credibility”. On that basis, he
                    decided that the First Memo was not fabricated, but had no probative value as to
                    the events which took place during the 1983 Meeting. With respect, having viewed
                    actual copies of the two Memos tendered in evidence and having regard to the
                    procedural history behind the production of these documents, we have grave
                    doubts as to their authenticity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     As mentioned, the First Memo was allegedly
                    prepared on the same day as the Second Memo. A visual inspection of the Second
                    Memo suggests that the body text was written only after the signatures of SHC,
                    SSM and SHY were already on that memo as the last line was deliberately written
                    closer to the penultimate line so as to avoid crossing over the
                        signatures.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> In fact, some of the words in the last
                    line appear to curve over the top of SHC’s signature in order to avoid
                    crossing over his signature. In our view, this is somewhat suspicious and
                    indicates that the Second Memo was probably fabricated. Given that the First
                    Memo was written on the same day as the Second Memo, it would be reasonable to
                    infer that the First Memo was likely to have been fabricated as
                well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Further, it was undisputed that the originals
                    of the two Memos were inspected by Mdm Chan’s solicitors on
                    8 June 2012, and that following such inspection, notice was given by
                    Mdm Chan’s solicitors on 18 June 2012 challenging the
                    authenticity of these two documents. Notwithstanding that, on the first day of
                    the trial, Mr See explained to the court that he had lost the originals of
                    the two Memos, and confirmed the next day that he was still not able to find
                    them. At no time was there an explanation by Mr See as to why he decided to
                    take possession of these documents <em>notwithstanding the notice
                        of challenge as to their authenticity</em>. This was highly
                    suspicious, to say the least. Given these circumstances, we are of the view that
                    the Judge ought to have drawn the appropriate adverse inferences against
                    Mr See and SHC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     This leads us to our seventh and final
                    observation. On the whole, it appears to us that SHC and SHY were the real
                    litigants behind this action, and that the respective cases put forth by
                    Mr See and Mdm Chan were largely an attempt by SHC and SHY to
                    reconstruct versions of the material events which would be favourable to their
                    cause based on whatever documentary evidence there was available. We are
                    therefore of the view that the evidence of Mr See, Mdm Chan, SHC and
                    SHY as to the parties’ intentions had to be approached with extreme
                    caution, and that the documentary evidence played a central role in this
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 1: Did Mr See pay the whole of the purchase price of
                the Property?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     We turn now to Issue 1. The Property is
                    held in Mdm Chan’s sole name, and hence, she is deemed to be
                    absolutely entitled to the Property unless the presumption of resulting trust
                    arises. The question in the present appeal, however, is not whether the
                    presumption of resulting trust applies – it patently does since
                    Mdm Chan conceded that she did not contribute the whole of the purchase
                    price of the Property. Instead, the question is whether Mr See contributed
                    the whole of the purchase price. Where this is concerned, it is not in dispute
                    that the funds listed at [18(d)]–[18(f)] above should be attributed to
                    Mr See. We therefore turn to examine to whom the $290,000, the HSBC Term
                    Loan and the TMPL Overdraft (<em>ie</em>, the items at
                    [18(a)]–[18(c)] above) should be attributed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The $290,000 contribution by Mdm Chan</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     As mentioned, Mdm Chan’s case was
                    that the $290,000 was her contribution of her life savings towards the purchase
                    price of the Property, and not a loan. In this regard, besides relying on her
                    own evidence, she pointed to a handwritten note made by SHC prior to the
                        Purchase,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> which categorised the $250,000 as
                    “CASH” from “MUM” (<em>ie</em>,
                    Mdm Chan), and not as a “LOAN” (there is a $40,000 difference
                    between the sum stated in that note and the amount eventually contributed by
                    Mdm Chan because Mdm Chan subsequently found out that she actually had
                    $290,000 in her life savings). The relevant parts of that handwritten note read
                    as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     In our view, the appropriate inference to be
                    drawn from this handwritten note, which was used for the See family’s own
                    reference, is that Mr See and SHC were discussing at that time how much
                    they would have to borrow in the form of <em>bank</em>
                    loans, in an attempt to minimise the amount of interest to be paid. Therefore,
                    we are unable to accept Mdm Chan’s construction of the handwritten
                    note as it is not supported by its context.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Mdm Chan, however, made a valid point
                    about one part of the Judge’s reasoning. The Judge believed
                    Mr See’s account that Mdm Chan had advanced a loan, which was
                    repaid in 1986 using the sale proceeds of the Joo Chiat property.
                    Mdm Chan’s <em>failure to request for repayment over
                        the years</em> was seen by the Judge as supporting the inference that
                    Mr See <em>had</em> indeed repaid the said loan (see
                    the Judgment at [8]). With respect, we find ourselves unable to agree with the
                    Judge. Mdm Chan never said that she asked for repayment of the $290,000
                    which she contributed. In fact, her case rested on the premise that that sum was
                        <em>not</em> lent to Mr See. Her failure to
                    request for repayment was therefore at best equivocal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     As there is no doubt that the $290,000
                    initially belonged to Mdm Chan, the burden was on Mr See – and
                    not Mdm Chan – to show that that sum was properly characterised as a
                    loan. In this regard, Mr See’s evidence that he agreed at the 1983
                    Meeting to take a loan from Mdm Chan was supported only by SHC’s
                    evidence of what transpired at that meeting. There was no document executed
                    pursuant to the alleged agreement that Mr See would take a loan of $290,000
                    from Mdm Chan, so what existed was a purported oral agreement. The only
                    other evidence supporting the characterisation of the $290,000 as a loan was
                    Mr See’s testimony that he <em>repaid</em> this
                    loan in 1986 out of the proceeds of sale of the Joo Chiat property. SHC
                    supported this story – in fact, it was SHC who claimed that he issued the
                    cheque from TMPL for Mr See to sign and repay Mdm Chan. Yet, neither a
                    copy of the said cheque nor the corresponding cheque stub was produced in
                    evidence. Nor did Mr See produce any evidence from TMPL’s records to
                    show that TMPL had indeed issued such a cheque to Mdm Chan. Given that the
                    Joo Chiat property was sold for $265,000, it seems odd that no record was kept
                    of the issuance of a cheque for such a large sum. In this regard, we note that
                    Mdm Chan said in cross-examination that she <em>had</em> been repaid the $290,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> However, for the
                    reasons stated above (at [63]), we would be hesitant to take
                    Mdm Chan’s evidence at face value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Given that there was simply no documentary
                    evidence whatsoever that the $290,000 from Mdm Chan was a loan or that it
                    had been repaid, much came down to the self-serving statements of Mr See
                    and SHC. In view of that, we respectfully disagree with the Judge’s
                    conclusion that the $290,000 was properly characterised as a loan. On the
                    contrary, we find that the $290,000 should properly be attributed to
                    Mdm Chan as her contribution to the purchase price of the
                Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The TMPL Overdraft </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Mdm Chan’s case on the TMPL
                    Overdraft of $400,000 was twofold. On the one hand, she argued that the whole of
                    that overdraft should be attributed to her on the sole account of her having
                    signed a guarantee for the overdraft.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> In the alternative, Mdm Chan
                    pointed out that Mr See had conceded in cross-examination that there was an
                    agreed arrangement between them whereby she was to receive about 65% of what he
                    received from SEPL and TMPL, except for dividends and profit. She asserted that
                    she allowed her future income from SEPL and TMPL to be applied towards the
                    repayment of the TMPL Overdraft, and thus, part of that overdraft should be
                    attributed to her as her contribution to the purchase price of the
                        Property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     SHC testified that the use of the $400,000
                    from the TMPL Overdraft was purely fortuitous as the plan was for TMPL to sell
                    the Borthwick property and use its sale proceeds to partially fund the Purchase.
                    However, as the completion date of the Purchase was one month before the
                    completion date of the sale of the Borthwick property, the lack of
                    synchronisation necessitated drawing down from the TMPL Overdraft as a form of
                    bridging finance. SHC further testified that the TMPL Overdraft was repaid in
                    November 1983 following the completion of the sale of the Borthwick property.
                    This date was confirmed by SHC’s handwritten notes and was also accepted
                    by Mdm Chan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     It was not disputed that at the material time,
                    Mr See owned all but one of the 50,002 shares in TMPL. On that basis, the
                    Judge treated the use of the sale proceeds of the Borthwick property as
                    Mr See’s direct contribution to the purchase price of the Property.
                    Oddly, despite Mdm Chan’s contentions above, she did not challenge
                    this finding. We therefore see no reason to interfere with the Judge’s
                    finding on this point, and it necessarily disposes of both of
                    Mdm Chan’s arguments on the TMPL Overdraft. Accordingly, we are in
                    agreement with the Judge that that $400,000 overdraft should be attributed to
                    Mr See.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The HSBC Term Loan </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     It is not disputed that the HSBC Term Loan of
                    $400,000 was granted to Mdm Chan and not Mr See. A letter from HSBC
                    tendered in evidence shows that Mdm Chan executed a first registered
                    mortgage for $1.4m over the Property to secure the payment obligations under the
                    HSBC Term Loan as well as her guarantees of up to $1m in relation to an
                    overdraft facility for SEPL and the TMPL Overdraft. Neither Mr See nor SHC
                    were named as guarantors in HSBC’s letter and they did not claim to
                    be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Subject to what we have discussed briefly at
                    [53]–[57] above, the HSBC Term Loan would be attributed to Mr See if
                    he can establish that: (a) he repaid this loan; and (b) he made
                    repayment pursuant to an agreement which he had with Mdm Chan at the time
                    the mortgage was taken out (see <em>Lau Siew Kim</em> at
                    [116]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Who repaid the HSBC Term Loan?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     SHC claimed that he issued cheques quarterly
                    from SEPL and TMPL to Mr See for him to repay the HSBC Term Loan. There was
                    no documentary evidence (such as cheque stubs) to support this. Notwithstanding
                    this, Mdm Chan did not appear to deny that Mr See made those
                    repayments. In any event, the Judge noted that there was no credible evidence
                    that Mdm Chan had contributed to the repayment of this loan. Again, before
                    this court, Mdm Chan asserted that she <em>allowed</em> her future income under her agreed arrangement with
                    Mr See (see [78] above) to be applied towards the repayment of the HSBC
                    Term Loan, which was in her name. However, she stopped short of claiming that
                    Mr See agreed that he would use the sums representing her future income to
                    repay the loan, and in any event, she had no documentary evidence to support
                    such a contention. In the premises, we see no reason to disturb the
                    Judge’s finding that it was Mr See who repaid the HSBC Term
                    Loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was there sufficient evidence of a prior agreement that Mr See
                would repay the HSBC Term Loan?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     SHC’s evidence was that at the 1983
                    Meeting, it was agreed that Mdm Chan need not worry about repaying the HSBC
                    Term Loan (even though it was in her name) as Mr See would take care of
                    that. There was no documentary evidence of this alleged agreement. Hence, there
                    was only Mdm Chan’s evidence that she could not recall exactly what
                    was agreed at the 1983 Meeting against the evidence of Mr See and SHC, both
                    of whom said that it was with Mdm Chan’s agreement that Mr See
                    took on the obligation of repaying the HSBC Term Loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The Judge was of the view that Mdm Chan
                    did not give a cogent reason as to why the parties would have reasonably
                    accepted that she had the means to repay the HSBC Term Loan. By 1983, she had
                    been a housewife for at least 25 years, and there was no evidence of her actual
                    financial position. The Judge concluded that it was implausible that the parties
                    would have agreed that Mdm Chan, who was dependent on the household income
                    which Mr See gave her, would be responsible for discharging the HSBC Term
                    Loan. We agree with the inference drawn by the Judge. It was inconceivable that
                    Mdm Chan, a homemaker who had just contributed her entire life savings
                    towards the purchase price of the Property, would have undertaken the risk of
                    being personally exposed to HSBC without at least some form of tacit assurance
                    from Mr See that he would be responsible for paying off the HSBC Term
                    Loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     In any event, even if we were not prepared to
                    find the existence of a prior arrangement that Mr See would pay off the
                    HSBC Term Loan, given that Mr See repaid the whole of that loan by himself,
                    we would be willing to consider the remedy of equitable accounting to adjust
                    Mr See’s and Mdm Chan’s respective shares of the
                    beneficial interest in the Property so as to attribute the $400,000 from the
                    HSBC Term Loan to Mr See (see our discussion above at
                    [53]–[57]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     On that basis, we are of the view that the
                    $400,000 from the HSBC Term Loan was properly attributed to
                Mr See.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our conclusion on Issue 1</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     In view of the foregoing analysis, we find
                    that Mdm Chan contributed a total of $290,000 and Mr See, a total of
                    $1,541,758.90 to the $1,831,758.90 purchase price of the Property. The starting
                    point, therefore, is the presumption that Mdm Chan holds 84.17% of the
                    beneficial interest in the Property on a resulting trust for
                Mr See.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 2: Did Mr See intend to benefit Mdm Chan by his
                contributions to the purchase price of the Property?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Given the existence of the presumption of the
                    aforesaid resulting trust, we move on to consider whether Mr See intended
                    to benefit Mdm Chan by his contributions to the purchase price of the
                    Property. This depends on what was actually said at the 1983 Meeting, details of
                    which can be found at [14]–[16] above. To recapitulate, Mdm Chan
                    claimed that she wanted the Property to be put in her name because she was
                    feeling insecure due to Mr See’s infidelity. It was therefore
                    “inherently probable” that Mr See bought the Property in her
                    name to appease her and to assuage his guilt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     In our view, the main obstacle in
                    Mdm Chan’s case was the existence of the POA (see [17] above).
                    According to Mr See, at the 1983 Meeting, an agreement was reached between
                    him and Mdm Chan that the Property would be put in her name so that she
                    could brag about it to her friends – on condition that she acknowledged
                    him as the true owner of the Property in an “appropriate legal
                    document”. Mr See claimed that the POA, which was subsequently
                    executed, was the embodiment of that acknowledgment. SHC confirmed that that was
                    indeed how the POA came about. The Judge agreed with Mr See. He said that
                    the POA, when viewed in the light of the circumstances at the time of the
                    Purchase, supported Mr See’s account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     On appeal, Mdm Chan challenged
                    Mr See’s account of the events surrounding the execution of the POA
                    on the basis that the POA could not be considered an “appropriate legal
                    document”. She argued that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_91-p2_a"></a>(a)     The POA was wholly ineffective to
                        show that the designated attorney was the true beneficial owner of the
                        Property. A declaration of trust should have been <em>but was
                            not</em> used.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_91-p2_b"></a>(b)     That a declaration of trust should have been but was not
                        used was even more glaring given that Mr See had executed a written
                        declaration of trust not too long before the Purchase (see [9]
                        above).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_91-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        only reason why a power of attorney, and not a declaration of trust, was
                        executed was because Mr See wanted at that time <b><em>only </em></b><em>to retain control over the
                            Property</em> and not to claim beneficial ownership over it as
                        well. This could be seen from the fact that SHC was also named as one of the
                        attorneys in the POA – there was no reason to do so if Mr See
                        intended to retain beneficial ownership of the Property <em>himself</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>We appreciate
                        the force of these arguments and agree with Mdm Chan that the POA is
                        ineffective in showing the existence of any agreement between the parties
                        that Mr See was to be the true beneficial owner of the whole of the
                        Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     However, Mdm Chan’s submissions
                    still do not explain why, if the Property was truly a gift to her, she willingly
                    allowed Mr See to exercise control over the Property. Mdm Chan claimed
                    that the POA was not explained or translated to her in Cantonese, and she
                    therefore never understood the effect of the POA. In the proceedings below, the
                    Judge took the view that Mdm Chan’s signature on the POA was
                        <em>prima facie</em> evidence that she had acceded to
                    its contents; moreover, the court must assume that the lawyer drafting the POA
                    would have explained its effect to Mdm Chan. There being no evidence to the
                    contrary apart from Mdm Chan’s words, we respectfully agree with the
                    Judge that Mdm Chan did not discharge the burden (which lay on her) of
                    proving that she did not understand the effect of the POA. We also agree with
                    the Judge that Mdm Chan’s story was unrealistic and incredible
                    – there was no convincing reason why Mr See, a man nearing retirement
                    who had just begun an affair, would make the biggest purchase of his life, only
                    to gift it to someone who was his wife in name only. We therefore find that
                    Mr See had no intention to benefit Mdm Chan by his contributions to
                    the purchase price of the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     For the sake of completeness, we would add
                    that any presumption of advancement in this case (which would have been weak in
                    view of the state of the relationship between the parties at the time of the
                    Purchase) would have been negated by the circumstances discussed above, and
                    thus, it is unnecessary for us to deal with Issue 3 (at [58(c)]
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The common intention constructive trust: a “sounder
                solution”?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Our analysis at [58]–[93] above is
                    sufficient to dispose of this appeal. We now turn to address the Judge’s
                    comment (at [19] of the Judgment) that the common intention constructive trust
                    analysis is “a sounder solution” than the resulting trust
                    analysis. In coming to this view, the Judge referred to two recent English
                    decisions: <em>Stack</em> and <em>Jones v
                        Kernott</em> [2012] 1 AC 776 (“<em>Jones</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Overview of the common intention constructive trust</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The foundational authorities in English law on
                    the common intention constructive trust are <em>Pettitt v
                        Pettitt</em> [1970] AC 777 (“<em>Pettitt</em>”) and <em>Gissing v
                        Gissing</em> [1971] AC 886 (“<em>Gissing</em>”). The common intention constructive trust was
                    developed to mitigate the arithmetic rigour of the resulting trust when
                    ascertaining property rights upon the breakdown of a relationship in the
                    domestic context. At the time <em>Pettitt</em> and
                        <em>Gissing</em> were decided, the Matrimonial Causes
                    Act 1973 (c 18) (UK) (“the MCA 1973 (UK)”) had not been
                    enacted yet, and the English courts lacked a flexible, discretionary power to
                    depart from a strict application of hard-nosed property law when dividing
                    matrimonial assets. The common intention constructive trust still remains
                    relevant today in England in cases which fall outside the scope of matrimonial
                    legislation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Prior to <em>Stack</em>
                    and <em>Jones</em>, the leading case on the essential
                    elements of a claim by one party for a common intention constructive trust over
                    a property held in the sole name of another party was <em>Lloyds
                        Bank Plc v Rosset and Another</em> [1991] 1 AC 107
                        (“<em>Rosset</em>”). In <em>Rosset</em>, a married couple purchased a property in the
                    husband’s sole name with the aid of a mortgage and cash from the
                    husband’s family trust. The wife made no financial contribution to the
                    acquisition of the property or the cost of renovating it, but assisted in the
                    building works. The mortgagee bank subsequently brought possession proceedings,
                    and the question was whether the wife had acquired any interest in the property
                    that had priority over the mortgagee’s claim. The House of Lords held that
                    the wife had failed to establish any interest in the property. The following
                    passage in the speech of Lord Bridge of Harwich in <em>Rosset</em> (at 132–133) encapsulates his view as to when a
                    common intention constructive trust arises:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The first and fundamental question … is whether, independently of
                        any inference to be drawn from the conduct of the parties in the course of
                        sharing the house as their home and managing their joint affairs, there has
                        at any time prior to acquisition, or exceptionally at some later date, been
                        any agreement, arrangement or understanding reached between them that the
                        property is to be shared beneficially. The finding of an agreement or
                        arrangement to share in this sense can only … be based on evidence of
                        express discussions between the partners, however imperfectly remembered and
                        however imprecise their terms may have been. Once a finding to this effect
                        is made it will only be necessary for the partner asserting a claim to a
                        beneficial interest against the partner entitled to the legal estate to show
                        that he or she has acted to his or her detriment or significantly altered
                        his or her position in reliance on the agreement in order to give rise to a
                        constructive trust or a proprietary estoppel.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In sharp contrast with this situation is the very different one where
                        there is no evidence to support a finding of an agreement or arrangement to
                        share, however reasonable it might have been for the parties to reach such
                        an arrangement if they had applied their minds to the question, and where
                        the court must rely entirely on the conduct of the parties both as the basis
                        from which to infer a common intention to share the property beneficially
                        and as the conduct relied on to give rise to a constructive trust. In this
                        situation direct contributions to the purchase price by the partner who is
                        not the legal owner, whether initially or by payment of mortgage
                        instalments, will readily satisfy the inference necessary to the creation of
                        a constructive trust. But … it is at least extremely doubtful whether
                        anything less will do.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Lord Bridge’s dicta in <em>Rosset</em> was approved and applied by this court in
                        <em>Tan Thiam Loke v Woon Swee Kheng Christina</em>
                    [1991] 2 SLR(R) 595 (“<em>Tan Thiam
                    Loke</em>”) at [18]. Under the approach in <em>Rosset</em>, X acquires a beneficial interest in a property by way of
                    a common intention constructive trust when he relies to his detriment on a
                    common intention that the beneficial interest in the property is to be shared.
                    Such a common intention may: (a) arise from an express discussion; or
                    (b) take the form of an inferred common intention, as evidenced by direct
                    financial contributions by X to the purchase price of the property; or
                    (c) in exceptional situations, arise from other conduct by X which gives
                    rise to an implied common intention. <em>Rosset</em>,
                    however, left it unclear where the resulting trust fit into the analysis. For
                    example, since it appeared possible from <em>Rosset</em>
                    that direct financial contributions to the purchase price of a property could
                    lead to the acquisition of a beneficial interest in the property both under a
                    resulting trust <em>and</em> a common intention
                    constructive trust, it was uncertain whether the applicable principles for
                    quantifying the parties’ respective shares of the beneficial interest in
                    the two situations would be the same or different.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     There appears to have been a dearth of
                    reported cases on common intention constructive trusts in Singapore ever since
                    the decision in <em>Tan Thiam Loke</em>. One reason could
                    be the perceived restrictive nature of this remedy following <em>Rosset</em>. Whatever the reasons, the court is generally constrained
                    by the manner in which counsel decide to present their clients’ cases. For
                    example, in <em>Lau Siew Kim</em>, both the appellant and
                    the respondents were content to rely on the law of resulting trusts to resolve
                    their dispute. Similarly, in this case, notwithstanding the Judge’s
                    references to <em>Stack</em> and <em>Jones</em>, both Mr See and Mdm Chan, perhaps for reasons
                    of economy, declined to take up his invitation to consider the applicability of
                    the common intention constructive trust, and the appeal before us was argued
                    purely on the basis of resulting trust principles. Nevertheless, we note that
                    there have been cases of property disputes (as defined at [3] above) where the
                    parties advanced their claims on the alternative bases of: (a) a resulting
                    trust; (b) a common intention constructive trust; and (c) proprietary
                    estoppel (see, for example, the recent case of <em>Quek Hung
                        Heong v Tan Bee Hoon (executrix for estate of Quek Cher Choi, deceased) and
                        others and another suit</em> [2014] SGHC 17 (“<em>Quek Hung Hong</em>”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     We acknowledge that the interaction between
                    the resulting trust and the common intention constructive trust (and, dare we
                    say, proprietary estoppel) is complex and confusing, and has given rise to much
                    controversy (see, for example, the observations of Vinodh Coomaraswamy J in
                        <em>Quek Hung Hong</em> at [116] and those of
                    Chadwick LJ in <em>Oxley v Hiscock</em> [2005] Fam 211
                    at [71]). Further, we are mindful of the importance of identifying the correct
                    default legal regime to apply to property disputes, especially in the domestic
                    context. In this regard, we agree with what A J Cloherty and
                    D M  Fox said in their article “Proving a trust of a shared
                    home” [2007] CLJ 517 (at p 518):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Identifying the applicable regime is obviously important: if the parties
                        separate it determines what share, if any, each party has in the equity in
                        the house. Once identified, it is equally important to know the starting
                        point for that regime’s application to a particular case. In
                        principle, it should give a structure to the parties’ negotiations,
                        and, in the heat of post-separation animosity, help to distinguish relevant
                        from irrelevant evidence. Ideally, a clear view of that starting point
                        should prevent litigation, which is often … paid for out of the
                        shrinking sale proceeds of the parties’ former home.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    It is thus hoped that the following
                    discussion on the common intention constructive trust will provide <em>some</em> clarity for lawyers when advising their clients on
                    this difficult area of the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The English position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    The House of Lords case of <em>Stack</em> and the UK Supreme Court case of <em>Jones</em> firmly establish that under English law, the
                    common intention constructive trust is the more appropriate tool for quantifying
                    each party’s share of the beneficial interest in domestic property
                    disputes (as defined at [3] above) where the property concerned is a family home
                    purchased in the joint names of a cohabiting couple. Both cases are difficult to
                    reconcile with <em>Pettitt</em>, <em>Gissing</em> and <em>Rosset</em>, although none
                    of the latter three cases has been overruled.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The decision in Stack </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The salient facts of <em>Stack</em> are as follows. S and D were in a 19-year relationship.
                    They were not married and, hence, fell outside the scope of the MCA 1973 (UK). A
                    few years into their relationship, D bought a house in her sole name, where the
                    parties lived together and raised four children. The £30,000 purchase price
                    of the house was financed by: (a) a £8,000 down payment from D’s
                    building society account; and (b) a £22,000 mortgage in D’s
                    name, which D repaid on her own. It was unclear whether S made any contributions
                    to D’s building society account. Extensive improvements were made to the
                    house. Although S was responsible for most of these renovations, it was
                    difficult to put a figure on how much they affected the final sale value of the
                    house. The house was sold some years later, and D received a net amount of about
                    £66,000 from the sale. The parties subsequently bought another property in
                    their joint names (“the joint-names property”) for £190,000.
                    Over 65% of the purchase price of that property (<em>ie</em>, £129,000) came from funds in D’s building society
                    account, which, at that time, included the £66,000 from the sale of the
                    previous house. The balance of the purchase price came from a £65,000 loan
                    secured by a mortgage in the joint names of D and S and two endowment policies,
                    one in the parties’ joint names and the other, in D’s sole name. The
                    interest on the mortgage and the premium on the endowment policy in the
                    parties’ joint names (eventually totalling about £34,000) were paid
                    by S. S contributed £27,000 and D, over £38,000 towards repayment of
                    the mortgage loan. The parties did not execute a declaration of trust over the
                    joint-names property. It was undisputed that both parties had a beneficial
                    interest in that property; the issue in <em>Stack</em>.
                    therefore, was simply the quantification of the parties’ respective shares
                    of the beneficial interest. The judge at first instance held that the beneficial
                    interest in the joint-names property should be split 50:50 between D and S. D
                    appealed. The English Court of Appeal disagreed with the judge at first instance
                    and held that the beneficial interest should be split 65:35 in favour of D. S
                    then appealed. The House of Lords upheld the English Court of Appeal’s
                    decision, but with Lord Neuberger adopting a different line of reasoning
                    from that adopted by the other law lords (<em>viz</em>,
                    Lord Hoffmann, Lord Hope of Craighead, Lord Walker of
                    Gestingthorpe and Baroness Hale of Richmond (collectively, “the
                    majority in <em>Stack</em>”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The approach of the majority in <em>Stack</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    In what appears to be a recasting of the law
                    as traditionally understood, the majority in <em>Stack</em>
                    held that the resulting trust analysis ought not generally to play any role in
                    the resolution of domestic property disputes. For instance, Lord Walker
                    held (at [31] of <em>Stack</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… In a case about beneficial ownership of a matrimonial or
                        quasi-matrimonial home (whether registered in the names of one or two legal
                        owners) the resulting trust should not in my opinion operate as a legal
                        presumption, although it may (in an updated form which takes account of all
                        significant contributions, direct or indirect, in cash or in kind) happen to
                        be reflected in the parties’ common intention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Similarly, Baroness Hale, with whom the
                    other members of the majority in <em>Stack</em> agreed,
                    cited with approval (at [60] of <em>Stack</em>) the
                    following passage from Kevin Gray &amp; Susan Francis Gray, <em>Elements of Land Law</em> (Oxford University Press, 4th Ed,
                    2004) (“<em>Elements of Land Law</em>
                    (4th Ed)”) at para 10.21:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In recent decades a new pragmatism has become apparent in the law of
                        trusts. English courts have eventually conceded that the classical theory of
                        resulting trusts, with its fixation on intentions presumed to have been
                        formulated contemporaneously with the acquisition of title, has
                        substantially broken down. … Simultaneously the balance of emphasis
                        in the law of trusts has transferred from crude factors of money
                        contribution (which are pre-eminent in the resulting trust) towards more
                        subtle factors of intentional bargain (which are the foundational premise of
                        the constructive trust). … [T]he undoubted consequence is that the
                        doctrine of resulting trust has conceded much of its field of application to
                        the constructive trust, which is nowadays fast becoming the primary
                        phenomenon in the area of implied trusts. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Baroness Hale continued (likewise at
                    [60] of <em>Stack</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… There is no need for me to rehearse all the developments in the
                        case law since <em>Pettitt v Pettitt</em> [1970] AC 777
                        and <em>Gissing v Gissing</em> [1971] AC 886 …
                        <em>The law has indeed moved on in response to changing
                            social and economic conditions. The search is to ascertain the
                            parties’ shared intentions</em>, <b><em>actual,
                            inferred or imputed</em></b><em>, with respect to the
                            property in the light of their whole course of conduct in relation to
                            it.</em> [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    The majority in <em>Stack</em> held that in the domestic context, if the property
                    concerned was held in joint names, the starting point was the presumption that
                    the parties were also joint tenants in equity, regardless of whether or not they
                    had made equal contributions to the purchase price of the property (<em>cf</em> the resulting trust approach, where there is a
                    presumption that the beneficial interest in the property is held in proportion
                    to the contributions made by each party to the purchase price, <em>regardless</em> of how the property is held in law). The
                    burden, the majority in <em>Stack</em> held, was on the
                    party seeking to displace the equal division of the beneficial interest to show
                    that the parties had a different common intention, and this was “not a
                    task to be lightly embarked upon” (see <em>Stack</em> at [68]). This was evidentially the case because the court
                    was dealing with the allocation of property rights, an area where certainty in
                    the law was a principal consideration. In fact, Baroness Hale went so far
                    as to say (at [69] of <em>Stack</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At the end of the day, … cases in which the joint legal owners are
                        to be taken to have intended that their beneficial interests should be
                        different from their legal interests will be <em>very
                            unusual</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    In the same paragraph, Baroness Hale
                    attempted to give a non-exhaustive list of factors which might shed light on the
                    parties’ intentions:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In law, “context is everything” and the domestic context is
                        very different from the commercial world. Each case will turn on its own
                        facts. Many more factors than financial contributions may be relevant to
                        divining the parties’ true intentions. These include: any advice or
                        discussions at the time of the transfer which cast light upon their
                        intentions then; the reasons why the home was acquired in their joint names;
                        the reasons why (if it be the case) the survivor was authorised to give a
                        receipt for the capital moneys; the purpose for which the home was acquired;
                        the nature of the parties’ relationship; whether they had children for
                        whom they both had responsibility to provide a home; how the purchase was
                        financed, both initially and subsequently; how the parties arranged their
                        finances, whether separately or together or a bit of both; how they
                        discharged the outgoings on the property and their other household expenses.
                        When a couple are joint owners of the home and jointly liable for the
                        mortgage, the inferences to be drawn from who pays for what may be very
                        different from the inferences to be drawn when only one is owner of the
                        home. The arithmetical calculation of how much was paid by each is also
                        likely to be less important. It will be easier to draw the inference that
                        they intended that each should contribute as much to the household as they
                        reasonably could and that they would share the eventual benefit or burden
                        equally. The parties’ individual characters and personalities may also
                        be a factor in deciding where their true intentions lay. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The minority approach in <em>Stack</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Lord Neuberger, although agreeing with
                    the majority in <em>Stack</em> on the result, disagreed
                    with the use of the common intention constructive trust as the default
                    analytical tool. He accepted that the nature of the relationship between the
                    parties would have a bearing on the inferences to be drawn from their
                    discussions and actions, and that the domestic context could give rise to very
                    different factual considerations from the commercial context (see <em>Stack</em> at [103] and [107]). Nevertheless, he argued that:
                    (a) the same principles should apply to assess the apportionment of the
                    beneficial interest between legal co-owners, whether in a sexual, platonic,
                    familial, amicable or commercial relationship (see <em>Stack</em> at [107]); and (b) consistency required the approach
                    to be the same regardless of whether the property was held in the name of one
                    party or in the names of all the parties (see <em>Stack</em> at [114]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Lord Neuberger argued that the question
                    of “the ownership of the beneficial interest in property held in the
                    names of two people” should be considered in “a structured
                    way” (see <em>Stack</em> at [108]). He preferred to
                    state that where the only evidence available was the extent of each
                    party’s contributions to the purchase price of the property, the
                    beneficial ownership of the property would be held in the same proportions as
                    the parties’ respective contributions to the purchase price, <em>ie</em>, the resulting trust analysis would apply. To him,
                    this was a matter of both principle and logic (see <em>Stack</em> at [110] and [114]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    
          <em>But, that was not to say
                        that the common intention constructive trust analysis was
                        irrelevant</em>. Lord Neuberger was prepared to accept that if
                    there was <em>more</em> evidence available than the
                    parties’ respective contributions to the purchase price of the property,
                    the court might be able to deduce an agreement or understanding amounting to an
                    intention as to how the beneficial interest in the property would be held. In
                    this way, the resulting trust could be rebutted by a common intention
                    constructive trust (see <em>Stack</em> at
                [124]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    In relation to the quantification of each
                    party’s share of the beneficial interest in the property,
                    Lord Neuberger, unlike the majority in <em>Stack</em>,
                    drew a sharp distinction between an inferred and an imputed common intention,
                    holding that the court could infer a common intention on the part of the
                    parties, but could not impute to them a common intention (at [125]–[127]
                    of <em>Stack</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">125    While an intention may be inferred as well as
                            express, it may not, at least in my opinion, be imputed. That appears to
                            me to be consistent both with normal principles and with the majority
                            view of this House in <em>Pettitt v Pettitt</em>
                            [1970] AC 777, as accepted by all but Lord Reid in <em>Gissing v Gissing</em> [1971] AC 886, [at] 897H,
                            898B-D, 900E-G, 901B-D, 904E-F, and reiterated by the Court of Appeal in
                                <em>Grant v Edwards</em> [1986] Ch 638, [at]
                            651F-653A. The distinction between inference and imputation may appear a
                            fine one (and in <em>Gissing v Gissing</em> [1971]
                            AC 886, [at] 902G-H, Lord Pearson, who, on a fair reading I think
                            rejected imputation, seems to have equated it with inference), but it is
                            important.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">126    An inferred intention is one which is objectively
                            deduced to be the subjective actual intention of the parties, in the
                            light of their actions and statements. An imputed intention is one which
                            is attributed to the parties, even though no such actual intention can
                            be deduced from their actions and statements, and even though they had
                            no such intention. Imputation involves concluding what the parties would
                            have intended, whereas inference involves concluding what they did
                            intend.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">127    To impute an intention would not only be wrong in
                            principle and a departure from two decisions of your Lordships’
                            House in this very area, but it also would involve a judge in an
                            exercise which was difficult, subjective and uncertain. (Hence the
                            advantage of the resulting trust presumption). [<em>sic</em>] It would be difficult because the judge would be
                            constructing an intention where none existed at the time, and where the
                            parties may well not have been able to agree. It would be subjective for
                            obvious reasons. It would be uncertain because it is unclear whether one
                            considers a hypothetical negotiation between the actual parties, or what
                            reasonable parties would have agreed. The former is more logical, but
                            would redound to the advantage of an unreasonable party. The latter is
                            more attractive, but is inconsistent with the principle, identified by
                            Baroness Hale at paragraph 61, that the court’s view of
                            fairness is not the correct yardstick for determining the parties’
                            shares (and see <em>Pettitt v Pettitt</em> [1970]
                            AC 777, [at] 801C-F, 809C-G, 826C).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Lord Neuberger nevertheless appeared
                    willing to adopt a broader approach than that adopted in <em>Rosset</em> as to the factors which could be taken into account when
                    discerning the parties’ common intention. He accepted that (at 129 of
                        <em>Stack</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is hard to identify, particularly in the abstract, the factors which
                        can be taken into account to infer an agreement or understanding, and the
                        effect of such factors. Each case will be highly fact-sensitive, and what is
                        relevant, and how, may be contentious, whether one is considering actions,
                        discussions or statements, even where there is no dispute as to what was
                        done or said.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Lord Neuberger went on to observe that
                    while the court should take into account all the circumstances of the
                    relationship between the parties, it did not mean that all these circumstances
                    were of <em>primary or equal</em> relevance to the
                    ascertainment of the parties’ common intention (see <em>Stack</em> at [131]). In his view, most of the factors cited by
                    Baroness Hale provided part of the vital background – but <em>only the background</em> – against which any alleged
                    discussion, statement or action concerning the parties’ common intention
                    was to be assessed. For that reason, he considered Baroness Hale’s
                    endorsement of considering the parties’ whole course of dealing in
                    relation to the property (see [105] above) too imprecise, as it gave
                    insufficient guidance on what was primarily relevant, that is, the dealings
                    which cast light on the beneficial ownership of the property (see <em>Stack</em> at [144]). To Lord Neuberger, the conduct of
                    the parties was only relevant insofar as it threw light on the question of what
                    the parties intended their respective shares of the beneficial interest in the
                    property to be. In his opinion (see <em>Stack</em> at
                    [145]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… “Undertaking a survey of the whole course of dealings
                        between the parties” should not, I think, at least normally, require
                        much detailed or controversial evidence. That is not merely for reasons of
                        practicality and certainty. As already indicated, I would expect almost all
                        of “the whole course of dealing” to be relevant only as
                        background: it is with actions, discussions and statements which relate to
                        the parties’ agreement and understanding as to the ownership of the
                        beneficial interest in the home with which the court should, at least
                        normally, primarily be concerned. Otherwise, the inquiry is likely to be
                        trespassing into what I regard as the forbidden territories of imputed
                        intention and fairness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Finally, Lord Neuberger accepted that
                    there was nothing wrong in principle with <em>subsequently</em> altering, after the date of acquisition of the
                    property, the parties’ respective shares of the beneficial interest in the
                    property as it stood on the date of acquisition in the event of a change in
                    their common intention after that date. However, in his view, such an alteration
                    of the quantification of each party’s share of the beneficial interest
                    required “compelling evidence”, which would normally involve
                    “discussions, statements or actions, subsequent to the acquisition, from
                    which an agreement or common understanding as to such a change [could] properly
                    be inferred” (see <em>Stack</em> at [138]), although
                    he appeared to accept that it was possible to infer a common intention to alter
                    a party’s share of the beneficial interest if that party carried out
                    “significant improvements to the home” (see <em>Stack</em> at [139]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    On the evidence, Lord Neuberger was
                    satisfied that S could not establish a claim to more than 36% of the beneficial
                    interest in the joint-names property, and indicated that he was more comfortable
                    with putting S’s contribution at around 30% (see <em>Stack</em> at [122]). However, since D was prepared to concede that S
                    should have a 35% share of the beneficial interest, Lord Neuberger was in
                    agreement with the result reached by the majority in <em>Stack</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The decision in Jones</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    A few years later, <em>Jones</em> reached the UK Supreme Court. The facts of <em>Jones</em> can be summarised as follows. J and K were in a
                    relationship. Like the couple in <em>Stack</em>, they were
                    not married and they too fell outside the scope of English matrimonial
                    legislation. In 1985, J and K purchased a property in their joint names for
                    £30,000. Part of the purchase price was raised by way of an endowment
                    mortgage in the parties’ joint names, which was repaid out of a joint
                    account. J and K cohabited at the property for eight years until they separated
                    in 1993, at which point K moved out of the property (which was estimated to be
                    worth about £60,000 by then). It was accepted that when K moved out, the
                    beneficial interest in the property was split 50:50 between the parties. From
                    then on, J assumed sole responsibility for the outgoings and maintenance of the
                    property, financial support of the children and all mortgage repayments in
                    respect of the property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    In 1995, two years after K moved out of the
                    property (which was worth about £70,000 by then), the parties cashed in a
                    joint life insurance policy (different from the endowment policy which secured
                    the mortgage on the property) and shared the proceeds. These proceeds allowed K
                    to put down a deposit for the purchase of his own home. Eleven years later, in
                    2006, K sought to claim a beneficial interest in the property, whereupon J
                    sought a court declaration that, <em>inter alia</em>, the
                    entire beneficial interest in the property belonged to her. At the time of the
                    first instance hearing, the property was worth around £243,000. As in the
                    case of <em>Stack</em>, the question here was again one of
                    quantification of the parties’ respective shares of the beneficial
                    interest in the property. In particular, the issue was whether each
                    party’s share of the beneficial interest had changed over
                time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    At first instance, the county court judge
                    concluded that the common intention of the parties changed after K moved out of
                    the property and focused on his own home, and held that the beneficial interest
                    should be split 90:10 in favour of J. K appealed. The English High Court,
                    applying <em>Stack</em>, upheld the county court
                    judge’s decision. K appealed again. The English Court of Appeal, by a 2:1
                    majority and likewise applying <em>Stack</em>, disagreed
                    that the evidence supported the finding that the parties’ common intention
                    changed after their separation and declared that the beneficial interest should
                    be split 50:50. This time, J appealed. The UK Supreme Court reversed the
                    decision of the English Court of Appeal and reinstated the 90:10 split in favour
                    of J. Although all five members of the UK Supreme Court were in agreement with
                    the result, four separate judgments (comprising a joint judgment by
                    Lord Walker and Baroness Hale JJSC, and separate judgments by
                    Lord Collins of Mapesbury, Lord Kerr of Tonaghmore and
                    Lord Wilson JJSC) were issued, the main disagreement being whether it
                    was more appropriate to infer or impute a common intention to split the
                    beneficial interest in the property 90:10 in the light of the
                evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    In their joint judgment, Lord Walker
                    and Baroness Hale JJSC said that the logical inference was that
                    K’s beneficial interest in the property crystallised in 1995 when the
                    joint life insurance policy was cashed in and he bought a new home for himself.
                    From that point on, it could be inferred (and did not have to be imputed) that
                    the common intention of the parties was that J would have the sole benefit of
                    any capital gains in the property after that time (see <em>Jones</em> at [48]). Based on a rough calculation of the
                    parties’ respective financial contributions to the purchase price of the
                    property, Lord Walker and Baroness Hale were satisfied that it would
                    be wrong to interfere with the findings of the first instance
                judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    Lord Walker and Baroness Hale JJSC
                    also took the opportunity to clarify the principles laid down in <em>Stack</em>. In particular, they clarified that: (a) the
                    regime set out in <em>Stack</em> applied to both
                    joint-names cases and single-name cases; and (b) it was appropriate in some
                    circumstances to impute an intention to the parties (<em>ie</em>, to attribute to them an intention which they did not have)
                    in order to arrive at what the court considered to be a fair
                result.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    Having considered all four judgments in
                        <em>Jones</em>, the following is our attempt to
                    summarise the inquiry now adopted under English law when apportioning the
                    beneficial interest in domestic property:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_121-p2_a"></a>(a)     The starting point is that equity
                        follows the law. It is therefore presumed: (i) in joint-names cases,
                        that the parties are joint tenants in both law and equity; and (ii) in
                        single-name cases, that the party who does not own the property at law also
                        does not have a beneficial interest in it (see <em>Jones</em> at [16], [51(1)] and [52]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_121-p2_b"></a>(b)     The first question is whether the
                        above presumption can be displaced by showing that the parties had a common
                        intention to hold the beneficial interest in the property differently from
                        the way in which the legal interest was held at the time the property was
                        acquired. In single-name cases, as part of that inquiry, the court will ask
                        whether there was a common intention that the party who did not own the
                        property at law was to have any beneficial interest in it at all. In
                        answering this question, the court is permitted to look for either an
                        express or an inferred intention, objectively deduced from the evidence.
                        However, it is not permitted to impute an intention to the parties (see
                            <em>Jones</em> at [17], [51(2)], [52] and [64]).
                        The task of ascertaining whether the parties intended to hold the beneficial
                        interest in the property differently from the way in which the legal
                        interest was held is not a task to be “lightly embarked upon”
                        (see <em>Jones</em> at [12]). Nevertheless, if it is
                        embarked upon, the court is to ascertain the parties’ common intention
                        as to their respective shares of the beneficial interest based on their
                        whole course of conduct in relation to the property (see <em>Jones</em> at [12], [13] and [51(3)]). Financial contributions
                        are but one of the factors for the court to consider in deciding what the
                        parties commonly intended (see <em>Jones</em> at
                        [51(5)]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_121-p2_c"></a>(c)     If
                        the first question is answered in the affirmative, then the second question
                        is how to quantify each party’s share of the beneficial interest in
                        the property. In answering this question, the court will refer to the common
                        intention of the parties, again objectively deduced. This intention may be
                        an express <em>or an inferred one</em>. But, if it is
                        impossible to divine a common intention as to the proportions in which the
                        beneficial interest is to be shared, the court will <em>impute</em> to the parties an intention which they never had, so
                        that each party is entitled to a share which the court considers fair,
                        having regard to the whole course of dealing between them in relation to the
                        property (see <em>Jones</em> at [31], [33], [47],
                        [51(3)], [51(4)] and [64]). Again, financial contributions are but one of
                        the factors for the court’s consideration in deciding what is fair
                        (see <em>Jones</em> at [51(5)]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_121-p2_d"></a>(d)     The third question is this:
                        notwithstanding the parties’ common intention at the time the property
                        was acquired, whether the parties’ common intention changed over time
                        to reflect a different quantification of each party’s share of the
                        beneficial interest in the property (see <em>Jones</em>
                        at [14] and [51(2)]). To answer this question, the steps in questions one
                        and two above are repeated once again.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The scope of Stack and Jones in the English courts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Single-name and joint-names cases</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Although <em>Stack</em>
                    and <em>Jones</em> were both cases where the domestic
                    property concerned was held at law in the <em>joint</em>
                    names of both parties and, therefore, were strictly speaking about the
                    quantification of each party’s share of the beneficial interest in the
                    property, they have been applied to a wide array of situations where the
                    property in question was held in a single name (see, <em>eg</em>: (a) <em>Re Piper</em> [2011]
                    EWHC 3570 (Admin), where a wife claimed a half share in a property held in
                    her husband’s name in criminal confiscation proceedings against the
                    husband; (b) <em>Geary v Rankine</em> [2012] EWCA
                    Civ 555 (“<em>Geary</em>”), where G
                    claimed a share in a property purchased for business purposes by R and held in
                    R’s name; (c) <em>Thompson v Hurst</em> [2012]
                    EWCA Civ 1752 (“<em>Thompson</em>”),
                    where T claimed that the starting point in the division of the beneficial
                    interest in a property held in H’s name should the same as that in a
                    joint-names case because the parties would have liked to be joint legal owners
                    of the property, but were prevented by “external factors” (at
                    [16]) from doing so; (d) <em>Aspden v Elvy</em> [2012]
                    EWHC 1387 (Ch); and (e) <em>Gallarotti v
                        Sebastianelli</em> [2012] EWCA Civ 865 (“<em>Gallarotti</em>”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    In our view, this is unsurprising, given
                    that, as mentioned above, Lord Walker and Baroness Hale JJSC
                    expressly stated in <em>Jones</em> (albeit in <em>obiter dictum</em>) that a single regime applied to both
                    joint-names and single-name cases, albeit with different starting
                points.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Beyond cohabitation relationships</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    The English courts have also accepted that
                    the approach of the majority in <em>Stack</em> and the UK
                    Supreme Court in <em>Jones</em> (referred to hereafter as
                    “the approach in <em>Stack</em> and <em>Jones</em>” where appropriate to the context) extends
                    beyond cohabiting couples to other domestic relationships. This is perhaps
                    unsurprising as well since Baroness Hale referred to the presumption of
                    equality in joint-names cases applying “at least in the domestic consumer
                    context” (see <em>Stack</em> at [58]). An example of
                    this is <em>Adekunle v Ritchie</em> [2007] EW Misc 5
                    (EWCC) (“<em>Adekunle</em>”), where a mother
                    had the opportunity to buy a house at a substantial discount under a government
                    scheme. As she was unable to obtain the necessary loan by herself (due to her
                    age and financial position), her son (who lived with her) agreed to be a party
                    to the mortgage and the other registered owner of the property. When the mother
                    died without making a will, her administrators applied for an order to sell the
                    house and divide the sale proceeds between her ten children under the rules of
                    intestacy. The son who had lived with the mother while she was alive opposed the
                    application. HHJ Behrens accepted that the approach of the majority in
                        <em>Stack</em> (<em>Jones</em> had
                    not been decided yet at that time) applied outside home-sharing arrangements
                    which involved a sexual relationship (see <em>Adekunle</em>
                    at [65]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    The approach in <em>Stack</em> and <em>Jones</em> has also been
                    applied outside familial relationships. In <em>Gallarotti</em>, two close male friends, G and S, bought a flat
                    together with the help of a mortgage. The flat was purchased in the sole name of
                    S, who paid a larger initial cash contribution and repaid a much larger share of
                    the mortgage. The parties initially orally agreed that they would each have a
                    50% interest in the flat. No declaration of trust was made to this effect.
                    However, when the parties realised that they were going to make unequal
                    contributions to the purchase price of the flat, there was a subsequent oral
                    agreement that G would pay a larger proportion of the mortgage repayments. This
                    did not happen. The parties subsequently fell out and G commenced proceedings to
                    determine his share of the beneficial interest in the flat. The evidence showed
                    that S paid about 75% of the total cost of the flat while G paid approximately
                    25%.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    The judge at first instance held that the
                    parties held the beneficial interest in the flat in equal shares. On appeal, the
                    English Court of Appeal disagreed and substituted a finding that the beneficial
                    interest in the flat should be split 75:25 in favour of S. In coming to this
                    conclusion, Arden LJ agreed with the judge at first instance that the
                    common intention constructive trust analysis (as espoused by the majority in
                        <em>Stack</em> and the UK Supreme Court in <em>Jones</em>) would apply in view of the close friendship
                    between G and S. However, she found that the initial oral agreement between the
                    parties (on a 50:50 split) did not cover the situation at hand. Instead, she
                    inferred from the parties’ course of conduct that they intended their
                    respective shares of the beneficial interest in the flat to reflect, in
                    substance, their respective financial contributions to the purchase price of the
                    flat (which would have been the result under the resulting trust analysis had
                    there been no common intention).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The key drivers for the decisions in Stack and Jones</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    The decisions in <em>Stack</em> and <em>Jones</em> stand out for
                    propounding a refreshed approach to the determination of each party’s
                    share of the beneficial interest in domestic property when domestic property
                    disputes arise – an approach which will, in most cases, leave no room for
                    the resulting trust to operate (see <em>Jones</em> at [24],
                    [25] and [53]). The English departure from the resulting trust solution, so far
                    as domestic property is concerned, appears to be the consequence of changing
                    economic and social conditions in England. The rise in property prices in
                    England (as well as in other parts of the UK), coupled with the dramatic
                    increase in the number of unmarried couples living together (some with dependent
                    children) over the past 50 years, has led to calls for reform in the law
                    concerning the apportionment of property rights for persons outside the reach of
                    the MCA 1973 (UK).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Attempts at legislative reform in the UK,
                    however, have thus far been unsuccessful. For example, prior to <em>Stack</em>, the UK Law Commission set out in 2001 to review
                    the law in this area, which it felt was (see <em>Eighth Programme
                        of Law Reform</em> (Law Com No 274, 2001) at p 7):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… widely accepted [to be] … unduly complex, arbitrary and
                        uncertain in application. It is ill-suited to determining the property
                        rights of those who, because of the informal nature of their relationship,
                        may not have considered their respective entitlements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    In 2002, however, the UK Law Commission
                    published <em>Sharing Homes: A Discussion Paper</em> (Law
                    Com No 278, 2002), which, after an extensive review of the law in England
                    and other common law jurisdictions (including, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, Canada and Australia), concluded (at
                    para 1.31(1)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is quite simply not possible to devise a statutory scheme for the
                        ascertainment and quantification of beneficial interests in the shared home
                        which can operate fairly and evenly across the diversity of domestic
                        circumstances which are now to be encountered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>With this background in mind, the English judiciary believed
                        that the evolution of the law of property to take into account changing
                        social and economic circumstances would have to come from the courts rather
                        than from the UK Parliament (see <em>Stack</em> at
                        [46]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    Further attempts at law reform following
                        <em>Stack</em> were also unsuccessful. After <em>Stack</em>, the UK Law Commission published <em>Cohabitation: The Financial Consequences of Relationship
                        Breakdown</em> (Law Com No 307, 2007) in July 2007, which
                    proposed the introduction of a structured judicial discretion to order property
                    adjustments on the breakdown of a relationship between couples in certain
                    relationships, provided the specified eligibility criteria were met. Despite
                    this, the UK government announced in 2011 that it had no plans to change the
                    law. It was with these developments (or the lack thereof) in mind that the UK
                    Supreme Court in <em>Jones</em> confirmed (at [78]) that it
                    was possible to <em>impute</em> to the parties “[a]
                    common intention which impresse[d] a constructive trust upon the legal ownership
                    of the family home”. We note parenthetically that there was a recent
                    (unsuccessful) attempt in late 2013 to introduce a private member’s Bill
                        (<em>viz</em>, the Cohabitation Rights Bill (HL
                        Bill 49))<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>
                    which sought to implement certain recommendations of the aforesaid 2007 UK Law
                    Commission report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    Another factor which appears to have
                    influenced the decisions in <em>Stack</em> and <em>Jones</em> is the growing view amongst English judges that
                    the assumptions underlying the resulting trust approach to domestic property
                    disputes are no longer appropriate. As we mentioned earlier, the majority in
                        <em>Stack</em> agreed (at [60]) with the observation by
                    Kevin Gray and Susan Francis Gray in <em>Elements of Land
                        Law</em> (4th Ed) at para 10.21 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he balance of emphasis in the law of trusts has transferred
                        from crude factors of money contribution (which are pre-eminent in the
                        resulting trust) towards more subtle factors of intentional bargain (which
                        are the foundational premise of the constructive trust). …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In a similar vein, the UK Supreme Court pointed out in
                            <em>Jones</em> (at [53]) that “[t]he
                        assumptions as to human motivation, which led the courts to impute
                        particular intentions by way of the resulting trust, [were] not appropriate
                        to the ascertainment of beneficial interests in a family
                        home”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    A further driver for the approach in
                        <em>Stack</em> and <em>Jones</em>
                    is, perhaps, the greatly diminished operation in England of the presumption of
                    advancement, which would have tempered the presumption of resulting trust.
                    Indeed, abandoning the presumption of advancement whilst retaining the
                    presumption of resulting trust would place an even greater emphasis upon
                    “crude factors of money contribution” (see <em>Elements of Land Law</em> (4th Ed) at para 10.21), an
                    emphasis which the English judiciary now considers too narrow (see <em>Jones</em> at [24]). In this regard, we note that the
                    presumption of advancement will be abolished in England when s 199 of the
                    Equality Act 2010 (c 15) (UK) comes into force.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The reception to Stack and Jones in England</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    As Lord Walker and
                    Baroness Hale JJSC themselves observed in <em>Jones</em> (at [2]), the reception in England to the new approach to
                    domestic property disputes heralded by <em>Stack</em> has
                    “range[d] from qualified enthusiasm … to almost unqualified
                    disapprobation”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    For instance, Kevin Gray and Susan Francis
                    Gray, the authors of <em>Elements of Land Law</em> (Oxford
                    University Press, 5th Ed, 2009) (which was published prior to the decision
                    in <em>Jones</em>), laud the approach in <em>Stack</em> as “a bold strategy … to escape from a
                    generation of restrictive case law on the law of trusts” (at
                    para 7.3.72).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    At the other end of the spectrum, the
                    doctrinal soundness of the approach in <em>Stack</em> and
                        <em>Jones</em> has been questioned (see William
                    Swadling, “The common intention constructive trust in the House of Lords:
                    An Opportunity Missed” (2007) 123 LQR 511; Adrian Briggs,
                    “Co-ownership and an equitable non sequitur” (2012) 128 LQR
                    183; Martin Dixon, “Editor’s Notebook: The Still Not Ended,
                    Never-ending Story” [2012] Conv 83; and John Mee, “Jones v
                    Kernott: inferring and imputing in Essex” [2012] Conv 167).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    Aside from doctrinal problems, the approach
                    in <em>Stack</em> and <em>Jones</em>
                    has been criticised for being a “litigation-generator” because of
                    the large degree of subjectivity and uncertainty which it has introduced into
                    the realm of property law where domestic property disputes are concerned. In his
                    case note on <em>Stack</em> (see “Editor’s
                    Casenotes” [2007] Conv 352), Dr Dixon points out (at p 353)
                    that despite Baroness Hale’s insistence that “the enquiry into
                    ownership should not be lightly embarked on because of what it might cost the
                    parties” (thus recognising the need for certainty in this area of the
                    law), her non-exhaustive list of factors (at [69] of <em>Stack</em>) which the court can consider in apportioning, in the
                    absence of a written declaration of trust, the beneficial interest in the
                    property concerned among the disputing parties is “the property
                    lawyers’ equivalent of Pandora’s Box” which would lead to
                    precisely the opposite result.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    In fact, the ease with which the default
                    starting position can be displaced is illustrated by the decision in <em>Stack</em> itself, where, despite the relatively
                    unexceptional facts (if we may say so), much was made of the fact that the
                    circumstances were “exceptional” in order to justify the
                    alteration of the <em>prima facie</em> 50:50 division of
                    the joint-names property to 65:35. Dr Dixon, in “The never-ending
                    story – co-ownership after Stack v Dowden” [2007] Conv 456, thus
                    observes (at p 459):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [D]espite the insistence in <em>Stack</em>
                        that it should be difficult to subvert a joint-tenancy of the legal title,
                        it was clear that the factors listed in [69] [of <em>Stack</em>] were so wide-ranging that nearly any case could be
                        made “special”. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    Dr Dixon also points out that the
                    search for fairness between the parties under the approach in <em>Stack</em> and <em>Jones</em> might lead to huge
                    hidden litigation costs since the wide list of non-exhaustive relevant factors
                    which can be taken into account makes it difficult for solicitors to advise
                    their clients on the likelihood of a successful claim in domestic property
                    dispute cases. For this reason, Dr Dixon is of the view that the approach
                    of Lord Neuberger in <em>Stack</em>, in the absence of
                    any legislation, is preferable because of the certainty which it affords. He
                    argues in his 2007 case note on <em>Stack</em> (see [136]
                    above) at p 353:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The wholly different approach of Lord Neuberger – what
                        might be called a traditional Chancery approach – is in marked
                        contrast to that of the majority. Of course, it [<em>ie</em>, the approach of the majority in <em>Stack</em>] will only end in tears – probably those of the
                        Court of Appeal faced with a stream of litigation instigated by dissatisfied
                        claimants seeking a re-adjustment of their “share” of the
                        house on the basis of the fluid, equitable jurisdiction favoured by the
                        majority. Indeed, the real irony might well prove to be that the bill payer
                        in a relationship – usually the working man – can use the
                        principles of <em>Stack</em> to reduce the alleged
                        share of his partner – usually the non-working mother.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    It has also been pointed out by commentators
                    that the lower courts which have applied <em>Stack</em> and
                        <em>Jones</em> have readily displaced the presumption
                    of equality in joint-names cases where the parties make unequal contributions to
                    the purchase price of the property, and – ironically – have given
                    much weight to the financial contributions made by each party. In the result,
                    the division of the beneficial interest in such cases has tended to be very
                    close to the proportions in which the parties contributed to the purchase price
                    of the property. Extra-judicially, Lord Neuberger has observed in
                    “The Conspirators, The Tax Man, The Bill of Rights and A Bit about the
                    Lovers”, a lecture delivered to the Chancery Bar Association on
                    10 March 2008, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15.    … There appeared to be two factors which
                            together persuaded the majority [in <em>Stack</em>]
                            that the presumption [of equality] was rebutted (see paras 87 to 91
                            and para 11). The first was that one of the parties had
                            “contributed far more to the acquisition” than the other.
                            The difference was not, in fact, that great – not even 2 to 1.
                            More importantly, it is scarcely a convincing reason. If the parties had
                            contributed equally, there would be no issue as to beneficial shares.
                            The issue only arises where the contributions are unequal. If the
                            presumption of equality is to be rebutted because the contributions are
                            significantly different, it is a pretty useless presumption: the only
                            time you need it, it isn’t there.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16.    The second factor was that Mr Stack and
                            Miss Dowden kept their assets separate from each other (save for
                            the house itself and an associated endowment policy) and each paid for
                            different aspects of the household expenses. I find it hard to believe
                            it is a particularly unusual state of affairs in the present day even as
                            between married couples. Further, if anything, it can be said to suggest
                            that the parties intended the house to be shared equally because they
                            did not keep their respective investments in the house in separate
                            names. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17.    Are these facts telling enough to live up to
                            discharging the “considerable burden” said by
                            Lord Walker (para 14) to face a party seeking to rebut the
                            presumption? Lady Hale said (at para 92) that these two factors, on
                            their own, did indeed render <em>Stack</em>
                            “a very unusual case” and justified a departure from the
                            principle of equality[.] However, I suspected at the time that this
                            would mean that almost every case would be “very unusual”,
                            and that most cases would end up with a <em>de
                                facto</em> resulting trust apportionment.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    Finally, it seems to us that having
                    dramatically different approaches to property disputes, depending on whether the
                    dispute concerned arises in a domestic or a commercial context, leads to the
                    additional problem of identifying what cases are truly
                    “domestic”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    For example, in the English Court of Appeal
                    case of <em>Laskar</em>, a mother and her daughter
                    purchased a property under a government scheme. The property was sold to them at
                    a discount because the mother had previously occupied the property as a secured
                    tenant. The purchase was financed through a mortgage in the joint names of the
                    mother and the daughter and their joint contributions towards the deposit for
                    the property, with the daughter added as a joint owner because the mother could
                    not afford to buy the property by herself. After the purchase, the mother moved
                    out of the property and the joint mortgage was repaid using income received from
                    renting out the property. The mother subsequently fell out with her daughter,
                    and the latter sought to realise her interest in the property.
                    Lord Neuberger (sitting in the English Court of Appeal) concluded (at [17])
                    that while the approach of the majority in <em>Stack</em>
                    could in principle apply to property jointly held by a mother and her daughter,
                    it would not apply in <em>Laskar</em> because the property
                    had been purchased not as a home, but as an investment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    The approach in <em>Laskar</em> can be contrasted with the more recent approach of the
                    English Court of Appeal in <em>Geary</em>. In <em>Geary</em>, the couple were in a relationship, but were not
                    married to each other. R, using cash, purchased a property in his sole name for
                    the purposes of running a guesthouse business. G later helped R in running the
                    guesthouse business. When the parties fell out, G sought to argue that she had a
                    beneficial interest in the property by way of a common intention constructive
                    trust. Although G’s claim eventually failed, what is interesting for our
                    purposes is that the English Court of Appeal in <em>Geary</em> was willing to adopt the approach in <em>Stack</em> and <em>Jones</em> (albeit with a
                    higher burden of proof to displace the default starting position (see <em>Geary</em> at [18])) even though the property in question had
                    been purchased not as a home, but for investment and business
                purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Different approaches in other Commonwealth countries </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    We also note with interest that other
                    Commonwealth jurisdictions such as Australia and Canada have not followed
                    England in adopting the common intention constructive trust to resolve domestic
                    property disputes, but have instead developed their own distinct
                    approaches.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Australia</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    The Australian courts have moved away from
                    the common intention of the parties and have instead adopted the concept of
                    “unconscionability” as the basis for imposing a constructive trust
                    where the domestic property in question is a shared home. Under this approach,
                    the Australian courts view the sharing of a home as a joint venture focused on
                    the pooling of resources, and the imposition of a constructive trust as a means
                    of preventing the unconscionable retention of disproportionate contributions to
                    the joint enterprise (see <em>Baumgartner v
                        Baumgartner</em> (1987) 164 CLR 137).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    The benefit of such an approach is the
                    avoidance of the search for a common intention which the parties might never
                    have had. The risk, of course, is that opening up the analysis beyond the common
                    intention of the parties leads to an increase in the unpredictability of
                    outcomes and the same problem of spiraling litigation costs highlighted by
                    Dr Dixon above (at [138]). The situation is made more complex as it appears
                    that in Australia, the resulting trust and the common intention constructive
                    trust are still pleaded alongside this modified form of constructive trust in
                    domestic property dispute cases (for a recent example, see <em>Sivritas v Sivritas</em> [2008] VSC 374).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    That said, we should also point out that
                    common law trust doctrines now play a reduced role in Australia in resolving
                    domestic property disputes following the enactment of legislation (at both
                    federal and state levels) to deal with domestic property disputes between
                    partners in a de facto relationship (which falls outside the scope of
                    matrimonial legislation) upon the breakdown of their relationship. Such
                    statutory recourse is available to an aggrieved partner in a de facto
                    relationship provided he or she can show that certain criteria have been
                    fulfilled (see further Adrian J Bradbrook <em>et
                        al</em>, <em>Australian Real Property Law</em>
                    (Thomson Reuters, 5th Ed, 2011) at para 8.375 <em>ff</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Canada</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    The Canadian courts, in contrast, have
                    developed the “remedial constructive trust” based on their law of
                    unjust enrichment to address the property consequences of the breakdown of
                    domestic relationships. In order to establish a claim for unjust enrichment in
                    Canada, the claimant must show: (a) an enrichment of the defendant;
                    (b) a corresponding deprivation on the part of the claimant; and
                    (c) an absence of any juristic reason for the enrichment (see <em>Pettkus v Becker</em> [1980] 2 SCR 834
                        (“<em>Pettkus</em>”), which was affirmed
                    in <em>Kerr v Baranow</em> [2011] 1 SCR
                269).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    The rationale for imposing a remedial
                    constructive trust in situations where the above criteria are fulfilled was
                    explained as follows by Dickson J in <em>Pettkus</em>
                    at [41]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [W]here one person in a relationship tantamount to spousal
                        prejudices herself in the reasonable expectation of receiving an interest in
                        property and the other person in the relationship freely accepts benefits
                        conferred by the first person in circumstances where he knows or ought to
                        have known of that reasonable expectation, it would be unjust to allow the
                        recipient of the benefit to retain it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    It should be noted that
                    “enrichment” in this context has been interpreted widely to
                    include both financial and non-financial contributions (<em>eg</em>, domestic and maintenance works). Like the Australian courts,
                    the Canadian courts have departed from the English common intention constructive
                    trust because of the danger that it involves “the judicial quest for that
                    fugitive common intention” (<em>per</em>
                    Dickson J in <em>Pettkus</em> at [20]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    Having said that, the Canadian courts will
                    only grant the proprietary remedy of a remedial constructive trust where
                    monetary compensation is inappropriate or insufficient (see <em>Peter v Beblow</em> [1993] 1 SCR 980 at 987–988 and
                        <em>Shannon v Gidden</em> (1999) 178 DLR
                    (4th) 395 at [21]–[24]). We have three observations to make on the
                    applicability of the Canadian approach in Singapore:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_150-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the risk of inherent
                        uncertainty and spiraling litigation costs under the Australian approach is
                        also inherent under the Canadian approach, where there even appears to be a
                        remedial discretion for the court to determine whether a party is awarded a
                        personal or a proprietary remedy.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_150-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, as this court observed in <em>Wee
                            Chiaw Sek Anna v Ng Li-Ann Genevieve (sole executrix of the estate of Ng
                            Hock Seng, deceased) and another</em> [2013] 3 SLR 801
                            (“<em>Anna Wee</em>”) at [176], the
                        Canadian position on unjust enrichment is different from the position
                        adopted in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_150-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, even assuming that a proprietary remedy is
                        available in a claim for unjust enrichment, it is uncertain what the unjust
                        factor ought to be. In this regard, Etherton LJ (who, incidentally,
                        formed part of the coram in the English Court of Appeal cases of <em>Geary</em> and <em>Thompson</em>),
                        writing extra-judicially in “Constructive trusts: a new model for
                        equity and unjust enrichment” [2008] CLJ 265, attempted to explain
                            <em>Stack</em> by reference to the law of unjust
                        enrichment, and suggested (at pp 280–281) that a new unjust
                        factor of “unconscionability” ought to be recognised for
                        policy reasons. Although the grounds of unjust enrichment are not closed, a
                        ground based on unconscionable behaviour, in our respectful view, appears to
                        be unduly vague and uncertain (see the discussion in <em>Anna
                            Wee</em> at [100]–[103]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Should Singapore adopt the approach in Stack and Jones towards
                domestic property disputes?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    The question then arises as to whether this
                    court ought to adopt the approach in <em>Stack</em> and
                        <em>Jones</em> and use the common intention
                    constructive trust (or, alternatively, either the Canadian approach or the
                    Australian approach discussed above) as the primary device for resolving
                    domestic property disputes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    In our view, the recent developments in
                    England as well as the disparate approaches adopted in Commonwealth countries
                    such as Australia and Canada to domestic property disputes reveal that no
                    solution is free from difficulties. Further, it is clear that the position in
                    England has developed in response to its changing economic and social landscape.
                    In this regard, this court expressed the view in <em>Lau Siew
                        Kim</em> (at [61]) that in Singapore, “the presumption of
                    advancement still accords with the community’s contemporary societal norms
                    and expectations in particular situations”. While this view might change
                    as our society evolves, we do not think that at present, we ought to depart from
                    it. Further, we are persuaded by the force of the criticisms (as discussed
                    above) which have been laid against the approach in <em>Stack</em> and <em>Jones</em>, in
                    particular:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_152-p2_a"></a>(a)     the increased risk of litigation
                        because of the large degree of subjectivity and uncertainty which the
                        approach in <em>Stack</em> and <em>Jones</em> has introduced into the realm of property law where
                        domestic property disputes are concerned (see [136]–[137]
                        above);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_152-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        difficulty of identifying the applicable legal regime due to uncertainty as
                        to whether or not a property dispute falls within the domestic context (see
                        [140]–[142] above); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_152-p2_c"></a>(c)     related to the first and second criticisms, the risk of
                        increased and disproportionate litigation costs because under the approach
                        in <em>Stack</em> and <em>Jones</em>, it will be difficult for solicitors to advise their
                        clients on the likelihood of a successful claim in domestic property dispute
                        cases (see [138] above; see also [145] and [150(a)] above <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Australian and the Canadian approaches
                        respectively).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    As mentioned at [99] above, the approach
                    which our courts should take in resolving property disputes, especially in the
                    domestic context, must provide proper guidance to the parties, who will most
                    probably (we hope) seek legal advice on their property rights once their
                    relationship breaks down. Of course, the best method of preventing such disputes
                    from even arising is for lawyers advising parties on the acquisition of a
                    property to ask the latter to seriously consider at the outset how the property
                    ought to be divided in the event of a breakdown in their relationship (however
                    uncomfortable and unpleasant this conversation might be). The reality,
                    unfortunately, is that this is often not done for one reason or another. For
                    this reason, we are of the view that Lord Neuberger’s minority
                    approach in <em>Stack</em> has much to commend
                it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    First, and most importantly, it provides
                    pragmatic and clear guidance on when a resulting trust and when a common
                    intention constructive trust, each of which is a distinct concept, applies in
                    this complex and difficult area of the law. This in turn facilitates informed
                    negotiations after a relationship has broken down, and prevents unnecessary and
                    costly litigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    Second, and related to the first point,
                    Lord Neuberger’s approach removes the unclear distinction that has
                    emerged in England between the domestic and the commercial contexts, thus
                    ensuring better consistency of results.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    Third, this approach prevents the court from
                    imputing to the parties an intention which they never had <em>vis-à-vis</em> the quantification of their respective shares of the
                    beneficial interest in the property concerned; that is, it prevents the court
                    from foisting upon the parties an intention which they never had in order to
                    achieve a “fair” result. This ensures that the common intention
                    constructive trust, if successfully invoked, is not used as a smokescreen for
                    the courts to effect “palm tree” justice in an unprincipled and
                    arbitrary manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    Fourth, as Paul S Davies and Graham
                    Virgo, the authors of <em>Equity &amp; Trusts: Text, Cases and
                        Materials</em> (Oxford University Press, 2013), observe (at
                    p 447), the upshot of Lord Neuberger’s approach is that the
                    common intention constructive trust would also be applicable in the commercial
                    context. The authors argue that this would be a welcome development of the law
                    since there is no policy reason why the presumption of resulting trust in a
                    commercial context cannot be rebutted by the common intention of the parties
                    (although principle would suggest that it would be easier to rebut this
                    presumption in the domestic context).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    Fifth, the use of the resulting trust as the
                    default analytical tool in the absence of any evidence of a common intention
                    between the parties as to how the beneficial interest in the property concerned
                    is to be held is also consistent with the lack-of-intention analysis of the
                    resulting trust discussed above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    It may be that the approach advocated by
                    Lord Neuberger would lead to outcomes which some people might perceive as
                    “unfair” in certain cases. We acknowledge that. However, we are
                    ultimately of the view that subjective fairness may not be the most appropriate
                    yardstick to apply in resolving property disputes, and that each party’s
                    share of the beneficial interest in the property concerned ought to be
                    determined in a principled and fairly predictable manner. Having said that, we
                    accept that the resulting trust analysis may require further refinement. We are
                    also cognisant that this judgment does not (and is not intended to) resolve all
                    issues concerning the application of the resulting trust as well as its
                    difficult and intricate relationship with the common intention constructive
                    trust (and, indeed, the doctrine of proprietary estoppel). It is, however, hoped
                    that these doctrines can continue to develop in a coherent and principled manner
                    under the approach which we have adopted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    In view of our discussion above, a property
                    dispute involving parties who have contributed unequal amounts towards the
                    purchase price of a property and who have not executed a declaration of trust as
                    to how the beneficial interest in the property is to be apportioned can be
                        <em>broadly</em> analysed using the following steps in
                    relation to the available evidence:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_160-p2_a"></a>(a)     Is there sufficient evidence of the
                        parties’ respective financial contributions to the purchase price of
                        the property? If the answer is “yes”, it will be presumed that
                        the parties hold the beneficial interest in the property in proportion to
                        their respective contributions to the purchase price (<em>ie</em>, the presumption of resulting trust arises). If the
                        answer is “no”, it will be presumed that the parties hold the
                        beneficial interest in the same manner as that in which the legal interest
                        is held.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_160-p2_b"></a>(b)     Regardless of whether the answer to (a) is “yes” or
                        “no”, is there sufficient evidence of an express or an
                        inferred common intention that the parties should hold the beneficial
                        interest in the property in a proportion which is different from that set
                        out in (a)? If the answer is “yes”, the parties will hold the
                        beneficial interest in accordance with that common intention instead, and
                        not in the manner set out in (a). In this regard, the court may not impute a
                        common intention to the parties where one did not in fact
                    exist.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_160-p2_c"></a>(c)     If the
                        answer to both (a) and (b) is “no”, the parties will hold the
                        beneficial interest in the property in the same manner as the manner in
                        which they hold the legal interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_160-p2_d"></a>(d)     If the answer to (a) is “yes” but the
                        answer to (b) is “no”, is there nevertheless sufficient
                        evidence that the party who paid a larger part of the purchase price of the
                        property (“X”) intended to benefit the other party
                        (“Y”) with the entire amount which he or she paid? If the
                        answer is “yes”, then X would be considered to have made a
                        gift to Y of that larger sum and Y will be entitled to the entire beneficial
                        interest in the property.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_160-p2_e"></a>(e)     If the answer to (d) is “no”, does the
                        presumption of advancement nevertheless operate to rebut the presumption of
                        resulting trust in (a)? If the answer is “yes”, then:
                        (i) there will be no resulting trust on the facts where the property is
                        registered in Y’s sole name (<em>ie</em>, Y will
                        be entitled to the property absolutely); and (ii) the parties will hold
                        the beneficial interest in the property jointly where the property is
                        registered in their joint names. If the answer is “no”, the
                        parties will hold the beneficial interest in the property in proportion to
                        their respective contributions to the purchase price.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_160-p2_f"></a>(f)     Notwithstanding the situation at the
                        time the property was acquired, is there sufficient and compelling evidence
                        of a subsequent express or inferred common intention that the parties should
                        hold the beneficial interest in a proportion which is different from that in
                        which the beneficial interest was held at the time of acquisition of the
                        property? If the answer is “yes”, the parties will hold the
                        beneficial interest in accordance with the subsequent altered proportion. If
                        the answer is “no”, the parties will hold the beneficial
                        interest in one of the modes set out at (b)–(e) above, depending on
                        which is applicable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    Using the present case as an illustration of
                    the application of this framework, the starting position would be that the
                    parties’ respective shares of the beneficial interest in the Property at
                    the time of its acquisition would be in the same proportions as their respective
                    contributions to the purchase price of the Property, that is, 84.17:15.83 in
                    favour of Mr See (step (a)). In the present case, the evidence as to
                    the parties’ common intention (if indeed there was one) at the 1983
                    Meeting was unsatisfactory and it would not be justified to depart from the
                    apportionment of the beneficial interest indicated by the presumption of
                    resulting trust (step (b)). We were satisfied that there was sufficient
                    evidence to indicate that Mr See did not intend to benefit Mdm Chan by
                    any of his financial contributions to the purchase price of the Property
                    (step (d)), and the presumption of advancement was not applicable either in
                    view of the state of their relationship at the material time (step (e)).
                    There being no argument that Mr See and Mdm Chan subsequently agreed
                    to hold the beneficial interest in the Property in a different manner after the
                    date of acquisition of the Property, step (f) was not
                applicable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    For the reasons set out above, we allow this
                    appeal in part and declare that Mdm Chan holds only 84.17% of the
                    beneficial interest in the Property, as opposed to the whole of the beneficial
                    interest, on a resulting trust for Mr See.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    Mdm Chan is entitled to 15% of her
                    costs in this appeal. The parties are to bear their own costs of the hearing
                    below. The usual consequential orders shall apply.</p>
