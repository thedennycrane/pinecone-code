Mr Wang’s evidence was that whilst he signed on the invoices (as placed before him by the accounts department) this was purely as an administrative matter and did not mean that he was personally approving the sum actually charged. He also stated that that he was not responsible for approving legal fees charged; in any case, he was not Mr Zhu’s supervisor. I also note Mr Wang’s evidence that the trader had an interest in the cost of the legal fees because the cost of litigation would be a factor in determining the trader’s discretionary bonus.

Sometimes, a general indication of the type of disbursements that were likely to be incurred (such as overseas travel in connection with the matter) might be provided. In other cases, it appears that there would be no indication at all as to the general nature of the costs and disbursements to which the deposit would be applied. In addition, it appears that the Firm would, from time to time, issue particular invoices seeking specific sums in respect of various items of work that had been performed. The evidence is that once the Firm sent Mr Zhu a request for a deposit or an invoice, Mr Zhu would pass the same to the Client’s accounting department for processing and approval. The accounting department would then prepare payment vouchers against the documents to be signed by Mr Wang. So long as the payment vouchers and documents were regular on their face, Mr Wang would sign the cheques.

</div> The latter invoice is expressly headed “(Interim) Tax Invoice” and states that it was for part payment of service charges incurred for, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, meetings with English solicitors over stated periods. Section 2 of the LPA provides that “‘costs’ includes fees, charges, disbursements, expenses and remuneration”. It follows that a bill for disbursements or a request for a deposit to meet future disbursements is also a bill or request in respect of costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">29 </span>In the present case, the Client seeks a declaration that the Disputed Invoices are not proper bills in circumstances where (i) it has already paid in full on some of the invoices; and (ii) the amounts due under some of the invoices were satisfied by the Firm making deductions against the Client’s funds held by the Firm.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">30 </span><span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>It is convenient to deal first with the issue of what constitutes a proper bill under the LPA before touching on matters relating to the fact of payment and/or satisfaction by deduction. A client who disputes the validity of the bill must seek a declaration that the bill is not a proper bill under the LPA. This is important since a dispute over the validity of a Bill is different from an application for taxation. As will be seen (<span class="font-italic">infra</span> [35]), once a client applies for taxation of a Bill, it will be too late to challenge the validity of the Bill as such.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">31 </span>The procedure for taxation of costs is governed by O 59 r 20 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed), which requires a party entitled to require any costs to be taxed to begin the proceedings by filing the bill of costs at the Registry within the applicable time limit. The form of the bill of costs is dealt with by O 59 r 24, which provides that the bill must set out: (i) the work done in the cause or matter, (ii) the work done for and in the taxation of costs; and (iii) all disbursements. O 59 r 24(2) states that the costs claimed for all work done in the cause or matter must be indicated as one global sum, whereas for disbursements, the sum claimed for each item is to be set out.  Appendix 1 to O 59, which deals with costs on taxation, requires that the bill of costs must set out sufficient information to enable the Registrar to have regard to the matters set out in the rule, including the complexity and difficulty of the matter, the skill required, the number and importance of the documents, and the urgency of the matter to the client.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">32 </span><span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2018</span>, Vol 1 (Foo Chee Hock gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2018) (“<span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span>”) at para 59/24/1states that the form of the bill of costs must also comply with the applicable practice directions and that failure to do so amounts to non-compliance with the Rules of Court and may result in rejection of the bill. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">33 </span>I note, however, that O 59 of the Rules of Court applies to bills <span class="font-italic">drawn for taxation</span>, and that the Rules of Court do not address the requirements applicable to bills which are not drawn for taxation (see <span class="font-italic">Ho Cheng Lay v Low Yong Sen </span>[2009] 3 SLR(R) 206 (“<span class="font-italic">Ho Cheng Lay</span>”) at [13]). Nevertheless, the requirements in O 59 shed light on what solicitor-and-client bills, even if not drawn for taxation, should contain. In this regard, it is worth noting the following observations in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span> at para 59/24/2:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A lawyer owes a duty to his client to draw up his (commercial) bill clearly and accurately and with such attention to detail as he would do in undertaking any work on behalf of his client </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">34 </span>One might also note the comments in <span class="font-italic">The Law of Advocates and Solicitors in Singapore and West Malaysia</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at p 699, where, citing <span class="font-italic">Cook v</span><span class="font-italic"> Gillard</span> (1852) 1 E &amp; B 26 (“<span class="font-italic">Cook v Gillard</span>”), it is stated that the degree of itemization required of a bill of costs is a question of degree,  but the general question is whether from the point of view of the client, the client is able to ascertain by perusing the bill what business was done for him and whether the charges were <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> reasonable.)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">35 </span>In <span class="font-italic">Ho Cheng Lay</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the plaintiff brought an application for certain bills to be taxed. However, in the course of submissions before Kan Ting Chiu J,  the plaintiff’s solicitor sought to introduce an argument that his client was not liable to pay the disputed bills, as they were not proper bills under s 122 (at [10]). Kan J found that the plaintiff could not take this point after making an application for taxation <span class="font-italic">alone</span>, because by making such an application, the plaintiff had acknowledged that there <span class="font-italic">were</span> bills to be taxed (at [11]). Instead, the court considered the lack of detail in the bills which the plaintiff complained of as a factor in deciding whether to send the bill for taxation. Following the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ralph Hume Garry (a firm) v Gwillim </span>[2003] 1 WLR 510 (“<span class="font-italic">Garry</span>”), Kan J found that the skeletal bills that were presented by the defendant solicitor to the plaintiff fell short of the standard that was required. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">36 </span>In <span class="font-italic">Garry</span>, Ward LJ<span class="font-italic"> </span>laid down the following principles to be applied in deciding whether a proper bill had been presented (at [32]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) The legislative intention was that the client should have sufficient material on the face of the bill as to the nature of the charges to enable him to obtain advice as to taxation. The need for advice was to be able to judge the reasonableness of the charges and the risks of having to pay the costs of taxation if less than one-sixth of the amount was taxed off.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) That rule was, however, subject to these caveats: (a) <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">precise exactness of form was not required</span> and the rule was not that another solicitor should be able on looking at the bill, <span class="font-italic">and without any further explanation from the client</span>, see on the face of the bill all information requisite to enable him to say if the charges were reasonable; (b) thus <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the client must show that further information which he really and practically wanted in order to decide whether to insist on taxation had been withheld and that he was not already in possession of all the information that he could reasonably want for consulting on taxation</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) The test, it seems to me, is thus, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not</span> whether the bill on its face is objectively sufficient, but whether the information in the bill <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">supplemented by what is subjectively known to the client</span> enables the client with advice to take an informed decision whether or not to exercise the only right <span class="font-italic">then</span> open to him, viz, to seek taxation reasonably free from the risk of having to pay the costs of that taxation. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) A balance has to be struck between the need, on the one hand, to protect the client and for the bill, together with what he knows, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">to give him sufficient information to judge whether he has been overcharged</span> and, on the other hand, to <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">protect the solicitor against late ambush</span> being laid on a technical point by a client who seeks only to evade paying his debt.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics, emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">37 </span>Flowing from these principles, Ward LJ concluded that whether a solicitor’s bill is sufficiently particularised as to be a proper bill complying with the UK Solicitors Act 1974 (c 47) (UK) (“the 1974 UK Act”) “will vary from case to case” (at [70]) The client can show that the bill is not proper if the bill does not have a “sufficient narrative” to allow the client to identify what he is being charged for, and if “[the client] does not have sufficient knowledge from other documents in his possession or from what he has been told reasonably to take advice whether or not to apply for that bill to be taxed”. Ward LJ added (at [70]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The sufficiency of the narrative and the sufficiency of [the client’s] knowledge will vary from case to case, and the more he knows, the less the bill may need to spell it out for him. The interests of justice require that the balance be truck between protection of the client’s right to seek taxation and of the solicitor’s right to recover not being defeated by opportunistic resort to technicality.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">38 </span>The decision in <span class="font-italic">Garry</span> concerned the question of whether a solicitor’s bill is “a bill <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> complying with [the 1974 UK Act]” within the meaning of s 69 of that statute, which is the English equivalent of s 118(3) of the LPA. Although the case concerned a different statutory provision, its statement of the level of particularisation and itemisation required of a solicitor’s bill has been accepted by our courts in the context of s 122 of the LPA (see <span class="font-italic">Ho Cheng Lay </span>([33] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [16], <span class="font-italic">Sports Connection Pte Ltd v Asia Law Corp and another </span>[2010] 4 SLR 590 (“<span class="font-italic">Sports Connection</span>”) at [42] and <span class="font-italic">Kosui Singapore Pte Ltd v Thangavelu </span>[2015] 5 SLR 722 at [89]). <span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">39 </span>These then are the principles this court will apply when deciding whether the Disputed Invoices are “proper” bills under the LPA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">“Special circumstances” under s 122 of the LPA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">40 </span>In the event that this court finds that the Disputed Invoices are proper bills under the LPA, the question that arises is whether the Client is entitled to have the bills sent for taxation under s 120. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">41 </span>The difficulty the Client faces is that there are two disqualifying events under s 122 of the LPA. The first disqualifying event is the expiration of 12 months from the delivery of a bill of costs (“the time limit disqualification”). The second disqualifying event is the payment of a bill of costs (“the payment disqualification”). If either one or both of these disqualifying events have occurred, the court must be satisfied that there are special circumstances justifying an order for taxation before it can make an order for the bill of costs to be taxed.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">42 </span>Leaving aside the time-limit disqualification, it is noted that a question has also arisen as to whether the payment disqualification is applicable. The payment disqualification is based on (i) payment by the Client of certain invoices by cheques; and (ii) deduction by the Firm of certain amounts from monies held in the Firm’s client account by way of deposit and/or from the proceeds of the 123 Award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">43 </span>The Client’s claims that it had been requested on two occasions to provide deposits: (i) S$50,000 in January 2014 and (ii) S$100,000 in January 2015. Leaving aside the details (which will be gone into later), on both occasions, the Client was basically asked to pay these sums to meet disbursements and costs that may be incurred. As will be seen, in both cases, the Firm subsequently made deductions against the deposits held in the client account without first raising invoices or bills or seeking the Client’s specific consent to the deductions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">44 </span>The Client’s position was that it was not aware of the specific deductions at the time when they were made. It was only later (in some cases very much later) that they were provided with accounts, in the sense of invoices, to explain how the funds had been used. The Client alleges that it was never asked if it consented, and that it did not consent, to the Firm making deductions from its moneys held in the Firm’s client account in this manner.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">45 </span>In addition, on one occasion the Firm also deducted or retained the sum of S$300,000 from the 123 Award monies which they had received from Metalloyd in the SIAC 123 arbitration. Once again, leaving aside the details, which are disputed, the Client’s basic position is that this deduction was improper and done without their consent. Accordingly, it is argued that they did not “pay” this amount so as to trigger the payment disqualification under s 122.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">46 </span>It is convenient to examine in detail the legal principles regarding what amounts to payment later, in connection with the relevant invoices. That said, I make the following observation at the outset: It appears that law firms frequently require clients to place deposits to be held in the firm’s client account against that firm’s fees and disbursements. Thereafter, specific sums are deducted or set-off against the deposits as and when bills or invoices are issued to the client. Under the applicable legal professional rules (which will be examined later) the law firm must raise a bill of costs with the client prior to making the deduction. In short, the client’s consent is needed if monies held in the client account are used. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">47 </span>For example, in <span class="font-italic">Kosui </span>([38] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), a total of eight bills were paid by deductions from the client’s deposit held by the law firm. Whilst there was a dispute as to whether the law firm had obtained the client’s approval to make the deduction for the last bill, it was common ground that, for the purposes of the application for leave to tax, all the bills were to be treated as having been paid (see <span class="font-italic">Kosui </span>at [20]). The court in<span class="font-italic"> Kosui </span>did not have to consider the question of what constitutes payment by the client such as to trigger the payment disqualification. In the case at hand, however, it is not common ground that all the bills were paid by the Client. Instead, as will be examined in more detail later, the Client’s basic position is that many of the “payments” were unilateral deductions made without its consent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">48 </span>There is no strict rule as to what constitutes special circumstances within the meaning of s 122 of the LPA. It is for the court to decide on the facts of every case whether there are special circumstances which make it right to refer the solicitor’s bill for taxation (<span class="font-italic">Kosui</span> at [61]). As summarised by the court in <span class="font-italic">Kosui </span>at [61], some of the instances in which special circumstances justifying taxation were proven include:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Prolonged negotiation over fees between solicitor and client after which the client applies for taxation (see <span class="font-italic">Wee Harry Lee v Haw Par Brothers International Ltd </span>[1979–1980] SLR(R) 603 at [14]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) A disciplinary committee’s finding that the solicitor has in fact overcharged (see <span class="font-italic">Ho Cheng Lay</span> ([26] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [5]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) An impecunious client who requires time to secure a grant of legal aid in order to apply under s 120 of the LPA for an order of taxation of a delivered bill of costs (see <span class="font-italic">Ho Cheng Lay</span> at [6]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) A bill which fails to provide sufficient information, even when supplemented by what is subjectively known to the client, to enable the client to take an informed decision on whether to seek taxation (see <span class="font-italic">Ho Cheng Lay</span> at [17]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The fact that the solicitor, without his client’s knowledge or consent, appropriated funds belonging in equity to the client in order to pay the bill (see <span class="font-italic">Ho Cheng Lay</span> at [23]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Duress, pressure or fraud by the solicitor (see <span class="font-italic">Sports Connection</span>, ([38] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [35], citing <span class="font-italic">In re Hirst &amp; Capes </span>[1908] 1 KB 982 at 996.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">49 </span>The list of special circumstances set out above is not exhaustive. As helpfully explained by Vinodh Coomaraswamy J in <span class="font-italic">Kosui </span>at [62]–[63], what counts as special circumstances in any given case will depend on how the facts in that case justify referring the bill to taxation even though one or both of the disqualifying events under s 122 has already set in: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">62 … More importantly, special circumstances in any given case cannot be asserted or proved in a vacuum but must, <span class="font-italic">in some rational way</span>, address the <span class="font-italic">fundamental question</span> which s 122 poses: <span class="font-italic">Why is it right to refer the solicitor’s bill for taxation even though the client has allowed one or both of the disqualifying events under s 122 to be triggered</span><span class="font-italic">?</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">63 <span class="font-italic">One of the ways</span> in which a client can answer this fundamental question is by showing <span class="font-italic">how the special circumstances explain and excuse his conduct in allowing the disqualifying event to set in</span>. How the special circumstances do that will, to a large extent, depend on the <span class="font-italic">particular</span> disqualifying event which is in play. That is because <span class="font-italic">each disqualifying event serves a distinct underlying purpose</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">50 </span>What is worth noting from this passage is the principle that each disqualifying event serves a distinct underlying purpose, and that the facts cited as “special circumstances” must, “in some rational way”, excuse the applicant’s conduct in allowing that disqualifying event to set in.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">51 </span>The requirement that the client apply for taxation within 12 months of the bill’s delivery serves the same purpose as a limitation period (<span class="font-italic">Kosui</span> at [64]). In other words, it is intended to “prevent stale claims, to relieve a potential defendant of the uncertainty of a potential claim against [him] and to remove the injustice of increasing difficulties of proof as time goes by” (<span class="font-italic">Kosui</span> at [64], citing <span class="font-italic">Teh Siew Hua v Tan Kim Chiong </span>[2010] 4 SLR 123 at [25] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Steven Chong J (as he then was), citing Mummery LJ in <span class="font-italic">Ridgeway Motors (Isleworth) Ltd v ALTS Ltd </span>[2005] 1 WLR 2871 at [31]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">52 </span>As for the requirement that the client should apply to tax the bill before he pays it, this serves to discourage the client from approbating and reprobating and upholds the solicitor’s interest in security of receipt for his fees (<span class="font-italic">Kosui </span>at [64]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">53 </span>Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Kosui </span>(at [65]), Coomaraswamy J gave the example of a client who does not pay his solicitor’s bill but allows the 12-month period to elapse. In this example, the client is likely able to satisfy the court that it is right to refer the bill to taxation if he can show that he failed to apply in time because he was engaged in prolonged negotiations with the solicitor over the bill. In contrast, if a client pays his solicitor’s bill and then applies to tax it within the 12-month period, it would be immaterial for the client to show that he paid the bill after a period of prolonged negotiations with the solicitor. This is because those negotiations do not explain the relevant disqualifying event: that the bill has been paid. The client must instead show special circumstances excusing his decision to pay the bill. As earlier stated (<span class="font-italic">Kosui at</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[64]), there must be a rational connection between the special circumstances and the disqualifying event which is in play. Coomaraswamy J also held that if both disqualifying events are in play, then the special circumstances advanced must have a rational connection to both events (<span class="font-italic">Kosui </span>at [65]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">54 </span>At the same time, it must be recognised that taxation proceedings serve a very limited and distinct purpose. According to <span class="font-italic">The Law of Advocates and Solicitors </span>( [27] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at pp 708–709:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Taxation of costs is simply the ascertainment by an officer of the court, the taxing master, of the proper remuneration of a solicitor for business transacted. ‘[It] is … a quantification machinery by means of which the recoverable amount of costs, disbursements, expenses, etc is ascertained.’ For those purposes, the taxing master has incidental jurisdiction to take an account of such sums of money as may have been paid or duly appropriated towards satisfaction of the bill of costs; but he has no jurisdiction to order an account of dealings and pecuniary matters unconnected with the bill to be taxed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This is consistent with what the Court of Three Judges had to say about taxation proceedings in <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v </span><span class="font-italic">Andre Ravindran Saravanapavan Arul </span>[2011] 4 SLR 1184 (“<span class="font-italic">Andre Ravindran</span>”) at [32]: that “[t]axation provides the best means for an aggrieved client <span class="font-italic">to determine what the proper fee is for the actual work done by his lawyer</span>” [emphasis added].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">55 </span>Taxation by the court accordingly provides a conclusive and objective method of determining what fees the solicitor is entitled to. Further, in <span class="font-italic">Andre Ravindran</span>, it was noted that all solicitors should act on the basis that they can have their bill of costs taxed and they must remember that many clients do not know this (at [33]). For this reason, the court warned that solicitors have an obligation to inform their clients of this option and they fail or omit to do so at their peril. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">56 </span>Thus where a client is unhappy with the bill of costs that he has been presented with, for example, because of the amount charged or because of suspicion that unnecessary work was performed, the best course of action and, indeed, the first port of call, should be to have the bill of costs taxed. The amount of fees awarded after taxation would then enable the Law Society to assess if the overcharging was such as to merit investigation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">57 </span>Further, as stated in <span class="font-italic">Kosui</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([38] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [57], a well-founded complaint of overcharging lodged with the Law Society undoubtedly carries serious disciplinary and reputational consequences for a solicitor, but the Law Society disciplinary procedure does not serve the goal of rectifying the consequences of overcharging for the client. Only taxation under s 120 of the LPA can yield for the client a refund or a remission of overcharged fees. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">58 </span>Before I turn to consider each of the Disputed Invoices in detail, I underscore some points on “special circumstances” in respect of: (i) the scenarios under which a dispute may arise between a solicitor and client over monies held by the solicitor for the client and fees due to the solicitor; (ii) allegations of overcharging; (iii) breach of the legal professional rules; and (iv) making an improper deduction from a client’s account.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Disputes over deposits, client’s monies and fees</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">59 </span>The circumstances under which a dispute can arise between a client and his solicitor regarding deposits and monies in the client’s account are varied. Not all disputes are amenable to be “solved” by means of taxation of a bill of costs. In the first place, the dispute over monies may not be a dispute over a bill of costs. Where a solicitor wrongly retains monies belonging to a client (for example, where the solicitor wrongly retains the fruits of successful litigation or the proceeds from the sale of a property) the claim may lie in breach of fiduciary duty, or monies had and received. If the solicitor’s defence is that he is owed costs for fees and disbursements, as a result of which he claims some right to deduct the appropriate sum from the client’s monies held by the firm under some principle of set-off or agreement, it does not seem that an application to have the bill of costs taxed is the appropriate course of action as such (at least not on its own).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">60 </span>The existence of a right to deduct or set-off the solicitor’s claim against the client’s monies is not a matter that can be properly addressed by taxation <span class="font-italic">per se</span> before the Registrar. It seems to me that in such a situation the proper course of action is to (i) establish the existence of a right of deduction or set-off; and (ii) apply for taxation of the bill of costs to establish what are the appropriate fees which the lawyer can claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">61 </span>Indeed, I observe that making unilateral deductions from a client’s account without first raising a bill or otherwise obtaining consent from the client may be a breach of legal professional rules of conduct. For example, the client may have transferred large sums to the solicitor by way of deposit for future expenses and disbursements in connection with the case being handled by the solicitor. If a solicitor makes deduction against the deposit without issuing any bill of costs to the client, whether at the time of the deduction or thereafter, then as noted previously, it seems there is no bill of costs to be sent for taxation as such. Other forms of legal proceedings may have to be considered in such a scenario. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Allegations of overcharging</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">62 </span>Reference has already been made to the issue of whether the court can have regard to allegations of overcharging. Whilst it is rightly said that taxation provides the best way of determining what the solicitor is entitled to claim as fees, overcharging is a matter that is best raised and addressed prior to payment and/or expiration of the 12-month period under s 122. Once a disqualification event has set in, it cannot be assumed that the law should lean in favour of granting leave where overcharging is raised. In some cases, the allegation may be nothing more than a bare complaint or an expression of regret for having paid a fee now felt to be on the “high side.” When a client alleges “overcharging” against his lawyer, it should be borne in mind that legal fees charged for work can and will vary between lawyers and firms. Viewing the issue through the lens of reasonableness, it is likely that there will always be a band of reasonableness into which a fee will fit. Just because the client feels he has paid on the high side does not necessarily mean that he has been overcharged. Indeed, as pointed out in <span class="font-italic">Andre Ravindran </span>([54] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [32]–[33], where a client takes the view that there is overcharging, the bill should be taxed by the court first before a complaint is made to the Law Society.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">63 </span>That said, the court hearing an application for leave to have bills taxed after payment or expiration of the 12-month period may find that it is in an awkward position. Taxation, to be sure, provides the most objective method of determining what is the reasonable fee that the lawyer is entitled to for the work in question. But if a bare allegation of “overcharging” constitutes special circumstances justifying the grant of leave to tax a bill that has already been paid, or in respect of which the 12-month period has expired, the statutory disqualifications will have little meaning as they will be readily bypassed. It follows that care must be taken where a client seeks to dispute the reasonableness of the bill after one of the disqualifying events has set in. Merely to make a general assertion that the bill of costs is unreasonable or unfair will not ordinarily be sufficient.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Breach of legal professional rules</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">64 </span>It is clear from the <span class="font-italic">Kosui </span>case ([38] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) that there is a sharp distinction between the procedure for resolving a complaint of professional misconduct and the procedure for resolving a fee dispute. For example, just because the lawyer was guilty of some professional misconduct (such as misapplication of client’s deposit against fees) does not mean that the fees were excessive or unreasonable. Indeed, as <span class="font-italic">Kosui’s </span>case points out, a client who accepts the fee is reasonable but is objecting to the misapplication of the client deposit is unlikely to establish special circumstances. As Coomaraswamy J states<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [66]), in such a situation, the special circumstance advanced has nothing to do with the object of taxation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">65 </span>On the other hand, if the client’s case is that he had been deceived by the lawyer into paying the bill because he had been told the work was done by a senior lawyer with specialist knowledge of the area of dispute when in fact<span class="font-italic"> all</span> the work was done by an unsupervised junior lawyer with only 1-year post-qualification experience, such a client may well be able to establish special circumstances. Quite apart from professional misconduct, in such a scenario, the rationale of applying the disqualification to discourage the client from approbating and reprobating will likely rapidly fade away.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Misapplying client’s deposit against fees</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">66 </span>What I have said thus far should not be taken to mean that rules of professional conduct may never be relevant to the consideration of special circumstances under s 122 of the LPA. Consider r 7(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iv) of the Legal Profession (Solicitors’ Accounts) Rules (Cap 161, R 8, 1999 Rev Ed) (“LP(SA)R”). That rule provides that once a client’s money is in a firm’s client account, it can be withdrawn to pay the solicitor’s costs where a bill of costs or other written intimation of the amount of costs incurred has been delivered to the client and the client has been notified that the money held for him in the client account will be used to pay such costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">67 </span>The point of r 7(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iv) is that the client ought to be notified of how the money he deposits with his solicitor is being put to use by his solicitor <span class="font-italic">before</span> the solicitor actually puts that money to use. The first point of overlap with s 122 of the LPA is, obviously, that when such a bill of costs is delivered to the client, the 12-month limitation period under s 122 begins counting. The other point of overlap concerns the issue of when, if ever, a bill of costs can be said to be paid by the client where it is the solicitor who, in order to satisfy his costs, draws down on the initial deposit that the client pays to account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">68 </span>In <span class="font-italic">Ho Cheng Lay </span>([33] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), Kan J held that payment under s 122 of the LPA must be an act of the paying party. The paying party can make direct payment of the costs after receiving the bill. He can also agree that the solicitor pay himself out of funds that the solicitor is holding for him (<span class="font-italic">Ho Cheng Lay </span>at [18]). But in <span class="font-italic">Ho Cheng Lay</span>, since the solicitor’s deductions from the sale proceeds to satisfy his bills were made <span class="font-italic">without</span> the client’s agreement and consent, Kan J found that the bills were <span class="font-italic">not</span> paid within the meaning of s 122 (at [23]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">69 </span>It follows that a client can be said to have paid a bill of costs where a solicitor draws down on the client’s money in accordance with the procedure envisaged under r 7(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iv) of the LP(SA)R – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, having obtained the client’s consent. Indeed, the emphasis on client’s consent to payment is also seen from r 7(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii) of the LP(SA)R, which permits drawdowns on a client account of “money drawn on the client’s authority”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">70 </span>Conversely, if the solicitor does not follow the procedure envisaged under r 7(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iv) of the LP(SA)R, unless the solicitor can show through some other means that the client is aware and has consented to the payment of that particular bill of costs from the monies held by the solicitor on account, it is unlikely that the client can be said to have<span class="font-italic"> paid</span> that particular bill.  In such a case, the solicitor will also have breached the LP(SA)R by deducting from the client’s account without first raising a bill or otherwise informing the client of the deduction or obtaining his consent. But as noted (see [64] above), the question on taxation remains whether the fees deducted were, in any case, reasonable. The fact that the solicitor may have breached the professional rules by making the unilateral deduction will not, in itself, justify referring a bill for taxation if the fees have been accepted as reasonable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Disputed Invoices</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The 15 January Invoice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">71 </span>After the 123 Award was issued on 2 January 2014, discussions over the question of enforcement soon took place between the Client and the Firm.

</div> That email specifically referred to a meeting in the morning between Mr Gabriel and Mr Zhu, where it was agreed that Mr Gabriel “would proceed to London to discuss with English solicitors to register the award in London”. The email also noted that the award would also be registered in Singapore. The email continued that “for the purpose of registration it is agreed you will pay S$50,000 towards initial costs and disbursements”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">78 </span>Although the Client first seeks a declaration that it is not liable to pay any of the Disputed Invoices (on the grounds that they are not proper invoices), it seems that by the time of its closing submissions, it had taken a different stance at least on the 15 January Invoice.  Its main complaint now is that no account of these funds was provided by the Firm. As a result, the Client says that it had no way of disputing the reasonableness of the costs incurred. It was only in May 2016, when R&amp;T wrote to the Firm asking about this payment, that the Firm provided an account in an email on 23 May 2016 (see [73] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">79 </span>Paradoxically, on its part, the Firm says that the Client had intentionally mischaracterised the 15 January 2014 email as an “invoice” so as to persuade the court that there is a bill capable of being taxed. The Firm argues that this email was merely an email for disbursements and not an invoice <span class="font-italic">per se</span>.

</div> The Firm also says that the Client was well aware that Mr Gabriel would be travelling to London in or around September to October 2014 to instruct English solicitors in registering the arbitration award. It bases this claim on an email it had sent to the Client on 24 September 2014.

</div> Thus, it says that the Client had made a false allegation that it was not informed of Mr Gabriel’s trip to London. The Firm does not make any submissions on the rest of the disbursements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">80 </span>I pause to note that <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure </span>states (at para 59/24/3) that the ambit of “disbursements” is not defined in the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (nor, indeed, in the LPA). That said, in <span class="font-italic">Ong Jane Rebecca v Lim Lie Hoa &amp; Ors</span> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 189 at [11], the High Court held that the word “disbursements” was wide enough to include loans or debts properly incurred by a party for the purposes of the litigation, provided that it is proven that these loans or debts are due and payable and would be paid after taxation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">81 </span>Looking at the evidence as a whole, I am of the view that the sum of S$50,000 that the Client then paid to the Firm on 16 January 2014 is what r 2(1) of the LP(SA)R calls “client’s money”, that is, “money held or received by a solicitor on account of a person for whom he is acting (in relation to the holding or receipt of such money) either as a solicitor, or in connection with his practice as a solicitor”. The sum of S$50,000 was basically a deposit to be held in the client account against the Firm’s fees and costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">82 </span>Rule 3(1) of the LP(SA)R mandates that client’s money shall be paid without delay into a client account. The Firm did this.

</div>
</div>
</div> And as noted, once the money is in the client account, it can be withdrawn to pay the solicitor’s costs only where a bill of costs or other written intimation of the amount of costs incurred has been delivered to the client and the client has been notified that the money held for him in the client account will be used to pay such costs (r 7(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iv) of the LP(SA)R). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">83 </span>It follows that the Firm ought to have issued and delivered a proper bill of costs when it sought to utilise the Client’s funds in the client account for costs and disbursements. The 15 January Invoice is not properly a bill of costs; it is merely a friendly reminder by email to pay an agreed sum as a deposit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">84 </span>The Firm had only been just briefed in January 2014 on the enforcement matters. The costs had not yet been incurred (although they clearly would be in the near future). The amount of costs and disbursements was unknown at that stage. The S$50,0000 was paid into the Firm’s client account and ordinarily would have been drawn down subsequently against proper bills/invoices raised by the Firm. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">85 </span>The problem, however, is that after the Client deposited the S$50,000 with the Firm, it never got an account or other notice of the costs or disbursements to which this deposit was put to use until R&amp;T wrote to the Firm more than two years later. The Client may have been aware that a portion of the S$50,000 put into the client account would be used to cover travel to the UK to engage solicitors. But it would not have any inkling of the amount of costs and disbursements that were going to be claimed for this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">86 </span>For example, suppose that in a similar (but hypothetical) case, a solicitor had withdrawn the bulk of the funds represented by a S$50,000 deposit to reimburse himself for first class air travel to and from London such as to exhaust the deposit. If the client is not informed of this expenditure, he would not have been in the position to challenge the expense as being unreasonable and excessive. The fact that the client may have been generally aware that the solicitor was going to visit legal professionals in the UK to consult on the matter does not mean that he has consented to the expenditure in question in the example that I have set out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">87 </span>Returning to the case before me, the Firm then adduced supporting documents to justify its disbursements from the deposit. In the case of travelling expenses to London, I note that Mr Gabriel made three trips over the following periods: (i) 15 January 2014 to 4 February 2014; (ii) 28 September 2014 to 7 October 2014; and (iii) 5 February 2015 to 19 February 2015 (see [75(b)] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">88 </span>Whilst it is clear that Mr Zhu knew that trips to the UK would take place, it appears that he did not receive any specific information on the trips aside from being told of the trip to London in or around September to October 2014.  The email of 24 September 2014, by which the Firm had informed the Client that Mr Gabriel would be travelling to London in or around September to October 2014, is not a bill of costs. It merely informed the Client of the impending trip but did not provide any breakdown of the costs that were or would be incurred on this trip.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">89 </span>As noted previously (at [68] above), payment under s 122 of the LPA concerns the act of the paying party. A client can either (i) make a direct payment of the costs after receiving the bill; or (ii) agree that the solicitor can pay himself out of the funds that the solicitor is holding for him.  Where monies are deducted unilaterally from monies held by a solicitor for a client to meet the costs or disbursements of the solicitor, such a deduction will not ordinarily constitute payment by the client under the LPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">90 </span>Whilst Mr Zhu was aware that the S$50,000 would be used to meet the costs and expenses of registering the 123 Award in Singapore and the UK, the Client was never told or provided with a bill of costs in respect of how the S$50,000 had, in fact, been used. I note also that there is no suggestion (nor indeed any basis for a suggestion) that when the Client provided the S$50,000 deposit, it had agreed with the Firm or had otherwise given a general approval to the Firm to make unilateral deductions from the deposit to meet particular items of expenditure, without any need to raise a bill or obtain the Client’s consent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">91 </span>On the material before me, the only time that a bill of costs (or invoice) was issued in respect of this S$50,000 was on 23 May 2016, when the Firm eventually provided to R&amp;T a breakdown of the costs and disbursements paid out of the initial deposit of S$50,000. It is not clear on the evidence whether this was also the date on which the bill of costs was delivered to the Client. By this time the Client was questioning the invoices through its new law firm. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">92 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Accordingly, I find that there was no payment of any bills of costs here. I note also that the 12-month time bar does not apply because </span>the only bill that was issued in respect of the S$50,000 deposit was the bill dated 23 May 2016, which evidenced the particular uses to which the initial deposit of S$50,000 was put to by the Firm. Based on this date, the 12-month period would not have expired since the present application, OS 931/2016, was brought by the Client on 14 September 2016 (see [12] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">93 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">I accordingly need not consider whether special circumstances arose within the meaning of s 122.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">94 </span>In the event I am wrong, I make clear that in any case, even if the payment of S$50,000 to cover costs and expenses incurred for the 123 Award Enforcement Proceedings carried with it the Client’s implied consent for the Firm to make deductions without first sending an invoice prior to the deduction (with the effect that the Client is deemed to have paid by the deduction), I find that special circumstances exist which support the grant of leave for taxation. On the evidence, the Client was not provided with any information on the details (the amounts and specific purposes) at the time of deduction. Indeed, it is not even clear when the deductions were made. Whilst it may be said that the Client could have objected to any deductions at the earliest by 23 May 2016 when it was provided with an account by the Firm, and hence that it is deemed to have paid by not so objecting, I am of the view that special circumstances exist because the Client was not in possession of the relevant information and details to question the reasonableness of the expenses. The present case is different in this way from <span class="font-italic">Kosui’s</span> case, where the court found at [72] that the client had allowed each bill to be paid without objection out of the client’s deposit in circumstances where it was intimately aware of the work being done and was already in a position to raise a complaint if it thought the sums were unreasonable. In the present case, the earliest time that the Client would reasonably have knowledge of how the S$50,000 was specifically put to use, and thus would be able to dispute the reasonableness of those expenses, would be on 23 May 2016 itself. By then, however, it is clear that sums had already been paid out of the S$50,000 deposit to meet the Firm’s costs and disbursements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">95 </span>The difficulty, however, is that the Client has not applied to tax the email dated 23 May 2016 as a bill of costs. The application is for taxation of the 15 January Invoice, which “invoice” is simply an email request for S$50,000 by way of a deposit for future costs and disbursements. On this basis, the Firm takes the position that the application to tax the 15 January Invoice must fail as there is in reality no bill of costs to tax. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">96 </span>I note that the 15 January 2014 email is similar to another email sent to the Client on 9 December 2014 which requested the transfer of “about S$100,000 to our account towards further costs and disbursements which may be incurred in England.” This was subsequently followed by Invoice 46 dated 5 January 2015 for S$100,000.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Invoice 46 is headed: “Re: ARB No. 123 of 2010 (OS 304 of 2014).” “OS 304 of 2014” refers to Metalloyd’s application to set aside the 123 Award in Singapore.  The invoice simply states that the S$100,000 is “for disbursements.” No specific disbursements are referred to at all. There is no reference made to trips to the UK or consultations with UK solicitors over registration and enforcement of the 123 Award in the UK. It was only on 13 March 2015 that the Firm by email provided information on how S$55,271.82 (out of the S$ 100,000) had been wired 3 days before to the UK solicitors to meet the UK solicitor bills’ 15/305, 15/355 and 15/381. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">97 </span>The short point is that the Firm does not contend that Invoice 46, as a request for a deposit, is not an invoice that is capable of being taxed. Instead it takes the position that there is no reason for taxation since the Client was informed on 13 March 2015 how a portion had been spent to meet the English bills (referred to) leaving a balance of S$44,629.21. The Client did not appear to object to this expenditure at the time when it was informed. I shall examine Invoice 46 in more detail below. The point that might be made is that given the position the Firm has taken on Invoice 46 (it could have been taxed but there are no special grounds for leave) might it not be wholly inconsistent for the Firm to take the position that the January 2014 invoice for S$50,000 is not taxable as it was just a request for a deposit? Whilst there is something to be said for this, the conclusion I have come to is that the email of 15 January 2014, being a request for a deposit, is not a bill of costs capable of taxation as such.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Invoice 15</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">98 </span>On 1 April 2014, Metalloyd took out Originating Summons 304 of 2014 (“OS 304/2014”) in the Singapore Courts to set aside the 123 Award.

What may be a sufficient bill on the facts of one case may not be a sufficient bill on the facts of another. At the end of the day, the question is whether the client, armed with the knowledge that he has, would know enough by looking at the narrative in the bill, so that he can arrive at an informed view of whether to apply for taxation if he disputes the reasonability of the charges in the bill (see [37] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">109 </span>In this context, I note that r 17(5) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (Cap 161, R 1, 2010 Rev Ed) (“the LP(PC)R”) states that if a client disputes or raises a query about a bill of the legal practitioner in a matter, the legal practitioner must inform the client in writing of the client’s right to apply to the court to have the bill taxed or to review any fee agreement, unless the legal practitioner believes that the client knows or reasonably ought to know of that right. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">110 </span>In the present case, I accept that Mr Zhu and the Client were not aware and were not informed of the right of taxation.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>That said, I also accept that Mr Zhu did not indicate any concern over the bill such that r 17(5) was operative. In any case, even if I am wrong, a breach of the LP(PC)R does not on its own address the rationale of the special circumstances requirement for leave under s 122 of the LPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">111 </span>To begin with, in light of Ms Marie’s and Mr Gabriel’s emails explaining to Mr Zhu the charges under Invoice 15 for OS 304/2014, as well as his own involvement in affirming the affidavits in that application, I find that Mr Zhu must have had sufficient knowledge of the scope of work done by the Firm. And although Mr Zhu now says that he did not raise any issues with the Firm over its charges because he trusted that it would charge fairly, this is not sufficient for me to find that there are special circumstances under s 122 of the LPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">112 </span> Nowhere is there any evidence of Mr Zhu taking the slightest issue with the Firm’s costs. And this is in spite of Ms Marie making it known in her email to Mr Zhu that he could contact her or Mr Gabriel for further clarifications on the charges in Invoice 15 (see [102] above). The clarification that Mr Zhu sought in his 9 June 2014 email in no way expressed an issue with the reasonability of the Firm’s charges: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">dear Erin,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">could you please give me more details of the invoice (<span class="font-italic">under which cases?</span>),<span class="font-italic">so i can explain to my financial department to arrange the payment</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">To my mind, the italicised words show that Mr Zhu was not thinking so much about the reasonableness of the charges, as much as he was concerned with the administrative task of arranging for payment from the Client’s financial department, which apparently required him to know about the case for which Invoice 15 was issued.         </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">113 </span>In the circumstances, I find that Invoice 15 is a proper bill that the Client is liable to pay and which has been paid.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">121 </span>But the Firm does not stop there. It goes on to say that because Mr Zhu knew that Invoice 39 was wrongly-titled, the Client was thus acting in bad faith and was in fact dishonest when it went on to say that the Firm may have charged for non-existent items in relation to OS 304/2014.  I find the Firm’s position on this rather startling. Even if I were to assume for a moment that the Firm is correct insofar as Invoice 39 was indeed wrongly-titled, I did not think it supports the assertion that the Client was dishonest or acting in bad faith. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">122 </span>The question inevitably comes to mind: in respect of which matter, SIAC 200 or the 123 Award Enforcement Proceedings, is Invoice 39 (for the sum of S$107,809.47 and paid on 24 November 2014) charged, paid and attributed towards the Client, in the accounts between the parties? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">123 </span> If the sum is indeed accounted for as a sum paid for the 123 Award Enforcement Proceedings, it appears to follow that a similar amount remains due and owing in the accounts for SIAC 200. On the other hand, if the sum was properly attributed and accounted for by the Firm to SIAC 200 and was not charged to the accounts for the 123 Award Enforcement Proceedings, the titling error appears to be nothing more than that: an error that has no real consequence on the state of affairs between the parties aside from the confusion that has been caused. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">124 </span>Without knowing which set of proceedings (and what work) Invoice 39 was intended for, the Client would not be in a position to assess the reasonableness or otherwise of the fees sought. To say that Invoice 39 was wrongly-titled and to resist an application for its taxation by alleging that the Client was dishonest and acting in bad faith ignores the fact that it was the Firm which made the “error” in the first place.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">125 </span>I have noted already that the Firm was handling a number of separate matters for the Client at or about the same time in respect of which fee invoices were being sent (see [8] above). It is odd for the Firm that was conducting the work to assert that it should have been clear to the Client that Invoice 39 was for SIAC 200, when the Firm itself was responsible for drawing up and delivering Invoice 39 for the 123 Award Enforcement Proceedings. I am of the view that the Firm cannot excuse its very late attempt to clarify the position on the basis that the Client did not raise any issues regarding Invoice 39 in its correspondence with the Firm.

</div> The Firm only clarified on 27 September 2016 that there was a titling error for Invoice 39 (see [120] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">127 </span>This leaves the question of whether there are special circumstances justifying an order for the taxation of Invoice 39. Plainly, there are. Although the limitation period of 12 months has set in and Invoice 39 has been paid, the Client had gone out of pocket for non-existent work at least insofar as the 123 Award Enforcement Proceedings are concerned. The Firm was responsible for the confusion over the matter to which Invoice 39 related. Even if the Client might have queried Invoice 39 much earlier, the fact remains that any confusion was caused by the Firm itself. If, on taxation, it is established that Invoice 39 was in fact intended for work done in respect SIAC 200, the appropriate order and directions will have to be sought from the taxing registrar.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">128 </span>Finally, I note that in<span class="font-italic"> re G B B Norman </span>(1886) 16 QBD 673, special circumstances justifying taxation were found because the bill of costs included a charge for shorthand notes of the proceedings at a reference where no professional shorthand writer had been employed. Instead, the clerk to the solicitor had taken the notes, and it did not appear that the solicitor had given his clerk any part of the amount charged. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">129 </span>Whilst <span class="font-italic">re G B B Norman</span> is not on all fours with the present case, it supports the conclusion that a solicitor ought not to be entitled to security of receipt for fees charged in relation to non-existent work. In particular, I note Lord Esher’s comment at pp 675–676 that even if the bill of costs had been paid, there is no hard and fast rule as to what constitutes special circumstances. There,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the fact that the total amount of charges was large and a “gross blunder” had been committed (in respect of the shorthand fees) constituted special circumstances for the bill to be sent for taxation. In the case at hand, I am of the view that it is not a sufficient response to say that the work charged was performed but in respect of a completely different matter being handled by the Firm for the Client. I accordingly order that Invoice 39 be sent for taxation. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Invoice 46</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">130 </span>Invoice 46 for the payment of S$100,000.00 was dated 5 January 2015 (see [2(d)] above), but it can be traced back to an email dated 9 December 2014 sent by Mr Gabriel to Mr Zhu.

</div>
</div> I note that these are the very same bills that the Firm, <span class="font-italic">one year later</span>, in response to R&amp;T’s queries, provide together with a fourth English bill (15/243) to explain the usage of the sum of S$50,000 (see [75(a)] above), which was the deposit made in January 2014. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">135 </span>The English solicitors 4 bills total approximately £29,699.75. At current exchange rates this is about S$53,000. At the exchange rates prevailing around 1 January 2015 this is roughly equivalent to S$60,000–S$62,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">136 </span>The fact that the same English solicitors’ bills were referred to in the explanations for how the sums deposited by the Client in January 2014 (S$50,000) and January 2015 (S$100,000) were used does not necessarily mean there has been any double payment for the same disbursements. Nevertheless, it is not surprising that the Client now takes the position that it was not in the position to object to the use of the S$55,271.82 that was said to have been paid out of the S$100,000 deposit. After all, when it received the breakdown in respect of Invoice 46 on 13 March 2015, the Client had no idea that three of the same English bills would also be referenced as explanations for the use of the first S$50,000 deposit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">137 </span>The S$100,000 paid for Invoice 46 is similar to the S$50,000 paid under the 15 January Invoice. The Client accepts that the S$100,000, paid on 13 February 2015, was meant as a deposit to be applied towards disbursements to be incurred. The chief complaint is that it ought to have been informed of any deductions <span class="font-italic">before</span> those deductions were made.

</div>
</div> If they had been informed, they would have been able to take a view as to whether they had any issues with the deduction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">138 </span>The difficulty however is that as discussed earlier in connection with the 15 January invoice, the email of 9 December 2014 is not on its face a bill of costs that is capable of being taxed as such. It is a request for a deposit. That said, Invoice 46, which is dated 5 January 2015 and which is connected to the email of 9 December 2014 has <span class="font-italic">not</span> been challenged by the Firm as an invoice that is not capable of being taxed. Indeed, the Firm says that the Client was informed of the disbursements towards which the deposit was applied. But I have already noted that the Client was only informed of the disbursements <span class="font-italic">after</span> they had been paid out by the Firm’s unilateral deduction. The Client had no opportunity to agree to or dispute the sums quoted by the Firm. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">139 </span>On this basis, it appears that the only bill of costs delivered during this period then, would be the breakdown the Firm provided in its email of 13 March 2015. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">140 </span>The problem, however, is that there is <span class="font-italic">no</span> application to tax the 13 March 2015 bill. Whilst the matter of granting leave to tax 13 March 2015 invoice is not before me, it may be convenient if I set out some passing observations that may assist in the event the matter is taken further and Invoice 46 is found to be capable of being taxed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">141 </span>First, since this breakdown (13 March 2015) was provided to the Client only <span class="font-italic">after</span> the relevant disbursements had been paid out of the S$100,000 deposit, and there is no evidence showing that the Client knew of those disbursements to begin with, it <span class="font-italic">appears</span> that the Client had not agreed to the payment of those disbursements at the time of the deduction. As a client’s consent is necessary for the payment of a bill of costs, the point <span class="font-italic">appears </span>to arise that the bill of costs here, as evidenced in the Firm’s email of 13 March 2015, was accordingly not paid. On this basis, the only disqualifying event under s 122 that is in play is the 12-month limitation period.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">142 </span>Second, in regard of the 12-month limitation, the question to consider is whether, having seen the breakdown of disbursements provided in the Firm’s email of 13 March 2015, in circumstances where there is no evidence showing any disagreement from the Client with how the deposit was then put to use, the Client was justified in allowing more than 12 months to elapse. Looking at the facts and circumstances as a whole, it appears that even if one or more disqualifying events were applicable, special circumstances might be established to refer 13 March 2015 bill for taxation. The Client did not know that the first deposit of S$50,000 had also been used (at least in part) to meet the English solicitors’ bills. To be clear, I emphasise that the repeat quotation of the English solicitors’ bills does not mean that there was a case of deliberate double charging. The point is that there appears to be a good case for saying that the Client was not in the position whereby it could take an informed view on the reasonableness or otherwise of 13 March 2015 Bill and how the S$100,000 had been utilised. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">143 </span>On this I note in passing that in <span class="font-italic">Kosui</span>, the client also raised an argument that special circumstances existed with respect to two bills, on account of the fact the invoices contained exactly the same description of the work done and period covered by the bill. The court found at [99] that the point raised was a “technicality” and devoid of merit because the client had never previously made an assertion that this amounted to overcharging by double or overlapping billing. The allegation was an afterthought, especially given that the client accepted that the fees charged as a whole were reasonable. The concession that the fees charged were reasonable as a whole precluded any inference of overcharging. In the present case, the position is different. There is no concession by the Client that the total fees charged and “paid” for the 123 Award Enforcement Proceedings are reasonable. Further, the Client was not in the position to even note the possible overlap between the 15 January Invoice and Invoice 46 until 26 July 2016. That said, I stress the above comments are simply by way of passing observation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">144 </span>I further note that the Firm had also confirmed in a follow-up email on 13 March 2015 that a sum of S$44,629.21 remained in its office account.

</div> The Firm’s explanation for this discrepancy is that the Statement of Costs was prepared for the limited purpose of seeking costs in the English proceedings. The English solicitors were of the view that the Firm’s costs, as costs for Singapore solicitors, would not be claimable in the English proceedings. A decision was hence taken to try for a smaller sum as reflected in the Statement of Costs.

</div> Its chief issue with Invoice 54 is that the time costs of S$149,000 reflected therein considerably exceeded those reflected in the Statement of Costs submitted to the English High Court in Folio 1276 for assessment. This, the Client says, shows that Invoice 54 was inflated and that it had thus been overcharged.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">154 </span>Yet, a mere allegation of overcharging without more cannot amount to special circumstances. In this regard, it is worth quoting, in full, the remarks of Chong J in <span class="font-italic">Sports Connection</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([38] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [37]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In my view, an allegation of overcharging by reference to the quantum of the total fees is generally not sufficient to amount to special circumstances <span class="font-italic">per se</span>. Typically a client seeks an order for taxation of the solicitor’s fees because he is dissatisfied with the quantum charged, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, he believes he has been overcharged. The law allows such a client the right to tax any bill raised within 12 months from the delivery of the bill provided it has not been paid. Outside the 12-month window or after payment, the law requires the client to demonstrate special circumstances. It seems to me that to treat a general allegation as opposed to a specific allegation of overcharging as special circumstances would almost invariably lead to an order for taxation even if it is applied for outside the 12-month period or after payment. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Such an approach would have the effect of rendering the restriction to tax such bills outside the 12-month window or after payment otiose. Clearly the objective behind s 122 of the LPA is to cut down the client’s entitlement to tax the bill as of right</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">155 </span>Indeed, what Chong J had to say is entirely consistent with what I have repeatedly emphasised above. A client is entitled to tax his solicitor’s bill of costs if he feels that he has been overcharged. But his right to do so is circumscribed by statute. Clearly, the legislature saw good reason to circumscribe what a client is otherwise entitled to do as of right. If the client is concerned that he had been overcharged, he should not then have paid the bill without requesting for it to be taxed or without indicating, in any other way, that he had an issue with the reasonability of his solicitor’s charges in the first place. He should also not wait until the claim becomes stale before deciding that he wants to take it up with his solicitor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">156 </span>Here, although the Client says it did not question the differences between the charges as reflected in Invoice 54 and the Statement of Costs because it could not appreciate the significance of the latter, I find that this is does not amount to a special circumstance which would outweigh the legislature’s concern to prevent stale claims from being brought. To be clear, even if it was a breach of applicable rules for the Client to seek to claim, in the English proceedings, Mr Gabriel’s costs of attendance and meetings with UK solicitors in London (as to which I am not making any finding), this does not affect the question of taxation that is before me.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">157 </span>The Client also raised the point that the sum of S$44,629.21 remaining in the Firm’s office account after payment of Invoice 46 was applied, without the Client’s knowledge and consent, to partially satisfy invoice 54 (see [151] above). Again, the Client does not explain, and I cannot see, how this can amount to special circumstances under s 122.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Invoice 86</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">158 </span>Invoice 86 was dated 28 September 2015 and was thus meant to cover work done by the Firm between 20 March 2015 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the day subsequent to the date of the last invoice) and 28 September 2015.

</div> There was, however, no evidence on this from the secretary. The Firm also takes the position that an agreement was reached at the meeting of 25 September 2015 concerning the payment of the final bill of S$300,000.00. Moreover, Mr Gabriel also asserts that he did not suggest the figure of S$300,000.00. Instead, he says that this was a figure that Mr Zhu himself proposed and that there was, in fact, much more than S$300,000 that was due to the Firm in respect of the 123 Award Enforcement Proceedings. By this, what is meant is that the Firm was prepared to accept a final global payment of S$300,000 on account of its past relationship with the Client, in full satisfaction of the outstanding costs and disbursements for the 123 Award Enforcement Proceedings. Crucially, however, no contemporaneous evidence or documents were adduced to support the Firm’s position on any of its assertions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">162 </span>Evidently, Invoice 86 was the most significant invoice not just in terms of quantum, but also because of the substantial disputes of fact between the parties over the circumstances surrounding its issue and payment.

Mr Zhu was undoubtedly pleased that SIAC 123 was finally concluded. He was now based in Shanghai, China.

Invoice 86 was rather large (as compared to the earlier invoices). Whilst Mr Zhu was the head trader responsible for the trade leading to SIAC 123, it does not appear that the Firm had ever sought clarification as to whether Mr Zhu had authority to commit the Client to a global sum of S$300,000 on the final invoice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">169 </span>As noted already (at [132] above), it is apparent that in the past, the Firm had on several occasions asked for and was provided with deposits totalling some S$150,000, against which it had made deductions for various disbursements and costs without obtaining the Client’s prior approval on the specific amounts to be deducted. In the case of Invoice 86, I note that the S$300,000 charged was once again satisfied by the Firm’s unilateral deduction – this time, from the monies the Firm had received from Metalloyd and which were due to the Client under the 123 Award. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">170 </span>Looking at the evidence as a whole, including the oral testimony, I find that Mr Zhu did not, on 25 September 2015, come to any agreement on behalf of his employer (the Client) for a final payment of S$300,000 to the Firm. To be sure, it appears that Mr Zhu was aware that a final invoice would be sent and that some figures may have been mentioned. Nevertheless, I am of the view that Mr Zhu did not make any agreement on behalf of the Client committing the Client to pay a final fee of S$300,000 (bearing in mind that there was no discussion at all of what work or disbursements remained outstanding at that date), and that this sum could be deducted from the arbitration award that had been obtained.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">171 </span>To be clear, it may well be that the question of a final invoice or bill was raised in the course of the meeting at the Firm’s office on 25 September 2015. Nevertheless, it is evident that any discussions would have been brief and lacking in detail (to say the least). Leaving aside any issue of Mr Zhu’s authority to enter into a fee agreement on behalf of the Client, I find that the failure of Mr Zhu to respond to the emails (in which he was copied) is at most “acquiescence” based on the past practice of the Firm making unilateral deductions from deposits or monies held by on behalf of the Client. It does not mean that he was agreeing that the S$300,000 was a reasonable sum. After all, he had no basis or detailed information by reference to which he could make an informed decision on what would be a reasonable final sum to close the accounts between the Client and the Firm for the 123 Award Enforcement Proceedings. It is also apparent from these series of emails that the Client’s accounting department was merely querying the basis of the deduction by the Firm (as opposed to its quantum), and that Mr Gabriel had not raised or discussed the matter directly with Mr Wang or the Client’s Chairman. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">172 </span>In coming to my decision, I note that in the case of <span class="font-italic">re G B B Norman</span> ([128] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), Lord Esher’s view at p 676 (by way of <span class="font-italic">dicta</span>) was that even if a bill of costs had been paid, acquiescence does not necessarily deprive the client of taxation. The <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> does not, at first sight, sit easily with the Singapore case law referred to which identifies the policy concern behind the disqualifying event of payment as being one of preventing approbation and reprobation on the client’s part. Nevertheless, the key point is that such a disqualifying event is not absolute, especially in a case where the client simply acquiesces in his solicitor’s decision to withhold sums to satisfy its fees. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">173 </span>Further, even if the Client can be said to have “paid” the S$300,000 within the meaning of s 122 of the LPA, I find that there are special circumstances justifying the grant of leave to tax Invoice 86. With respect to the Firm, the circumstances under which the S$300,000 was deducted from the 123 Award on the back of an alleged oral agreement or understanding obtained from Mr Zhu leaves much to be desired. No final account was prepared for Mr Zhu. Mr Gabriel was also not aware of what costs and disbursements remained outstanding in respect of the work done in the 123 Award Enforcement Proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">174 </span>It is worth repeating that the Disputed Invoices were not billed in respect of the SIAC 123 arbitration proceedings that led up to the 123 Award. What is in issue is simply the bills raised in respect of the 123 Award Enforcement Proceedings. The legal costs and disbursements awarded to the Client in SIAC 123 (a 4-year arbitration) was S$355,000.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">175 </span>By 25 September 2015 when the alleged oral agreement for the S$300,000 was made, the Firm had already raised five invoices totalling S$419,457.67. Under cross-examination, this was accepted by Mr Gabriel although the point was made that he was not sure at that time how much had been paid.

</div> Even if Invoice 39 is taken out of the equation, S$311,648.20 had already been invoiced by the Firm for work done in enforcement proceedings alone. To be sure, a portion of the sums previously raised were to meet the bills of the English solicitors. The four English solicitors’ bills raised a total sum of £29,699.75. At the prevailing exchange rate in May 2016, that sum would roughly equate to a total of about S$60,000. Even affording the Firm the benefit of the doubt and taking the sum billed under Invoice 39 out of the equation, a total of S$251,548.20 was paid to the Firm for enforcement proceedings alone, which occurred over a span of slightly under two years. As stated above, the legal costs and disbursements awarded to the Client in a full-blown 4-year arbitration was S$355,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">176 </span>It appears that Mr Gabriel’s position is that Invoice 86, as the final invoice, was intended to cover not just new work done in the period between Invoice 54 and Invoice 86, but also items dating back to earlier periods of the 123 Award Enforcement Proceedings and which had not yet been billed for.

</div> Yet, at the time of the alleged oral agreement, Mr Gabriel had not prepared or shown to Mr Zhu anything like a final account for the 123 Award Enforcement Proceedings. All that Mr Gabriel claims to have done was to step out of his office to confer with his secretary (or personal assistant) on the costs and disbursements due. Even so, his evidence is that the sum of S$300,000 was on the low side and that he could have charged much higher but did not because of the past relationship between the Firm and the Client.
