</div> This was telling: it indicated that if the plaintiff were to lose the Arbitration, it intended nevertheless to try to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat by pressing on with the Suit. Indeed, the plaintiff might be hoping that it might <span class="font-italic">first</span> win the Suit, and then use that to influence the outcome of the Arbitration. It had, however, agreed with the Employer that the disputes which were in issue in the Suit, would be resolved in the Arbitration between them, and that Arbitration was underway ([26] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([20] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the Court of Appeal emphasised that the plaintiff’s right to sue whoever he wants and where he wants, albeit a fundamental right, is not absolute (<span class="font-italic">Tomolugen </span>at [187]; <span class="font-italic">Rex</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([20] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [9]). In appropriate cases, that right may be curtailed where it is necessary to prevent a plaintiff from circumventing the operation of an arbitration clause, holding him to his obligation to arbitrate where he has agreed to do so (<span class="font-italic">Tomolugen </span>at [188]). The basis for granting a stay of court proceedings the outcome of which depends on the resolution of a related arbitration stems not from the mere <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">existence</span><span class="font-italic"> of common issues</span>, but from the fact that proper ventilation of the issues in the court proceedings is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">dependent </span>on the resolution of the related arbitration (<span class="font-italic">Rex</span> at [11]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In this case, the plaintiff had agreed with the Employer to arbitrate disputes that included the common issues of the Calls, defects and rectification, and a stay of the Suit would hold the plaintiff to this agreement. This stay would be lifted upon the Arbitration being determined, and if the plaintiff succeeded in its claim in the Arbitration that the Employer’s Calls were wrongful, the plaintiff could then proceed against the defendants in the Suit. As a practical matter, though, if the plaintiff received from the Employer what was awarded in relation to this claim, the plaintiff would not stand to recover any more by pressing on with the Suit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The outcome of the Arbitration would either have the effect of resolving the Suit because it was dispositive of the common issues, or at least pave the way for the Suit to be resolved as between the parties. I have discussed the consequences of the plaintiff losing in the Arbitration, at [41]–[42] above. Conversely, if the plaintiff were to win in the Arbitration, it might not be open to the defendants (despite them not being parties to the Arbitration Agreement) to challenge any adverse finding from the Arbitration on the common issues – that may amount to an abuse of process, for it would be contrary to the stance of seeking a stay of the Suit pending the Arbitration (see <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([20] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [142] and [189(b)(iii)]). This was particularly so for the 1st defendant (the applicant for the stay). The 1st defendant implicitly accepted this, and at the hearing of Summons 4854 she readily agreed to be bound by the Arbitration (see [43] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The common issues in the present case fell within the scope of the plaintiff and the Employer’s Arbitration Agreement, and their resolution in the Arbitration would be crucial to the eventual outcome of the Suit. A similar situation was also present in <span class="font-italic">Tomol</span><span class="font-italic">ugen</span>. Proceedings for relief under s 216 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) had been commenced by the plaintiff against multiple defendants for alleged oppressive conduct against it as the minority shareholder of a company, of which the 2nd defendant was a shareholder. The plaintiff had acquired shares in that company from the 2nd defendant by way of a share sale agreement, which contained an arbitration clause. The plaintiff advanced four distinct allegations, only one of which was within the scope of the arbitration clause – the “MP allegation” (see <span class="font-italic">Tomolugen </span>at [16]). Notwithstanding that, the Court held that the court proceedings in relation to the <span class="font-italic">three remaining allegations not falling within the scope of the arbitration clause were also to be stayed</span> pursuant to its inherent powers of case management if the plaintiff were to pursue the MP allegation against the 2nd defendant by arbitration (<span class="font-italic">Tomol</span><span class="font-italic">ugen </span>at [190(c)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In <span class="font-italic">Tomol</span><span class="font-italic">ugen</span>, the MP allegation would have been as dispositive of a finding of minority oppression as the three remaining allegations would, and it made no practical sense for the former to be proceeded with in arbitration <span class="font-italic">concurrently</span> with the latter three in court. Similarly, in this case, the common issues of the Calls, defects and rectification costs, are dispositive of the plaintiff’s claims against the defendants in the Suit. It would not make practical sense for the same issues to <span class="font-italic">concurrently</span> be fought over – in arbitration, and in court. Instead, these common issues ought first to be resolved in the Arbitration (which has been underway for more than three years now), in accordance with the Arbitration Agreement between the plaintiff and the Employer. I was thus satisfied that “the proper ventilation of the issues in the court proceedings <span class="font-italic">depended</span> on the resolution of the related … arbitration” (<span class="font-italic">Rex</span> ([20] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [11] [emphasis in original]) – that was what would ensure the efficient and fair resolution of the dispute as a whole.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The plaintiff contended that any overlap between the Arbitration and the Suit could be accommodated by bifurcating the suit into liability and quantum phases, and only staying the quantum phase.

The plaintiff cannot obtain interlocutory judgment for damages to be assessed by only focusing on the conduct and state of mind of the defendants, without resolving the issues of whether the Calls were wrongful, whether the SOD was false, and whether the estimated rectification costs were fabricated or inflated, and ultimately, whether the defendants have caused the plaintiff damage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 A stay of court proceedings pending the outcome of arbitration was also granted in <span class="font-italic">CKR Contract Services Pte Ltd v Asplenium Land Pte Ltd</span> [2020] 5 SLR 665 (“<span class="font-italic">CKR</span><span class="font-italic"> v Asplenium</span>”).

This administrative sealing was expressed to be pending resolution of Summons 4853. Accordingly, outsiders to the Arbitration could not, by inspecting the court file, obtain confidential information about the Arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 On 1 December 2020, the plaintiff filed its affidavit, in which the deponent stated that the 1st defendant had disclosed some documents purportedly in relation to the Arbitration.

</div> Presumably, the plaintiff was hoping that if the 1st defendant were bereft of evidence, a stay might not be granted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 As I mentioned above at [55], the Registrar dealt with the plaintiff’s objection as an oral application to expunge the 1st defendant’s affidavits; that oral application was dismissed, and the plaintiff did not appeal against that decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The 1st defendant’s sealing application by Summons 4853 remains pending. The other defendants are amenable to it, but the plaintiff is objecting. Why would the plaintiff object to the sealing application if it were truly concerned about confidentiality? Perhaps the plaintiff objected to sealing so that it could complain that the 1st defendant’s disclosures might be seen by third parties. That would, however, be self-serving, and quite inconsistent with protecting confidentiality of the Arbitration. For the present, the file remains sealed. The plaintiff has asked that the sealing application only be dealt with after the resolution of the present appeal, and the 1st defendant has agreed to this. There is thus no present danger of arbitration confidentiality being breached in relation to outsiders to the Arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I upheld the case management stay which the Registrar had granted: this would ensure the efficient and fair resolution of the dispute as a whole. The issues in the Suit of whether the Employer’s Calls were wrongful, whether the SOD was false, and whether the estimated rectification costs were fabricated or inflated, were all issues in the Arbitration (or at least within the scope of the Arbitration Agreement). The Arbitration has been underway for more than three years now, and the plaintiff and the Employer ought properly to finish the Arbitration, before the plaintiff proceeds any further with the Suit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 On a related note, it was reasonably necessary, and in the interests of justice, for the court to have been informed of the overlapping Arbitration.
