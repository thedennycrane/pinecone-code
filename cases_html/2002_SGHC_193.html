<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">       

The appellant faced three identical charges under s 157(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50)

("CA"), namely, as Managing Director of Thai Shin Pawnshop Pte Ltd ("Thai

Shin"), Thai Hong Pawnshop Pte Ltd ("Thai Hong") and Wang Wang Pawnshop Pte

Ltd ("Wang Wang"), he failed to use reasonable diligence in the discharge of the

duties of his office by permitting various jewellery items pawned to the three companies

as pledges for loans from the companies to be released to one Kalimahton binte Md Samuri

("Samuri") without proper redemption and resulting in losses to the companies.

The three charges were for the same offence committed at different premises, namely, at

each of the three companies. The appellant was fined $4,000 on each of the charges in the

district court under s 157(3)(b) CA. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2

        The relevant sub-sections of s 157 CA read as

follows:</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3

        The appellant appealed against his conviction

and sentence. I heard his appeals on 9 July 2002 and dismissed them. I now give my

reasons. </font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The facts</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4

        The appellant is Lim Weng Kee, aged 62. At the

date of the alleged incidents, on or around 28 October 1998, he had had 20 years of

experience in running the business. He had been the managing director of Thai Shin and

Thai Hong since 1978, and the <i>de facto</i> managing director of Wang Wang (which he

founded) since 1996. The appellant admitted that he was the person-in-charge of the

businesses of the three pawnshops at the time of the alleged incidents. The three pawn

licenses were also issued in his name. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5

        Chong Yok Yin ("Chong"), the

appellant’s sister-in-law, was a director of Thai Hong and Thai Shin. One of her

sons, Lim Feok Loong ("Feok") started as an employee of the three pawnshops and

was later appointed a director of Thai Shin and Thai Hong. Her other son, Lim Yeow Loong

("Yeow"), was a shareholder of all three pawnshops and had been working at Thai

Shin for about two to three years before the alleged incidents. Sim Siew Ngoh

("Sim") and Ang Geok Eng ("Ang") were both employees at Thai Shin.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6

        The appellant first came to know Samuri on 12

December 1997. In the appellant’s words, Samuri struck him as "well dressed,

wasn’t ordinary, common people; of high society type". Samuri in turn

perpetuated the impression by arriving at the pawnshops in a chauffeur-driven Mercedes and

claiming to be married to the brother of the Sultan of Brunei. Her ‘residence’

at Punggol was two adjacent bungalows, 3-storeys high, bearing a single address. Between

1997 and 1998, she pawned $4m worth of jewellery items at the 3 pawnshops. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7

        Samuri tried to buy the heart of the appellant

by showering him with gifts, including a gold coin, ‘blessed’ Bruneian notes and

a watch. That happened in May or June 1998. Samuri also developed a close relationship

with Chong, addressing her as ‘Mama’. All these were in fact a pretence. She was

not a royal but an owner of a restaurant. The Punggol ‘residence’ did not belong

to her and the jewellery items were conned from a diamond merchant. The appellant

unfortunately failed to see through the facade.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8

        On 12 October 1998, the appellant directed Feok

to telephone Samuri regarding the outstanding interest due to the pawnshops. Feok did so

and Samuri requested that they make a visit to her ‘residence’. At her

‘residence’, Samuri informed them of her intention to redeem her jewellery items

and asked the appellant to give an estimate. The appellant gave an estimate of between $4m

to $5m. Samuri then instructed Feok to write out a $6m cheque in favour of Wang Wang

pawnshop, with the balance to be refunded to her later. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9

        Immediately afterwards, Samuri instructed Feok

to write out four more cheques of $1m each<b> </b>as gifts to the appellant, Feok, Yeow

and Chong. To prevent the appellant from discovering her ploy, Samuri told the appellant

that she would be attending prayers for a deceased relative for the next 21 days and the

cheques must not be deposited during that period of time. Meanwhile, the appellant kept

all the five cheques.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10

        On the morning of 28 October 1998, the

appellant and Feok were at Thai Hong. They proceeded to Thai Shin upon receiving a call

from Yeow that Samuri was there. Upon arriving at Thai Shin, the appellant immediately

asked Samuri when he could deposit the five 12 October cheques. Samuri told him to wait

and instead instructed Feok to write out a $15m cash cheque which was meant for Chong to

safe-keep for her, a $200,000 cheque in favour of Chong, a $50,000 cash cheque intended as

a gift to the employees of the three companies; and a cash cheque of $3m intended as an

anonymous gift to charity. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11

        After about 15 to 20 minutes, Samuri told the

appellant that she wanted the jewellery items back. The appellant responded that he could

not release the items as the cheques had not been cleared. The appellant claimed that he

told Chong the same thing in the Khek dialect but Chong assured him that Samuri would pay

up and that the appellant should allow Samuri to take the items. Both Feok and Yeow were

present but did not utter a word.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12

        Before the court below, the appellant claimed

that he did not permit the release of the items. He only relented because he could not

oppose Chong and Feok as he had a heart problem. He claimed that he had done his best but

could not do more to prevent the release of the items as both Feok and Chong were also

directors. Even if he had tried to stop Chong and Feok, they would not have listened to

him. The prosecution’s submission was that the appellant did permit the release of

the items. The district judge ruled in favour of the prosecution on this point. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13

        Samuri chose some items at Thai Shin. Feok then

drove Samuri and the appellant to Thai Hong and Wang Wang where the same process of

choosing the items was repeated. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14

        On 5 November 1998, the $6m cheque issued on 12

October 1998 was dishonoured. Samuri was also nowhere to be found. The appellant then made

a police report. Samuri was later arrested and sentenced to serve six and a half

years’ imprisonment in Changi Women’s Prison. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15

        The losses to the pawnshops were very

substantial. The appellant admitted that until the day of the trial, he did not know the

actual value of the items taken away as he did not keep proper track of the exact list of

jewellery taken away by Samuri. It was estimated by the appellant to amount to $4.136m,

based on the total value of the pawn tickets. The shareholders of the three pawnshops

suffered immense losses. At the date of the trial, Wang Wang was in the process of being

sold, while Thai Shin and Thai Hong had to be injected with fresh capital to survive. In a

separate civil suit, the appellant, Chong, Yeow and Feok were ordered to pay $300,000 in

compensation each to Thai Shin and Thai Hong. </font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Decision below</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16

        The district judge made several findings of

fact. Firstly, the appellant was in control of the companies at the relevant time.

Secondly, the appellant permitted the release of the jewellery items to Samuri. The judge

rejected the appellant’s claim that he had done his best to object to the release of

those items on three main grounds. Firstly, evidence given by Samuri, Ang and Sim showed

that the appellant had released the items willingly. Evidence given by Chong, Feok and

Yeow in favour of the prosecution was excluded for fear of unfair prejudice against the

appellant as they were also the recipients of Samuri’s gifts. Secondly, the appellant

did not mention this claim to the investigating officer and only brought it up in court as

an afterthought. Thirdly, if the appellant had objected strongly to the release of the

items, he would not have followed Feok and Samuri to the second and third pawnshops. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17

        The judge also held that the standard of

‘reasonable diligence’ under s157(1) CA is objective: the issue therefore was

whether the appellant exercised such degree of care and skill as would amount to the

reasonable care which an ordinary person might be expected to take in the circumstances on

his own behalf. This objective test applies to both civil breaches of the duty to use

reasonable diligence under s 157(3)(a); as well as criminal breaches of that duty under s

157(3)b. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18

        The judge ruled that, on the totality of the

evidence, the prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had

objectively failed to use reasonable diligence in the discharge of his duties as a

director of the three pawnshops. The items were extremely valuable and no person of

ordinary prudence would have permitted the release of the items without first having the

cheques cleared and honoured. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19

        The appellant was convicted and fined $4,000 on

each of the charges. In awarding the sentence, the judge bore in mind sentencing

precedents and the suffering the appellant had gone through in the form of loss of

employment and control of the pawnshops, as well as the substantial compensation he had to

pay in settlement of the civil suits.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Issues Arising on Appeal</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20

        Four issues arose for the court’s

consideration. Firstly, what the test of ‘reasonable diligence’ to be applied

for a criminal offence under s 157(3)(b) CA is. Secondly, what the standard of proof under

s 157(3)(b) CA is. Thirdly, whether the appellant had used reasonable diligence on the

facts of the case. Lastly, whether the fines imposed by the judge were manifestly

excessive. </font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">First ground of appeal: the test of

‘reasonable diligence’ under s 157 CA</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21

        The appellant did not deny that an objective

test of ‘reasonable diligence’ applies for <i>civil</i> breaches of

directors’ duties under s 157(3)(a) but contended that a subjective test should apply

for <i>criminal</i> breaches under s 157(3)(b). I did not think that the appellant was

right. First of all, however it will be useful to survey the case law with respect to

civil breaches. This is for two reasons. Firstly, most cases to date have focused on civil

breaches and, hence, they provide a useful starting point in formulating the test for

criminal breaches. Secondly, s 157(1) on its plain terms does not appear to set different

tests for civil and criminal breaches of directors’ duties. Hence, the test applied

in one will obviously be relevant to the other.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(i) The test to be applied for civil

breaches of directors’ duties under s 157(3)(a) CA</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22

        Section 157(1) CA "mirrors a

director’s general fiduciary duty at common law": <i>Cheam Tat Pang &amp; Anor v

PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=9956&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1996] 1 SLR 541</a> at 548. Hence, the common law is very persuasive in interpreting

s157(1). According to <i>Re City Equitable Fire Insurance Co Ltd</i> [1925] Ch 407 at 428,

the standard is measured "by the care an ordinary man might be expected to take in

the circumstances on his own behalf". With due respect, this is a vague proposition

which does not elaborate on the factors that go towards influencing this

‘ordinary’ man standard. In particular, should the courts take into account the

subjective level of knowledge and experience of the particular defendant in deciding what

an ‘ordinary’ director would do in the circumstances? The traditional approach

answers the question in the affirmative. As stated by Lord Lindley M.R. in <i>Lagunas

Nitrate Company v Lagunas Syndicate</i> [1899] 2 Ch 392 at 435:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">If directors act within their powers, if

  they act with such care as is reasonably to be expected from them<i><b>, having regard to

  their knowledge and experience</b></i>, and if they act honestly for the benefit of the

  company they represent, they discharge both their equitable as well as their legal duty to

  the company. [Emphasis added]</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">This passage was cited with approval by

Pidgeon J in<i> Australian Securities Commission v Gallagher </i>[1993] 10 ACSR 43, a

decision of the Supreme Court of Western Australia at 53:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">…the test is <i><b>basically</b></i>

  an objective one in the sense that the question is what an ordinary person, <i><b>with the

  knowledge and experience of the defendant</b></i>, might be expected to have done in the

  circumstances if he was acting on his own behalf. [Emphases added]</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23

        Under the traditional approach exemplified by

these lines of cases, the standard of ‘reasonable diligence’ is essentially

objective but it contains an important subjective qualification: it is measured against

what an ‘ordinary’ director<i>, sharing the same level of knowledge and

experience as the defendant</i>, would or would not have done on the facts of the case.

This makes it possible for a defendant to escape liability by appealing to his own lack of

knowledge or experience. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24

        However, times have changed. Professor Paul

Davis pointed out in<i> Gower’s Principles of Modern Company Law</i> (6 ed.) at p

640, "those cases seem to have framed the directors’ duties of skill and care

with non-executive rather than executive directors in mind and, moreover, on the basis of

a view that the non-executive director had no serious role to play within the company but

was simply a piece of window-dressing aimed at promoting the company’s image". </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25

        In <i>Daniels v Anderson</i> [1995] 16 ACSR 607

at 666-667, the Supreme Court of New South Wales indicated that it is no longer

appropriate to judge a director’s conduct by the traditional approach applied in

cases such as <i>Lagunas Nitrate Company v Lagunas Syndicate</i>:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The duties of a director are eloquently

  explained in the judgment of Pollock J, giving the opinion of the Supreme Court of New

  Jersey, in <i>Francis v United Jersey Bank</i> 432 A 2d 814 (1981)……In our

  opinion, this has become what the law requires of directors. At 812-3 Pollock J said:

  " ……Because directors are bound to exercise ordinary care, <i><b>they

  cannot set up as a defense lack of the knowledge needed to exercise the requisite degree

  of care</b></i>. If one feels that he has not had sufficient business experience to

  qualify him to perform the duties of a director, he should either acquire the knowledge by

  inquiry, or refuse to act……A director is not an ornament, but an essential

  component of corporate governance. Consequently, a director cannot protect himself behind

  a paper shield bearing the motto "dummy director". [Emphasis added]</font></p>

        This passage was quoted with approval in the

Chancery Division in<i> Re Barings plc and others</i> (No 5) [1999] 1 BCLC 433 at 488. The

policy under this modern approach is clear: a person who accepts the office of director

undertakes the responsibility that he understands the nature of the duty required of that

office. That duty will vary depending on the circumstances, the size and the business of

the particular company and the experience or skills that the director<i><b> </b>held

himself out<b> </b></i>to possess in support of appointment to the office<b>.</b> </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">27

        A similar view was held by Hoffman J in <i>Re

D’Jan of London Ltd</i> [1994] 1 BCLC 561 (Chancery Division) where he decided that

the duty of care owed by a director at common law is the conduct of a reasonably diligent

person having both (a) the general knowledge, skill and experience that may reasonably be

expected of a person carrying out the same functions as are carried out by that director

in relation to the company, and (b) the general knowledge, skill and experience which that

director has. As pointed out by Professor Davis in<i> Gower’s Principles of Modern

Company Law</i> (6 ed.) at p 642, the crucial difference with the traditional approach is

that limb (b) adds a subjective standard which can operate only to increase, and not

decrease the level of care and diligence required by the director. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">28

        In my opinion, the modern approach exemplified

in <i>Daniels v Anderson</i> and <i>Re D’ Jan of London Ltd</i> also represents the

position here. The law hence stands as thus: the <i>civil</i> standard of care and

diligence expected of a director is objective, namely, whether he has exercised the same

degree of care and diligence as a reasonable director found in his position. This standard

is not fixed but a continuum depending on various factors such as the individual’s

role in the company, the type of decision being made, the size and the business of the

company. However, it is important to note that, unlike the traditional approach, this

standard will not be lowered to accommodate any inadequacies in the individual’s

knowledge or experience. The standard will however be raised if he held himself out to

possess or in fact possesses some special knowledge or experience. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">29

        This position is not just in line with recent

developments in England and Australia but supported by two other reasons on principle:

firstly, the traditional approach made it too easy for directors to escape responsibility

for breaches of duty by relying on their personal lack of experience or knowledge. Surely

the law cannot act as an excuse for directors to continue in their ignorant state. That is

however exactly the effect of the traditional approach. This detracts from the protection

to shareholders intended by s157. Secondly, most of the older cases predated the modern

objective test of negligence propounded by the House of Lords in <i>Donoghue v Stevenson</i>

[1932] AC 562 and should be read in the light of subsequent developments. Hence, the

traditional position in <i>Lagunas Nitrate Co v Lagunas Syndicate </i>should no longer be

followed. </font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) The test to be applied for criminal

breaches of directors’ duties under s 157(3)(b) CA</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">30

        The appellant did not deny that an objective

test applies for civil cases but contended that a subjective test should apply for a

criminal offence under s157(3)(b) because it is a fundamental principle of criminal law

that a guilty mind must be proved before a charge can be sustained. Presumably, the

subjective test means that, for a director to be criminally liable, he must at least be

conscious of the risks involved but goes on to take the risks. In my opinion, the judge

was justified in rejecting the subjective test because the language of s 157(1) CA

supports an objective test. The term ‘<i>reasonable</i> diligence’ in s157(1)

itself implies that the appellant’s conduct must be measured against some objective

standard of behaviour: how else could reasonableness be ascertained? Neither is an

objective test alien in our criminal law. In <i>Lim Poh Eng v PP</i> [1999] 1 SLR 116

where the appellant was facing a charge of causing grievous hurt by doing an act so

negligently as to endanger human life under s 338 Penal Code (Cap 224), I adopted an

objective standard for negligence in both criminal and civil cases, namely, whether a

person has omitted to do something which a reasonable man would do, or has done something

which a prudent and reasonable man would not do. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">31

        It can be seen that the requirement of a

subjective state of mind in our criminal law stands no higher than this: it is a general

and important principle but it must yield to clear statutory language. Just as

"negligently" under s 338 of the Penal Code is an instance of such clear

language, likewise, "reasonable diligence" under s 157(1) CA is also such an

instance. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">32

        It is important to note that the duty of a

director to act with reasonable diligence is in turn conceptually distinct from the other

limb in s157(1): the duty to act honestly. These are different aspects of a

director’s bundle of duties even though they may overlap on certain facts.

"Honesty" has been interpreted to refer to the common law duty of a director to

act bona fide in the interests of the company: <i>Marchesi v Barnes and Keogh</i> [1970] V.R. 434 at 438.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">33

        Given the conceptual difference between honesty

and diligence, it is clear that adopting a subjective test for the duty to act honestly

does not mean that the court must do likewise for the duty to act with reasonable

diligence. Bearing this in mind, the following passage in <i>Cheam Tat Pang v PP</i>
<a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=9956&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1996] 1 SLR 541</a> at 545 relied upon by the appellant, although suggesting a subjective

test, is clearly directed towards the ‘honesty’ limb in s 157(1) and does not

support the appellant’s submission: </font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Counsel submitted that the concept of <i><b>honesty</b></i>

  bears different meanings under s157(1) CA, and under s 405 of the Penal Code. It was not

  disputed that the former term covers a wide spectrum of obligations relating to a

  director’s fiduciary duties. The only <i>mens rea</i> required for a s157(3) CA

  offence <i><b>is knowledge that what is being done is not in the interests of the company</b></i>,

  adopting Gowan J’s views as expressed in <i>Marchesi v Barnes &amp; Keogh </i>(1970)

  V.R. 434.[Emphases added]</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">34

        Although the subjective test of

‘reasonable diligence’ is rightly rejected, a choice must still be made between

two different variants of objective tests for the purpose of criminal liability, namely,

the traditional approach under <i>Lagunas Nitrate Co v Lagunas Syndicate</i> or the modern

approach under <i>Daniels v Anderson</i>. I have earlier adopted the modern approach for

civil cases. I am convinced that the same should also apply to criminal cases for two

reasons.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">35

        Firstly, the structure of s 157 shows that

Parliament does not intend different tests of diligence for civil and criminal breaches.

If different tests are indeed intended, then it would be natural for s 157 to have

different sub-sections describing the respective tests in different terms. Instead, a

single standard of ‘reasonable diligence’ is set in s 157(1) with s 157(3)

indicating concurrent civil and criminal liability for breach of that standard. This was

also the opinion of Sinnathuray J in the High Court decision of <i>Re Kie Hock Shipping

(1971) Pte Ltd </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=2570&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1985] 1 MLJ 411</a> at 417:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">…every director owes a duty to his

  company to use reasonable diligence in the discharge of his duties. Failure by a director

  to do so would be a breach of duty of his office. That breach of duty would give rise to

  an action by the company against the director for damages suffered by the company. The

  commission of <i><b>that</b></i> breach of duty by the director would <i><b>also</b></i>

  be a criminal offence. [Emphases added]</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">It is clear from the cited passage that

Sinnathuray J did not distinguish between civil and criminal breaches of the duty to use

reasonable diligence. Therefore, if the test in <i>Daniels v Anderson</i> applies for

civil cases (and I have decided earlier that it does), then the same test should apply for

criminal cases as well. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">36

        Secondly, one must keep in mind the aim of

imposing criminal liability under s 157(3)(b). While the objective of civil liability is

to compensate the company for losses caused by directors’ negligence, the aim of

criminal liability is to protect the wider public interests by deterring directors from

acting negligently. It should be clear by now that corporate scandals, especially in large

listed companies, impact adversely not only on the company in question, but may also have

a ripple effect on the wider stock market and the economy. Civil liability is however not

intended to protect, and in many cases is ineffective in protecting, the wider public

interests, simply because a civil action is not brought in many cases. For instance, the

director may be bankrupt by then and will not have the resources to pay any damages.

Sometimes, members of the company may not want to tarnish the reputation of the company

due to the negative publicity generated by suing the errant director. There are many other

reasons why a civil action may never see the light of day. However, in such cases, public

interests, represented by the criminal law, demand that the errant director cannot go

scot-free. Hence, any test of criminal liability must be sufficiently robust if it is to

protect the public interests by deterring directors from acting negligently. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">37

        The traditional approach under <i>Lagunas

Nitrate Co v Lagunas Syndicate</i>, in allowing an errant director to escape liability

because of his inexperience and lack of knowledge, is certainly not robust enough. Often,

losses are caused precisely because of the director’s inexperience and ignorance:

giving allowance to such failings will negate any intended protection of the public

interests. Public interests demand that the law places a duty on directors to acquire the

experience and knowledge required to run the company, which is well reflected in the

modern approach under <i>Daniels v Anderson</i>.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">38

        Hence, in my opinion, the test in <i>Daniels v

Anderson</i>, which I have adopted in the context of civil liability, also applies to

criminal liability under s 157(3)(b). However, it is important to note that, even though

the subjective lack of experience and knowledge of the defendant is irrelevant to

conviction, it should be considered in sentencing. It is only fair that a director who is

unable to meet the expected standard due to his lack of experience, should be given a

lighter punishment than someone who is experienced enough to be able to exercise the

required degree of care and diligence, but simply fails to do so.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Second ground of appeal: the standard of

proof under s 157(3)(b) CA</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">39

        The appellant contended that the district

judge, in adopting an objective standard of ‘reasonable diligence’, erroneously

adopted the civil standard of proof for a criminal action. This contention had no merit.

The appellant unfortunately failed to distinguish between the standard of reasonable

diligence and the standard of proof. An objective standard of reasonable diligence can

co-exist with the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt. Under s 157(3)(b),

like other criminal actions, the prosecution must <i>prove beyond a reasonable doubt</i>

that on the totality of the evidence, the defendant has <i>objectively</i> failed to use

reasonable diligence in the discharge of his duties as a director.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Third ground of appeal: whether the

appellant had used reasonable diligence on the facts</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">40

        Applying the standard for criminal liability

adopted earlier, the issue here was whether a reasonable managing director having 20 years

experience in operating three pawnshop businesses of similar scale would have done as the

appellant did, namely, releasing such valuable jewellery items before the cheque had been

cleared. If the appellant had been totally lacking in experience or knowledge, this <i>would</i>
<i>not lower</i> the standard of care expected of him. Here, however, he had been running

the business for 20 years – this certainly qualified as ‘special

experience’ which <i>would raise</i> the expected standard. On the facts, there was

certainly no doubt that he failed to use reasonable diligence. He was in control of the

pawnshops then and no reasonable managing director found in his shoes would have done as

he did. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">41

        The judge’s findings of facts were

challenged on several points, particularly that he should have found that the appellant

was conscious of the risks involved in releasing the items and only authorised their

release upon Chong’s assurance that Samuri would pay up. It is unnecessary to list

all the objections here, but suffice to say that none of them detract from the central

fact that the appellant voluntarily authorised the release of those items although he knew

the cheque had not been cleared. In my opinion, this fact alone was enough to sustain a

conviction. Under an objective test, it did not matter whether the appellant was conscious

of the risks involved in releasing the items. Further, neither would a reasonable director

release the items upon the informal assurance of a fellow director that a customer would

pay up. It was more than careless of the appellant to trust Chong’s assurance of

Samuri’s credibility. In my opinion, the prosecution had proved the charges beyond a

reasonable doubt.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Fourth Ground of Appeal: whether the fines

imposed are manifestly excessive</font></p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">42

        In his judgment, the judge carefully considered

all the mitigating factors: the appellant’s loss of employment and control of the

pawnshops, the fruits of his lifetime’s hard work and efforts, as well as the sum of

$300,000 he had to pay (together with Chong, Feok and Yeow) in settlement of the civil

suits. On the other hand, one must not forget the substantial losses caused to the

shareholders of the pawnshops and the glaring fact that the appellant, with his 20 years

of experience in the business, should not have made such a mistake. On the facts of the

case, the fines of $4,000 in respect of each of the charges were not excessive at all.</font></p>
