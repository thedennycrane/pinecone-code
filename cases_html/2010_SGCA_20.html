        Chan Sek Keong CJ (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The appellant, Yong Vui Kong (“the
                    Appellant”), was convicted of trafficking in 47.27g of diamorphine, a
                    controlled drug, and sentenced to death (see <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Yong Vui Kong</em> [2009] SGHC 4). He appealed
                    against the conviction and the sentence, but later withdrew that appeal. Four
                    days before the sentence was to be carried out, he filed Criminal Motion
                    No 41 of 2009 (“CM 41/2009”) seeking leave to pursue his
                    appeal. This court granted him leave to do so (see <em>Yong Vui
                        Kong v Public Prosecutor</em> [2009] SGCA 64). In the
                    present proceedings, the Appellant’s counsel, Mr M Ravi
                    (“Mr Ravi”), has confirmed that the Appellant is appealing
                    against only his sentence, and not his conviction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues raised in this appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The general issue in this appeal is whether the
                        <em>mandatory</em> death penalty (“the
                    MDP”) is permitted by the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore
                    (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint). The specific issue is whether the MDP
                    imposed under certain provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185,
                    2001 Rev Ed), in particular, is permitted by the Constitution of the
                    Republic of Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In this judgment, the cases to be considered and
                    the legal points to be discussed relate to different revised editions of both
                    the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore and the Misuse of Drugs Act. For
                    simplicity, we shall hereafter refer to the particular revised edition of the
                    statute that is relevant to the case or legal point being discussed as
                    “the Singapore Constitution” (<em>vis-à-vis</em> the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore) and
                    “the MDA” (<em>vis-à-vis</em> the Misuse of
                    Drugs Act).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Appellant is challenging the constitutional
                    validity of s 33 read with the Second Schedule to the MDA (collectively
                    referred to hereafter as “the MDP provisions in the MDA”), under
                    which he was sentenced to suffer the MDP. This challenge against the MDP for
                    drug-related offences is not new. It was made in 1980 before the Privy Council
                    in <em>Ong Ah Chuan v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [1981] AC 648 (“<em>Ong Ah
                    Chuan</em>”) and in 2004 before this court in <em>Nguyen Tuong Van v Public Prosecutor</em> [2005]
                    1 SLR(R) 103 (“<em>Nguyen</em>”).
                    In both cases, it was contended that the MDP prescribed by the MDA for the
                    offence in question (<em>viz</em>, trafficking in
                    controlled drugs in <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em> and importation
                    of controlled drugs in <em>Nguyen</em>) was
                    unconstitutional because it infringed Arts 9(1) and 12(1) of the Singapore
                    Constitution. In both cases, the constitutional challenge to the MDP was
                    dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Notwithstanding the decisions in <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em> and <em>Nguyen</em>,
                    both of which affirm the constitutionality of the MDP provisions in the MDA, we
                    gave leave to the Appellant in CM 41/2009 to pursue the present appeal and
                    argue both the general issue and the specific issue delineated at <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above because Mr Ravi said that he had new
                    arguments based on new materials to show that both <em>Ong Ah
                        Chuan</em> and <em>Nguyen</em> were wrongly
                    decided at the relevant time, and that, today, this court should depart from
                    those decisions and declare the MDP unconstitutional in view of Art 9(1)
                    and/or Art 12(1) of the Singapore Constitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       We should point out at this juncture that the
                    issue of whether the death penalty <em>per se</em>
                        (<em>ie</em>, the death penalty as a form of punishment
                    for an offence) is unconstitutional does not arise in this appeal since the
                    Appellant (as Mr Ravi has emphasised) is only challenging the
                    constitutional validity of the MDP. It is not surprising that the Appellant has
                    adopted this stance because Art 9(1) expressly allows a person to be
                    deprived of his life “in accordance with law”; <em>ie</em>, it expressly sanctions the death penalty. This precludes the
                    Appellant from challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty <em>per se</em> (see in this regard the observations of the Privy
                    Council in <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em> at 672 as quoted at
                        <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> below). The Appellant has thus
                    chosen to argue that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     as the MDP is an inhuman punishment,
                        any legislation that prescribes the MDP as the punishment for an offence
                        (referred to hereafter as “MDP legislation” generically)
                        violates the right to life set out in Art 9(1) and, therefore, is not
                        “law” for the purposes of this provision;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     MDP legislation is also not
                        “law” for the purposes of Art 9(1) because the term
                        “law” therein includes customary international law
                        (“CIL”), which prohibits the MDP as an inhuman punishment;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        differentia employed in the MDA for determining when the MDP is to be
                        imposed is arbitrary, thus making the MDP provisions in the MDA inconsistent
                        with the right under Art 12(1) of equal protection of the
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Appellant’s challenge to the MDP based
                    on Art 9(1) (“the Article 9(1) challenge”) is targeted
                    at the mandatory nature of the MDP. It rests on the premise that, because MDP
                    legislation does not give the court any discretion to decide (in view of the
                    circumstances of the case at hand) whether or not to impose the death penalty,
                    such legislation “treats all persons convicted of a designated offense
                    not as uniquely individual human beings, but as members of a faceless,
                    undifferentiated mass to be subjected to the blind infliction of the penalty of
                    death” (<em>per</em> Stewart J in <em>Woodson et al v North Carolina</em> 428 US 280 (1976)
                        (“<em>Woodson</em>”) at 304). From this
                    perspective, MDP legislation is regarded as being inhuman and, thus,
                    antithetical to the right to life set out in Art 9(1). The
                    Article 9(1) challenge, if successful, will affect the constitutionality of
                    not only the MDP provisions in the MDA, but also all other MDP legislation, such
                    as:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     s 302 of the Penal Code
                        (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Singapore Penal Code”)
                            <em>vis-à-vis</em> the offence of
                    murder;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     s 4 of
                        the Arms Offences Act (Cap 14, 2008 Rev Ed) <em>vis-à-vis</em> the offence of using or attempting to use
                        arms;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     s 4A
                        of the Arms Offences Act <em>vis-à-vis</em> the offence
                        of using or attempting to use arms to commit or to attempt to commit an
                        offence listed in the Schedule to the Act; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_d"></a>(d)     s 58(1) of the Internal Security Act
                        (Cap 143, 1985 Rev Ed) <em>vis-à-vis</em> the
                        offence of having or carrying, without lawful excuse and without lawful
                        authority, any firearm, ammunition or explosive in a security area (as
                        defined in s 2 of that Act).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In contrast, the Appellant’s challenge to
                    the MDP based on Art 12(1) (“the Article 12(1)
                    challenge”), if successful, will affect only the MDP provisions in the
                    MDA. In other words, the Appellant’s argument on Art 12(1) is
                    specific to the MDP provisions in the MDA and does not impinge on the
                    constitutional validity of other MDP legislation. The Appellant’s
                    submission in this regard is that the MDP provisions in the MDA, in making the
                    quantity of controlled drugs trafficked the sole determinant of when the MDP is
                    to be imposed, draw arbitrary distinctions between offenders who traffic in
                    different amounts of controlled drugs. (In the case of trafficking in
                    diamorphine specifically, the MDP provisions in the MDA state that the MDP
                    applies so long as more than 15g of diamorphine is trafficked. For convenience,
                    we shall hereafter refer to this criterion as “the 15g
                    differentia”.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Although the Article 9(1) challenge and the
                    Article 12(1) challenge are different in so far as they pertain to two
                    different constitutional provisions, they are at the same time related in that
                    the Appellant does not need to rely on the Article 12(1) challenge if he
                    succeeds on the Article 9(1) challenge. In other words, if the MDP
                    provisions in the MDA violate Art 9(1) because, in making the death penalty
                        <em>mandatory</em>, they lay down an inhuman
                    punishment, they would be unconstitutional regardless of whether or not they
                    also, contrary to Art 12(1), draw arbitrary distinctions between offenders
                    who traffic in different amounts of controlled drugs. For this reason, we shall
                    address the Article 9(1) challenge first before the Article 12(1)
                    challenge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Article 9(1) challenge: Whether the MDP is consistent with
                the right to life in Article 9(1)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     To understand the parties’ arguments on
                    Art 9(1) of the Singapore Constitution, it is necessary to appreciate the
                    legal context of those arguments. We shall set out this legal context first,
                    followed by the parties’ arguments and then our decision on the
                    Article 9(1) challenge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The legal context of the Article 9(1) challenge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Article 9(1) of the Singapore
                    Constitution provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in
                        accordance with law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The expression “law” is defined in Art 2(1) as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“law” includes written law and any legislation of the United
                        Kingdom or other enactment or instrument whatsoever which is in operation in
                        Singapore and the common law in so far as it is in operation in Singapore
                        and any custom or usage having the force of law in Singapore …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In this regard, the expression “written law” means (see
                    likewise Art 2(1)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… this Constitution and all Acts and Ordinances and subsidiary
                        legislation for the time being in force in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     
          <em>Prima facie</em>, the
                    MDA, being legislation in force in Singapore, is “written law” and
                    is thus “law” as defined in Art 2(1); the same applies to
                    other MDP legislation currently in force in Singapore. The meaning of the term
                    “law” was considered by the Privy Council in <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em> and by this court in <em>Nguyen</em>. Before we turn to examine these two decisions, we note
                    in passing that, although Art 2(1) defines the expression
                    “law” to include “custom or usage” (<em>per</em> Art 2(1)), Mr Ravi has not argued that
                    these words are intended to include CIL. If such an argument had been made, we
                    would have rejected it because, in our view, the phrase “custom or
                    usage” in Art 2(1) refers to local customs and usages which (in the
                    words of this provision) “[have] the force of law in Singapore”,
                    that is to say, local customs and usages which are already part of our domestic
                    law.</p>

                    to death. They appealed against their convictions on, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the ground that the rebuttable presumption of trafficking
                    which arose under the MDA upon proof of possession of controlled drugs exceeding
                    the stipulated quantity was a violation of due process of law and was therefore
                    not “in accordance with law” for the purposes of
                    Art 9(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Prosecution in that case argued that,
                    since the expression “law” was defined in Art 2(1) to include
                    written law and since “written law” included all Acts of
                    Parliament, the requirements of Art 9(1) were satisfied so long as the
                    deprivation of life or personal liberty complained of was carried out in
                    accordance with provisions contained in “any Act passed by the Parliament
                    of Singapore, <em>however arbitrary or contrary to fundamental
                        rules of natural justice</em> the provisions of such Act [might]
                    be” [emphasis added] (see <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em> at
                    670). The Privy Council rejected this argument (which was characterised as
                    “extreme” in the later Privy Council decision of <em>Haw Tua Tau and others v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [1981–1982] SLR(R) 133 at [7]) for the following reasons (see
                        <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em> at 670–671):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In a Constitution founded on the Westminster model and particularly in
                        that part of it that purports to assure to all individual citizens the
                        continued enjoyment of fundamental liberties or rights, <em>references to “law” in such contexts as “in
                            accordance with law,” “equality before the law,”
                            “protection of the law” and the like, in their
                            Lordships’ view, refer to a system of law which incorporates those
                            fundamental rules of natural justice that had formed part and parcel of
                            the common law of England that was in operation in Singapore at the
                            commencement of the [Singapore] Constitution</em>. It would have
                        been taken for granted by the makers of the [Singapore] Constitution that
                        the “law” to which citizens could have recourse for the
                        protection of fundamental liberties assured to them by the [Singapore]
                        Constitution would be a system of law that did not flout those fundamental
                        rules. If it were otherwise it would be [a] misuse of language to speak of
                        law as something which affords “protection” for the individual
                        in the enjoyment of his fundamental liberties, and the purported
                        entrenchment (by article 5) of articles 9(1) and 12(1) would be
                        little better than a mockery. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Having set out its interpretation of the
                    expression “law”, the Privy Council in <em>Ong Ah
                        Chuan</em> tested the provisions of the MDA against that
                    interpretation to determine their constitutional validity, and held that they
                    did not breach the fundamental rules of natural justice. Hence, the Privy
                    Council rejected the appellants’ constitutional challenge to the statutory
                    presumption of trafficking in the MDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     We should point out that, at the hearing
                    before the Privy Council, the Board (<em>per</em>
                    Lord Diplock) specifically asked counsel for the Prosecution whether he was
                    contending that, so long as a statute was an Act of Parliament, it would be
                    justified by Art 9(1), however unfair, absurd or oppressive it might be
                    (see <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em> at 659). When counsel answered
                    that the Prosecution was not advancing that argument and that it was unnecessary
                    for him to rely on that argument since the Prosecution considered its case
                    against each appellant to be plain on its facts, Lord Diplock replied
                    (likewise at 659):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Their Lordships cannot accept that because they will have to deal with the
                        point. They are not disposed to find that article 9(1) justifies all
                        legislation whatever its nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, beyond what was actually decided in <em>Ong Ah
                        Chuan</em> itself, it is not clear what the Privy Council had in mind
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> the kind of legislation that would
                    not qualify as “law” for the purposes of Art 9(1). Perhaps,
                    the Privy Council had in mind colourable legislation which purported to enact a
                    “law” as generally understood (<em>ie</em>, a
                    legislative rule of general application), but which in effect was a legislative
                    judgment, that is to say, legislation directed at securing the conviction of
                    particular known individuals (see <em>Don John Francis Douglas
                        Liyanage and others v The Queen</em> [1967] 1 AC 259 at
                    291), or legislation of so absurd or arbitrary a nature that it could not
                    possibly have been contemplated by our constitutional framers as being
                    “law” when they crafted the constitutional provisions protecting
                    fundamental liberties (<em>ie</em>, the provisions now set
                    out in Pt IV of the Singapore Constitution).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In this connection, it is useful to put in
                    context the following statement by Yong Pung How CJ (delivering the
                    judgment of this court) in <em>Jabar bin Kadermastan v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1995] 1 SLR(R) 326 (“<em>Jabar</em>”) at [52]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Any law which provides for the deprivation of a person’s life or
                        personal liberty … is valid and binding so long as it is validly
                        passed by Parliament. <em>The court is not concerned with
                            whether it is also fair, just and reasonable as well</em>.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Upon a first reading, Yong CJ’s
                    statement may appear to contradict the Privy Council’s interpretation of
                    the expression “law” in <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em>
                    at 670–671 (see the extract quoted at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above). In our view, however, there is in fact no such
                    contradiction. Yong CJ’s statement was made in the context of a case
                    where the appellant argued, in reliance on <em>Earl Pratt and
                        another v Attorney-General for Jamaica and another</em> [1994]
                    2 AC 1 (“<em>Pratt</em>”), that
                    Art 9(1) of the Singapore Constitution was applicable to render the
                    execution of the death sentence imposed on him unconstitutional as he had been
                    incarcerated on death row for more than five years since his conviction. In
                        <em>Pratt</em>, the Privy Council held that a prolonged
                    delay in the execution of a death sentence constituted inhuman punishment and
                    contravened s 17(1) of the Constitution of Jamaica, which stated that no
                    person should be subjected to “torture or to inhuman or degrading
                    punishment or other treatment”. This ruling was rejected in <em>Jabar</em> by this court, which preferred the decision in
                        <em>Willie Lee Richmond v Samuel A Lewis</em>
                    948 F 2d 1473 (1990). In that case, the US Court of Appeals, Ninth
                    Circuit, held that the carrying out of a death sentence after the offender had
                    spent 16 years on death row did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment in
                    contravention of the Eighth and the Fourteenth Amendments to the US Constitution
                    where the delay was occasioned by the offender initiating unmeritorious legal
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The issue raised in <em>Jabar</em> concerned the constitutionality of <em>carrying out the MDP</em>, given the period of time which had lapsed
                    since the appellant’s conviction, and not the constitutionality of the MDP
                        <em>per se</em>. That was why this court held that the
                    question of whether the relevant MDP legislation (which, on the facts of
                        <em>Jabar</em>, was s 302 of the Penal Code
                    (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed)) was fair, just and reasonable was not
                    relevant. Yong CJ’s statement should be read in this context, and not
                    as a definitive interpretation of the term “law” in Art 9(1);
                    otherwise, that statement would be inconsistent with the approach taken in
                        <em>Nguyen</em>, where this court (Yong CJ
                    presiding) affirmed (at [82]) the Privy Council’s interpretation of
                    “law” in <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Returning to the facts of <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em>, the appellants, apart from challenging the
                    constitutionality of the statutory presumption of trafficking (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above), also disputed the constitutionality
                    of the MDP. The Privy Council made the following observations about the death
                    penalty in general (at 672):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It was not suggested on behalf of the [appellants] that capital punishment
                        is unconstitutional per se. Such an argument is foreclosed by the
                        recognition in article 9(1) of the [Singapore] Constitution that a
                        person may be deprived of life “in accordance with
                        law.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     With regard to the MDP specifically, the Privy
                    Council commented (at 672–673):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As their Lordships understood the argument presented to them on behalf of
                        the [appellants], it was that the mandatory nature of the sentence, in the
                        case of an offence so broadly drawn as that of trafficking created by
                        section 3 of the [MDA], rendered it arbitrary since it debarred the
                        court in punishing offenders from discriminating between them according to
                        their individual blameworthiness. This, it was contended, was arbitrary and
                        not “in accordance with law” as their Lordships have construed
                        that phrase in article 9(1); alternatively it offends against the
                        principle of equality before the law entrenched in the [Singapore]
                        Constitution by article 12(1), since it compels the court to condemn to
                        the highest penalty of death an addict who has gratuitously supplied an
                        addict friend with 15 grammes of heroin from his own private store, and
                        to inflict a lesser punishment upon a professional dealer caught selling for
                        distribution to many addicts a total of 14.99 grammes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Their Lordships would emphasise that in their judicial
                            capacity they are in no way concerned with arguments for or against
                            capital punishment or its efficacy as a deterrent to so evil and
                            profitable a crime as trafficking in addictive drugs. Whether there
                            should be capital punishment in Singapore and, if so, for what offences,
                            are questions for the legislature of Singapore which, in the case of
                            drugs offences, it has answered by section 29 and Schedule 2
                            of the [MDA]. A primary object of imposing a death sentence for offences
                            that society regards with particular abhorrence is that it should act as
                            a deterrent; particularly where the offence is one that is committed for
                            profit by an offender who is prepared to take a calculated risk. There
                            is nothing unusual in a capital sentence being mandatory. Indeed its
                            efficacy as a deterrent may be to some extent diminished if it is
                            not</em>. At common law all capital sentences were mandatory;
                        under the Penal Code of Singapore [<em>ie</em>, the
                        Penal Code (Cap 103, 1970 Rev Ed)] the capital sentence for murder
                        and for offences against the President’s person still is. If it were
                        valid the argument for the [appellants] would apply to every law which
                        imposed a mandatory fixed or minimum penalty even where it was not capital
                        – an extreme position which counsel was anxious to disclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The decision in <span class="ToggleRoman" style="font-style:normal">Nguyen</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Moving on to <em>Nguyen</em>, the appellant in that case was convicted of importing
                    396.2g of diamorphine into Singapore without authorisation, an offence under
                    s 7 of the MDA, and was, pursuant to the MDP provisions in the MDA,
                    sentenced to suffer the MDP. He appealed against both his conviction and his
                    sentence, contending that those provisions were unconstitutional because they
                    violated Arts 9(1), 12(1) and 93 of the Singapore Constitution (these
                    Articles concern, respectively, the right to life, the right to equal protection
                    of the law and the judicial power of Singapore).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     For present purposes, we shall examine only
                    the appellant’s argument based on Art 9(1) and this court’s
                    decision on that argument. The appellant’s argument was that: (a) the
                    MDP was arbitrary because it precluded proportional and individualised
                    sentencing, which form of sentencing was protected by the prohibition against
                    cruel and inhuman treatment or punishment; and (b) even if the MDP were not
                    arbitrary, execution by hanging amounted to cruel and inhuman punishment. In
                    making this argument, the appellant took the position that the expression
                    “law” in Art 9(1) incorporated CIL, specifically, the CIL
                    prohibition against cruel, inhuman, degrading or unusual treatment or
                    punishment. (In this regard, we shall hereafter refer to such treatment or
                    punishment as “inhuman punishment” generically since Mr Ravi has,
                    in his arguments, emphasised the prohibition against <em>inhuman</em> treatment or punishment in particular; it should,
                    however, be noted that the terms “cruel”, “inhuman”,
                    “degrading” and “unusual” do not share the exact
                    same meaning.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The way in which the appellant in <em>Nguyen</em> framed his argument on Art 9(1) was probably
                    influenced by post-<em>Ong Ah Chuan</em> Privy Council
                    decisions on the constitutional validity of the MDP under the Constitutions of
                    other Commonwealth States, principally the Caribbean States. Counsel for the
                    appellant cited those cases in an attempt to persuade this court that either
                        <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em> had been wrongly decided at the
                    material time or, alternatively, the Privy Council would have decided the case
                    differently in 2004. The decisions which counsel referred to were:</p>

                    under the MDA was arbitrary, this court affirmed in <em>Nguyen</em> (at [82]) as established law the Privy Council’s
                    decision in <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em> at 670–671 (quoted
                    at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above) on the meaning of the phrase
                    “in accordance with law” in Art 9(1). The court noted that
                    the Privy Council had ruled in both <em>Watson</em> and
                        <em>Reyes</em> that “the [MDP] in respect of
                    certain classes of murder was … unconstitutional as a violation of the
                    prohibition against cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment” (see
                        <em>Nguyen</em> at [83]), and opined (likewise at [83])
                    that the Privy Council would have ruled in the same way in <em>Matthew</em> and <em>Boyce</em> “but for
                    certain ‘saving provisions’ in the relevant national Constitutions
                    which preserved pre-existing national laws”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In <em>Reyes</em>, the
                    Privy Council held that the MDP was unconstitutional under s 7 of the
                    Constitution of Belize (Laws of Belize, c 4) (“the Belize
                    Constitution”), which specifically prohibited, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, inhuman punishment. The Privy Council (<em>per</em> Lord Bingham of Cornhill) observed thus (at
                    [43]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To deny the offender the opportunity, before sentence is passed, to seek
                        to persuade the court that in all the circumstances to condemn him to death
                        would be disproportionate and inappropriate is to treat him as no human
                        being should be treated and thus to deny his basic humanity, the core of the
                        right which section 7 [of the Belize Constitution] exists to
                        protect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In <em>Nguyen</em>, this
                    court held (at [84]) that the Privy Council’s reasoning in <em>Reyes</em> as to why the MDP was unconstitutional was not
                    applicable to Singapore because neither the Singapore Constitution nor any other
                    Singapore statute contained an equivalent of s 7 of the Belize
                    Constitution. The court also pointed out (at [85] of <em>Nguyen</em>) that <em>Reyes</em> was decided
                    “in the light of the various international norms that had been
                    ‘accepted by Belize as consistent with the fundamental standards of
                    humanity’”, such as those encapsulated in the Universal Declaration
                    of Human Rights (10 December 1948), GA Res 217A (III), UN
                    Doc A/810 (“the UDHR”) and the International Covenant on
                    Civil and Political Rights (19 December 1966), 999 UNTS
                171.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     With regard to <em>Watson</em>, this court distinguished it in <em>Nguyen</em> (at [86]) on the same grounds as those outlined in the
                    preceding paragraph. At the same time, this court acknowledged (likewise at
                    [86]) the following comments by Lord Hope of Craighead, who delivered the
                    judgment of the majority in <em>Watson</em> (at
                    [29]–[30]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Their Lordships consider that the mandatory death penalty which is imposed
                        under section 3 of the Act [<em>ie</em>, the
                        Offences against the Person Act 1864 (Laws of Jamaica, c 268), as
                        amended by the Offences against the Person (Amendment) Act 1992
                        (No 14)] is open to the same constitutional objections as those that
                        were identified in <em>Reyes v The Queen</em>. It is no
                        longer acceptable, nor is it any longer possible to say, as
                        Lord Diplock did on behalf of the Board in <em>Ong Ah
                            Chuan v Public Prosecutor</em> [1981] AC 648, 674, that
                        there is nothing unusual in a death sentence being mandatory. As
                        Lord Bingham pointed out in <em>Reyes</em>’<em>s</em> case [2002]
                        2 AC 235, 244, para 17, the mandatory penalty of death on
                        conviction of murder long predated any international arrangements for the
                        protection of human rights. The decision in that case was made at a time
                        when international jurisprudence on human rights was rudimentary
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The march of international jurisprudence on this issue [<em>viz</em>, the constitutionality of the MDP] began with the
                        Universal Declaration of Human Rights which was adopted by a resolution of
                        the General Assembly of the United Nations on 10 December 1948
                        (Cmd 7662). It came to be recognised that among the fundamental rights
                        which must be protected are the right to life and the right not to be
                        subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment: see
                        articles 3 and 5 of the Universal Declaration; articles I and XXVI
                        of the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man which was
                        adopted by the Ninth International Conference of American States on
                        2 May 1948; articles 2 and 3 of the European Convention for the
                        Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (1953) (Cmd 8969);
                        articles 6(1) and 7 of the International [Covenant] on Civil and
                        Political Rights which was adopted by a resolution of the General Assembly
                        of the United Nations on 16 December 1966 and [which] entered into
                        force on 23 March 1976 (1977) (Cmnd 6702); and articles 4.1
                        and 5.2 of the American Convention on Human Rights which was signed on
                        22 November 1969 and [which] came into force on 18 July 1978. So
                        the practice was adopted, as many of the former British colonies achieved
                        independence, of setting out in their Constitutions a series of fundamental
                        rights and freedoms which were to be protected under the Constitution. The
                        history of these developments is fully set out in <em>Reyes</em> [2002] 2 AC 235. It is as relevant to the
                        position under the Constitution of Jamaica as it was in that case to Belize.
                        There is a common heritage. In <em>Minister of Home Affairs v
                            Fisher</em> [1980] AC 319, 328 Lord Wilberforce
                        referred to the influence of the European Convention in the drafting of the
                        constitutional instruments during the post-colonial period, including the
                        Constitutions of most Caribbean territories. That influence is clearly seen
                        in Chapter III of the Constitution of Jamaica.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Ultimately, in <em>Nguyen</em>, this court upheld the constitutionality of the MDP in
                    view of two factors, namely: (a) the difference between the wording of the
                    applicable constitutional provisions in <em>Reyes</em> and
                        <em>Watson</em> and that of the relevant provisions of
                    the Singapore Constitution; and (b) the difference between the
                    constitutional history of the States from which those two Privy Council appeals
                    arose (namely, Belize where <em>Reyes</em> was concerned,
                    and Jamaica where <em>Watson</em> was concerned) and the
                    constitutional history of Singapore. In so ruling, this court effectively
                    distinguished <em>Reyes</em>, <em>Watson</em> and other like cases on the ground that Art 9(1) of
                    the Singapore Constitution did not contain any words prohibiting inhuman
                    punishment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     To complete this account of the decision in
                        <em>Nguyen</em>, we should add that the basis on which
                    this court distinguished <em>Reyes</em> and <em>Watson</em> was <em>in pari materia</em>
                    with the basis on which the Privy Council in <em>Bowe and another
                        v The Queen</em> [2006] 1 WLR 1623 (“<em>Bowe</em>”), an appeal from the Commonwealth of the
                    Bahamas (“the Bahamas”), distinguished <em>Ong Ah
                        Chuan</em>, namely, the Bahamian Constitution expressly prohibited
                    inhuman punishment whereas the Singapore Constitution contained no such express
                    prohibition. In <em>Bowe</em>, the Privy Council observed
                    thus (at [41]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Ong Ah Chuan</em> … concerned mandatory
                        death sentences in Singapore for possession of more than 15 grammes of
                        heroin. The constitutionality of that sentence was challenged, and in giving
                        the judgment of the Board rejecting the challenge Lord Diplock made
                        observations … approbatory of the mandatory death sentence for
                        murder, while suggesting … that the moral blameworthiness of those
                        convicted of murder might vary more widely than in the case of drug
                        traffickers. He pointed to the prerogative of mercy as a means of mitigating
                        the rigidity of the law. <em>But the [Singapore] Constitution
                            … contained no provision comparable with section 3 of the
                            1963 and 1969 Constitutions [of the Bahamas], or the eighth amendment to
                            the US Constitution, or article 3 of the European Convention[, all
                            of which prohibit subjecting a person to torture or inhuman
                            punishment]</em>. The decision … is not authority on the
                        compatibility of a mandatory death sentence with a constitution containing
                        such a provision, particularly where (contrary to the situation said by
                        counsel to prevail in the case of drug traffickers in Singapore …)
                        the sentence is frequently commuted. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     With regard to the argument by the appellant
                    in <em>Nguyen</em> that death by hanging was inhuman
                    punishment and that the prohibition against such punishment was incorporated in
                    the expression “law” in Art 9(1) of the Singapore
                    Constitution, this court said (at [91]–[92]) that while it was widely
                    accepted that the prohibition against inhuman punishment amounted to a rule of
                    CIL, there was insufficient evidence of state practice to demonstrate that the
                    content of this CIL prohibition was such as to prohibit hanging as a mode of
                    execution. This court also noted that there was no CIL prohibition against the
                    death penalty <em>per se</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The above summary of what was decided in
                        <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em> and <em>Nguyen</em> forms the legal backdrop to the form and structure of the
                    arguments advanced by Mr Ravi in this appeal. We shall now consider the
                    Article 9(1) challenge proper.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The two limbs of the Article 9(1) challenge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     As indicated at <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above, there are two limbs to the Article 9(1)
                    challenge, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a>(a)     MDP legislation is not
                        “law” for the purposes of Art 9(1) as it prescribes the
                        MDP, which is an inhuman punishment, as the punishment for an offence;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"></a>(b)     the MDP is
                        prohibited under CIL, which is included in the expression
                        “law” in Art 9(1), and, accordingly, the MDP is
                        prohibited by Art 9(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">For convenience, we shall
                    hereafter refer to the first limb as “the ‘inhuman
                    punishment’ limb” and the second limb as “the
                    ‘contrary to CIL’ limb”.</p>

                    punishment” limb of the Article 9(1) challenge, Mr Ravi
                    contends that the MDP is an inhuman punishment because it has been held to be so
                    in a long string of Privy Council cases decided post-<em>Ong Ah
                        Chuan</em> and/or post-<em>Nguyen</em>, as well

<p class="Judg-1">It may be
                    noted that many of the above cases were decided prior to <em>Nguyen</em>, and were considered and distinguished by this court in
                        <em>Nguyen</em>. To this extent, Mr Ravi is
                    traversing old ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Mr Ravi’s argument before this
                    court is that the Appellant’s Art 9(1) cases cast doubt on the
                    correctness of the decisions in <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em> and
                        <em>Nguyen</em>, and support the view that the MDP
                    dehumanises the offender by debarring the trial judge from considering, during
                    the sentencing process, any and all mitigating circumstances as to why the
                    offender should not suffer death. In this respect, three of the
                    Appellant’s Art 9(1) cases should be noted in
                particular.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The first is the Privy Council case of
                        <em>Reyes</em>. In that case, the appellant was
                    convicted of two counts of murder for shooting his neighbour and his
                    neighbour’s wife in a dispute over the neighbour’s attempt to build
                    a fence 2ft from the back of the appellant’s house. Under s 102(3)(b)
                    of the Criminal Code of Belize (Laws of Belize, c 84) (“the Belize
                    Criminal Code”), murder by shooting was classified as a
                    “class A” murder, and, under s 102(1) of the same
                    statute, it attracted the MDP. The appellant appealed against his sentence,
                    contending that s 102 of the Belize Criminal Code was contrary to s 7
                    of the Belize Constitution. The Privy Council, in allowing the appeal, made the
                    following observations (at [43]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For [the] purposes of this appeal the Board need not consider the
                        constitutionality of any mandatory penalty other than death, nor the
                        constitutionality of a mandatory death penalty imposed for any murder other
                        than by shooting. In the absence of adversarial argument it is undesirable
                        to decide more than is necessary to resolve this appeal. The Board is
                        however satisfied that the provision requiring sentence of death to be
                        passed on the defendant on his conviction of murder by shooting subjected
                        him to inhuman or degrading punishment or other treatment incompatible with
                        his right under section 7 of the [Belize] Constitution in that it
                        required sentence of death to be passed and precluded any judicial
                        consideration of the humanity of condemning him to death. The use of
                        firearms by dangerous and aggressive criminals is an undoubted social evil
                        and, so long as the death penalty is retained, there may well be murders by
                        shooting which justify the ultimate penalty. But there will also be murders
                        of quite a different character (for instance, murders arising from sudden
                        quarrels within a family, or between neighbours, involving the use of a
                        firearm legitimately owned for no criminal or aggressive purpose) in which
                        the death penalty would be plainly excessive and disproportionate. In a
                        crime of this kind there may well be matters relating both to the offence
                        and the offender which ought properly to be considered before sentence is
                        passed. <em>To deny the offender the opportunity, before
                            sentence is passed, to seek to persuade the court that in all the
                            circumstances to condemn him to death would be disproportionate and
                            inappropriate is to treat him as no human being should be treated and
                            thus to deny his basic humanity, the core of the right which
                            section 7 exists to protect</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The second case which we wish to highlight is
                        <em>Woodson</em>, where the US Supreme Court (by a
                    majority of 5:4) struck down MDP legislation as unconstitutional in view of the
                    prohibition against (<em>inter alia</em>) “cruel and
                    unusual punishments” set out in the Eighth Amendment to the US
                    Constitution. Stewart J, who delivered the judgment of the majority, said
                    in a passage at 303–305 (which was later cited with approval by
                    Lord Bingham at [34] of <em>Reyes</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[D]eath is a punishment different from all other sanctions in kind rather
                        than degree. …
                        <em>A process that accords no significance to relevant facets
                            of the character and record of the individual offender or the
                            circumstances of the particular offense excludes from consideration in
                            fixing the ultimate punishment of death the possibility of compassionate
                            or mitigating factors stemming from the diverse frailties of humankind.
                            It treats all persons convicted of a designated offense not as uniquely
                            individual human beings, but as members of a faceless, undifferentiated
                            mass to be subjected to the blind infliction of the penalty of
                            death</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This Court has previously recognized that “[f]or the determination
                        of sentences, justice generally requires consideration of more than the
                        particular acts by which the crime was committed and that there be taken
                        into account the circumstances of the offense together with the character
                        and propensities of the offender.”
                        <em>Pennsylvania ex rel Sullivan</em> v. <em>Ashe</em>, 302 U.S. 51, 55 (1937). Consideration of
                        both the offender and the offense in order to arrive at a just and
                        appropriate sentence has been viewed as a progressive and humanizing
                        development. … While the prevailing practice of individualizing
                        sentencing determinations generally reflects simply enlightened policy
                        rather than a constitutional imperative, we believe that in capital cases
                        the fundamental respect for humanity underlying the Eighth Amendment
                        … requires consideration of the character and record of the
                        individual offender and the circumstances of the particular offense as a
                        constitutionally indispensable part of the process of inflicting the penalty
                        of death.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This conclusion rests squarely on the predicate that the penalty of death
                        is qualitatively different from a sentence of imprisonment, however long.
                        Death, in its finality, differs more from life imprisonment than a 100-year
                        prison term differs from one of only a year or two. Because of that
                        qualitative difference, there is a corresponding difference in the need for
                        reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate punishment in
                        a specific case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     It should be noted that, although
                    Stewart J highlighted in the above passage the qualitative difference
                    between the death sentence and a sentence of imprisonment (because of the
                    finality of death) and the “corresponding difference in the need for
                    reliability in the determination that death [would be] the appropriate
                    punishment in a specific case” (see <em>Woodson</em>
                    at 305), he did not say that the possibility of error in making this
                    determination rendered the MDP dehumanising. Instead, he held that it was the
                    exclusion of judicial discretion – specifically, the exclusion of
                    “the character and record of the individual offender and the
                    circumstances of the particular offense” (see <em>Woodson</em> at 304) from the court’s consideration –
                    which made the MDP dehumanising. Stewart J also added that if every
                    offender convicted of murder were punished with death, the law would be treating
                    all such offenders as “a faceless, undifferentiated mass” (see
                        <em>Woodson</em> at 304) and would be dehumanising
                    them; from that perspective, the MDP was an inhuman punishment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The third of the Appellant’s
                    Art 9(1) cases which we wish to draw attention to is <em>Mithu</em>. Several extracts of the Indian Supreme Court’s
                    judgment in that case were cited in a passage at [36] of <em>Reyes</em>. That passage (“the composite passage from
                        <em>Mithu</em>”) comprises certain observations
                    made by Y V Chandrachud CJ (at [12] and [16]) and Chinnappa
                    Reddy J (at [25]) on s 303 of the Penal Code 1860 (Act 45 of
                    1860) (India) (“the Indian Penal Code”), which imposes the MDP on
                    a person who commits murder while under a sentence of life imprisonment. The
                    passage reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.    … [A] provision of law which deprives the
                            Court of the use of its wise and beneficent discretion in a matter of
                            life and death, without regard to the circumstances in which the offence
                            was committed and, therefore, without regard to the gravity of the
                            offence, cannot but be regarded as harsh, unjust and unfair.
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16.    Thus, there is no justification for prescribing a
                            mandatory sentence of death for the offence of murder committed inside
                            or outside the prison by a person who is under the sentence of life
                            imprisonment. A standardized mandatory sentence, and that too in the
                            form of a sentence of death, fails to take into account the facts and
                            circumstances of each particular case. It is those facts and
                            circumstances which constitute a safe guideline for determining the
                            question of sentence in each individual case. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25.    … Section 303 [of the Indian Penal
                            Code] excludes judicial discretion. The scales of justice are removed
                            from the hands of the Judge so soon as he pronounces the accused guilty
                            of the offence. So final, so irrevocable and so irrestitutable is the
                            sentence of death that no law which provides for it without involvement
                            of the judicial mind can be said to be fair, just and reasonable. Such a
                            law must necessarily be stigmatised as arbitrary and oppressive.
                            Section 303 is such a law and it must go the way of all bad laws.
                            …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Mr Ravi has referred to [12] of <em>Mithu</em> in his submissions, but not to [16] and [25] of that
                    judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In addition to the Appellant’s
                    Art 9(1) cases, Mr Ravi has also relied on the opinions of two experts
                    on international human rights law to contend that the MDP is an inhuman
                    punishment. The first of these experts is Ms Asma Jilani Jahangir
                    (“Ms Jahangir”), Special Rapporteur of the UN Commission on
                    Human Rights on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions (from August 1998
                    to July 2004), who, in her report to the UN General Assembly, expressed the view
                    that “the death penalty should <em>under no
                        circumstances</em> be mandatory, regardless of the charges
                    involved” [emphasis added] (see <em>Interim Report of the
                        Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on Extrajudicial,
                        Summary or Arbitrary Executions</em>, UN Doc A/55/288
                    (11 August 2000) at para 34). The second of the abovesaid experts is
                    Mr Philip Alston (“Mr Alston”), the current Special
                    Rapporteur of the UN Commission on Human Rights on extrajudicial, summary or
                    arbitrary executions. In a critique of the decision in <em>Nguyen</em> (see “Expert on arbitrary executions calls on
                    Singapore Government not to carry out mandatory death sentence”
                    (15 November 2005)), Mr Alston expressed the view that, in <em>Nguyen</em>, this court failed to examine <em>Boyce</em>, where the dissenting members of the Privy Council
                        (<em>viz</em>, Lord Bingham, Lord Nicholls of
                    Birkenhead, Lord Steyn and Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe) accepted the
                    submission (at [81]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No international human rights tribunal anywhere in the world has ever
                        found a mandatory death penalty regime compatible with international human
                        rights norms …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Mr Ravi argues that in view of the
                        post-<em>Ong Ah Chuan</em> and/or post-<em>Nguyen</em> decisions from other Commonwealth jurisdictions
                    condemning the MDP as an inhuman punishment, coupled with the opinions of
                    Ms Jahangir and Mr Alston as mentioned in the preceding paragraph,
                    this court should declare that Art 9(1) of the Singapore Constitution
                    prohibits the MDP.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Prosecution’s response</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In response to Mr Ravi’s submission
                    that the MDP is an inhuman punishment and that MDP legislation is therefore not
                    “law” for the purposes of Art 9(1), the then
                    Attorney-General, Prof Walter Woon SC (“the AG”),
                    who appeared in his capacity as the Public Prosecutor, has pointed out that the
                    Privy Council in <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em> and this court in
                        <em>Nguyen</em> decided otherwise. The AG submits that
                    the position laid down in <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em> and
                        <em>Nguyen</em> holds good, and that the Privy
                    Council’s decisions in post-<em>Ong Ah Chuan</em>
                    and/or post-<em>Nguyen</em> cases should not be followed
                    because the Privy Council does not dictate human rights standards for the rest
                    of humanity.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties’ arguments on the “contrary to CIL”
                limb</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Appellant’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Turning now to the “contrary to
                    CIL” limb of the Article 9(1) challenge, Mr Ravi’s
                    submission is that CIL is part of the expression “law” in
                    Art 9(1). It should be noted that Mr Ravi has not cited any authority
                    for this proposition, although, with regard to the contention that there is a
                    CIL rule prohibiting the MDP as an inhuman punishment, he has pointed to the
                    fact that there are a diminishing number of States which still retain the MDP
                    for drug-related offences. According to Mr Ravi, at last count, only 14
                    States still retain the MDP for such offences (<em>cf</em>
                    the figure given by the AG as to the number of States which still retain the MDP
                    for drug-related <em>and other</em> serious offences (see
                        <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a> below)). This, Mr Ravi
                    asserts, demonstrates the existence of a CIL prohibition against the MDP as an
                    inhuman punishment. In our view, Mr Ravi’s argument is not devoid of
                    merit, but it does not explain why the expression “law” in
                    Art 9(1) should be interpreted to include CIL, in particular, the CIL rule
                    prohibiting inhuman punishment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Prosecution’s response</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In response to the Appellant’s argument
                    that the word “law” in Art 9(1) includes CIL, the AG has
                    submitted that there are two possible interpretations of this word: the first is
                    that it refers only to statutes and the common law as applied in Singapore; the
                    second is that it also includes CIL in addition to statutes and the common law
                    as applied locally. When asked to clarify his position as to which was the
                    preferred interpretation, the AG said that, in principle, the expression
                    “law” should be interpreted to include CIL. We do not think that
                    the AG, by this reply, was conceding that the expression “law” in
                    Art 9(1) includes CIL in the sense that “law” has been
                    defined to include CIL, with the consequence that, once it is shown that there
                    is a rule of CIL prohibiting the MDP as an inhuman punishment, that CIL rule
                    automatically becomes part of “law” for the purposes of
                    Art 9(1). Indeed, the constitutional definition of “law” in
                    Art 2(1) is quite different (see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>
                    above). Besides, such a concession would be contrary to the decision in
                        <em>Nguyen</em>, where this court held at [94], citing
                        (<em>inter alia</em>) the Privy Council case of
                        <em>Chung Chi Cheung v The King</em>
                    [1939] AC 160 (“<em>Chung Chi
                    Cheung</em>”), that in the event of a conflict between a rule of
                    CIL and a domestic statute, the latter would prevail. From his other
                    submissions, it seems clear enough to us that what the AG meant when he said
                    that the expression “law” should be interpreted to include CIL was
                    that this expression would include a CIL rule which had already been recognised
                    and applied by a domestic court as part of Singapore law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The AG disagrees with Mr Ravi’s
                    contention that the MDP violates the CIL prohibition against inhuman punishment.
                    In this regard, the AG has submitted that the post-<em>Ong Ah
                        Chuan</em> and/or post-<em>Nguyen</em> Privy
                    Council decisions cited by Mr Ravi (“the Privy Council cases
                    relating to Art 9(1)”) merely reflect a change in the Privy
                    Council’s attitude towards the MDP and, like the rest of the
                    Appellant’s Art 9(1) cases, do not reflect an international consensus
                    that the MDP is prohibited as a rule of CIL. The AG has also pointed out that
                    since there are 31 States which continue to impose the MDP for drug-related and
                    other serious offences, the widespread state practice and the <em>opinio juris sive necessitatis</em> (“<em>opinio juris</em>”) necessary to establish the prohibition of
                    that penalty as a rule of CIL are lacking.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our decision on the Article 9(1) challenge</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The “inhuman punishment” limb</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     We shall first consider the “inhuman
                    punishment” limb of the Article 9(1) challenge, which rests on the
                    premise that the expression “law” in Art 9(1) should be
                    interpreted as excluding MDP legislation because such legislation lays down an
                    inhuman punishment (<em>viz</em>, the MDP).
                    Article 9(1), which we set out earlier at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above and which we reproduce again below for ease of
                    reference, provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in
                        accordance with law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In view of the wording of Art 9(1), the
                    key issue in the Article 9(1) challenge is whether the MDP deprives a
                    person of his life “in accordance with law”. This, in turn, raises
                    the question of what the word “law” as used in Art 9(1) means
                    (in this regard, see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>–<a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above, where we set out our local
                    jurisprudence on the meaning of “law” in Art 9(1)).
                    Mr Ravi accepts (in keeping with the case law which he has referred to)
                    that any law (<em>ie</em>, any common law rule or any
                    legislation properly enacted by the Legislature) that provides for the death
                    penalty as a form of punishment is, <em>prima facie</em>,
                    “law” for the purposes of Art 9(1). Hence, he accepts –
                    correctly – that the death penalty <em>per se</em>
                    does not violate Art 9(1) (in this regard, see also <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above). What he argues (in reliance on the Appellant’s
                    Art 9(1) cases as defined at <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a>
                    above) is, instead, that <em>MDP</em> legislation violates
                    Art 9(1) because such legislation prescribes an inhuman punishment
                        (<em>ie</em>, the MDP) for an offence. As alluded to at
                        <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above, Mr Ravi’s
                    contention is that it is the taking away of judicial discretion as to whether or
                    not to impose the death penalty which makes the MDP an inhuman punishment as
                    each offender is then treated in the same way as any other offender convicted of
                    the same offence, regardless of the circumstances in which he committed the
                    offence and, thus, regardless of his personal culpability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Significantly, all of the Appellant’s
                    Art 9(1) cases concern the offence of murder, unlike the offence in issue
                    in this appeal, which is the offence of drug trafficking. Hence, the rationale
                    underlying those cases has no direct application to the present appeal. In this
                    regard, it is pertinent to note the following comments made by Lord Diplock
                    in <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em> at 674 (these comments, although
                    made in relation to Art 12(1), are also relevant to the present discussion
                    on Art 9(1)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Wherever a criminal law provides for a mandatory sentence for an offence
                        there is a possibility that there may be considerable variation in moral
                        blameworthiness, despite the similarity in legal guilt of offenders upon
                        whom the same mandatory sentence must be passed. In the case of murder, a
                        crime that is often committed in the heat of passion, the likelihood of this
                        is very real; <em>it is perhaps more theoretical than real in
                            the case of large scale trafficking in drugs, a crime [for] which the
                            motive is cold calculated greed</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     With regard to the offence of drug
                    trafficking, what is an appropriate threshold of culpability for imposing the
                    MDP is, in our view, really a matter of policy, and it is for Parliament to
                    decide, having regard to public interest requirements, how the scale of
                    punishment ought to be calibrated. This is <em>par
                        excellence</em> a policy issue for the Legislature and/or the
                    Executive, and not a judicial issue for the Judiciary. The MDA does not
                    recognise any gradations in culpability in drug trafficking offences except in
                    terms of the amount of controlled drugs trafficked. In this regard, it is a
                    matter of common sense that the larger the amount trafficked, the greater the
                    likelihood of harm done to society. Accordingly, even if the Appellant’s
                    Art 9(1) cases bear out the conclusion that the MDP is an inhuman
                    punishment when it is prescribed as the punishment for murder, it does not
                    necessarily follow that the MDP, when prescribed as the punishment for drug
                    trafficking, is likewise an inhuman punishment. In any event, whatever might be
                    the merits of the argument (based on the Appellant’s Art 9(1) cases)
                    that the MDP imposed for the offence of murder is an inhuman punishment and is
                    thus unconstitutional, this argument has been foreclosed by constitutional
                    developments in Singapore (see <a href="#p1_61">[61]</a>–<a href="#p1_72">[72]</a>
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     It should also be noted that the
                    Appellant’s Art 9(1) cases (leaving aside <em>Mithu</em>) were decided in a different <em>textual</em> context. All of those cases (save for <em>Mithu</em>) involved Constitutions which <em>expressly</em> prohibited inhuman punishment. The key issue in those
                    cases was thus interpretative in nature, <em>ie</em>: in
                    relation to the constitutional prohibition against inhuman punishment, was the
                    MDP an inhuman punishment? The decisions in the Appellant’s Art 9(1)
                    cases (apart from <em>Mithu</em>) are therefore technically
                    decisions on the question of what kind of punishment would constitute inhuman
                    punishment and, strictly speaking, are <em>not</em>
                    relevant to the meaning of the expression “law” in Art 9(1)
                    of the Singapore Constitution. Hence, these cases are not direct authority on
                    the question of whether the MDP provisions in the MDA constitute
                    “law” for the purposes of Art 9(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     That the Appellant’s Art 9(1) cases
                    (other than <em>Mithu</em>) concern interpretative issues
                    can be seen from the following comments by Lord Bingham in <em>Reyes</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    In a modern liberal democracy it is ordinarily the
                            task of the democratically elected legislature to decide what conduct
                            should be treated as criminal, so as to attract penal consequences, and
                            to decide what kind and measure of punishment such conduct should
                            attract or be liable to attract. The prevention of crime, often very
                            serious crime, is a matter of acute concern in many countries around the
                            world, and prescribing the bounds of punishment is an important task of
                            those elected to represent the people. <em>The ordinary
                                task of the courts is to give full and fair effect to the penal laws
                                which the legislature has enacted. This is sometimes described as
                                deference shown by the courts to the will of the
                                democratically-elected legislature. But it is perhaps more aptly
                                described as the basic constitutional duty of the courts which, in
                                relation to enacted law, is to interpret and apply
                            it</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    
              <em>When (as here) an enacted law is
                                said to be incompatible with a right protected by a Constitution,
                                the court’s duty remains one of interpretation</em>. If
                            there is an issue (as here there is not) about the meaning of the
                            enacted law, the court must first resolve that issue. Having done so it
                            must interpret the Constitution to decide whether the enacted law is
                            incompatible or not. … As in the case of any other instrument,
                            the court must begin its task of constitutional interpretation by
                            carefully considering the language used in the Constitution. But it does
                            not treat the language of the Constitution as if it were found in a will
                            or a deed or a charterparty. A generous and purposive interpretation is
                            to be given to constitutional provisions protecting human rights.
                                <em>The court has no licence to read its own
                                predilections and moral values into the Constitution, but it is
                                required to consider the substance of the fundamental right at issue
                                and ensure contemporary protection of that right in the light of
                                evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing
                                society …</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In this appeal, Mr Ravi is arguing that,
                    as a matter of interpretation, Art 9(1) of the Singapore Constitution
                    should be read as incorporating some form of prohibition against inhuman
                    punishment similar to the prohibition expressed in the various Constitutions at
                    issue in the Appellant’s Art 9(1) cases (apart from <em>Mithu</em>). In other words, what Mr Ravi is seeking to
                    argue is that the expression “law” in Art 9(1) <em>excludes</em> a law that provides for an inhuman punishment.
                    We must emphasise that Mr Ravi is not arguing that Art 9(1) <em>expressly</em> prohibits inhuman punishment. He cannot make
                    that argument on the face of Art 9(1) without asking the court to (in
                    effect) legislate those words into Art 9(1). What he is arguing, instead,
                    is that Art 9(1) should be interpreted generously to prohibit a law that
                    prescribes an inhuman punishment because human values have changed and legal
                    norms should also change to reflect such changed human values.
                    Mr Ravi’s argument, really, is that the world has changed and so have
                    the civilised norms of humanity, with the result that the MDP is no longer
                    acceptable, and, thus, this court should depart from <em>Ong Ah
                        Chuan</em> and <em>Nguyen</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Indeed, Mr Ravi has argued that the world
                    had already changed by the time <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em> was
                    decided in 1980, with the MDP being widely recognised by then as an inhuman
                    punishment which was not “in accordance with law” for the purposes
                    of Art 9(1), but the Privy Council in <em>Ong Ah
                        Chuan</em> failed to recognise or understand this. In this connection,
                    Mr Ravi has referred to <em>Bowe</em>, where the Privy
                    Council held that the Bahamian courts had made a similar mistake in failing to
                    recognise, prior to the coming into force of the 1973 Constitution of the
                    Bahamas, the incompatibility of the MDP with the constitutional prohibition
                    against (<em>inter alia</em>) inhuman punishment (this
                    prohibition was first set out in s 3 of the 1963 Constitution of the
                    Bahamas; it was subsequently reproduced as, respectively, s 3 of the 1969
                    Constitution of the Bahamas and s 17 of the 1973 Constitution of the
                    Bahamas). Lord Bingham said (at <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is … clear that it took some time for the legal effect of
                        entrenched human rights guarantees to be appreciated, not because the
                        meaning of the rights changed but because the jurisprudence on human rights
                        and constitutional adjudication was unfamiliar and, by some courts,
                        resisted. The task of the court today is not to conduct a factual inquiry
                        into the likely outcome had the present challenge been presented on the eve
                        of the 1973 Constitution [when the 1969 Constitution of the Bahamas was
                        still in force]. That would be an inappropriate exercise for any court to
                        adopt, perhaps turning on personalities and judicial propensities. The task
                        is to ascertain what the law, correctly understood, was at the relevant
                        time, unaffected by later legal developments, since that is plainly the law
                        which should have been declared had the challenge been presented then. As it
                        is, all the building blocks of a correct constitutional exposition were in
                        place well before 1973. It matters little what lawyers and judges might have
                        thought in their own minds: in the context of a codified Constitution, what
                        matters is what the Constitution says and what it has been interpreted to
                        mean. In 1973 there was no good authority contrary to the appellants’
                        argument [<em>viz</em>, that the MDP was an inhuman
                        punishment and thus contravened the constitutional prohibition against such
                        punishment], and much to support it. In the final resort, the most important
                        consideration is that those who are entitled to the protection of human
                        rights guarantees should enjoy that protection. The appellants should not be
                        denied such protection because, a quarter century before they were condemned
                        to death, the law was not fully understood.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     We do not accept Mr Ravi’s
                    criticism of <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em>. There may be good
                    reasons why Lord Bingham held in <em>Bowe</em> that
                    the Bahamian courts had made the mistake outlined in the preceding paragraph (we
                    should add that his Lordship’s holding was based on the constitutional
                    development of the Bahamas from colonial times until the Bahamas became an
                    independent State in 1973 (see [13]–[21] of <em>Bowe</em>)). But, where the Singapore Constitution is concerned,
                    Mr Ravi’s criticism of <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em>
                    borders on the fanciful as it suggests <em>incorrectly</em>
                    that: (a) Lord Diplock did not understand the nature of the MDP and
                    thus failed to recognise it as an inhuman punishment (when his Lordship had
                    specifically said (at 673 of <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em>) that
                    there was nothing unusual about a capital sentence being mandatory and that the
                    efficacy of a capital sentence as a deterrent might to some extent be diminished
                    if it were not mandatory); and (b) our courts (in post-<em>Ong Ah Chuan</em> decisions) did not understand the term
                    “law” as interpreted by the Privy Council in <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Mr Ravi has made much of the Privy
                    Council cases relating to Art 9(1) (as defined at <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a> above) in attempting to buttress his case that
                    Art 9(1) should be read as prohibiting inhuman punishment, including the
                    MDP. His argument implies that even though there is no express prohibition
                    against inhuman punishment in the Singapore Constitution, it does not follow
                    that Art 9(1), which sets out the right to life, cannot be interpreted as
                    prohibiting such punishment. In this regard, Mr Ravi points to <em>Reyes</em>, where the Privy Council stated that, given its
                    decision that the MDP provided for under s 102(1) of the Belize Criminal
                    Code <em>vis-à-vis</em> the offence of
                    “class A” murder violated s 7 of the Belize
                    Constitution, it was unnecessary to analyse the compatibility of that provision
                    with ss 3 and 4 of the Belize Constitution (apropos the right to life), but
                    “[that] should not … be taken as a rejection of the
                    defendant’s arguments based on those sections” (at [48]). Another
                    case which Mr Ravi has relied on is <em>Matthew</em>,
                    where the Privy Council, although focusing its analysis on the issue of whether
                    the MDP was cruel and unusual punishment and, thus, inconsistent with the
                    prohibition against such punishment in s 5(2)(b) of the Constitution of
                    Trinidad and Tobago, also stated (in addition to finding that the MDP was
                    inconsistent with that constitutional provision) that the MDP was inconsistent
                    with s 4(a) of the Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago (which sets out
                    “the right of the individual to life, liberty, security of the person and
                    enjoyment of property and the right not to be deprived thereof except by
                        <em>due process of law</em>” [emphasis
                    added]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Mr Ravi has further submitted that
                    international human rights norms are relevant in interpreting the Singapore
                    Constitution as our courts, to the extent that is permitted by the language of
                    the Singapore Constitution, will be slow to interpret constitutional provisions
                    as being inconsistent with Singapore’s international legal obligations. In
                    this regard, Mr Ravi argues that, even though the Singapore Constitution
                    does not expressly prohibit inhuman punishment, this court should, following the
                    path made on Caribbean soil by the Privy Council in cases such as <em>Reyes</em> and <em>Matthew</em>,
                    likewise read the moral bases of human rights – which include the right to
                    be protected from inhuman punishment – into the expression
                    “law” in Art 9(1). This right (<em>ie</em>, the right to be protected from inhuman punishment),
                    Mr Ravi emphasises, is recognised in, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, Art 5 of the UDHR, which provides that “[n]o
                    one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
                    punishment”, and Art 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights
                    (4 November 1950), 213 UNTS 221 (“the ECHR”), which
                    provides that “[n]o one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or
                    degrading treatment or punishment”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In his book <em>The Idea of
                        Justice</em> (Allen Lane, 2009), Prof Amartya Sen
                    (“Prof Sen”) points out (at p 359):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The framers of the [UDHR] in 1948 clearly hoped that the articulated
                        recognition of human rights would serve as a kind of a template for new laws
                        that would be enacted to legalize those human rights across the world. The
                        focus was on fresh legislation, and not just on more humane interpretation
                        of existing legal protections.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In this regard, Prof Sen agrees (at
                    p 363) with Herbert Hart’s view that moral rights (which would
                    include human rights) should be seen as “<em>parents of
                        law</em>” [emphasis in original] –
                    <em>ie</em>, as motivators of specific legislation –
                    rather than as “child[ren] of law” (see, likewise, p 363),
                    which was Jeremy Bentham’s view. This observation has resonance in the
                    following comments by Lord Bingham in <em>Reyes</em>
                    at [27]–[28] (although it should be noted that his Lordship’s
                    comments were made for a different purpose):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27    In considering what norms have been accepted by
                            Belize as consistent with the fundamental standards of humanity, it is
                            relevant to take into account the international instruments
                            incorporating such norms to which Belize has subscribed … By
                            becoming a member of the Organisation of American States Belize
                            proclaimed its adherence to rights which, although not listed in the
                            Charter of the Organisation, are expressed in the Declaration [<em>ie</em>, the American Declaration of the Rights and
                            Duties of Man adopted in 1948 at the Ninth International Conference of
                            American States]. With some differences of wording, all these
                            instruments prohibit “cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
                            punishment”, words equivalent in meaning to those used in this
                            Constitution [<em>ie</em>, the Belize
                            Constitution]. As more fully discussed below, the requirement of
                            humanity has been read as incorporating the precept that consideration
                            of the culpability of the offender and of any potentially mitigating
                            circumstances of the offence and the individual offender should be
                            regarded as a sine qua non of the humane imposition of capital
                            punishment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    In interpreting the Constitution of Belize it is
                            also relevant to recall that for 28 years preceding independence the

                            measure incorporated into Part II of the [Belize] Constitution
                            … [But this] does not mean that in interpreting the Constitution
                            of Belize effect need be given to treaties not incorporated into the
                            domestic law of Belize or non-binding recommendations or opinions made
                            or given by foreign courts or human rights bodies. <em>It
                                is open to the people of any country to lay down the rules by which

                            bound to give effect in their Constitution to norms and standards
                            accepted elsewhere, perhaps in very different societies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     We agree that domestic law, including the
                    Singapore Constitution, should, as far as possible, be interpreted consistently
                    with Singapore’s international legal obligations. There are, however,
                    inherent limits on the extent to which our courts may refer to international
                    human rights norms for this purpose. For instance, reference to international
                    human rights norms would not be appropriate where the express wording of the
                    Singapore Constitution is not amenable to the incorporation of the international
                    norms in question, or where Singapore’s constitutional history is such as
                    to militate against the incorporation of those international norms (in this
                    regard, see further <a href="#p1_61">[61]</a>–<a href="#p1_72">[72]</a> below). In such circumstances, in order for
                    our courts to give full effect to international human rights norms, it would be
                    necessary for Parliament to first enact new laws (as the drafters of the UDHR
                    hoped States would do) or even amend the Singapore Constitution to expressly
                    provide for rights which have not already been incorporated therein. Both of
                    these measures are, as Lord Bingham observed in <em>Reyes</em> at [28] (reproduced in the preceding paragraph), well
                    within the prerogative of a sovereign State. In short, the point which we seek
                    to make is this: where our courts have reached the limits on the extent to which
                    they may properly have regard to international human rights norms in
                    interpreting the Singapore Constitution, it would not be appropriate for them to
                    legislate new rights into the Singapore Constitution under the guise of
                    interpreting existing constitutional provisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Where the Singapore Constitution is concerned,
                    we are of the view that it is not possible to incorporate a prohibition against
                    inhuman punishment through the interpretation of existing constitutional
                    provisions (in this case, Art 9(1)) for two reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     First, unlike the Constitutions of the
                    Caribbean States, the Singapore Constitution does not contain any express
                    prohibition against inhuman punishment. Our constitutional history is quite
                    different from that of the Caribbean States. Belize and the other Caribbean
                    States modelled their Constitutions after the ECHR, whereas the Singapore
                    Constitution – specifically, Pt IV thereof on fundamental liberties
                    – was derived (albeit with significant modifications) from Pt II of
                    the 1957 Constitution of the Federation of Malaya (“the 1957 Malayan
                    Constitution”), which formed the basis of what we shall hereafter refer
                    to as “the 1963 Malaysian Constitution” (<em>viz</em>, the Constitution of Malaysia that came into effect when
                    Malaysia (comprising the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak) was
                    formed on 16 September 1963). It is a little known legal fact that the ECHR
                    was made applicable to Singapore and the Federation of Malaya in 1953 just as it
                    was made applicable to Belize and several other British colonies by virtue of
                    the UK’s declaration under Art 63 of the ECHR (see Karel Vasak,
                    “The European Convention of Human Rights Beyond the Frontiers of
                    Europe” (1963) 12 ICLQ 1206 at p 1210). The ECHR ceased to
                    apply in the respective British colonies upon their independence (in the case of
                    Singapore, the ECHR ceased to apply when we became a constituent State of
                    Malaysia in 1963), but Belize and many other former British colonies (especially
                    those in the Caribbean) modelled their Constitutions after the ECHR. As a
                    result, the Constitutions of these countries included a prohibition against
                    inhuman punishment. This was not the case for either Malaysia or
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     When the 1957 Malayan Constitution was drafted
                    (pursuant to advice from the Federation of Malaya Constitutional Commission
                    chaired by Lord Reid (“the Reid Commission”)), no reference
                    was made to a prohibition against inhuman punishment in any provision of the
                    draft Constitution; <em>ie</em>, the Reid Commission did
                    not recommend the incorporation of such a prohibition. Given that the Reid
                    Commission’s report (<em>viz</em>, <em>Report of the Federation of Malaya Constitutional Commission
                        1957</em> (11 February 1957)) was published in 1957 when the
                    prohibition against inhuman punishment already existed in the ECHR (which
                    applied to the Federation of Malaya prior to its independence), the omission of
                    a similar prohibition from the 1957 Malayan Constitution was clearly not due to
                    ignorance or oversight on the part of the Reid Commission. The prohibition
                    against inhuman punishment was likewise omitted from the 1963 Malaysian
                    Constitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     When Singapore separated from Malaysia and
                    became an independent sovereign republic on 9 August 1965, we inherited a
                    state Constitution (<em>ie</em>, the Constitution of the
                    State of Singapore set out in Schedule 3 to the Sabah, Sarawak and
                    Singapore (State Constitutions) Order in Council 1963 (GN No S1 of 1963))
                    and many provisions of the 1963 Malaysian Constitution, including (<em>inter alia</em>) the provisions on fundamental liberties that
                    are now Arts 9–16 in Pt IV of the Singapore Constitution. As a
                    result of the aforesaid developments in our constitutional history, the
                    Singapore Constitution, unlike many other Commonwealth Constitutions, is not
                    modelled after the ECHR and does not contain an express prohibition against
                    inhuman punishment. This weakens Mr Ravi’s contention that the
                    Singapore Constitution should be read as incorporating an implied prohibition to
                    this effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The second and more important reason why it is
                    not possible to interpret the Singapore Constitution as incorporating a
                    prohibition against inhuman punishment is that a proposal to add an <em>express</em> constitutional provision to this effect was made
                    to the Government in 1966 by the constitutional commission chaired by Wee Chong
                    Jin CJ (“the Wee Commission”), but that proposal was
                    ultimately rejected by the Government. The Wee Commission was appointed to look
                    into (among other things) the protection of minority rights in Singapore after
                    we became an independent sovereign republic. To this end, the Wee Commission
                    studied the constitutional texts of some 40 different British colonies and
                    dominions and newly independent nations as well as non-Commonwealth
                    Constitutions (see <em>Evolution of a Revolution: Forty years of
                        the Singapore Constitution</em> (Li-ann Thio &amp;
                    Kevin Y L Tan eds) (Routledge Cavendish, 2009) at
                    pp 11–12), and, in its written report (<em>viz</em>, <em>Report of the Constitutional Commission
                        1966</em> (27 August 1966) (“the 1966 Report”)),
                    went out of its way to recommend, <em>inter alia</em>, the
                    inclusion of a constitutional provision prohibiting torture or inhuman
                    punishment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The Wee Commission gave the following reasons
                    for its recommendation (see the 1966 Report at para 40):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In looking at other written Constitutions[,] we find a
                            <em>fundamental human right</em> which is
                        acknowledged and protected in all of them but which is not written into the
                        Constitution of Malaysia [<em>ie</em>, the 1963
                        Malaysian Constitution, certain provisions of which continued in force in
                        Singapore after 9 August 1965 by virtue of the Republic of Singapore
                        Independence Act 1965 (Act 9 of 1965)]. This is the right of every
                        individual not to be subjected to torture or inhuman treatment. We think it
                        is beneficial if this right is written into the Constitution of Singapore as
                        a fundamental right and accordingly we recommend a new Article as
                        follows —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“13.—(1) <em>No person shall be
                                subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading punishment or other
                                treatment</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(2)    Nothing contained in or done under the
                                authority of any law shall be held to be inconsistent with or in
                                contravention of this Article to the extent that the law in question
                                authorises the infliction of any punishment or the administration of
                                any treatment that was lawful immediately before the coming into
                                force of this Article.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">For convenience, we shall hereafter refer to the new Article proposed
                    by the Wee Commission as “the proposed Art 13”, and to the
                    two subsections of this proposed Article as, respectively, “the proposed
                    Art 13(1)” and “the proposed
                Art 13(2)”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Three things may be noted about the proposed
                    Art 13. The first is that the proposed Art 13(1) is effectively word
                    for word the same as both Art 3 of the ECHR and s 7 of the Belize
                    Constitution (which was the subject matter of the decision in <em>Reyes</em>). The second is that the proposed Art 13(1) and the
                    proposed Art 13(2) are <em>in pari materia</em> with:
                    (a) ss 15(1) and 15(2) respectively of the Constitution of Barbados
                    (which provisions were commented on by the Privy Council in <em>Boyce</em> at, <em>inter alia</em>, [28]); and
                    (b) ss 17(1) and 17(2) respectively of the Constitution of Jamaica
                    (which Constitution was construed in <em>Pratt</em>, a
                    decision rejected by this court in <em>Jabar</em> (see
                        <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above)). Third, the proposed
                    Art 13(2), which is essentially a savings clause to preserve the validity
                    of <em>punishments</em> existing before the coming into
                    force of the proposed Art 13 (regardless of whether or not such punishments
                    are inhuman), is also substantially the same as para 10 of Schedule 2
                    to the Saint Lucia Constitution Order 1978 (SI 1978/1901) (“the
                    Saint Lucia savings clause”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The Saint Lucia savings clause reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Nothing contained in or done under the authority of any law shall be held
                        to be inconsistent with or in contravention of section 5 of the
                        Constitution [of Saint Lucia] to the extent that the law in question
                        authorises the infliction of any description of punishment that was lawful
                        in Saint Lucia immediately before 1 March 1967 (being the date on
                        which Saint Lucia became an associated state).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In <em>Hughes</em>, the
                    Privy Council held that the above clause was inadequate to save the MDP imposed
                    for murder under s 178 of the Criminal Code of Saint Lucia as revised
                    in 1992 (“Saint Lucia’s Criminal Code”) from
                    unconstitutionality (in terms of violating the constitutional prohibition
                    against inhuman punishment set out in s 5 of the Constitution of
                    Saint Lucia). The Privy Council, relying on the word
                    “authorises” (which is also used in the proposed Art 13(2)),
                    stated (at [47] of <em>Hughes</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]here is a world of difference between a law that <em>requires</em> a judge to impose the death penalty in all cases of
                        murder and a law that merely <em>authorises</em> him to
                        do so. More particularly, it is because the law requires, rather than merely
                        authorises, the judge to impose the death sentence that there is no room for
                        mitigation and no room for the consideration of the individual circumstances
                        of the defendant or of the murder. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Proceeding on this basis, the Privy Council held that s 178 of
                    Saint Lucia’s Criminal Code fell outside the scope of the
                    Saint Lucia savings clause “to the extent that it …
                    require[d] the infliction of the death penalty in all cases of murder”
                    (at [48]). In other words, the Saint Lucia savings clause saved only the
                    discretionary death penalty, but not the MDP.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Since the proposed Art 13 is not part of
                    the Singapore Constitution, the Privy Council’s decision in <em>Hughes</em>, which turned on the interpretation of the word
                    “authorises” in the Saint Lucia savings clause, is not
                    relevant in the present appeal. Nevertheless, we wish to add that, whatever the
                    legislative intent of the Saint Lucia savings clause was, we find it
                    difficult to believe that when the Wee Commission raised the proposed
                    Art 13(2) for the Government’s consideration, it intended to exclude
                    from the protection of this provision all punishments “required”
                    by law, such as the MDP for murder, mandatory caning for other offences as well
                    as the various mandatory minimum punishments prescribed under the then existing
                    criminal statutes (for example, the Vandalism Act 1966 (Act 38 of 1966),
                    which came into force on 16 September 1966). It seems to us that the
                    converse was more likely, <em>ie</em>, the Wee Commission
                    intended the proposed Art 13(2) to prevent the raising of any argument that
                    any pre-existing lawful punishment of whatever nature would be in violation of
                    the proposed Art 13 (1) upon the proposed Art 13 taking
                    effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In this regard, we note that the word
                    “requires” was not used in the proposed Art 13(2). The word
                    used was, instead, “authorises”. It is an established principle of
                    interpretation that the meaning of a word is derived from the context in which
                    that word is used. The purpose of a savings clause in the nature of the proposed
                    Art 13(2) is clearly to save from possible unconstitutionality all existing
                    punishments that were lawful prior to the coming into effect of a new
                    constitutional right (such as that set out in the proposed Art 13(1)). If
                    the word “authorises” in such a savings clause is indeed intended
                    to exclude existing punishments that are “required” to be imposed
                        (<em>ie</em>, mandatory punishments such as the MDP),
                    it would be far easier to simply abrogate all those punishments so as to conform
                    to the new constitutional right in question, instead of leaving the
                    constitutional validity of those punishments in doubt until a court decides,
                    long after the event, which of the “required” punishments are
                    saved and which are not. It seems to us rather surprising that a punishment
                    which the court is “required” to impose for a particular offence
                        (<em>eg</em>, the MDP) can be construed as falling
                    outside the ambit of “authorised” punishments. This is because, if
                    the court is “required” to inflict a particular punishment, it is
                        <em>a fortiori</em> authorised to inflict that
                    punishment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Returning to the Wee Commission’s
                    recommendations as set out in the 1966 Report, the Government accepted many of
                    those recommendations in their entirety. There were other recommendations which
                    the Government agreed to in principle, but not with regard to the details; and
                    there were yet other recommendations which the Government found to be
                    unacceptable. In respect of the proposed Art 13, the Government accepted
                        <em>in principle</em> that no individual should be
                    subjected to torture, but it omitted any reference to protection from inhuman
                    punishment (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (21 December 1966) vol 25 at
                    cols 1052–1053) (Mr E W Barker, Minister for Law and
                    National Development)). Ultimately, the Government did not include the proposed
                    Art 13 in the amendments to the Singapore Constitution, and the
                    Constitution (Amendment) Act 1969 (Act 19 of 1969), which was passed to
                    give effect to provisions of the 1966 Report that the Government accepted,
                    provided for only the establishment of what is now the Presidential Council for
                    Minority Rights to, <em>inter alia</em>, serve as
                    “an additional check on … matters which might affect the
                    minorities” (see the 1966 Report at para 16).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The Government’s rejection of the
                    proposed Art 13 was unambiguous, whatever the reasons for such rejection
                    were. This development, in our view, forecloses Mr Ravi’s argument
                    that it is open to this court to interpret Art 9(1) of the Singapore
                    Constitution as incorporating a prohibition against inhuman punishment. We may
                    reasonably assume that the Wee Commission recommended the inclusion of the
                    proposed Art 13 in the Singapore Constitution because Art 9(1) did not
                    deal with the same subject matter as that of the proposed Art 13(1)
                        (<em>viz</em>, prohibition of inhuman punishment);
                    otherwise, Art 9(1) would have been redundant. The Government’s
                    rejection of the proposed Art 13(1) – the content of which forms the
                    basis of the ruling in the Privy Council cases relating to Art 9(1) that
                    the MDP is an inhuman punishment – makes it impossible for the Appellant
                    to now challenge the constitutionality of the MDP by relying on these Privy
                    Council cases. It is not legitimate for this court to read into Art 9(1) a
                    constitutional right which was decisively rejected by the Government in 1969,
                    especially given the historical context in which that right was rejected. We
                    therefore conclude that Mr Ravi’s proposed interpretation of
                    Art 9(1) as incorporating a prohibition against inhuman punishment is an
                    interpretation which our courts are barred from adopting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In this connection, we wish to highlight
                    Lord Bingham’s observation in <em>Reyes</em> at
                    [28] (quoted at <a href="#p1_58">[58]</a> above) that States are
                    not bound to give effect in their Constitutions to norms and standards accepted
                    elsewhere, perhaps in very different societies. It is also pertinent to refer to
                    the judgment of Lord Nicholls in <em>Matthew</em>,
                    where his Lordship said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">73    … If the requisite legislative support for a
                            change in the Constitution is forthcoming, a deliberate departure from
                            fundamental human rights may be made, profoundly regrettable although
                            this may be. That is the prerogative of the legislature.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">74    If departure from fundamental human rights is
                            desired, that is the way it should be done. The Constitution should be
                            amended explicitly. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     In our view, the reasoning of
                    Lord Nicholls in the above quotation is equally apt to apply to the
                    Government’s decision in 1969 to reject the proposed Art 13, with the
                    result that the right to freedom from inhuman punishment was not elevated to a
                    constitutional right. There is, in substance, no difference between <em>repealing</em> an existing constitutional provision
                    prohibiting inhuman punishment and <em>deliberately deciding not
                        to enact</em> such a constitutional provision in the first place. On
                    this ground alone, there is no legitimate basis for this court to now expand,
                    via an interpretative exercise, the scope of Art 9(1) so as to include a
                    prohibition against inhuman punishment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     This conclusion does not mean that, because
                    the proposed Art 13 included a prohibition against torture, an Act of
                    Parliament that permits torture can form part of “law” for the
                    purposes of Art 9(1). Currently, no domestic legislation permits torture.
                    In any case, torture is not the issue before us. All that is necessary is for us
                    to reiterate the Privy Council’s position in <em>Ong Ah
                        Chuan</em> (at 659 (quoted at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>
                    above)) that Art 9(1) does not justify all legislation, whatever its
                    nature. It also bears mention that the Government has expressed the view that
                    torture is wrong (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates,
                        Official Report</em> (29 July 1987) vol 49 at
                    cols 1491–1492 (Prof S Jayakumar, Minister for Home
                    Affairs)). This explicit recognition by the Government that torture is wrong in
                    the local context stands in sharp contrast to the absence of any statement on
                    its part (in the context of our national policy on combating drug trafficking in
                    Singapore) that the MDP is an inhuman punishment. In addition, torture, in so
                    far as it causes harm to the body with criminal intent, is already criminalised
                    under ch XVI of the Singapore Penal Code, which sets out the types of
                    offences affecting the human body.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     We shall now consider the Appellant’s
                    reliance on <em>Mithu</em> to support the contention that
                    Art 9(1) of the Singapore Constitution should be read as incorporating a
                    prohibition against inhuman punishment. Mr Ravi has submitted that, in
                        <em>Mithu</em>, the Supreme Court of India ruled that
                    the MDP was unconstitutional as it violated Arts 14 and 21 of the Indian
                    Constitution (<em>viz</em>, the Indian equivalent of,
                    respectively, Arts 12(1) and 9(1) of the Singapore
                Constitution).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Articles 14 and 21 of the Indian
                    Constitution read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>14</b>.    The State shall not
                            deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The issue in <em>Mithu</em> was whether
                    s 303 of the Indian Penal Code (which, as mentioned at <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a> above, lays down the MDP for the offence of
                    murder committed by a person whilst under a sentence of life imprisonment)
                    infringed these two Articles of the Indian Constitution. The Supreme Court of
                    India held that s 303 infringed Art 14 as there was no rational
                    justification for making a distinction between the punishment imposed on a
                    person who committed murder whilst under a sentence of life imprisonment and the
                    punishment imposed on a person who committed murder under other
                    circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     With regard to Art 21, the Indian Supreme
                    Court held that the phrase “procedure established by law” meant
                    “according to fair, just and reasonable procedure established by valid
                    law” (see <em>Mithu</em> at [6]). On this basis, the
                    Supreme Court held, further, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_78-p2_a"></a>(a)     it was harsh, unjust and unfair to
                        condemn a murderer to death without taking into account the circumstances in
                        which he committed the murder (at [12]); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_78-p2_b"></a>(b)     a provision which precluded the court from
                        exercising judicial discretion as to whether or not the MDP should be
                        imposed was arbitrary and oppressive (at [25]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In short,
                    what the Indian Supreme Court objected to in <em>Mithu</em>
                    was the fact that, under s 303 of the Indian Penal Code (at [25]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The scales of justice are removed from the hands of the Judge so soon as
                        he pronounces the accused guilty of the offence [and] … the sentence
                        of death … [is] provide[d] for … without involvement of the
                        judicial mind …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     In our view, there are three reasons why,
                    contrary to what Mr Ravi advocated, we cannot apply the reasoning in
                        <em>Mithu</em> to interpret Art 9(1) of the
                    Singapore Constitution as prohibiting inhuman punishment generally and the MDP
                    in particular. The first reason is that the test for the constitutional validity
                    of laws under Art 9(1) of the Singapore Constitution is different from the
                    test under Art 21 of the Indian Constitution. <em>Mithu</em> was not a case about inhuman punishment (<em>cf</em> the decisions in the rest of the Appellant’s
                    Art 9(1) cases), although Chandrachud CJ did say in his judgment (at
                    [6]) that “[a] savage sentence [was] anathema to the civilized
                    jurisprudence of Article 21” (in this regard, the learned Chief
                    Justice gave the example of cutting off the offender’s hands as a
                    punishment for theft). The issue before the court was not whether the MDP was
                    inhuman, but whether s 303 of the Indian Penal Code was procedurally
                    “fair, just and reasonable” (at [6]) when it “deprive[d]
                    the Court of the use of its wise and beneficent discretion in a matter of life
                    and death” (at [12]). What we now have to consider is whether this test
                    of fair, just and reasonable procedure employed by the Indian Supreme Court
                    (“the ‘fair, just and reasonable procedure’ test”) for
                    the purposes of determining the constitutional validity of laws under
                    Art 21 of the Indian Constitution is applicable in our local context to
                    Art 9(1) of the Singapore Constitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     As stated earlier (at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> and <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a> above),
                    Art 9(1) of the Singapore Constitution provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save <em>in accordance with law</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although the expression “law” may include substantive
                    law as well as procedural law, it does not follow that any procedural law must
                    be “fair, just and reasonable” (see <em>Mithu</em> at [6]) before it can constitute “law” for
                    the purposes of Art 9(1). Article 9(1) contains no such qualification;
                    nor can such a qualification be implied from its context or its wording. It must
                    also be noted that the Privy Council in <em>Ong Ah
                        Chuan</em> did not adopt the “fair, just and reasonable
                    procedure” test as the criterion for determining the constitutional
                    validity of laws under Art 9(1) (because that would have been too vague a
                    test of constitutionality). Such a test hinges on the court’s view of the
                    reasonableness of the law in question, and requires the court to intrude into
                    the legislative sphere of Parliament as well as engage in policy making. Thus,
                    in <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em>, the Privy Council only required,
                    for the purposes of Art 9(1), that any law depriving a person of his life
                    or personal liberty must be consistent with “fundamental principles of
                    natural justice” (at 670).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Our second reason for rejecting
                    Mr Ravi’s submissions on <em>Mithu</em> is that
                    the Indian Supreme Court in that case paid no regard to the overall context of
                    Art 21 of the Indian Constitution, which applies not only to deprivation of
                    life, but also deprivation of personal liberty. The court declared the MDP as
                    provided for under s 303 of the Indian Penal Code to be inconsistent with
                    Art 21 without reference to the context of that Article, which (as just
                    mentioned) also allows for derogation from the right to personal liberty. If the
                    objection to the MDP is the absence of judicial discretion to calibrate the
                    sentence according to the circumstances of the case, then all mandatory
                    sentences (and, indeed, all fixed minimum and maximum sentences prescribed by
                    the Legislature) will contravene Art 21. It may be that this is the law in
                    India. But, it is not the law in Singapore. In <em>Ong Ah
                        Chuan</em>, this was an extreme position which the appellants’
                    counsel refrained from taking (see <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em> at
                    673 (as reproduced at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above)).
                    Mr Ravi has also not taken this position before this court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     It may well be that the Indian Supreme Court
                    in <em>Mithu</em> considered that the death penalty was
                    qualitatively different from other punishments (a view also expressed by
                    Stewart J in <em>Woodson</em> at 305 (quoted at
                        <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a> above)), and, thus, a <em>different</em> standard must be adhered to in terms of the
                        <em>procedure</em> for imposing the death penalty. With
                    respect, we do not think this reasoning is applicable to Art 9(1) of the
                    Singapore Constitution. While we agree that it is beyond doubt that the death
                    penalty is qualitatively different from other lesser punishments, the relevant
                    question in this appeal is whether Parliament’s power to legislate for the
                    imposition of the death penalty as the <em>mandatory</em>
                    punishment for a serious offence is circumscribed because of this qualitative
                    difference. In our view, the plain wording of Art 9(1) does not support the
                    conclusion that Parliament cannot make the death penalty mandatory. We do not
                    think that we can give to Art 9(1) of the Singapore Constitution the same
                    expansive interpretation as that which the Indian Supreme Court has given to
                    Art 21 of the Indian Constitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Our third reason for not applying the
                    reasoning in <em>Mithu</em> to Art 9(1) of the
                    Singapore Constitution is that the Indian Supreme Court has given Art 21 of
                    the Indian Constitution pride of place in India’s constitutional
                    framework. The expansive interpretation of Art 21 was established
                    progressively in three cases, namely, <em>Smt Maneka Gandhi
                        v Union of India and another</em> AIR 1978 SC 597,
                        <em>Sunil Batra v Delhi Administration and others</em>
                    AIR 1978 SC 1675 and <em>Bachan Singh v State of
                        Punjab</em> AIR 1980 SC 898. The decision in <em>Mithu</em> is entirely understandable, having regard to the
                    economic, social and political conditions prevailing in India and the pro-active
                    approach of the Indian Supreme Court in matters relating to the social and
                    economic conditions of the people of India. In this regard, since its decision
                    in <em>Mithu</em>, the Indian Supreme Court has expanded
                    the scope of Art 21 even further to include numerous rights relating to
                    life, such as the right to education, the right to health and medical care and
                    the right to freedom from noise pollution (see generally <em>Shorter Constitution of India</em> (A R Lakshmanan
                        <em>et al</em> eds) (LexisNexis Butterworths Wadhwa
                    Nagpur, 14th Ed, 2009) at vol 1, pp 364–414).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     In our view, it is not possible for this court to interpret Art 9(1) of the Singapore Constitution in the same way that the Indian Supreme Court has interpreted Art 21 of the Indian Constitution. Although the right to life is the most basic of human rights, Art 9(1) of the Singapore Constitution expressly allows a person’s life to be taken away in accordance with law. The MDP is provided by law. With regard to the offence of murder, the MDP has been the punishment prescribed by our penal legislation since 14 March 1883, when what is now s 302 of the Singapore Penal Code was enacted via s 1 of the Penal Code Amendment Ordinance 1883 (Ordinance 2 of 1883) (“the Penal Code Amendment Ordinance”). The MDP was not abolished by the UK government during the period when the ECHR applied in Singapore (see <a href="#p1_61">[61]</a> above), and it survived under the 1963 Malaysian Constitution as well as the Singapore Constitution. The constitutional validity of the MDP was affirmed by the Privy Council in 1980 in <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em> and also by this court in 2004 in <em>Nguyen</em>. Since the latter decision, there has been no change in the legal matrix (including CIL (see <a href="#p1_87">[87]</a>–<a href="#p1_99">[99]</a> below)) that requires this court to give a different interpretation to the expression “law” in Art 9(1) and declare that MDP legislation is not “law” for the purposes of this provision. The development in human rights jurisprudence as manifested in the Privy Council cases relating to Art 9(1) is not relevant to the interpretation of Art 9(1) as those cases all concern the meaning of express constitutional prohibitions against inhuman punishment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     For the foregoing reasons, we reject
                    Mr Ravi’s submissions on <em>Mithu</em> and, in
                    turn, the Appellant’s argument on the “inhuman punishment”
                    limb of the Article 9(1) challenge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     We would add that, in so far as this limb of
                    the Article 9(1) challenge rests on the argument that the objectionable
                    element in MDP legislation is the absence of judicial discretion in imposing the
                    punishment prescribed by law (from the viewpoint that MDP legislation requires
                    the courts to impose the MDP in an arbitrary, absurd or mindless manner on
                    different offenders regardless of the different circumstances of each
                    offender’s case), it raises an issue which is, in essence, no different
                    from the question of whether MDP legislation is consistent with the right under
                    Art 12(1) of the Singapore Constitution, <em>ie</em>,
                    the right to equal protection of the law. In other words, Mr Ravi’s
                    objection to the MDP provisions in the MDA on the ground that these provisions
                    are arbitrary and thus inconsistent with Art 12(1) overlaps with the
                    objection based on Art 9(1) (<em>viz</em>, that
                    Art 9(1) does not sanction an arbitrary law that takes away an
                    individual’s life). In the context of Art 9(1), the argument is that
                    the MDP provisions in the MDA impose the MDP on convicted drug traffickers in so
                    arbitrary and absurd a manner that these provisions cannot constitute
                    “law”. In the context of Art 12(1), the argument is that the
                    MDP provisions in the MDA, which make the 15g differentia the only criterion, to
                    the exclusion of all other considerations, for determining whether or not the
                    MDP is to be imposed for trafficking in diamorphine, are arbitrary and thus do
                    not accord to convicted drug traffickers equal protection of the law. We shall
                    address this point below (at <a href="#p1_111">[111]</a>–<a href="#p1_119">[119]</a>) when we
                    consider the Article 12(1) challenge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The “contrary to CIL” limb</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     We now turn to the “contrary to
                    CIL” limb of the Article 9(1) challenge, which is based on the
                    proposition that CIL prohibits the MDP as an inhuman punishment and, because CIL
                    is “law” for the purposes of Art 9(1) of the Singapore
                    Constitution, the MDP is unconstitutional. This limb of the Article 9(1)
                    challenge is quite different from the “inhuman punishment” limb,
                    which centres on interpreting the expression “law” in
                    Art 9(1) to exclude any law providing for inhuman punishment. On his part,
                    the AG expressed his agreement that the expression “law” should be
                    given a liberal, rather than a restrictive, interpretation to include CIL (see
                        <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> above). However, as we pointed out
                    earlier (likewise at <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> above), we do not
                    think that the AG meant to agree that so long as it can be shown to the
                    satisfaction of the court that a particular rule has become part of CIL, that
                    rule automatically becomes “law” for the purposes of Art 9(1)
                    in the sense that it becomes part of Singapore law by operation of either the
                    common law or Art 9(1) itself. Be that as it may, even if the AG did agree
                    with Mr Ravi’s proposition that “law” in Art 9(1)
                    includes CIL, this court is free to reject this submission. As a general
                    principle, the court is not obliged to accept as the law what the parties agree
                    should be the law, even in a case such as the present, where one of the parties
                    concerned is the AG acting in his capacity as the Public Prosecutor. Thus, in
                    the present case, we can – and, indeed, must – still consider
                    whether the interpretation advanced by Mr Ravi (<em>viz</em>, that CIL is part of “law” for the purposes of
                    Art 9(1)) is an interpretation which is legally correct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Let us first consider the effect of the proposition that the expression “law” in Art 9(1) includes CIL. If this proposition were accepted, it would mean that any rule of CIL would be cloaked with constitutional status and would override any existing MDP legislation, such as s 302 of the Singapore Penal Code, which, as mentioned at <a href="#p1_84">[84]</a> above, can be traced back to 1883 (see s 1 of the Penal Code Amendment Ordinance).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Ordinarily, in common law jurisdictions, CIL
                    is incorporated into domestic law by the courts as part of the common law in so
                    far as it is not inconsistent with domestic rules which have been enacted by
                    statutes or finally declared by the courts. (A rule of CIL may, of course, also
                    be incorporated by statute, but, in that situation, the rule in question will
                    become part of domestic legislation and will be enforced as such; <em>ie</em>, it will no longer be treated as a rule of CIL.) The
                    classic exposition of the principle delineating when a CIL rule becomes part of
                    domestic common law is set out in the Privy Council case of <em>Chung Chi Cheung</em> (cited by this court in <em>Nguyen</em> at [94]), where Lord Atkin explained (at
                    167–168):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[S]o far, at any rate, as the Courts of this country are concerned,
                        international law has no validity save in so far as its principles are
                        accepted and adopted by our own domestic law. There is no external power
                        that imposes its rules upon our own code of substantive law or procedure.
                        The Courts acknowledge the existence of a body of rules which nations accept
                        amongst themselves. On any judicial issue they seek to ascertain what the
                        relevant rule is, and, having found it, they will treat it as incorporated
                        into the domestic law, so far as it is not inconsistent with rules enacted
                        by statutes or finally declared by their tribunals.</p>

                        Volume 1: Peace</em> (Robert Jennings &amp; Arthur Watts eds)

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The principle enunciated by Lord Atkin in
                        <em>Chung Chi Cheung</em> entails that, at common law,
                    a CIL rule must first be accepted and adopted as part of our domestic law before
                    it is valid in Singapore –
                    <em>ie</em>, a Singapore court would need to determine that
                    the CIL rule in question is consistent with “rules enacted by statutes or
                    finally declared by [our] tribunals” (<em>per</em>
                    Lord Atkin in <em>Chung Chi Cheung</em> at 168) and
                    either declare that rule to be part of Singapore law or apply it as part of our
                    law. Without such a declaration or such application, the CIL rule in question
                    would merely be floating in the air. Once that CIL rule has been incorporated by
                    our courts into our domestic law, it becomes part of the common law. The common
                    law is, however, subordinate to statute law. Hence, ordinarily, CIL which is
                    received via the common law is subordinate to statute law. If we accept
                    Mr Ravi’s submission that the expression “law” in
                    Art 9(1) includes CIL, the hierarchy of legal rules would be reversed: any
                    rule of CIL that is received via the common law would be cloaked with
                    constitutional status and would nullify any statute or any binding judicial
                    precedent which is inconsistent with it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     In our view, a rule of CIL is not
                    self-executing in the sense that it cannot become part of domestic law until and
                    unless it has been applied as or definitively declared to be part of domestic
                    law by a domestic court. The expression “law” is defined in
                    Art 2(1) to include the common law only “in so far as it is in
                    operation in Singapore”. It must therefore follow that until a Singapore
                    court has applied the CIL rule prohibiting the MDP as an inhuman punishment (if
                    such a rule exists) or has declared that rule as having legal effect locally,
                    that rule will not be in operation in Singapore. In the present case, given the
                    existence of the MDP in several of our statutes, our courts cannot treat the
                    alleged CIL rule prohibiting inhuman punishment as having been incorporated into
                    Singapore law, and, therefore, this alleged CIL rule would not be
                    “law” for the purposes of Art 9(1). We might add that (as
                    noted at <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> above), in <em>Nguyen</em>, this court held (at [94]) that in the event of any
                    conflict between a rule of CIL and a domestic statute, the latter would
                    prevail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     There is an even stronger reason why, even if
                    we accept that “law” in Art 9(1) includes CIL, the specific
                    CIL rule prohibiting the MDP as an inhuman punishment (assuming there is such a
                    rule) cannot be regarded as part of “law” for the purposes of this
                    provision. As mentioned earlier (at <a href="#p1_64">[64]</a>–<a href="#p1_65">[65]</a> and
                        <a href="#p1_71">[71]</a> above), the Wee Commission had in
                    1966 recommended adding a prohibition against inhuman punishment (in the form of
                    the proposed Art 13) to the Singapore Constitution, but that recommendation
                    was rejected by the Government. Given that the Government deliberated on but
                    consciously rejected this suggestion of incorporating into the Singapore
                    Constitution an express prohibition against <em>inhuman
                        punishment generally</em>, a CIL rule prohibiting such punishment
                    – let alone a CIL rule prohibiting <em>the MDP
                        specifically</em> as an inhuman punishment – cannot now be
                    treated as “law” for the purposes of Art 9(1). In other
                    words, given the historical development of the Singapore Constitution, it is not
                    possible for us to accept Mr Ravi’s submission on the meaning of the
                    expression “law” in Art 9(1) without acting as legislators in
                    the guise of interpreters of the Singapore Constitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     In any event, there is one other crucial
                    threshold which Mr Ravi must cross before he can make out a case that
                    “law” in Art 9(1) includes the CIL prohibition against the
                    MDP (assuming this prohibition does indeed exist), namely, he must show that the
                    content of the CIL rule prohibiting inhuman punishment is such as to prohibit
                    the MDP specifically. To this question, we now turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     In attempting to show that the prohibition
                    against the MDP has become part and parcel of the CIL rule prohibiting inhuman
                    punishment, Mr Ravi has relied on the following evidence:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_a"></a>(a)     first, the fact that only 14
                        countries in the world (<em>ie</em>, approximately 7%
                        of the countries in the world) still retain the MDP for drug-related
                        offences;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_b"></a>(b)     second, the plethora of decisions (including the Privy Council cases
                        relating to Art 9(1)) which hold the MDP to be an inhuman punishment;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_c"></a>(c)     third, the
                        opinions of Ms Jahangir and Mr Alston on the status of the MDP
                        (see <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">By
                    way of rebuttal, the AG has pointed out that there are in fact 31 States which
                    still retain the MDP for drug-related and other serious offences (see <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     In an extensive survey of the status of the
                    death penalty worldwide, Roger Hood and Carolyn Hoyle, the learned authors of
                        <em>The Death Penalty: A Worldwide Perspective</em>
                    (Oxford University Press, 4th Ed, 2008) (“<em>The
                        Death Penalty</em>”), make the following observations on the
                    MDP in relation to drug-related offences specifically (at
                    pp 137–138):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Many countries in Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa, and in a few
                        other parts of the world, have responded to international concern about the
                        growth of illicit trafficking in ‘dangerous’ drugs by
                        introducing the death penalty for both importation and ‘possession for
                        sale’ of certain amounts of such drugs, or by making the death penalty
                        mandatory for such offences where it was previously optional. According to a
                        survey in 1979, the death penalty could be imposed for drug trafficking in
                        10 countries. Just six years later, in 1985, a United Nations survey
                        revealed that such offences could, in certain circumstances, be punished by
                        death in 22 countries. By the end of 2006 the number was at least 31.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… A number of these countries have made the death penalty
                        mandatory, especially for recidivist drug offenders and trading on a large
                        scale. Others, such as Iran (1969), Thailand (1979), Singapore (1975 and
                        1989), and Malaysia (1983) have made capital punishment mandatory for
                        possession of even relatively small amounts. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The learned authors then continue as follows (at
                    pp 279–280):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The death penalty is still mandatory for some crimes in less than a third
                        (31) of the 95 retentionist and abolitionist <em>de
                            facto</em> countries that at present (December 2007) retain the
                        death penalty on their statute books, even if no persons have been, or are
                        very rarely, executed for them. Whilst it is usually only mandatory for
                        ‘capital murder’, it is still the only sentence available for
                        armed robbery in several African countries, including Kenya (ADF
                        [abolitionist <em>de facto</em>]), Nigeria, Tanzania
                        (ADF), and Zambia. Further, 12 of the 26 countries which introduced the
                        death penalty for producing, or trading in, illicit drugs have made it
                        mandatory on conviction of possessing quantities over certain prescribed
                        (and sometimes relatively modest) amounts. This is the case in Brunei
                        Darussalam (ADF), Egypt, Guyana (ADF), India, Iran, Jordan, Malaysia, Qatar,
                        Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Of the States referred to in the two passages
                    quoted above, the practice in India is inconclusive. Despite the Supreme Court
                    of India’s decision in <em>Mithu</em> (discussed at
                        <a href="#p1_76">[76]</a>–<a href="#p1_85">[85]</a> above) that s 303 of the Indian Penal Code was
                    unconstitutional, subsequent to that decision, the Indian legislature passed the
                    Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act 1985 (Act 61 of 1985)
                    (India) and the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of
                    Atrocities) Act 1989 (Act 33 of 1989) (India), both of which provide for
                    the MDP. Also, some of the other States referred to in the above extracts from
                        <em>The Death Penalty</em> are abolitionist <em>de facto</em>, which means that they retain the MDP on their
                    statute books, but in practice do not carry out that penalty. Leaving aside
                    those States and India, this still leaves a significant number of States which
                    impose, both in law and in practice, the MDP for drug-related and other serious
                    offences. As a result, although the majority of States in the international
                    community do not impose the MDP for drug trafficking, this does not make the
                    prohibition against the MDP a rule of CIL. Observance of a particular rule by a
                    majority of States is not equivalent to extensive and virtually uniform practice
                    by all States (see further <a href="#p1_98">[98]</a> below). The
                    latter, together with <em>opinio juris</em>, is what is
                    needed for the rule in question to become a rule of CIL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     As for the Privy Council cases relating to
                    Art 9(1) and the expert opinions of Ms Jahangir and Mr Alston,
                    they are relevant, but they are not in themselves sources of CIL. Instead, they
                    are a <em>subsidiary</em> means for determining the
                    existence or otherwise of rules of CIL. This well-established proposition is
                    encapsulated in Art 38(1)(d) of the Statute of the International Court of
                    Justice (26 June 1945), 33 UNTS 993
                    (“the ICJ Statute”), which provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    The Court, whose
                            function is to decide in accordance with international law such disputes

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">a.    international conventions, whether general or

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Hence, although “judicial decisions and
                    the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various
                    nations” (<em>per</em> Art 38(1)(d) of
                    the ICJ Statute) are relevant in determining the existence of rules of
                    CIL, they are relevant only as a subsidiary means for such determination (see
                    generally Andreas Zimmermann, Christian Tomuschat &amp; Karin Oellers-Frahm,
                        <em>The Statute of the International Court of Justice: A
                        Commentary</em> (Oxford University Press, 2006) at
                    paras 298–324). In the final analysis, as the International Court of
                    Justice observed in <em>Case Concerning the Continental Shelf
                        (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v Malta)</em> [1985] ICJ 13 at [27],
                    the substance of CIL “is to be looked for primarily in the actual
                    practice and <em>opinio juris</em> of States”. To
                    establish a rule of CIL, the state practice accompanying the <em>opinio juris</em> of States must be “both extensive and
                    virtually uniform” (see the seminal decision of the International Court
                    of Justice on CIL in <em>North Sea Continental Shelf Cases
                        (Federal Republic of Germany v Denmark; Federal Republic of Germany v
                        Netherlands)</em> [1969] ICJ 3 at [74]; see also <em>Case Concerning Right of Passage over Indian Territory (Portugal v
                        India)</em> [1960] ICJ 6 at 40 and <em>Asylum

                    276–277). As we stated above (at <a href="#p1_96">[96]</a>), there is a lack of extensive and virtually uniform state
                    practice to support Mr Ravi’s contention that CIL prohibits the MDP
                    as an inhuman punishment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     For these reasons, we are unable to accept
                    Mr Ravi’s contention that the content of the CIL rule prohibiting
                    inhuman punishment is such as to prohibit the MDP. In our view, there does not
                    presently exist a rule of CIL prohibiting the MDP as an inhuman punishment.
                    Accordingly, we also reject Mr Ravi’s arguments on the
                    “contrary to CIL” limb of the Article 9(1) challenge. The
                    Article 9(1) challenge therefore fails.</p>

<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em>, the Privy Council

                        a single class should be treated by way of punishment more harshly than
                        others; it does not forbid discrimination in punitive treatment between one
                        class of individuals and another class in relation to which there is some
                        difference in the circumstances of the offence that has been
                        committed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The questions whether [a] dissimilarity in circumstances
                        justifies any differentiation in the punishments imposed upon individuals
                        who fall within one class and those who fall within the other, and, if so,
                        what are the appropriate punishments for each class, are questions of social
                        policy. Under the [Singapore] Constitution, which is based on the separation
                        of powers, these are questions which it is the function of the legislature
                        to decide, not that of the judiciary. <em>Provided that the
                            factor which the legislature adopts as constituting the dissimilarity in

                            the social object of the law, there is no inconsistency with
                            article 12(1) of the [Singapore] Constitution</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    In relation to the specific drug trafficking
                    offence which the Appellant was charged with (<em>ie</em>,
                    the offence of trafficking in diamorphine), Mr Ravi has advanced six
                    arguments as to why the 15g differentia bears no reasonable connection to the
                    object of the MDA and is arbitrary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Mr Ravi’s first argument is that
                    the application of the 15g differentia entails that the death penalty is
                    mandatory for trafficking where the offender traffics in just slightly more than
                    15g of diamorphine (<em>eg</em>, 15.01g), but is
                    unavailable altogether where the offender traffics in just under 15g of
                    diamorphine (<em>eg</em>, 14.99g). This distinction, so
                    Mr Ravi submits, is illogical, and, even if there is a quantitative and
                    incremental increase in guilt or social mischief associated with trafficking in
                    an additional 0.02g of diamorphine (taking the example just outlined), it is
                    inappropriate for our sentencing regime to respond to this by a qualitative and
                    non-incremental increase in the penalty prescribed for the
                offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    The second argument advanced by Mr Ravi
                    is that the death penalty is also unavailable altogether where an offender has
                    multiple convictions for trafficking in less than 15g of diamorphine. In other
                    words, if the offender is convicted of two counts of trafficking in 14.99g of
                    diamorphine, the death penalty is unavailable even though the offender has
                    demonstrated a more conscious assumption of risk and greater imperviousness to
                    deterrence than a one-time offender who traffics in just slightly more than 15g
                    of diamorphine (and, as a result, faces the MDP).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Mr Ravi’s third argument is that
                    the MDP, which precludes the court from considering, for sentencing purposes,
                    the circumstances in which the offence came to be committed, denies the
                    Prosecution and the public the benefit of having information on the type of
                    offenders who are more likely to re-offend. This impedes the Legislature’s
                    determination of whether the MDP is necessary or whether it is in fact
                    superfluous.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    The fourth argument put forth by
                    Mr Ravi is that the sentencing regime under the MDA is too rigid because it
                    denies the court the opportunity to consider any major factual differences
                    between different cases of drug trafficking.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Mr Ravi’s fifth argument is that
                    the sentencing regime, although predicated on considerations of general
                    deterrence, does not allow the court to take into account whether the offender
                    in question voluntarily assumed the risk of trafficking in controlled drugs. It
                    is contended that, since whether or not the 15g differentia is satisfied depends
                    on the amount of pure diamorphine contained in the substance trafficked, it is
                    unlikely that a drug courier would ever know whether the substance which he
                    traffics contains the requisite amount of pure diamorphine needed to satisfy the
                    15g differentia and thus attract the MDP.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    The sixth and final argument by Mr Ravi
                    is that the sentencing regime fails to differentiate between an offender who
                    traffics in just slightly more than 15g of diamorphine and one who traffics in
                    multiple times that quantity since both offenders will, if convicted, be
                    sentenced to death.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Prosecution’s response</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    In response to Mr Ravi’s
                    arguments, the AG has referred to <em>Nguyen</em>, where
                    this court set out (at [70]) the two-step “reasonable
                    classification” test for determining the validity under Art 12(1) of
                    a differentiating factor prescribed by the Legislature for distinguishing
                    between different classes of offenders for sentencing purposes, <em>viz</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A “differentiating measure” such as the 15g
                        differentia is valid if[:]</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    the classification is founded on an <em>intelligible</em> differentia; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    the differentia bears a <em>rational relation</em> to the <em>object</em> sought to be achieved by the law in
                                question.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In this connection, the AG has submitted that the 15g differentia is
                    an intelligible differentia which bears a rational relation to the social object
                    sought to be achieved by the MDA (which is to deter large-scale drug traffickers
                    from plying their trade in or through Singapore).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    We shall now consider these arguments in
                    turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our analysis of the Appellant’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    With regard to Mr Ravi’s first
                    argument as set out at <a href="#p1_103">[103]</a> above, we
                    agree that the difference between the punishment for trafficking in just
                    slightly more than 15g of diamorphine and that for trafficking in just slightly
                    under 15g of this drug is stark. This, however, does not mean that the 15g
                    differentia is therefore arbitrary. The test for whether this differentia
                    violates Art 12(1) is, as the AG has rightly pointed out, the two-step
                    “reasonable classification” test outlined at [70] of <em>Nguyen</em>. Specifically, what we are concerned with in this
                    appeal is the “rational relation” limb of this test (referred to
                    hereafter as “the ‘rational relation’ test” for
                    short), <em>viz</em>: is there a <em>rational</em> relation between the 15g differentia (which is based on
                    the quantity of diamorphine trafficked) and the social object of the MDA? (This
                    test is, for all intents and purposes, the same as the “reasonable
                    relation” test enunciated by Lord Diplock in <em>Ong
                        Ah Chuan</em> at 673–674 (reproduced at <a href="#p1_101">[101]</a> above).) Mr Ravi contends that, in
                    applying this test, the court cannot take the view that so long as the 15g
                    differentia goes <em>some</em> distance towards advancing
                    the social object of the MDA, a rational relation will be found. If that were
                    the case, Mr Ravi submits, even purely arbitrary differentiating factors
                    could survive the “rational relation” test. For instance, it would
                    be permissible to use the length of the offender’s hair as the criterion
                    for determining when the MDP is applicable because imposing the death penalty on
                    all drug traffickers with short hair would go <em>some</em>
                    distance towards eradicating the illicit drug trade. We agree with Mr Ravi
                    on this point. The test is one of <em>rational</em>
                    relation precisely to exclude the use of purely arbitrary differentiating
                    factors. To take Mr Ravi’s example, the length of the drug
                    trafficker’s hair clearly does not bear any rational relation to the
                    social object of the MDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Where the MDA is concerned, it cannot be
                    said that the 15g differentia is purely arbitrary. In <em>Ong Ah
                        Chuan</em>, the Privy Council said (at 674) in relation to the
                    question of whether the 15g differentia bore a “reasonable
                    relation” (at 674) to the social object of the MDA:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The social object of the [MDA] is to prevent the growth of drug addiction
                        in Singapore by stamping out the illicit drug trade and, in particular, the
                        trade in those most dangerously addictive drugs, heroin and morphine. The
                        social evil caused by trafficking which the [MDA] seeks to prevent is
                        broadly proportional to the quantity of addictive drugs brought on to
                            [<em>sic</em>] the illicit market. There is nothing
                        unreasonable in the legislature’s holding the view that an illicit
                        dealer on the wholesale scale who operates near the apex of the distributive
                        pyramid requires a stronger deterrent to his transactions and deserves more
                        condign punishment than do dealers on a smaller scale who operate nearer the
                        base of the pyramid. It is for the legislature to determine in the light of
                        the information that is available to it about the structure of the illicit
                        drug trade in Singapore, and the way in which it is carried on, where the
                        appropriate quantitative boundary lies between these two classes of
                        dealers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We agree with this observation. We would also add that the quantity of
                    addictive drugs trafficked is not only broadly proportionate to the quantity of
                    addictive drugs brought onto the illicit market, but also broadly proportionate
                    to the scale of operations of the drug dealer and, hence, broadly proportionate
                    to the harm likely to be posed to society by the offender’s crime. For
                    these reasons, we find that the 15g differentia bears a rational relation to the
                    social object of the MDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Our finding that there is a rational
                    relation between the 15g differentia and the social object of the MDA should
                    not, however, be taken to mean that this differentia is the best and that there
                    is no other better differentia which would further the social object of the MDA.
                    In this regard, we appreciate the points made in Mr Ravi’s second,
                    third and fourth arguments at <a href="#p1_104">[104]</a>–<a href="#p1_106">[106]</a> above,
                    all of which suggest possible reasons for expanding the differentia to take into
                    account something more than just the quantity of controlled drugs trafficked. We
                    should also point out that although a differentia which takes into account
                    something more than merely the quantity of controlled drugs trafficked may be a
                    better differentia than the 15g differentia, what is a better differentia is a
                    matter on which reasonable people may well disagree. This question is, in truth,
                    a question of social policy, and, as the Privy Council stated in <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em> at 673 (quoted at <a href="#p1_101">[101]</a> above), it lies within the province of the Legislature,
                    not the Judiciary. Our judiciary has to respect the constitutional role of our
                    legislature as delineated in the Singapore Constitution (under Art 38), and
                    this is why our courts will only act to ensure that the differentia employed in
                    the MDA for determining when the MDP is to be imposed bears a rational relation
                    to the social object of that statute. As mentioned in the preceding paragraph,
                    we find that the 15g differentia does satisfy this test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    With regard to the fifth argument canvassed
                    by Mr Ravi at <a href="#p1_107">[107]</a> above, we do not
                    agree that a drug courier who does not know the amount of pure diamorphine
                    contained in the substance which he traffics is one who has not voluntarily
                    assumed the risk of trafficking. There is no need for a drug courier to know the
                    precise amount of pure diamorphine contained in the substance which he traffics
                    in order to know that his act causes harm to society and is illegal, and that he
                    will be punished if he is caught and convicted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    With regard to Mr Ravi’s sixth
                    argument at <a href="#p1_108">[108]</a> above, we do not think it
                    can be taken seriously. If this argument were accepted, it would apply even if
                    the 15g differentia is changed such that a far greater amount of diamorphine
                    must be trafficked before the MDP becomes applicable. For instance, if the MDP
                    were to be imposed only if the amount of diamorphine trafficked exceeds 100kg,
                    Mr Ravi would still be able to argue that the sentencing regime fails to
                    differentiate between an offender who traffics in just slightly more than 100kg
                    of diamorphine and one who traffics in multiple times that quantity. The reason
                    why a more severe sentence is not imposed for a more egregious violation of our
                    drug trafficking laws (in terms of trafficking in a larger quantity of
                    controlled drugs) is that the death penalty is the ultimate punishment and there
                    exists no punishment which is more severe. Parliament has set 15g of diamorphine
                    as the threshold for imposing the MDP where the offence of trafficking in this
                    drug is concerned; <em>ie</em>, it has decided that
                    trafficking in any quantity of diamorphine more than 15g is sufficiently serious
                    to warrant the imposition of the MDP. Hence, even though trafficking in even
                    larger quantities of diamorphine (as compared to, say, just 15.01g of
                    diamorphine) would be a more egregious violation of the law, there is no more
                    severe punishment which may be imposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Before we conclude our analysis of the
                    Article 12(1) challenge, we should briefly mention another argument made by
                    Mr Ravi which has some bearing (albeit only tangentially) on the question
                    of whether the MDP provisions in the MDA are consistent with Art 12(1) of
                    the Singapore Constitution. This argument is that the MDP has in fact only a
                    limited deterrent effect on drug couriers. To buttress this argument,
                    Mr Ravi filed Criminal Motion No 7 of 2010
                    (“CM 7/2010”) seeking leave for the Appellant to adduce an
                    affidavit by Prof Jeffrey Fagan dated 3 March 2010
                    (“Prof Fagan’s affidavit”), which states that the
                    deterrent effect of the MDP for drug trafficking has not been established and
                    that the utility of this penalty as a deterrence is limited where drug couriers
                    are concerned. Mr Ravi sought to rely on this affidavit to argue that the
                    imposition of the MDP on all offenders who traffic in more than 15g of
                    diamorphine is of limited deterrent effect. In this regard, the AG has produced
                    statistics (compiled by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime for the year 2008) to
                    show that Singapore has one of the lowest drug addiction rates internationally,
                    which suggests that the MDP does have a deterrent effect on drug trafficking
                    here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    It is not within the purview of this court
                    to determine the efficacy or otherwise of the MDP as a deterrent <em>vis-à-vis</em> the offence of drug trafficking. In <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em>, the Privy Council addressed this very
                    point when it said (at 672–673):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Their Lordships would emphasise that in their judicial capacity they are
                        in no way concerned with arguments for or against capital punishment or its
                        efficacy as a deterrent to so evil and profitable a crime as trafficking in
                        addictive drugs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    We would add that, although there is room
                    for arguing that there is insufficient evidence that the MDP deters serious
                    offences like murder, it can equally be said that there is insufficient evidence
                    that the MDP does not have such a deterrent effect. Surveys and statistical
                    studies on this issue in one country can never be conclusive where another
                    country is concerned. The issue of whether the MDP has a deterrent effect is a
                    question of policy and falls within the purview of Parliament rather than that
                    of the courts. Therefore, Prof Fagan’s affidavit is of little
                    practical relevance in this appeal. Accordingly, CM 7/2010 is unnecessary
                    and we make no order on it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Given our ruling that the 15g differentia
                    bears a rational relation to the social object of the MDA, this differentia is
                    not arbitrary and, thus, not inconsistent with Art 12(1). In this regard,
                    we note that the Privy Council in <em>Ong Ah Chuan</em>
                    likewise found that a “reasonable relation” (at 674) existed
                    between the 15g differentia and the social object of the MDA; we have no reason
                    to disagree with its finding. For these reasons, the Article 12(1)
                    challenge also fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    To summarise, our ruling on the issues
                    raised in this appeal is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_120-p2_a"></a>(a)     Art 9(1) of the Singapore
                        Constitution cannot be interpreted as impliedly including a prohibition
                        against inhuman punishment because of our constitutional history (in
                        particular, because of the Government’s conscious decision not to
                        incorporate such a prohibition into the Singapore Constitution
                        notwithstanding the recommendation of the Wee
                    Commission);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_120-p2_b"></a>(b)     in
                        view of our ruling in the preceding sub-paragraph, it is unnecessary for us
                        to decide whether the MDP is an inhuman punishment;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_120-p2_c"></a>(c)     the expression “law” in
                        Art 9(1) does not include CIL which has yet to be incorporated into
                        domestic law;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_120-p2_d"></a>(d)     even if the word “law” in Art 9(1) includes CIL which
                        has yet to be incorporated into domestic law, we are not persuaded that the
                        CIL rule prohibiting inhuman punishment includes a prohibition against the
                        MDP specifically;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_120-p2_e"></a>(e)     in view of our findings at sub-paras (a) and (d) above, the MDP
                        is not contrary to the right to life set out in Art 9(1);
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_120-p2_f"></a>(f)     the 15g
                        differentia in the MDP provisions in the MDA does not draw arbitrary
                        distinctions between offenders who traffic in different amounts of drugs and
                        thus does not violate the right under Art 12(1) of equal protection of
                        the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    It follows that the MDP is not
                    unconstitutional as it does not contravene either Art 9(1) or
                    Art 12(1). In view of this conclusion, it is unnecessary for us to consider
                    Mr Ravi’s submission as to the effect which the President’s
                    power to grant clemency under Art 22P of the Singapore Constitution has on
                    the constitutionality of the MDP.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Finally, we would reiterate that, in the
                    light of our constitutional history since Singapore became an independent
                    sovereign republic on 9 August 1965, there is no room for the argument that
                    MDP legislation is unconstitutional because it is not “law” for
                    the purposes of Art 9(1). In our view, whether or not our existing MDP
                    legislation should have been enacted and/or whether such legislation should be
                    modified or repealed are policy issues that are for Parliament to determine in
                    the exercise of its legislative powers under the Singapore Constitution. It is
                    for Parliament, and not the courts, to decide on the appropriateness or
                    suitability of the MDP as a form of punishment for serious criminal offences. In
                    view of the decisive rejection of a constitutional prohibition against inhuman
                    punishment in the evolution of the Singapore Constitution (see <a href="#p1_61">[61]</a>–<a href="#p1_72">[72]</a> above), any changes in CIL and any foreign constitutional
                    or judicial developments in relation to the MDP as an inhuman punishment will
                    have no effect on the scope of Art 9(1). If any change in relation to the MDP
                    (or the death penalty generally) is to be effected, that has to be done by
                    Parliament and not by the courts under the guise of constitutional
                    interpretation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    In the result, we dismiss the present
                    appeal.</p>
