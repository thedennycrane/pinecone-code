Rather, he participates purely on a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">non-partisan basis</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Applicant contended that permitting the AG to file reply affidavits in the present application would allow the AG to venture beyond his non-partisan role as the guardian of the public interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 With respect, the Applicant’s arguments were unmeritorious and contrived. The mere fact that the Court of Appeal had granted leave to the “Prosecution” (instead of the AG) to respond did not indicate that it had specifically intended to preclude the AG from filing a response; at the highest, this was an inadvertent mistaken reference to the identity of the putative respondent. Likewise, no particular conclusions could be drawn from the fact that the Court of Appeal had originally directed for the application to be heard before it instead of the High Court. In the circumstances, it was patently clear to me that the Court of Appeal had intended to allow the AG, as the putative respondent, leave to respond in these proceedings, and nothing in its directions detracted from this plain and obvious intent.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Further, and in any event, I was of the view that the Applicant’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">Deepak Sharma </span>was misplaced. As the AG pointed out, <span class="font-italic">Deepak Sharma </span>was a case involving <span class="font-italic">private </span>judicial review, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>judicial review that does not involve the Government and/or does not seek to challenge any governmental action or decision (<span class="font-italic">Deepak Sharma </span>at [2]). The present application was an application for leave to commence <span class="font-italic">public</span> judicial review. Where public judicial review is concerned, the AG has a right to attend and to be heard “in the interest of the government in particular and the public in general” (see <span class="font-italic">Chan Hiang Leng Colin v Minister for Information and the Arts </span>[1995] 2 SLR(R) 627 at [4], citing <span class="font-italic">George John v Goh Eng Wah Brothers Filem Sdn Bhd</span> [1988] 1 MLJ 319 (at 320)). In such cases, courts have readily accepted affidavits filed by the AG (see for example, <span class="font-italic">Muhammad Ridzuan bin M</span><span class="font-italic">ohd Ali v Attorney-General </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1222 (“<span class="font-italic">Muhammad Ridzuan</span>”) at [59], [63], [64] and [66]; <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2019] 2 SLR 216 (“<span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span>”) at [79] and [80]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conditions for leave to commence judicial review proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Having addressed the preliminary issue, I turned to consider the substantive issues which arose in the present application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The purpose of the leave requirement in judicial review proceedings is to serve as a means of filtering out groundless or hopeless cases at an early stage (<span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran </span>at [76]). It is uncontroverted (and undisputed by the parties) that there are three conditions which must be satisfied in order for a court to grant leave to commence judicial review (<span class="font-italic">Muhammad Ridzuan </span>at [32]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the subject matter of the complaint has to be susceptible to judicial review; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the applicant has to have sufficient interest in the matter; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the materials before the court have to disclose an arguable or <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of reasonable suspicion in favour of granting the remedies sought by the applicant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 As there is a presumption that constitutional office holders and other officials make decisions in accordance with the law, a party who seeks to challenge an executive decision will only be granted leave to do so if he can adduce <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>evidence that the relevant standard has been breached (<span class="font-italic">Muhammad Ridzuan </span>at [36]). Nevertheless, the threshold of a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of reasonable suspicion is a “very low” one (<span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran </span>at [76]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 There was no dispute that the first and second conditions were satisfied in the present case. Accordingly, the only question before this court was whether the third condition was satisfied in respect of the three challenges mounted by the Applicant, <span class="font-italic">viz</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the PP challenge, the Cabinet challenge and the SPS challenge. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The PP challenge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The PP challenge hinged on the following contentions:   </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the Applicant alleged that he was not served a notice (hereinafter referred to as “the MDP Notice”) informing him of the possibility that he could avoid the death penalty by giving substantive assistance to the CNB.

In this regard, O 53 r 1(6) of the ROC provides that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [L]eave shall not be granted to apply for a Quashing Order to remove any judgment, order, conviction or other proceeding for the purpose of its being quashed, unless the application for leave is made within <span class="font-italic">3 months</span> after the date of the proceeding or such other period (if any) as may be prescribed by any written law or, except where a period is so prescribed, <span class="font-italic">the delay is accounted for to the satisfaction of the Judge to whom the application for leave is made</span>…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The three-month period starts to run from the date on which the right to seek relief arises, and not when the applicant learnt of the decision or when he had sufficient evidence to bring the action (<span class="font-italic">Teng Fuh Holdings Pte Ltd v Collector of Land Revenue </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 568 (“<span class="font-italic">Teng Fuh Holdings</span>”) at [17]). Therefore, in the present case, time would have started to run on 2 May 2017, which was the date of the Applicant’s conviction by the High Court and when he was notified that a CSA would not be issued. The present application was only filed well over two years later, on 24 June 2019. The three-month time bar had clearly been exceeded. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Consequently, the Applicant could only seek leave to apply for a Quashing Order against the PP’s decision if he could offer an explanation which adequately accounted for his delay (<span class="font-italic">UDL Marine (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Jurong Town Corp</span> [2011] 3 SLR 94 (“<span class="font-italic">UDL Marine</span>”) at [39]). Although this inquiry is necessarily fact-specific, case authorities suggest that courts typically have regard to the applicant’s knowledge of the facts underpinning his application for judicial review. For instance, in <span class="font-italic">UDL Marine</span>, the applicant’s delay was deemed to be satisfactorily accounted for on the basis that the applicant only came to know of certain information which formed its “strongest basis for judicial review” after the three-month time bar had passed (see <span class="font-italic">UDL Marine </span>at [46]). Conversely, in <span class="font-italic">Teng Fuh Holdings</span>, the Court of Appeal held (at [23]) that the applicant had not satisfactorily accounted for its delay because “it had the interest, the knowledge and the means to have acquired the information to make its application long before it filed the same”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The Applicant argued that his delay in bringing the present application was not unreasonable because it was not clear, prior to the issuance of the Court of Appeal’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Nag</span><span class="font-italic">aenthran</span> on 27 May 2019, whether the PP’s determination under s 33B of the MDA could be challenged on grounds other than bad faith, malice or unconstitutionality; and/or whether the PP’s role under s 33B of the MDA was to make a determination or exercise its executive discretion.

</div>
</div> The Applicant was only advised to bring his challenge after the Court of Appeal clarified these issues in <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I found the Applicant’s explanations unconvincing and unmeritorious. First, the Court of Appeal’s holding in <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran </span>could not logically have provided the impetus for the Applicant to bring an action for judicial review, when the Applicant filed CA/CM 6/2019 on 21 May 2019, <span class="font-italic">before </span>the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran </span>was delivered on 27 May 2019. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Secondly, it was already clear, prior to <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span>, that the PP’s power under s 33B of the MDA is not discretionary in nature. The Court of Appeal had explicitly stated in <span class="font-italic">Prabagaran a/l Srivijayan v Public Prosecutor and other matters </span>[2017] 1 SLR 173 (“<span class="font-italic">Prabagaran</span>”) at [65] that the PP is “duty-bound” to issue a CSA if the facts justify it. The Court of Appeal’s written judgment in <span class="font-italic">Prabagaran </span>was delivered on 2 December 2016, long before the Applicant’s conviction on 2 May 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Finally, it cannot be denied that <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran </span>was the first case to <span class="font-italic">explicitly</span> clarify that the PP’s determination under s 33B of the MDA could be challenged on the usual grounds of judicial review, including illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety (see <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran </span>at [75]). Be that as it may, it is pertinent to note that the Court of Appeal had previously suggested, in its grounds of decision for <span class="font-italic">Muhammad Ridzuan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>dated 5 October 2015, that it was an “open question” whether the PP’s decision to issue a CSA could be challenged on grounds other than bad faith and malice (see <span class="font-italic">Muhammad Ridzuan </span>at [76]). It was therefore <span class="font-italic">open</span> to the Applicant to seek judicial review on the grounds of illegality, irrationality and/or procedural impropriety. Such a course of action was clearly aligned with the Applicant’s interests and would in all likelihood have been within his means, given that he had the benefit of pro bono legal advice at the material time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In the present case, the Applicant and his then-counsel first became aware of the PP’s decision not to issue a CSA on 2 May 2017. Moreover, the facts relied on by the Applicant in support of his application for leave to apply for a Quashing Order against the PP’s decision, namely the facts pertaining to Zamri’s arrest and the alleged conversations between Zamri and the Applicant, had been known to the Applicant since 2015, on his own evidence. Considering the circumstances in their totality, I was of the view that the Applicant had not provided a reasonable explanation for his two-year delay. Accordingly, the application for leave to apply for a Quashing Order against the PP’s decision was time-barred under O 53 r 1(6) ROC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Even if the application for leave to apply for a Quashing Order had not been brought out of time, I found that it ought to be dismissed along with the Applicant’s other prayers relating to the PP challenge, on the basis that the Applicant had not discharged his onus of proving a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of reasonable suspicion. I elaborate on the reasons for this below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Non-service of the MDP Notice </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I should first point out that the Applicant took inconsistent positions regarding (a) the alleged non-service of the MDP Notice and (b) the substantive assistance which he had allegedly rendered to the CNB. On one hand, the Applicant claimed that the MDP Notice was not served on him at the time of his arrest. Hence, he was not apprised of the potential benefit of immediate cooperation and therefore did not provide any contemporaneous information to assist the CNB.

</div> This suggested that he did so either because the MDP Notice was served on him, or because he was conscious of the potential benefit of cooperation all along.

Reading the sentence in its proper context, the word “He” referred to the Investigation Officer (“IO”), Lee Tien Shiong Herman. The word “that” referred to the MDP Notice. Thus, the sentence “He didn’t read me that” simply meant that the IO had not read the MDP Notice to the Applicant. It did not preclude the possibility that the MDP Notice had been served or that it had been read to the Applicant by a <span class="font-italic">different</span> officer. Indeed, it was the AG’s case that the MDP Notice had been read to the Applicant by a CNB Officer, Khairul Faiz bin Nasaruddin (“Khairul”), rather than the IO.

For a start, my visual examination of the signatures did not clearly reveal any obvious or distinct differences. Even if such differences could be said to exist, it would be far-fetched to suggest, on that basis alone, that the MDP Notice had not been served on the Applicant. The Applicant’s reliance on the conduct of the Trial DPP was likewise speculative and unsubstantiated. I thus found, on the totality of the evidence before me, that the MDP Notice been served on the Applicant and read to him, and he was made aware of it.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Secondly, taking the Applicant’s case at its highest and assuming that the MDP Notice had not been served on him, I agreed with the AG that the service of the MDP Notice could not be characterised as a <span class="font-italic">compulsory</span> procedural prerequisite. In this regard, I drew guidance from the Court of Appeal’s observation in <span class="font-italic">Muhammad bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor </span><span class="font-italic">and another appeal </span>[2017] 1 SLR 427 (“<span class="font-italic">Abdullah</span>”) at [54] that the MDP Notice is typically served “[a]s a matter of practice”. The Court of Appeal did not state that the service of the MDP Notice was mandated by law, and the Applicant was unable to point me to any statutory provision to that effect. Further, as the AG correctly pointed out, accused persons who commit offences in Singapore are in effect presumed to be aware of what the law states, including the alternative sentencing regime under s 33B of the MDA, as ignorance of the law is not a defence.

</div> Thus, the non-service of the MDP Notice could not be said to be a fatal omission which operated to prejudice the Applicant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The Applicant also argued that it was significant that s 258 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) had been amended in 2012 to incorporate the following explanation: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Explanation 2 — If a statement is otherwise admissible, it will not be rendered inadmissible merely because it was made in any of the following circumstances:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(aa) where the accused is informed in writing by a person in authority of the circumstances in section 33B of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185) under which life imprisonment may be imposed in lieu of death;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Applicant submitted that this explicit reference to the MDP Notice indicated that it was a prerequisite for the imposition of the death penalty, and not merely a matter of practice.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I was unable to agree with this submission. If Parliament had intended to make service of the MDP Notice compulsory, it would have expressly legislated for this instead of indirectly incorporating a reference to the MDP Notice under Explanation 2(aa) to s 258 of the CPC. Indeed, Parliament had explicitly codified other notices, such as the notice which must be read to an accused under s 23(1) of the CPC prior to the recording of his cautioned statement. It is telling that Parliament had not chosen to do so here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Accordingly, I was satisfied that non-service of the MDP Notice would not have given rise to a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of reasonable suspicion that the PP’s decision was tainted with procedural impropriety. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 For completeness, I also briefly address the Applicant’s contention that non-service of the MDP Notice infringed his right to equality under Article 12 of the Constitution.

This test was applied in <span class="font-italic">Eng Foong Ho and others v Attorney-General </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 542, where the Court of Appeal held (at [31]) that the Collector of Land Revenue’s act of gazetting a temple property for acquisition did not infringe Art 12 because “[t]here was no allegation of arbitrary action on the part of the Government: indeed, it is conceded that the acquisition was proceeded with in good faith”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In the present case, the Applicant was not able to point to any factual circumstances to support his contention that there had been a breach of Art 12 premised on the <span class="font-italic">Muhammad Ridzuan</span> standard.

</div> This was long after the Applicant’s conviction on 2 May 2017, and more than seven months after the dismissal of his appeal on 9 February 2018. Further, Zamri had already been convicted on 31 March 2017, more than a year before 24 September 2018.

However, the Applicant did not adduce any evidence to discharge this burden. As pointed out in <span class="font-italic">Prabagaran</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [97]), the question of whether an offender has provided substantive assistance involves a “multi-faceted inquiry” taking into account a “multitude of factors”, such as the upstream and downstream effects of any information provided, the operational value of any information provided to existing intelligence, and the veracity of any information provided when counterchecked against other intelligence sources. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The Applicant was in no position to speculate as to how the CNB had conducted its investigations or how it might have acted on the various sources of information it obtained.

There were two limbs to this argument. First, the Applicant took issue with the fact that it was the former AG, namely AG V K Rajah (“AG Rajah”), who had decided not to issue a CSA to the Applicant, more than a year before the Applicant’s trial had even begun. Secondly, the DPPs involved in the Applicant’s trial had allegedly adopted a “cavalier approach” towards the issuance of the CSA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In my judgment, there was no merit in either of these assertions. The Applicant was not able to produce any authorities to support his proposition that the CSA had to be specifically and personally reviewed by the AG who was in office at the time he was due to be sentenced, namely AG Lucien Wong. A considered decision had been made by AG Rajah on the evidence which had been available to him before the trial commenced. Nothing new or material had emerged at trial to warrant a reappraisal of AG Rajah’s decision not to issue a CSA. In any event, the Applicant had not offered any novel information to the CNB up to the point when he was due to be sentenced. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I was also unable to agree with the Applicant’s assertions about the attitudes and/or conduct of the DPPs involved in the Applicant’s High Court trial. These assertions were exclusively premised on the fact that DPP Wuan Kin Lek, Nicholas (“DPP Wuan”) had used the words “discretion” and “determination” interchangeably in an affidavit which he had filed in CA/CM 6/2019. I was unable to draw any inferences from this fact which, in my view, may simply have been occasioned by an oversight on DPP Wuan’s part. In view of the paucity of evidence to support the Applicant’s contentions, I found that his submissions on this point were bound to fail. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Cabinet challenge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64  Turning to the Cabinet challenge, the Applicant’s main contention was that there was a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of reasonable suspicion that the Cabinet had, when advising the President not to commute the Applicant’s death sentence, failed to consider the substantive assistance he had rendered.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In my judgment, the Applicant’s challenge against the SPS was plainly unmeritorious as it was evident that he did not seek any substantive or practical relief through this challenge. The Applicant had originally sought three prayers against the SPS: (a) a Quashing Order against the SPS for its refusal to grant access to Zamri, (b) a Mandatory Order obliging the SPS to approve future requests of the Applicant’s solicitors to interview Zamri, and (c) a Prohibiting Order prohibiting the SPS from carrying out the execution of Zamri’s sentence until the final determination of his OS, including any appeals. In view of the fact that the SPS had consented to the Applicant’s solicitors interviewing Zamri subsequent to the filing of the present application, the Applicant withdrew his prayers for the Mandatory Order and the Prohibiting Order.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Only the prayer for the Quashing Order remained. To account for the continued necessity of pursuing this prayer, the Applicant stressed that the SPS’s actions had serious ramifications for the conduct of defence proceedings in Singapore and rationalised that there was a need to pre-empt possible future challenges of a similar nature. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I was unable to accept the Applicant’s submission. As the AG pointed out, the facts of this case were unique – Zamri was a prisoner who was awaiting capital punishment, and the Applicant’s offence was not directly correlated to his. Further, prisoners are deemed to be in the legal custody of the Superintendent of the prisons they are confined in (s 33 of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2000 Rev Ed)), and there are no legal provisions which confer a right of access to any prisoner in legal custody for the purposes of an interview. As such, the Quashing Order – even if ultimately granted – would be of zero or very limited utility, whether to the Applicant or to the criminal Bar as a whole. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Nevertheless, I proceed to deal with the Applicant’s other arguments for completeness. First, the Applicant’s point that the SPS had no lawful right to deny him access to Zamri simply could not stand since the Applicant and his solicitors were not legally entitled to obtain access to Zamri in the first place. The Applicant’s contention pertaining to litigation privilege and legal advice privilege was likewise misconceived. Even if I were to find, taking the Applicant’s case at its highest, that the information sought was protected by litigation and/or legal advice privilege, the SPS’s act of <span class="font-italic">requesting </span>for such information was not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>unlawful. Finally, I was not satisfied that the Applicant had raised a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>reasonable suspicion that the SPS was acting in bad faith or for improper purposes. These were serious allegations and it was not open to the Applicant to cast aspersions on the SPS without concrete evidence to shore up his suspicions. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In summary, I found that the evidence before me did not disclose an arguable or <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of reasonable suspicion in favour of granting the remedies sought by the Applicant. Accordingly, I dismissed the application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 As the AG agreed that each party should bear their own costs, I made no order as to costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-left">See Kee Oon <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Too Xing Ji (BMS Law LLC) and Lee Ji En (Ascendant Legal LLC) for the applicant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Francis Ng Yong Kiat SC, Adrian Loo Yu Hao and Teo Siu Ming (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
