        Vinodh Coomaraswamy J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In this action, the plaintiff claims from the
                    defendant: (i) various loans totalling $383,300 which he alleges he made to her
                    between 2011 and 2013; and (ii) possession of, or the value of, a car which he
                    claims she purchased with money that he had advanced to her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff in due course applied for summary
                    judgment. The Assistant Registrar entered judgment for the plaintiff on two of
                    the plaintiff’s claims and granted the defendant unconditional leave to
                    defend on the rest. The defendant appealed to a judge in chambers against the
                    former order; the plaintiff cross-appealed against the latter order. Both
                    appeals came before me. I have dismissed the defendant’s appeal and
                    allowed the plaintiff’s appeal, making the defendant’s leave to
                    defend conditional on the defendant furnishing security for the remainder of the
                    plaintiff's claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The defendant has appealed to the Court of
                    Appeal. I therefore set out my grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties and their positions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff and the defendant were in a
                    romantic relationship from October 2007<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> to October 2013,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>
                    subject to a break for a few months in the third quarter of 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> They cohabited at least from June
                        2011<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> until
                    October 2013.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> This action was commenced a few months
                    after the end of their relationship and a few months after the plaintiff learned
                    that the defendant had married another man.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The defendant’s case is that the plaintiff
                    is falsely alleging that the sums which he claims in these proceedings were
                    loans rather than gifts and has brought this action<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> only because he is angry that the
                    parties’ relationship has broken down and that she has left him to marry
                    another man. As she says in her affidavit to show cause:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I wish to say that the Plaintiff is angry that I left him and married
                        another man. Hence this action has been brought against me. I believe that
                        his object is vengeance for leaving him and to destroy my current marriage.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Her basic position is:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I say the Plaintiff should stand up and be an honourable gentleman and
                        withdraw his claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s seven claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Be that as it may, the plaintiff’s claim
                    for $383,300 comprises seven claims. Six of them are set out in the following

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>For convenience, I will refer to each of these claims by the
                    number set out against it in the table above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiff’s seventh claim is for the
                    return of the car<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> or for the sum of $120,000,
                    being the plaintiff’s advance to the defendant in March 2013 to enable her
                    to purchase the car.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       As evidence of his case on claims 1, 2 and 3,
                    the plaintiff relies on what he says is an admission to that effect by the
                    defendant in her email to him dated 14 October 2013.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> This is an
                    important email, not just for claims 1, 2 and 3, but also for claim 7. I will
                    set it out in full when I discuss claim 7 at [12] below. It suffices for now to
                    note that the words from that email which the plaintiff relies on as an
                    admission in respect of claims 1, 2 and 3 are these: “As for the LV, and
                    Shenton you said it was a loan right? So, i will pay you back as soon as I am in
                    better financial situation.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> It is common ground that
                    “LV” is a reference to the Langston Ville unit and that
                    “Shenton” is a reference to the V on Shenton unit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       As evidence of his case on claim 4,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> the
                    plaintiff produces a text message which the defendant sent to him on 7 July
                    2013. This is the same day on which he advanced the $5,000 to the defendant
                    which forms the subject-matter of claim 4. In this message, the defendant says:
                    “…Why are you treating me so well???.....hmmmm I am
                    speechless…..I know even though it is a loan, still your thoughts and
                    attention never failed to amaze me.…”. The defendant relies on
                    this text message as the defendant’s admission that claim 4 was a
                    loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     As evidence of his case on claim
                        5,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>
                    the plaintiff produces another text message from the defendant. The defendant
                    sent this message on 21 August 2013, the same day on which the plaintiff
                    transferred to her account the other $5,000 which forms the subject-matter of
                    claim 5. In this text message, the defendant says: “… thank you
                    for everything, I owe you a lot, sighhh”. The plaintiff relies on this
                    text message as the defendant’s admission that claim 5 was a
                loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The plaintiff has no evidence to support claim
                    6 other than his own statement to that effect in his affidavit. He relies on the
                    fact that claims 4 and 5 were loans to invite the court to infer that claim 6
                    also was a loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Claim 7 arises in this way. On or about 25
                    March 2013, the plaintiff advanced $120,000 to the defendant by cheque to enable
                    her to buy a Mercedes Benz car.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> She duly used the
                    advance to purchase the car and registered it in her name. The plaintiff’s
                    position is that the defendant is registered as the owner of the car merely as
                    his nominee and therefore the car was and remains his property. As evidence of
                    this, he relies on the same email from the defendant dated 14 October 2013
                    referred to at [8] above.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> I now set this email out in
                    full. It is common ground that the references to “snow white” in

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am just thinking it seems you are so bo kam guan with snow white
                        …..I must say snow white is the only luxury I could really enjoy and
                        appreciate right now…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Can you not sell it? It won’t make you poor right?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For almost 7 years I was with you, did you not enjoy my company and our

                        along? Did I ever Bragg about and ask you to buy expensive stuff from you?
                        Perhaps the only expensive thing I ever asked was the pearl earring which
                        you paid for 1500, it was 2200 actually :)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As for the LV, and Shenton you said it was on loan right? So, i will pay

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The defendant admits receiving from the
                    plaintiff all of the sums comprised in claims 1 to 7.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> Her case is that they were all gifts, save for
                    the sum of $105,000 which was indeed a loan and which she has repaid as
                    indicated in the table at [6] above.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The defendant’s case on claims 1 to 7</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On claim 1, the defendant’s evidence is
                    that the plaintiff volunteered to pay the down payment and the legal fees for
                    the Langston Ville unit because he foresaw a permanent future with her and
                    wanted her “to be comfortably installed” there.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On claim 2, the defendant’s evidence is
                    that the plaintiff gave her money towards the monthly instalments for the
                    Langston Ville unit not as loans but in recognition of three factors: (i) that
                    they loved each other and were living together with a view to marriage; (ii) in
                    recognition of the domestic services she was providing to him; and (iii) to
                    cover his share of the accommodation and other expenses of cohabiting with the
                        defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> The defendant points out that if the
                    plaintiff is correct that the advances of $58,200 comprised in claim 2 were not
                    gifts but were instead loans, it means that the plaintiff expected the defendant
                    to support him financially while they were cohabiting, by paying for his
                    accommodation and all household expenses for him. She says that that would be
                        bizarre<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> and was not the case.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On claim 3, the defendant’s evidence is
                    that only $105,000 out of the total sum of $205,000 comprised in this claim was
                    a loan, with the remaining $100,000 being a gift from the defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> I will have more to say about the unsatisfactory
                    nature of the defendant’s evidence on this point below at [89]–[94]
                    below. For now, it suffices to note that the defendant’s evidence is that
                    the $105,000 she repaid on 19 December 2012 and 27 February 2013 was to
                    discharge this loan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> Her case, therefore, is that she has fully
                    repaid the only part of this advance which was in fact a loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The defendant accepts in her affidavit that
                    claim 4 was a loan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> She initially denied that it was a loan in her
                        defence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On claims 5 and 6, the defendant’s
                    evidence is that she never asked the plaintiff for those sums and that he
                    deposited them into the defendant’s “bank account spontaneously and
                    of his own accord”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> To support her case that the
                    plaintiff did deposit money into her account spontaneously and voluntarily from
                    time to time, she relies on an email which the plaintiff sent to the defendant
                    on 5 August 2009 in which he refers to having deposited funds into her account.
                    In that email, he says: “…Firstly , the cheque is just to pay for
                    some expenses [which] I honestly feel I have on my part to pay, so please keep
                    the funds”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The defendant’s case on claim 7 is that
                    the plaintiff volunteered to buy the car for her as a gift to stop her from
                    badgering him to marry her, and that he has never before alleged that she held
                    the car merely as his nominee.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The defendant’s case on the 14 October 2013 email</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The defendant also puts before me her evidence
                    on the 14 October 2013 email (see [12] above) which the plaintiff relies on as
                    containing admissions that the sums advanced under claims 1, 2, 3 and 7 were
                    loans and not gifts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The defendant explains that the plaintiff has
                    taken out of context her references in this email to the advances for the
                    Langston Ville unit and the V on Shenton unit as loans. She says that the email
                    was sent in the terminal stages of their relationship when the plaintiff was
                    angry with her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff had claimed in anger that the
                    money he had given her for the Langston Ville unit were loans. She responded as
                    she did – by accepting that they were loans and undertaking to pay him
                    back when her financial position improved – in an attempt to shame him
                    into acknowledging the truth as a gentleman. She expected him to respond by
                    rising to the occasion and saying that the money was his gift to her and that he
                    would not ask for it back.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     As for her reference in this email to the car,
                    she explains that her plea to him not to sell the car was another attempt on her
                    part to shame him into being a gentleman and admitting the truth: that the car
                    was his gift to her and that he did not want the money back.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Defendant claims she has no access to documents</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In addition to dealing with the
                    plaintiff’s specific claims, the defendant also makes an overarching point
                    as to why a trial is necessary. She says that there are many documents which
                    will show that these advances were gifts and not loans, but that only the
                    plaintiff has them. Thus, she claims first that such documents do
                        exist:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… there will be many relevant documents to show the true nature of
                        the relationship and to debunk the [p]laintiff’s claim that the monies
                        he refers to in his statement of claim were loans. In fact the majority of
                        the money were gifts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Then, she goes on to explain why she cannot
                    produce these “many relevant documents”. It is because she has
                    deleted all of the text messages and emails she and the plaintiff exchanged
                    during their relationship. She did this when their relationship ended, she says,
                    because she wanted to draw a line under their relationship and move
                        on:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All the messages and e-mails between the [p]laintiff and myself then in my
                        possession at that time have been deleted as I wanted to close the past. I
                        know that the Plaintiff was angry. However, I did not expect that he would
                        turn around and say that some of the monies he gave me in the course of our
                        relationship were loans.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Finally, she alleges that the plaintiff
                    himself has all of these text messages and emails but has selectively disclosed
                    only those which assist his contentions and not those which would prove
                        hers:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The Plaintiff has failed to give all the correspondences [sic]
                        generated in course [sic] of the relationship. This evidence would show that
                        the monies he has given me were not loans. He has chosen not to place these
                        before the court as it would be against his contentions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s affidavit in reply </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The plaintiff makes five points in his
                    affidavit in reply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     First, he denies the defendant’s
                    assertion (see [19] and [21] above) that she sent her email to him on 14 October
                    2013 in response to his angry demand for repayment and as her attempt to shame
                    him into being a gentleman and doing the honourable thing by accepting that his
                    advances to her for claims 1, 2, 3 and 7 were gifts. To do this, he produces his
                    email to her sent on the morning of 14 October 2013<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> to which she responds in her crucial email sent
                    in the afternoon of 14 October 2013 (see [12] above). His point is that his
                    email to her was not an angry email and did not even touch on claims 1, 2, 3 or
                    7.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The plaintiff also produces further evidence
                    of their communications in or around October 2013 to support his case further
                    that he was not angry with her at or around the time she sent her email of 14
                    October 2013. To this end, he produces copies of 50 text messages they exchanged
                    from 4 August 2013 to 24 September 2013,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> evidence
                    that that they went to see the Phantom of the Opera as a couple on 30 August
                        2013,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> evidence that he had dinner with the defendant
                    and her mother on 28 September 2013,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> 11 text messages
                    they exchanged from 1 October 2013 to 9 October 2013<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span>
                    and seven text messages they exchanged on 15 October 2013<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> (the day after the defendant’s 14 October
                    2013 email) and on 26 October 2013.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> He
                    relies on this evidence to submit that,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> as at late as 26 October
                    2013, both the plaintiff and the defendant were behaving entirely normally, as
                    though their romantic relationship was still ongoing. This, he says, shows that
                    her admissions in her 14 October 2013 email should be taken at face
                    value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     He complains also that she continued to
                    communicate with him as late as 26 October 2013 as though their relationship was
                    ongoing even though her evidence now is that as early as August 2013, she had
                    decided to end their relationship<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> and that,
                    on 23 October 2013, she underwent in Jakarta a ceremonial marriage to her
                    current husband.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The plaintiff’s second point is that,
                    although he and the defendant were in a long-term romantic relationship from
                    2007 to 2013, they always kept their personal affairs separate from their
                    business affairs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> The defendant is a property broker. The
                    plaintiff’s family company owned a flat at Leonie Towers. To support his
                    second point, the plaintiff produces evidence to show that his family
                        company<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> paid commissions to the defendant’s
                    agency totalling more than $64,000 for finding a tenant for this flat on four
                    occasions between 2008 and 2013<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> and for finding a buyer for
                    this flat when the family company sold it in late 2013.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> This separation
                    between personal and business affairs, he says, carried through to the various
                    loans he made to the defendant and now claims from her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The plaintiff’s third point is that the
                    sums he is seeking to recover in this action do not include sums totalling just
                    under $65,000 which he advanced to the defendant during their relationship and
                    which he accepts were outright gifts, advanced with no expectation or promise of
                    repayment whatsoever.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> These advances were made to cover food,
                    utilities, maintenance fees for the Langston Ville unit and other household
                    expenses as well as medical, travel and other expenses for the defendant, her
                    friends and her family.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The plaintiff’s fourth point is that he
                    paid the road tax for the car when it fell due in August 2013 for the first time
                    after the purchase in March 2013.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> He relies on that to support
                    his case that he owns the car even though the car was registered in the
                    defendant’s name.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The plaintiff’s fifth point is in
                    response to the defendant’s point summarised at [23]–[25] above. He
                    asserts that no text messages or emails ever existed which would support the
                    defendant’s case. He further volunteers to source and, if the defendant
                    cannot afford it, to pay in the first instance for computer specialists who can
                    recover the text messages and emails<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> from the defendant’s
                    devices and accounts which she says she has deleted and which she says will
                    prove her case.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     This is how the parties’ positions stood
                    when the plaintiff’s summary judgment application came up for hearing
                    before the Assistant Registrar.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The summary judgment application</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Principles on which summary judgment is granted </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The legal principles governing an application
                    for summary judgment are well-known. The plaintiff must first show that he has a
                        <em>prima facie</em> case for summary judgment. If he
                    fails to do that, his application ought to be dismissed with the usual adverse
                    costs consequence (O 14 r 3(1) and r 7 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006
                    Rev Ed)). If the plaintiff does cross that threshold, the defendant then comes
                    under a tactical burden under O14 r 3 to raise “an issue or question in
                    dispute which ought to be tried”. It is this concept which is often
                    abbreviated to the well-known phrase, “a triable
                issue”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In order to meet her tactical burden, a
                    defendant must bring forward some grounds which raise a reasonable probability
                    that she has a real or <em>bona fide</em> defence in
                    relation to the issues in dispute which ought to be tried: <em>Goh Chok Tong v Chee Soon Juan</em> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 32. In that case,
                    the Court of Appeal said the following (at [25]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25 It is a settled principle of law that in an application
                        for summary judgment, the defendant will not be given leave to defend based
                        on mere assertions alone: <em>Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas
                            (Suisse) SA v Costa de Naray and Christopher John Walters</em>
                        [1984] 1 Lloyd's Rep 21 at 23. The court must be convinced that there is a
                        reasonable probability that the defendant has a real or <em>bona fide</em> defence in relation to the issues. In this regard,
                        the standard to be applied was well-articulated by Laddie J in <em>Microsoft Corporation v Electro-Wide Limited</em> [1997]
                        FSR 580, where he said at 593 to 594 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[I]t is not sufficient just to look at each factual issue one by one
                            and to consider whether it is possible that the defendant's story in
                            relation to that issue is credible. The court must look at the complete
                            account of events put forward by both the plaintiff and the defendants
                            and ... look at the whole situation. The mere fact that the defendants
                            support their defence by sworn evidence does not mean that the court is
                            obliged to suspend its critical faculties and accept that evidence as if
                            it was probably accurate. If, having regard to inconsistency with
                            contemporaneous documents, inherent implausibility and other compelling
                            evidence, the defence is not credible, the court must say so. It should
                            not let the filing of evidence which surpasses belief deprive a
                            plaintiff of its entitlement to relief.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Alternatively, the defendant may attempt to
                    show that there ought to be a trial for some other reason, even though there is
                    no reasonable probability of a real or <em>bona fide</em>
                    defence in relation to the issues in dispute which ought to be tried. A
                    defendant who chooses to pursue this latter argument bears both the legal burden
                    of proof and the evidential burden on it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     At the conclusion of the application for
                    summary judgment, having considered all the evidence, the court will enter
                    judgment against the defendant only if the plaintiff has satisfied the court
                    that there is no reasonable probability that the defendant has a real or
                        <em>bona fide</em> defence in relation to the issues in
                    dispute which ought to be tried and (only if the defendant raises this point)
                    that there is no other reason why there ought to be a trial: <em>Ritzland Investment Pte Ltd v Grace Management &amp; Consultancy Services
                        Pte Ltd</em> [2014] 2 SLR 1342 at [43] to [47].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Assistant Registrar’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The Assistant Registrar entered judgment
                    against the defendant in the sum of $105,000. He did so because he held that she
                    had shown no probability of a real or <em>bona fide</em>
                    defence to claims 3 and 4. On claim 3, he rejected the defendant’s
                    assertion that, of the $205,000 which the plaintiff had advanced the defendant
                    towards the purchase of the V on Shenton unit, only the $105,000 which she had
                    repaid was a loan, with the unpaid balance of $100,000 being a gift.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> On claim 4, he accepted that the defendant had
                    admitted in the text message dated 7 July 2013 (see [9] above) that the
                    plaintiff’s advance of $5,000 to her on the same day was indeed a
                        loan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> Those two sums – $100,000 and $5,000
                    – make up the sum for which the Assistant Registrar entered judgment
                    against the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The Assistant Registrar gave the defendant
                    unconditional leave to defend the remainder of the plaintiff’s claims. He
                    gave two reasons for not relying on the 14 October 2013 email (see [12] above)
                    as the defendant’s admissions on claims 1, 2, 3 and 7. First, the email
                    was not contemporaneous with any of the advances comprised in those four
                        claims.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> Second, the defendant’s
                    statements which the plaintiff relied on as admissions were in fact open to
                    interpretations which were not limited to the literal reading that the plaintiff
                    sought to put upon those statements.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> The Assistant
                    Registrar therefore held that the meaning to be put upon the 14 October 2013
                    email was a difficult area of fact which ought to be tried.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Both parties appealed to a judge in chambers
                    against the Assistant Registrar’s decision. The defendant prayed that the
                    judgment for $105,000 be set aside and that she be granted unconditional leave
                    to defend claims 3 and 4. The plaintiff prayed that the order giving the
                    defendant unconditional leave to defend claims 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 be set aside and
                    that summary judgment be entered in his favour on all seven of his
                    claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Prima facie case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The plaintiff has established a <em>prima facie</em> case on each of his claims. The starting
                    point is that the defendant does not dispute receiving any of the sums claimed.
                    The only dispute between the parties pertains to the basis on which the
                    defendant received the sums: was each advance a loan or a gift?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The plaintiff asserts on oath that the
                    defendant received the sums as loans. But he does not rely only on his own
                    self-serving statement to make out a <em>prima facie</em>
                    case. As evidence that claims 1, 2 and 3 were loans, he relies on the
                    defendant’s characterisation in the 14 October 2013 email (see [12] above)
                    of all the money advanced under those claims as loans. On claims 4 and 5, he
                    relies on the text messages of 7 July 2013 and 21 August 2013 (see [9] and [10]
                    above) as evidence that those two advances for $10,000 were also loans. On claim
                    7, he relies on the 14 October 2013 email as evidence that the defendant
                    acknowledged his ownership of the car.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The plaintiff also makes two points of general
                    application. First, he relies on the fact that the defendant is not in any
                    category of relationship to him which can give rise to any presumption that
                    these advances were gifts. Second, he submits that the fact that the defendant
                    accepts that $105,000 out of his advances to her was a loan is circumstantial
                    evidence that all of the remaining sums he claims were also loans. The plaintiff
                    does not accept the defendant’s appropriation of her repayment of $105,000
                    to claim 3. He submits that there is no clear or obvious distinction between
                    what the defendant accepts was a loan and what she denies was a loan, whether
                    that question is looked at in the context of claim 3 alone or in the context of
                    all seven claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     All of this is more than sufficient to make
                    out a <em>prima facie</em> case and to cast the tactical
                    burden on the defendant to bring forward some grounds to show that there is a
                    reasonable probability that she has a real or <em>bona
                        fide</em> defence in relation to the issues in dispute which ought to
                    be tried or that there is some other reason for which there ought to be a
                    trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Triable issues raised by the defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Points of pleading raised are not triable issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The defendant in her submissions relies on a
                    number of points of pleading said to give rise to triable issues. The points of
                    pleading rely principally on what is said to be the plaintiff's failure to plead
                    – properly or at all – whether the loan agreements were oral or in
                    writing, whether there was one loan agreement for all the advances or a separate
                    loan agreement for each advance and to furnish particulars of the loan
                    agreements. All of these points, it is said, raised triable
                issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     These points might have some merit if this had
                    been a claim where the plaintiff alleged that he advanced money to the defendant
                    as loans and the defendant admitted that they were indeed loans but disputed the
                    precise dates and terms on which those loans were made. But that is not this
                    case. The defendant asserts that all the advances claimed – save for
                    $105,000 – were not loans at all but outright gifts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The entire dispute between the parties
                    therefore turns only on a single question of fact: whether the advances were
                    loans or gifts. The dates, terms and other particulars of the loans cannot be
                    triable issues because there is no dispute on those issues. The defendant simply
                    denies that the bulk of the advances were loans at all. In these circumstances,
                    I do not see how these points of pleading could conceivably be a reason for the
                    plaintiff’s claim to go to trial, whether by way of showing a reasonable
                    probability of a real or <em>bona fide</em> defence or by
                    showing some other reason for trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The defendant also raised a pleading point on
                    claim 7, on the basis that the claim relied a resulting trust which had not been
                    sufficiently pleaded. This argument was not presented with any force. In any
                    event, it appears to me that the plaintiff’s claim is pleaded in
                    sufficiently broad terms to encompass a claim to recover the car or, in the
                    alternative, to recover damages for its unlawful detention in the tort of
                    detinue. The plaintiff need not rely on any trust at all to advance this claim.
                    He may simply rely on the principle in <em>Hilti Far East Pte Ltd
                        v Tan Hup Guan</em> [1991] 1 SLR(R) 711 that the owner of a car at law
                    is the person who funds its purchase and not the person who is registered as its
                    owner (at [21] – [23]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In taking these pleading points, the defendant
                    is simply putting the plaintiff to proof on his case. That does not even begin
                    to meet the defendant’s tactical burden on a summary judgment application.
                    It is little wonder, therefore, that counsel for the defendant did not advance
                    these points of pleading with any great enthusiasm in his oral submissions to
                    me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The proper interpretation of the parties’
                communications</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The only real issue raised by the defendant
                    – either as showing a reasonable probability of a real or <em>bona fide</em> defence which ought to be tried or as being
                    some other reason for a trial – is a single issue of fact. That issue is
                    that the text messages and emails upon which the plaintiff relies to seek
                    summary judgment are open to many interpretations and must be read in the
                    contemporaneous context in which they were made. In particular, the
                    defendant’s submission is that the court must bear in mind that the
                    parties were in a long-term romantic relationship and that that relationship was
                    in its terminal stages when the defendant sent the 14 October 2013 email. That
                    contemporaneous context, the defendant submits, can be investigated only at
                    trial. She says it is unsafe for the court to draw any inferences from these
                    communications on affidavit evidence alone. Thus she claims to be entitled to
                    defend at trial not only claims 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 (for which the Assistant
                    Registrar gave her unconditional leave to defend) but also claims 3 and 4 (for
                    which the Assistant Registrar entered judgment in the sum of $105,000 against
                    her).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     I accept the defendant's argument, but only on
                    claims 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7, and even then, only up to a point.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The 14 October 2013 email: very probably admissions </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     I begin my analysis by considering more
                    closely the central document in this case: the 14 October 2013 email. This is
                    the primary evidence that the plaintiff relies on to support his oral evidence
                    with regard to claims 1, 2, 3 and 7. I place great weight on this email and
                    therefore analyse it first, before considering the plaintiff’s claims one
                    by one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     It appears to me that the 14 October 2013
                    email is on its face a clear admission that claims 1, 2 and 3 were loans and not
                    gifts and, in respect of claim 7, that the plaintiff is entitled to control the
                    disposal of the car.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s purpose in sending the email</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     I begin my analysis of the 14 October 2013
                    email by noting that it is obviously preceded by a request by the plaintiff to
                    sell the car. The defendant’s sole purpose in this email is to plead with
                    the plaintiff not to sell the car – which the defendant endearingly calls
                    “snow white” – but for him to let her keep it instead. Her
                    plea to the plaintiff not to sell the car is, on its face, an acknowledgment
                    that the plaintiff has the right to decide whether and when to sell it. The
                    clear inference from that is that he, and not she, is the owner of the car as at
                    14 October 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Further, the defendant would not have to plead
                    with the plaintiff in this way at all if what the defendant says is true: that
                    the plaintiff made a gift to her of the $120,000 he advanced to her to purchase
                    the car in March 2013. What she is doing in this email is pleading with him to
                    make a gift of the car to her at the date of the email, 14 October 2013. That is
                    necessary only if she is proceeding on the basis that he did not make a gift of
                    it to her in March 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The defendant then makes three points in this
                    email to support her plea that the plaintiff now make a gift of the car to her.
                    All three of these points are presented, not as points in their own right, but
                    as subsidiary to and supportive of her sole purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     First, she tells him that she will lose a
                    great deal if the car is sold: it is her only luxury. Second, she points out
                    that he will not lose a great deal if the car is not sold: giving it to her will
                    not make him poor. Finally, and most importantly, she makes the point that her
                    request to him to make a gift of the car to her is the first time in the course
                    of their relationship that she is asking him for a lavish gift of any type. She
                    reminds him that she never took financial advantage of him by playing on their
                    relationship to persuade him to buy her lavish gifts at any time during the
                    entirety of their seven-year relationship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     It is at this juncture – while
                    presenting her case to be gifted the car in October 2013 as the only lavish gift
                    she has ever asked for – that the defendant refers to the sums which the
                    plaintiff advanced to her under claims 1, 2 and 3. She uses the fact that these
                    sums are loans and not gifts, and that she <em>accepts</em>
                    them to be loans and not gifts, as evidence of her point that she has never
                    before sought such a lavish gift from him as she now seeks and as support for
                    her plea for him to make <em>this</em> lavish gift to
                    her.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 14 October 2013 email does not appear to be taken out of
                context</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The defendant’s point that this email is
                    taken out of context is extremely weak. The context, she says, is that the
                    parties were then engaged in a cold war, or a civilised argument, as their
                    relationship was coming to an end. There are two difficulties with this
                    explanation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The first difficulty is that the
                    contemporaneous text messages and emails in September 2013 and October 2013
                    which the plaintiff has produced bear no trace of a cold war or a civilised
                    argument, let alone of a relationship that was over or all but over. The
                    defendant appears to accept this point, but invites the court to observe that
                    the parties adopted a far less affectionate tone in these communications in
                    September 2013 and October 2013 than in other communications between the parties
                    which she produces. But these other communications took place when the parties
                    first met in 2007 and when they resumed their relationship after their break in
                    2010. It is not surprising that by September and October 2013, the
                    parties’ ardour had cooled from the heady days when they were falling in
                    love in 2007 or falling in love again in 2010. That to my mind is a convincing
                    explanation why the communications in September 2013 and October 2013 were more
                    mundane and less overtly affectionate than the earlier communications upon which
                    the defendant relies. But that is the most that can be said of them. It cannot
                    be said that they evidence in any way a cold war or a civilised
                argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Most importantly to my mind, the actual email
                    to which the defendant was responding in her 14 October 2013 email, and which
                    sets the immediate context for her two admissions, is a mundane and innocuous
                    email from the plaintiff simply updating the defendant on his holiday in
                    Indonesia with his ex-wife and his daughter. The text messages exchanged by the
                    parties the day after the 14 October 2013 email are equally mundane and entirely
                    civil. None of these communications – immediately before, on and
                    immediately after 14 October 2013 – show any trace of a civilised
                    argument, let alone anger, giving rise to a subtext or a context which would
                    warrant the defendant’s admissions in that crucial email being interpreted
                    anything but literally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     It cannot be said either that the plaintiff
                    has offered a window into the parties’ communications limited to
                    immediately before and immediately after 14 October 2013. He has put in a broad
                    range of communication from the end of August 2013 until October 2013. All of it
                    contradicts the defendant’s assertion that the 14 October 2013 email
                    cannot be read literally because it was sent in the context of a cold war or a
                    civilised argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The second difficulty with the
                    defendant’s cold war explanation is that even if that argument is true, it
                    would give the defendant’s admissions in the 14 October 2013 email more
                    weight, not less. If it were indeed true that the parties were engaged in a cold
                    war when the defendant sent her email of 14 October 2013, and if it were indeed
                    true that she was responding to the plaintiff’s false allegation that the
                    sums advanced under claims 1, 2, 3 and 7 were loans and not gifts, it is to my
                    mind far more likely that she would have responded by <em>rejecting</em> his false assertion rather than by <em>adopting</em> the false assertion as an artifice to get him to
                    withdraw it and to acknowledge the truth. A party to a relationship which is
                    still good has a clear emotional motive to dissemble and to be less than
                    plainspoken. A party engaged in an argument, even if it is civilised and
                    especially when it comes at the end of an intimate relationship, no longer has
                    any reason to dissemble and has every reason to be plainspoken. If a party makes
                    an admission in that context, it carries far more weight than one made when
                    their relationship is good.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">An admission need not be contemporaneous</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The defendant’s argument that her
                    statements in this email come after the fact and are not contemporaneous with
                    the advances which underlie claims 1, 2, 3 and 7 is not to the point. The
                    plaintiff relies on this email as <em>evidence</em> of a
                    loan (for claims 1, 2 and 3) or as <em>evidence</em> of
                    ownership (for claim 7) and not as an agreement to borrow, an undertaking to
                    repay or an undertaking to return the car.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     These statements are evidence in support of
                    the plaintiff’s claim because they are admissions. The evidential force of
                    an admission does not come from how close in time the admission is to the facts
                    which are being admitted. The evidential force of an admission comes from the
                    fact that it is a statement against the maker’s interests. Indeed, it
                    could even be said that the longer the period between the facts in question and
                    the admission of those facts, the more weight the admission has. If a length of
                    time elapses between the facts and the admission, that suggests more strongly
                    that the admission ought to be taken at face value. The lapse of time tends to
                    show that the statement is a considered one, made with time to reflect on its
                    subject matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     I now turn to consider each of the
                    plaintiff’s claims. I take them in two groups: claims 1, 2 and 7 first,
                    followed by claims 3 and 4 then claims 5 and 6.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s claims: judgment or leave to defend?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Claims 1, 2 and 7: leave to defend, not judgment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     For the reasons set out at [53]–[65]
                    above, I accept that the 14 October 2013 email contains the defendant’s
                    admission that the plaintiff’s advances under claims 1, 2 and 7 were
                    loans. On claim 7, I also find it telling that the plaintiff paid the road tax
                    for the car – something which only an owner would be likely to do –
                    when it fell due.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     I am mindful, however, that the submissions I
                    have heard and the conclusions I have formed come on a summary judgment
                    application and not at the end of a trial. The defendant has, in her affidavits,
                    offered at least <em>some</em> explanation of the basis on
                    which she asserts the plaintiff intended the advances under claims 1, 2 and 7 to
                    be gifts to her. Although I find that explanation difficult to accept in the
                    light of her admissions in the 14 October 2013 email, I cannot say now that her
                    explanation is inherently incredible. I bear in mind particularly the intimate
                    nature of the parties’ relationship. I bear in mind also that the
                    relationship endured for seven years and was a marriage in all but name. While I
                    consider that I can construe the <em>text</em> of the 14
                    October 2013 email on the material before me now, I consider equally that the
                    circumstances of this case make oral evidence and cross-examination necessary to
                    understand fully the <em>subtext</em> and the <em>context</em> of the 14 October 2013 email before arriving at
                    a final determination of the parties’ rights and
                obligations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     For this reason, I consider that the defendant
                    is entitled to leave to defend on claims 1, 2 and 7. I consider at [80] below
                    precisely what form that leave to defend should take.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Claims 3 and 4: judgment for the plaintiff</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Claim 3: the advances for the V on Shenton unit</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     For the reasons set out above, I accept that
                    the 14 October 2013 email contains the defendant’s admission that the
                    plaintiff’s advances under claim 3 also were loans. Despite the point I
                    make at [69] above, however, I am satisfied that the plaintiff is entitled to
                    judgment on this claim. I say this for two reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     First, the defendant has not supplied any
                    context in her affidavit to indicate why her admission in her email dated 14
                    October 2013 should not be read literally as far as the money advanced for the
                        <em>V on Shenton unit</em> is concerned. It will be
                    recalled that the defendant said the following in her 14 October 2013 email:
                    “As for the LV, and Shenton you said it was on loan right? So, i will pay
                    you back as soon as I am in better financial situation.” The
                    defendant’s explanation in her affidavit of the underlying context to this
                    statement is confined to the <em>Langston Ville
                        unit</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> In other words, the defendant has not even
                    asserted on oath that she made this statement in her 14 October 2013 in
                    connection with the <em>V on Shenton unit</em> in an
                    attempt to shame the plaintiff into rising to the occasion as a gentleman and
                    acknowledging that the money he had advanced her towards the purchase price of
                    the <em>V on Shenton unit</em> was a gift. There is
                    therefore no evidential basis on which to read the admission in the 14 October
                    2013 email as regards the <em>V on Shenton unit</em>
                    anything other than literally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Second, taking the defendant’s case at
                    face value, she has offered absolutely no basis, rational or otherwise, to
                    explain why the plaintiff would have advanced her a total sum of $205,000
                    towards the purchase price of the V on Shenton unit, but would have classified
                    only $105,000 of that advance as a loan and the remaining $100,000 as a gift.
                    This is all the more puzzling given that the plaintiff advanced the money for
                    the V on Shenton unit to the defendant in three tranches of $50,000 on 13 August
                    2012, $5,000 on 21 August 2012 and $150,000 on 6 November 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> The
                    defendant’s repayments of $100,000 on 19 December 2012 and $5,000 on 27
                    February 2013 bear no relationship to any of these tranches, whether as to
                    amounts or as to dates, and whether taken alone or in combination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     For these reasons, I consider that the
                    Assistant Registrar was correct in entering judgment against the defendant for
                    the balance sum of $100,000 owing on the loan for the V on Shenton unit. I
                    therefore leave his decision on this claim undisturbed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Claim 4: advance of $5,000 on 13 July 2013</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The defendant admits that claim 4 was indeed a
                    loan. Although the path from this claim to judgment on it was not smooth (see
                    [87]–[88] below), the Assistant Registrar was sufficiently satisfied on
                    this point to enter judgment against her for this sum of $5,000 on 4 April
                    2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The defendant repaid the plaintiff this sum of
                    $5,000 on 18 June 2014, after judgment had been entered against her, conceding
                    that it was by then due and payable.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> Claim 4 has therefore not only been
                    admitted and adjudicated, it has been satisfied. I therefore need say nothing
                    further about it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     The Assistant Registrar was correct to have
                    entered judgment against the defendant for claim 4. I therefore leave his
                    decision on this claim undisturbed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Claims 5 and 6: conditional leave to defend</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The evidence which the plaintiff relies on to
                    support claim 5 is the defendant’s text message she sent to the plaintiff
                    on the day of the transfer. In that text message she says: “…
                    thank you for everything. I owe you a lot, sighhh”. The plaintiff invites
                    me to construe this as a specific admission of a <em>financial</em> and <em>legal</em> debt of $5,000
                    to the plaintiff, and not merely as a general allusion to a <em>moral</em> or <em>social</em> debt which she
                    owes him. I accept the defendant’s submission that this text message is
                    not an unequivocal admission that the sum advanced by the plaintiff to the
                    defendant on that day is a loan. In the absence of anything which can be
                    construed as an admission on its face in relation to this claim, I accept that
                    the plaintiff’s case on claim 5 comes down to a direct conflict of oral
                    evidence. The plaintiff has no evidence other than his own self-serving
                    statement to support claim 6. It is one which therefore ought to go to trial in
                    the ordinary way.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     For this reason, I consider that the defendant
                    is entitled to leave to defend claims 5 and 6.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conditional leave to defend</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Why impose a condition</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     I now consider the form of the leave to defend
                    which I should grant the defendant on claims 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The classic formulation is that conditional
                    leave to defend is the appropriate order when the defendant has succeeded in
                    showing a reasonable probability of a real or <em>bona
                        fide</em> defence which ought to be tried, but that defence is
                    shadowy. Characterising a defence as shadowy is as much a matter of impression
                    as it is of analysis. If one tries to capture that characterisation in words,
                    one can say that a defence is shadowy if the defendant’s evidence is
                    barely sufficient to rise to the level of showing a reasonable probability of a
                        <em>bona fide</em> defence. Alternatively, one can say
                    a defence is shadowy if the evidence is such that the plaintiff has very nearly
                    succeeded in securing judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The modern English approach to this question
                    is drawn from paragraph 4 of Practice Direction 24 which accompanies Part 24 of
                    the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (SI 1998 No 3132) (UK) (“CPR”).
                    Part 24 of the CPR is the successor to Order 14 of the Rules of the Supreme
                    Court 1965 (SI 1965 No 1776) (UK), from which our Order 14 is taken. Paragraph 4
                    reads as follows: “Where it appears to the court possible that a ...
                    defence may succeed but improbable that it will do so, the court may make a
                    conditional order ...”. It is true that Part 24 of the CPR is
                    considerably different from both the old English Order 14 and our Order 14, not
                    least because there is no longer a concept of leave to defend under the CPR. It
                    is also true that there is no express basis for the modern English approach in
                    our own Rules of Court or Practice Directions. However, I consider that the
                    words of O 14 r 4(1) and the very wide discretion that it confers are more than
                    wide enough to accommodate the modern English approach as a useful alternative
                    to the more conventional “shadowy defence”
                formulation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     On claims 1, 2 and 7, I consider it
                    appropriate to impose a condition on the defendant’s leave to defend. In
                    my view, the plaintiff has a strong case on these three claims in light of the
                    defendant’s admission on the face of her 14 October 2013 email read with
                    the substantial documentary evidence of its subtext and context that the
                    plaintiff has produced. That makes it appear to me that, while there is a
                    possibility that the defendant will succeed at trial in showing – whether
                    through oral evidence or through discovery – a different subtext or
                    context to her admissions, it seems to me improbable that she will do so.
                    Nothing I say now about the possibility or the probability of the defendant
                    succeeding at trial should, of course, be taken as pre-empting the outcome of
                    that trial. I have said what I have said simply to explain why it appears to me
                    just to grant the defendant, whom I have found to have succeeded in raising a
                    triable issue, conditional rather than unconditional leave to
                defend.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     On claim 5 and 6, I also consider it
                    appropriate to impose a condition on the defendant’s leave to defend. I
                    say this because I have serious difficulties with the overall credibility of the
                    defendant which lead me to doubt her bare denials of these two claims. I
                    summarise these difficulties at [85]–[88] below. These difficulties leave
                    me with the overriding impression that the defendant’s defences on claims
                    5 and 6 – and indeed also on claims 1, 2 and 7 – are
                shadowy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defendant’s credibility is suspect</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The defendant admits only what she is compelled to admit</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     It appears to me that the defendant is playing
                    a tactical game of admitting only what she is forced to admit. She has done this
                    on at least two occasions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     First, in her defence, she pleads that all of
                    the sums advanced by the plaintiff to her were gifts, save for the $105,000
                    which she has repaid. She offers no rational basis in her defence, in her
                    affidavits or in her submissions as to why this sum of $105,000 – which
                    she accepts is a loan – is distinguishable from the rest of the sums which
                    the plaintiff advanced to her. The inference I draw is that the true distinction
                    is nothing more than the fact that the defendant has repaid these sums and that
                    the defendant’s pleaded admission comes about not because she wishes to be
                    candid with the court, but because she realises that she cannot plausibly deny
                    that the amount she has repaid was a loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Second, the defendant denies in her defence
                    that the sum of $5,000 advanced under claim 4 was a loan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> But when the
                    plaintiff applied for summary judgment and filed his affidavit in support, he
                    exhibited her admission by text message that this sum was indeed a loan. The
                    defendant then accepted in her affidavit in response<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> that this sum was
                    a loan, contradicting her pleadings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     That was not, however, the end of the
                    defendant’s changes of position on claim 4. At the hearing of the summary
                    judgment application on 2 April 2014, the defendant through counsel accepted
                    unequivocally that the sum of $5,000 comprised in claim 4 was a loan and
                    indicated unequivocally that the defendant was prepared for judgment to be
                    entered against her in that amount. However, when the parties next appeared
                    before the Assistant Registrar just two days later on 4 April 2014, the
                    defendant’s position had changed yet again. Now, she took the position
                    through counsel that although she had admitted in her affidavit that this
                    advance was a loan, she had not admitted in her affidavit that the loan was
                        <em>due and payable</em>. The allegation that claim 5
                    comprised a loan which was not due and payable was a point which she had never
                    raised in her defence or in her affidavit and appeared to be one which had
                    occurred to her between 2 April 2014 and 4 April 2014. As a result, her
                    counsel’s instructions on 4 April 2014 were that, because she had never
                    admitted that the loan was due and payable, she was unequivocally opposed to
                    judgment being entered against her for this amount.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> The Assistant Registrar nevertheless entered
                    judgment against her for this amount. She eventually repaid the loan on 18 June
                    2014, asserting as I have said, that she accepted that it had then become due
                    and payable.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The defendant amends her affidavit to withdraw an admission</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     The defendant has also attempted to withdraw a
                    critical admission on claim 3. In paragraphs 25 and 26 of her first affidavit,
                    the defendant admitted that the entire sum of $205,000 comprised in claim 3 was
                    a loan:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25.    The Plaintiff knows that I have every intention of
                            paying back the sum of $205,000 for the acquisition of the V on Shenton
                            Unit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26.    In fact, I had made a repayment of $100,000 on 19
                            December 2012 and $5,000 on 27 February 2013. This was admitted by the
                            Plaintiff in paragraph 6 of his Statement of Claim, and at paragraph 13
                            of his 1<sup>st</sup> affidavit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The defendant then withdrew this admission in
                    her supplementary affidavit filed a week before her summary judgment application
                    was heard. In her supplementary affidavit, she characterises the admission in
                    paragraph 25 of her first affidavit as “a typographical error” and
                    says that paragraph 25 should be amended by replacing the figure
                    “$205,000” with “$105,000”. The effect of that
                    amendment, of course, is to confine herself to admitting only that she took a
                    loan of $105,000 (not $205,000) and asserting that she has repaid it in full
                    (not in part only).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Paragraph 25 of the defendant’s first
                    affidavit as amended does not sit well with paragraph 26 of that affidavit. As
                    originally drafted, these two paragraphs read together make perfect sense. The
                    defendant admits that the entirety of claim 3 is a loan, asserts that she has
                    every intention of repaying all of the $205,000 lent and deposes that she has in
                    fact made a part repayment of $105,000 out of that $205,000 long before the
                    litigation commenced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The amendment to these paragraphs is intended
                    to make them refer to a loan of only $105,000 which has been fully repaid. But
                    they do not read that way easily or naturally. As amended, the first paragraph
                    speaks of the defendant’s <em>present intention</em>
                    to repay $105,000 to the plaintiff. A present intention to repay can only be in
                    respect of a <em>future</em> repayment. One cannot have a
                    present intention to repay that which has already been repaid. But paragraph 26
                    then speaks of a repayment of $105,000 which has already taken
                place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The plaintiff submits that what happened is
                    this. The defendant’s initial strategy was to admit only what could be
                    proved. So she took the position in her defence that she borrowed only as much
                    as she had repaid. The defendant then saw the plaintiff’s affidavit. She
                    realised that he had proof, in the form of her admission in the 14 October 2013
                    email, that the advance of $205,000 for the V on Shenton unit was a loan.
                    Consistent with her strategy, she decided to accept that the entire amount
                    comprised in claim 3 was a loan and said so in her affidavit. She then realised
                    that she could rely on the context to the 14 October 2013 email as a plausible
                    basis on which to deny that the admissions should read literally and as a
                    convenient pretext for trial. So she had a change of heart and changed her
                    position again. I have no way to determine on affidavits alone whether the
                    plaintiff’s theory is indeed what happened.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     As against this, the defendant’s counsel
                    explained before the Assistant Registrar that the change came about because of a
                    typographical error on his firm’s part. Coming from counsel, I readily
                    take that explanation at face value. But that explains only why the figure
                    originally read “$205,000” rather than “$105,000”.
                    It is for the defendant to go on and explain what precisely she meant in the
                    following paragraph, given the disconnect I have identified above caused by
                    changing the figure in paragraph 25. No such explanation was forthcoming or
                    foreshadowed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     For this reason too, I consider the
                    defendant’s credibility suspect.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">No basis to appropriate the $105,000 repayment as the defendant
                does</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     The defendant has offered no basis whatsoever
                    for appropriating her repayment of $105,000 to the loan for the V on Shenton
                    unit. I have made the point above that the amounts of the two repayments which
                    the plaintiff made cannot be matched to the amounts of the three tranches in
                    which the plaintiff advanced funds for the V on Shenton unit. The plaintiff
                    makes the point that these sums were referable, not to the loans for the V on
                    Shenton unit, but to the overall state of the defendant’s indebtedness to
                    the plaintiff. The fact of the repayments is then circumstantial evidence that
                    the defendant thereby acknowledged a larger debt to the plaintiff. There is
                    force in the plaintiff’s submission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     This is yet another instance in which the
                    defendant’s case raised questions rather than dispelling them, thereby
                    contributing to the overall impression that her defence is
                shadowy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The defendant has access to documents</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     The defendant asserts that there are
                    “many relevant documents” (see [23] above) to prove her case which
                    she does not have because she has deleted them. She asserts also that the
                    plaintiff <em>does</em> have these documents but is
                    suppressing them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> There are four reasons why these assertions are
                    not credible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     First, there are no obvious signs in the
                    documents which the plaintiff has produced that there are other documents
                    unfavourable to his case which he has suppressed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Second, if what the defendant says is true,
                    she should at least be able to <em>describe</em> one or
                    more of these “many relevant documents”, even if she cannot
                    produce the documents because she has deleted them. But the defendant does not
                    even do that. Bereft of any such details, the defendant’s assertion that
                    such documents exist, let alone have been suppressed, is of little
                    weight.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Third, despite her claim that she no longer
                    has possession of any such documents, the defendant has been able to produce and
                    exhibit in her affidavit: (i) a card from the plaintiff to her dated 22 November
                        2007;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> (ii) an
                    email from the plaintiff to her dated 5 August 2009;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> and (iii) another
                    card from the plaintiff to her dated 25 November 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span> Her blanket
                    assertion that she has deleted “<em>all</em> the
                    messages and emails” therefore rings somewhat hollow.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Fourth, as I have mentioned above, the
                    plaintiff offered to source and pay, in the first instance, for computer
                    specialists who could recover her deleted text messages and emails.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> The defendant
                    failed entirely to respond to this offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Defendant alludes to further oral evidence but does not produce
                it</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    It is for a defendant who wishes to meet her
                    tactical burden on a summary judgment application to bring forward all the
                    evidence necessary to support the grounds on which she says she should be
                    granted unconditional leave to defend. Evidence in this sense includes not just
                    documentary evidence but also the defendant’s own evidence given on oath
                    or affirmation in her affidavits. That type of evidence is still evidence, even
                    if it will be slight weight if uncorroborated and unsupported by documents.
                    Weight is an entirely separate issue. But if that evidence is not adduced at
                    all, it can carry no weight at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    A defendant cannot hope to secure
                    unconditional leave to defend by saying simply that she has oral evidence to
                    give which will defeat the plaintiff’s claim, but that she will give that
                    oral evidence at trial once she has been granted unconditional leave to defend.
                    That is to put the horse after the cart. That is precisely what the defendant
                    does. In her first affidavit, she says this:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There are many events in our relationship which when heard, I say will
                        show that the monies he claims were not loans. This will be oral evidence.
                        After all, the relationship spanned over 6 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    If the defendant has oral evidence to give
                    at trial about these “many events” which show that the
                    plaintiff’s advances to her were not loans but were gifts, she should set
                    that oral evidence out in detail in her affidavits opposing the
                    plaintiff’s summary judgment application. She cannot manufacture a triable
                    issue by making a cryptic allusion to unspecified oral evidence in her affidavit
                    while holding back the oral evidence itself for trial and asking the court to
                    wait and see what it is.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    The fact that the defendant has taken this
                    approach, in itself, undermines her credibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Approach to determining the condition to be imposed </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Purpose of the condition</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    For all of these reasons, I consider that
                    the defendant should have only conditional leave to defend claims 1, 2, 5, 6 and
                    7. I now turn to consider what the condition should be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Order 14 r 4(1) allows the court “to
                    give a defendant ... leave to defend the action ... on such terms as to giving
                    security or time or mode of trial or otherwise as it thinks fit”. This
                    gives the court a wide discretion as to the type of condition to impose on a
                    grant of leave to defend to ensure that justice is done in any particular case.
                    As O 14 r 4(1) anticipates, however, the condition imposed typically requires
                    the defendant to provide security in one form or other for all or part of the
                    plaintiff’s claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    There is no starting point for the exercise
                    when the court considers how to exercise its discretion as to the quantum of
                    security to require of a defendant who is to be granted conditional leave to
                    defend under O 14 r 4(1). As the Court of Appeal said in <em>Mohd
                        Zain bin Abdullah v Chimbusco International Petroleum (Singapore) Pte Ltd
                        and another appeal</em> [2014] 2 SLR 446 (“<em>Chimbusco</em>”) at [39]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The court’s discretion … under O14 r 4(1) of the
                        Rules of Court … is unqualified and widely framed. A starting point
                        would detract from the latitude which these provisions seek to grant the
                        court. Further, the court may impose any condition which it sees fit and
                        need not confine itself to ordering that security be provided. We are
                        therefore of the view that the court ought not to begin with any starting
                        point in mind in determining the amount of security to be provided, and
                        should therefore instead exercise its discretion flexibly to meet the needs
                        of the case before it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Requiring a defendant whose defence is
                    shadowy or improbable to furnish security for the claim as a condition of
                    securing leave to defend serves two purposes. First, it requires the defendant
                    to show some degree of commitment to the defence she has advanced before she can
                    have her day in court. That ensures, to the extent that it is possible to do so,
                    that she is not stringing the plaintiff and the court along by advancing shadowy
                    or improbable defences merely to gain the many advantages which accrue to a
                    debtor from delay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    The second purpose of requiring a defendant
                    to furnish security as a condition is to preserve the claimant’s position,
                    to the extent that it is possible to do so, pending trial: <em>Chimbusco</em> at [20]. Security which is provided pursuant to court
                    order is security in the true sense of the word. The secured party has access to
                    that source of payment in priority to all other creditors in the event of the
                    opposing party’s insolvency. That is so whether the security is provided
                    to comply with a condition of leave to defend (<em>Re Ford; ex
                        parte the Trustee</em> [1900] 2 QB 211) or as security for costs
                        (<em>Cheng Lip Kwong v Bangkok Bank Ltd</em> [1992] 1
                    SLR(R) 941).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The factors to bear in mind in fixing the condition</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    The quantum of the security to be required
                    of a defendant must be fixed with the following two factors in mind:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_112-p2_a"></a>(a)     Doing justice to the plaintiff in
                        light of the strength of the plaintiff’s case and the uncertainties
                        attached to the defendant’s defences; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_112-p2_b"></a>(b)     Doing justice to the defendant in light of her
                        financial means.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    In <em>MV Yorke Motors (a
                        firm) v Edwards</em> [1982] 1 WLR 444 (“<em>Yorke Motors</em>”), the House of Lords considered the proper
                    approach to the second of these two factors. In that case, the defendant raised
                    a triable issue, but it was one which had extremely remote prospects of success
                    (at 448G). The case went through all four tiers of the English system. The
                    Master gave the defendant unconditional leave to defend. The judge in chambers
                    granted the defendant leave to defend on condition that he pay £12,000 into
                    court. The Court of Appeal reduced the amount to be paid into court to
                    £3,000. The House of Lords left the Court of Appeal’s decision
                    undisturbed and dismissed the defendant’s final appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    The defendant appealed to the House of Lords
                    on the basis that requiring him to give security for the plaintiff's claim
                    violated the following principle (at 449B):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...if the sum ordered to be paid as a condition of granting leave to
                        defend is one which the defendant would never be able to pay, then that
                        would be a wrongful exercise of discretion, because it would be tantamount
                        to giving judgment for the plaintiff notwithstanding the court’s
                        opinion that there was an issue or question in dispute which ought to be
                        tried.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The House of Lords accepted this principle (at 449C), but held on
                    the facts that requiring the defendant to give security did not violate
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    The evidence in <em>Yorke
                        Motors</em> showed that the defendant had been granted a legal aid
                    certificate with nil contribution, did not own his own home, was unemployed, was
                    in receipt of benefits from the state and could not afford to pay £12,000
                    into court. The evidence also showed that the defendant was engaged in buying
                    and selling motor vehicles for cash, <em>ie</em> that he
                    had a source of income.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Lord Diplock considered all of this evidence
                    and said the following at 449H:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... as Brandon L.J. pointed out:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“The fact that the man has no capital of his own does not mean
                            that he cannot raise any capital; he may have friends, he may have
                            business associates, he may have relatives, all of whom can help him in
                            his hour of need.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All that [the defendant] himself had sworn was: “I do not have
                        £12,000 nor is there any likelihood of my raising that <em>or any similar sum</em>” (my emphasis). I can see
                        no reason why the Court of Appeal should not be entitled to infer that,
                        although it might be difficult, it would not be impossible for [the
                        defendant] to find security, if his defence were put forward in good faith;
                        nor do I see any ground on which this House could interfere with the way in
                        which the Court of Appeal exercised the discretion ... by fixing £3,000
                        as the appropriate amount of security”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    In the course of his judgment, Lord Diplock
                    endorsed as correct the following three propositions advanced by the plaintiff
                    (at 449C):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(i) Where a defendant seeks to avoid or limit a financial condition by
                        reason of his own impecuniosity the onus is upon the defendant to put
                        sufficient and proper evidence before the court. He should make full and
                        frank disclosure. (ii) It is not sufficient for a legally aided defendant to
                        rely on there being a legal aid certificate. A legally aided defendant with
                        a nil contribution may be able to pay or raise substantial sums. (iii) A
                        defendant cannot complain because a financial condition is difficult for him
                        to fulfil. He can complain only when a financial condition is imposed which
                        it is impossible for him to fulfil and that impossibility was known or
                        should have been known to the court by reason of the evidence placed before
                        it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    From <em>Yorke
                        Motors</em>, I distil the following three principles which guide me in
                    considering the second of the two factors I have identified at [112]
                    above:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_118-p2_a"></a>(a)     Having decided to grant a defendant
                        leave to defend, it is wrong in principle to impose a condition on that
                        leave which the defendant would find impossible – as opposed to merely
                        difficult – to comply with;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_118-p2_b"></a>(b)     The defendant bears the burden, in every sense of the
                        word, of showing that it would be impossible – as opposed to merely
                        difficult – to comply with a condition which the court proposes to
                        impose on the leave to defend;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_118-p2_c"></a>(c)     In discharging that burden, the defendant has a duty
                        fully and frankly to disclose her financial position to the court;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_118-p2_d"></a>(d)     In
                        considering whether it is impossible – as opposed to merely difficult
                        – for the defendant to comply with the condition, it is legitimate to
                        have regard not just to the defendant’s own financial resources, but
                        also to the financial resources of those who might reasonably be expected to
                        extend financial assistance to her in her hour of need.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    I also note from the facts of <em>Yorke Motors</em> just how high the burden on the defendant
                    is to show that the condition imposed is impossible, as opposed to being merely
                    difficult. If the defendant in that case was unable to show that the condition
                    imposed was impossible as opposed to merely difficult, all but the utterly
                    impecunious will find it extremely difficult to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    The approach in <em>Yorke
                        Motors</em> was approved by the Court of Appeal in <em>Chimbusco</em> at [20]. It has also been followed in a number of
                    first instance cases including <em>International Bank of
                        Singapore Ltd v Bader</em> [1989] 1 MLJ 214; and <em>Citibank NA v Lim Soo Peng and Another</em> [2004] SGHC 266. I adopt
                    it in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant should furnish security for the entire claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    In the circumstances of this case, I
                    consider it just that the defendant ought, as a condition of obtaining leave to
                    defend, secure the plaintiff for the entirety of his claim. The value of the
                    plaintiff’s unadjudicated claim is $398,300. This is the total value of
                    claims 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7. I have left claim 3 out of account because I have not
                    allowed the defendant any sort of leave to defend that claim, adjudging her
                    liable to pay this sum. I have left claim 4 out of account because the defendant
                    no longer contests that claim and, indeed, has satisfied it in
                full.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    In the procedural history of this case, I
                    actually arrived at this decision on two separate occasions. The first occasion
                    was immediately after hearing the parties’ submissions on the appeal
                    against the Assistant Registrar’s decision. At that time, the defendant
                    had not placed any material before me about her financial means. The second
                    occasion was after acceding to a request by the defendant to present further
                    arguments to me as to why her leave to defend should not be subject to
                    conditions. I explain the grounds for my decision at each point in
                time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">My initial order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    I arrived at my initial order for the
                    following reasons. On the first of the two factors, as I have said, I had
                    serious doubts about the credibility of the defendant’s bare denials of
                    the entirety of the plaintiff's remaining unadjudicated claims. In addition, I
                    came very close to granting the plaintiff judgment on claims 1, 2 and 7. To my
                    mind, the plaintiff had fallen just short of securing an immediate judgment in
                    his favour for very nearly the full sum of $398,300.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    As for the second factor, it is true that I
                    did not have before me at that time any evidence on which to assess the
                    defendant’s financial means. But the defendant’s counsel did not ask
                    me to defer my decision in order for her to have an opportunity to place any
                    such evidence before me. And I did not consider that the defendant was taken by
                    surprise by an order for conditional leave. The plaintiff had put the defendant
                    on notice at the hearing before the Assistant Registrar that he would seek an
                    order for conditional lave to defend if he did not succeed in securing
                        judgment<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span> (<em>cf Anglo-Eastern Trust
                        Limited &amp; Anor v Roohallah Kermanshahchi</em> [2002] EWCA Civ 198
                    at [41] <em>per</em> Park J and [70] <em>per</em> Brooke LJ).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    On the merits of the second factor, I did
                    not, in making my initial decision, consider that a condition that the defendant
                    secure the entirety of the plaintiff’s unadjudicated claim would be
                    impossible – as opposed to be merely difficult – for her to fulfil
                    for four reasons. First, the amount of the security, $398,300, did not appear to
                    be a large sum when compared to the other sums that defendant dealt in. This
                    included the sum of $105,000 which the defendant had, by her own admission,
                    borrowed from and repaid to the plaintiff within a matter of months. This
                    included also the defendant’s financial commitment in contracting to
                    purchase the V on Shenton unit. Second, there was evidence before me that the
                    defendant is a property agent and earning an income of the same order of
                    magnitude as the security I was to order (see [30] above). Third, it appeared to
                    me to be reasonable to expect the defendant to be able to turn at least to her
                    new husband for assistance in fulfilling the condition. Finally, I was prepared
                    to give the defendant the option of returning the car to the plaintiff and
                    providing security reduced in value by $120,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    Bearing all of the above in mind, and
                    applying the principles distilled from <em>Yorke
                        Motors</em>, I considered it only just that the defendant show her
                    commitment to her defence by providing security for the full amount of the
                    plaintiff’s unadjudicated claim so that the plaintiff would not be
                    prejudiced by the inevitable delay in proceeding to trial on a claim which, on
                    my assessment, he was likely to succeed in. I did, however, provide that if the
                    defendant restored the car to the plaintiff’s possession, she need furnish
                    security only for $278,300, <em>ie</em> for the
                    unadjudicated claim of $398,300 less the value of the sum advanced for the
                    car.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">My initial order stands despite further arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    Following my order granting the defendant
                    conditional leave to defend, the defendant sought an opportunity to present
                    further arguments on the condition imposed and sought to leave to place evidence
                    of her financial position before me. I acceded to both requests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    The defendant submits that the evidence she
                    has placed before me shows that it is impossible – and not merely
                    difficult – for her to comply with the condition which I have attached to
                    her leave to defend. To support her submissions, she gives evidence to the
                    following effect:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_128-p2_a"></a>(a)     Her assets and liabilities are such
                        that, assuming that she sells both the Langston Ville unit and the V on
                        Shenton unit within 6 months, her net asset position will be only
                        $205,602.96 at the end of that period. That is substantially less than the
                        amount of security she needs to provide in order to defend the
                            claim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_128-p2_b"></a>(b)     Her income and expenditure is such that her
                            income<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span> is far less than her monthly
                        expenditure of $10,668.83.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_128-p2_c"></a>(c)     Her husband, relatives and friends
                        are all unable to help her financially.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    Having considered the defendant’s
                    evidence and both parties’ submissions, I decline to vary my original
                    order. I come to this decision for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    First, the plaintiff underlines her lack of
                    credibility by revealing only at this late stage that she sold the car for
                        $108,700<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> on 6 March 2014. That was two weeks after the
                    plaintiff filed his summary judgment application, well before the
                    plaintiff’s summary judgment application came up for hearing before the
                    Assistant Registrar and long before the parties’ appeals came up for
                    hearing before me. Yet, the plaintiff failed to inform her counsel of this
                    important fact and permitted him to make his submissions to the Assistant
                    Registrar and to me on the basis that she was still in possession of the car and
                    in a position to return it if ordered to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    Second, the defendant claims monthly
                    expenditure of almost $11,000. But her evidence, if true, means that she is
                    sustaining this level of expenditure with no visible means of support. She
                    cannot be sustaining it out of income. Her solicitors’ letter seeking an
                    opportunity to present further arguments asserts that she earned only $15,104 in
                    the first six months of 2014.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span> It is equally clear that she
                    is not sustaining this level of expenditure out of savings. The only bank
                    account which she has disclosed which is in credit is a single account with POSB
                    said to have a balance of only $5,605.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span> Even then, she
                    produces no bank statements for this account to show movements in it since the
                    litigation began. There is also no explanation of how she is funding her legal
                    fees for this action. Those sums are not included in her monthly expenditure of
                    almost $11,000 per month.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span> It appears to me that the
                    defendant must have, on the balance of probabilities, a source of income, a
                    source of savings or a source of credit, if not all three, that she has not
                    revealed and which is sustaining her level of expenditure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    Third, the defendant has not explained what
                    has happened to all the income she has earned over the years. Her income tax
                    notice of assessment for income earned in the calendar year 2012 shows that she
                    earned over $72,000 in that year.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span> She also produces a table prepared by
                    her employer, Carence Pte Ltd, showing that she earned over $106,000 in
                    commissions on real estate transactions in the nine months between February and
                    November 2013.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span>
                    She has not produced an income tax notice of assessment for the calendar year
                    2013. She offers no explanation for not producing this notice of assessment. I
                    have no way of knowing whether that is all the income that she earned in the
                    calendar year 2013 or what has become of the money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    Fourth, on 21 May 2013, the defendant
                    committed to a housing loan to purchase the V on Shenton unit at a price of
                        $1.027m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span>
                    The quantum of the loan was 60% of the purchase price. The plaintiff advanced
                    $205,000, or approximately 20% of the purchase price, to the defendant between
                    August and November 2012. The implication is that when she committed to this
                    loan on 21 May 2013, she either had the balance 20% – approximately
                    $205,000 – or she was confident of being able to raise that money to fund
                    the progress payments until she could draw down on the loan. But she offers no
                    explanation as to why she says it is impossible for her to raise any funds at
                    all to satisfy the condition attached to the leave to defend I have extended to
                    her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    Fifth, the defendant fails to explain what
                    has become of substantial sums of money which on her own evidence she has
                    received. She offers no explanation of what has become of the $108,700 which she
                    collected upon the sale of the car in March 2014. Her own evidence also shows
                    that, in or about November 2013 and February 2014, she drew close to $100,000 in
                    two tranches from an unsecured credit facility with her bank.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span> She offers
                    no explanation also as to what has become of this sum. Her counsel suggested in
                    submission that the money from the sale of the car was used to fund her day to
                    day expenses and that the money drawn from the bank’s credit facility was
                    drawn to fund an imminent payment for the V on Shenton unit. But there is
                    nothing in the defendant’s own affidavit to support these
                    submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    Sixth, the defendant includes in her
                    statement of liabilities full provision for the almost $100,000 in loans she has
                    drawn down on her unsecured line of credit. But the bank statements she has
                    produced show that these loans are not immediately due and repayable but are
                    repayable by monthly instalments over 5 years. There is therefore no reason for
                    her to deduct them in full from her assets. Doing so shows an artificially
                    depressed net asset position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    Her decision to treat the entire amount of
                    these loans as a liability that is immediately due and repayable despite the
                    bank’s instalment payment plan amounts to her statement that she would
                    prefer to pay that sum of money to her bank than to use it towards showing her
                    commitment to her defence in these proceedings. That indicates neither
                    difficulty nor impossibility in complying with the condition. It indicates
                    rather a conscious choice to allocate her financial resources so as to present
                    the picture that it is impossible for her to be able to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    Seventh, the defendant makes a bare
                    assertion that her husband, relatives and friends are all unable to help her:
                        <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_93" id="Ftn_93_1"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have also asked my husband, relatives and friends for help. They are
                        limited financially and are unable to provide me with the sums to meet the
                        financial conditions imposed on me by the honourable court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I note specifically that the defendant’s assertion is that
                    all of these people are <em>unable</em> to help her, not
                    that they are <em>unwilling</em> to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    I give this bald assertion no weight for
                    three reasons. First, I would have expected to see an affidavit from the
                    defendant’s husband (at the very least) to explain why he is unable to
                    render financial assistance to his wife. After all, if her commitment to her
                    defence is well founded, the security will be at no risk at all. In the absence
                    of an affidavit from her husband, I would have expected to see an explanation
                    from the defendant why she could not obtain such an affidavit. I have neither
                    before me. Second, the defendant gives no details whatsoever of her attempts to
                    secure funding either from her husband or from her friends and relatives. Third,
                    the doubts I already entertained about the defendant’s credibility when I
                    made my initial order were reinforced by her subsequent disclosure to me that
                    she had sold the car in March 2014. That meant that she had been far less than
                    straightforward with the court, and even with her own counsel, when the matter
                    was initially argued. For these reasons, the defendant’s bald assertion
                    that her husband, friends and relatives are unable to help her carries no
                    weight.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    Finally, the defendant gives evidence that,
                    after my initial decision, she satisfied the judgment in favour of the plaintiff
                    on claim 3 by paying him the sum of $100,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span> She does
                    not explain where this money came from. I note also that she paid this amount
                    – like the $5,000 – only when judgment was entered against her for
                    it. She also does not explain how her ability to pay this amount is consistent
                    with her disclosed financial position and with her assertion that her husband
                    and her friends and relatives are all unable to assist her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    For all these reasons, I find that the
                    defendant has failed to make the requisite full and frank disclosure of her
                    financial position. I find also that the defendant has failed to satisfy me on
                    the balance of probabilities that it is impossible – as opposed to merely
                    difficult – for her to furnish security to the plaintiff in the sum of
                    $398,300.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    For all these reasons, I have dismissed the
                    defendant’s appeal against the judgment entered by the Assistant Registrar
                    on claims 3 and 4. I have allowed the plaintiff’s appeal and granted the
                    defendant conditional leave to defend claims 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7, the condition
                    being that she furnish security to the plaintiff for the amount of $398,300 by a
                    banker's guarantee or solicitors’ undertaking within 30 days. Not knowing
                    when I made the order that the defendant had sold the car, I have also given the
                    defendant the alternative of returning the car to the plaintiff and furnishing
                    security to the plaintiff in the reduced amount of $278,300.</p>
