The funding application is opposed by the defendants to that litigation. The determination of the application turns on a consideration of the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) (“Bankruptcy Act”), the English decision in <span class="font-italic">In r</span><span class="font-italic">e Oasis Merchandising Services Ltd </span>[1998] Ch 170 (“<span class="font-italic">Oasis</span>”) (which was followed by the Singapore Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Neo Corp</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Neocorp Innovations Pte Ltd </span>[2006] 2 SLR(R) 717 (“<span class="font-italic">Neocorp</span>”)), and the effect of the 2017 amendments to the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“Civil Law Act”), which permits third-party litigation funding in respect of international arbitration, amongst other forms of dispute resolution.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The trustees of the bankruptcy estate of Fan Kow Hin (“the Trustees”) are proceeding with a suit, High Court Suit No 1078 of 2017, against various defendants, seeking, amongst other things, the avoidance of transactions at an undervalue and unfair preferences under the relevant provisions of the Bankruptcy Act (referred to generally and specifically as “the clawback claims”). The applicant Trustees now seek the Court’s approval of an agreement assigning and selling a proportion of the benefits or proceeds of the clawback claims. The defendants to the clawback claims were present at the hearing of the funding application as non-parties (“the Non-Parties”). By consent, they were allowed to make submissions albeit only on the specific questions of whether the fruits of insolvency clawback claims may be assigned and whether such an assignment would be champertous or an abuse of process. The merits of the funding application are to be heard separately, without the involvement of the Non-Parties.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Trustees’ case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Trustees argued that the assignment of the fruits of an insolvency clawback claim is permitted by law. First, the Trustees submit that the English decision of <span class="font-italic">Oasis</span> should not have been followed, as unlike the statutory regime prevailing in England at the time <span class="font-italic">Oasis </span>was decided, s 102(4) of our Bankruptcy Act expressly provides that the proceeds of  clawback claims under ss 98 or 99 shall be comprised in the bankrupt’s estate. These proceeds can be alienated. Second, the courts in Singapore should adopt the position in Australia, which permits the assignment of the proceeds of statutory claims. Third, the assignment proposed in the present case is not champertous or an abuse of process. Fourth, the proceeds are capable of assignment at law.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Non-Parties’ case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 As the 2017 amendments to the Civil Law Act only permit third-party funding for international arbitration and related court and mediation proceedings, other forms of third-party funding remained subject to the rule against maintenance and champerty. <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Vanguard Energy Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 4 SLR 597 (“<span class="font-italic">Vanguard</span>”), in which it was held that maintenance and champerty did not apply to a liquidator’s exercise of the power of sale under s 272(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Companies Act”), had been superseded by the 2017 amendments to the Civil Law Act, which allows third-party funding only in respect of international arbitration and related court and mediation proceedings. Second, the clawback claims arose out of rights personal to the Trustees – rights personal to liquidators are not covered by the exception in <span class="font-italic">Vanguard </span>as they are not the property of the company and cannot be assigned. Third, any development in the law on assignment of the proceeds of litigation should be left to Parliament. Last, should the court be minded to permit the assignment, the criteria laid down in <span class="font-italic">Vanguard</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>should be applied in determining whether such an assignment would be champertous.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The application is allowed. Under the Bankruptcy Act, the fruits of the litigation are property of the estate, and may be assigned by the trustees: see s 102(4) of the Bankruptcy Act. Even if it were not, such an assignment is not contrary to public policy as being champertous or in maintenance as it is aimed at providing access to justice in the context of an insolvency, in which no other option for litigation funding would be viable.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the proceeds of clawback claims constitute property of the bankrupt’s estate under the Bankruptcy Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The question of whether the proceeds of clawback claims under the Bankruptcy Act form part of the bankrupt’s estate turns on the interpretation of the statutory framework governing such claims under the Bankruptcy Act. On a proper construction of those provisions, I am satisfied that such proceeds are indeed property of the estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The parties’ submissions centre on ss 78(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 102(4) of the Bankruptcy Act, both of which deal with the composition of the bankruptcy estate:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Description of bankrupt’s property divisible among creditors</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">78.</span>—(1) The property of the bankrupt divisible among his creditors (referred to in this Act as the bankrupt’s estate) shall comprise —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) all such property as belongs to or is vested in the bankrupt at the commencement of his bankruptcy <span class="font-italic">or is acquired by or devolves on him before his discharge</span>…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Orders under sections 98 and 99</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">102.</span>—(1) Without prejudice to the generality of sections 98(2) and 99(2), an order under either of those sections with respect to a transaction or preference entered into or given by an individual who is subsequently adjudged bankrupt may, subject to this section —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) require any property transferred as part of the transaction, or in connection with the giving of the preference, to be vested in the Official Assignee;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) <span class="font-italic">Any sums required to be paid to the Official Assignee in accordance with an order under section 98 or 99 shall be comprised in the bankrupt’s estate.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The Trustees’ argument is that the proceeds of clawback claims are property of the bankrupt which may be alienated under the Bankruptcy Act by law; as such, no question of champerty or maintenance arises. The proceeds of claims for undue preferences and undervalue transactions under ss 98 and 99 comprise part of the bankrupt’s estate under s 102(4) of the Bankruptcy Act, and are thus available for division amongst the creditors under s 78(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of that same Act (which in fact expressly provides that after-acquired property also forms part of the bankrupt’s estate). The Non-Parties referred to the decision of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Manharlal Trikamdas Mody and </span><span class="font-italic">another v Sumikin Bussan International (HK) Ltd </span>[2014] 3 SLR 1161 (“<span class="font-italic">Sumikin</span>”), where it was held that the right to enforce statutory moratoria was personal to the Official Assignee and therefore incapable of assignment at law (at [32], [54]–[55]). That case can be distinguished as it was concerned only with the assignment of rights to enforce moratoria <span class="font-italic">under ss 76 and 105 of the Bankruptcy Act</span>, and not the assignment of the proceeds of clawback claims. A further distinction between <span class="font-italic">Sumikin</span> and the present case is that what is sought to be assigned is not the <span class="font-italic">right </span>to sue under ss 98 and 99, but only the <span class="font-italic">proceeds </span>of any successful suit thereunder. Such proceeds cannot be said to be <span class="font-italic">rights</span> personal to the trustees in bankruptcy. Rather, they are assets forming part of the bankruptcy estate. Likewise, <span class="font-italic">Neocorp</span>, the Trustees say, is also distinguishable because it did not concern the assignment of the <span class="font-italic">fruits</span> of litigation, but rather the <span class="font-italic">right</span> to avoid transactions tainted with unfair preference; and in any case involved a corporate insolvency under the Companies Act which, unlike the Bankruptcy Act, does not expressly define sums recovered under ss 98 and 99 as part of the bankruptcy estate. Also, <span class="font-italic">Neocorp </span>itself appeared to suggest that the proceeds from a transaction unwound under ss 98 or 99 would be a general asset of the company (at [25]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The Non-Parties contend that nothing in the Bankruptcy Act permits the assignment of the fruits of litigation as the Trustees’ claims arise out of rights personal to the Trustees which could not be said to form part of the bankruptcy estate. They further argue that the statutory provisions relied upon by the Trustees do not assist, as s 102(4) is predicated on orders under ss 98 or 99 first having been made, whereas no such orders were made here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Section 98 governs transactions at an undervalue; s 98(2) allows the court, upon application by the Official Assignee, to make an order restoring parties to the <span class="font-italic">status quo ante</span>;<span class="font-italic"> ie</span>, the position that would have been had the bankrupt not entered into the transactions at an undervalue. Section 99 provides that similar orders may be made in respect of unfair preferences given. Section 102, which is referred to in ss 98 and 99, is concerned with the orders that are made under ss 98 and 99. It is against that context that s 102(4) then provides that “[a]ny sums required to be paid to the Official Assignee in accordance with an order under section 98 or 99 shall be comprised in the bankrupt’s estate”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 In my view, the plain words of s 102(4) of the Bankruptcy Act clearly contemplate that the proceeds from clawback claims under ss 98 and 99 would be part of the estate, which, as s 78(1) provides, is property that may be divided among the creditors. The fact that no order has been made under ss 98 or 99 is immaterial. I accept that the insolvency clawback proceeds contemplated by s 102(4) would only obtain after an order is made pursuant to ss 98 or 99. However, that does not detract from the Trustees’ point that <span class="font-italic">if and when </span>such orders are made, the proceeds obtained therefrom would form part of the bankruptcy estate under s 102(4) of the Bankruptcy Act. I thus do not accept the arguments of the non-parties that it is necessary for an order under ss 98 and 99 to first have been made. What is material is that ss 78(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 102(4) make it clear that even property acquired post-bankruptcy can be property of the estate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The English decision in </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Oasis</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The primary obstacle in the way of the Trustees’ proposed course of action is the English case of <span class="font-italic">Oasis</span>. That case is authority for the proposition that fruits of a cause of action arising after insolvency are property recoverable only by the liquidator under statutorily-conferred powers, and therefore does not form part of the company’s property in the liquidation. Thus the alienation of such proceeds of litigation as a means of funding that same litigation would be champertous and an abuse of process.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The Trustees argue that <span class="font-italic">Oasis</span> should not be followed as the distinction drawn under English law between property acquired pre- and post-bankruptcy is not recognised in Singapore law, and in any case, was doubted and impliedly overruled by the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Buchler</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Talbot and others</span> [2004] 2 AC 298 (“<span class="font-italic">Buchler</span>”), and is therefore no longer good law. They further argue that <span class="font-italic">Oasis </span>only purported to apply to corporate insolvencies. The Trustees argues that instead, Australian authorities departing from <span class="font-italic">Oasis </span>should be followed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The Non-Parties point out that <span class="font-italic">Oasis</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was followed by the Singapore Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Neocorp </span>and the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Sumikin</span>. In respect of the Australian cases relied upon by the Trustees, these can be distinguished as the Australian corporations law provisions allow the recovery losses or damages resulting from insolvency as a “debt due to the company”. While the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 (c 26) (UK) now expressly  provides for the assignment of causes of action or rights personal to the liquidator, the Non-Parties argue that <span class="font-italic">Oasis </span>still applies in respect of bankruptcy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 I accept that <span class="font-italic">Oasis </span>does not stand for the proposition that proceeds assignable under the Bankruptcy Act would not run afoul of the rules against maintenance and champerty. Rather, <span class="font-italic">Oasis</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>concerned the question of whether the agreement was champertous. In that case, the agreement – to assign the fruits of an action commenced pursuant to a statutory power conferred on the liquidator personally to sue in respect of alleged wrongful trading by the directors – was made under a purported exercise of the liquidators’ statutory power to sell “the company’s property”. In my view, the legal principles to be extracted from <span class="font-italic">Oasis </span>are as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) An assignment of the fruits of litigation operates in equity and if there is consideration will be valid, and will not offend the rule against maintenance or champerty, if the assignee has no right to influence the course of proceedings (at 177, 186).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) There is a distinction between property of the company as at the time of the commencement of the liquidation; and those that arise after the liquidation and recoverable by the liquidator under statutory powers. The latter is not part of the company’s property (at 180–181). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The English statutory provisions did not permit the liquidator to enter into a champertous agreement (at 187).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 In the present case, <span class="font-italic">Oasis</span> is invoked as authority both for the argument that the proposed agreement here offends the policy against champertous agreements, as well as for the argument that the Trustees have no statutory power (which would protect the transaction against all allegations of being champertous) to sell the fruits of the litigation, as those proceeds were not an asset of the estate but a right vested in the Trustees personally.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 It is clear that <span class="font-italic">Oasis </span>is authority for the distinction between property of the company accrued <span class="font-italic">before </span>the liquidation and property subsequently obtained <span class="font-italic">after </span>the commencement of the liquidation by the exercise of rights vested in the liquidator. While there is criticism of this distinction, it is not open to me to go behind the Singapore Court of Appeal’s endorsement of <span class="font-italic">Oasis</span> in <span class="font-italic">Neocorp</span> (at [24]). In the context of bankruptcy, <span class="font-italic">Oasis</span> was followed by the Singapore High Court in <span class="font-italic">Sumikin</span>, which came to the conclusion that the rights under s 76(1) (relating to the statutory moratorium on actions against the person or property of the bankrupt commenced by creditors in respect of a debt), and s 105 (relating to the restriction of the rights of a creditor against the Official Assignee under execution or attachment) are personal to the Official Assignee and not capable of being assigned (<span class="font-italic">Sumikin</span> at [54]). On the facts of that case, the purported assignment of a cause of action was held to be ineffective.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 A point of difference from the present case was that <span class="font-italic">Sumikin</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was not concerned at all with third-party funding insolvency litigation; rather, it looked at the question of who should pursue an action. Thus, the similar but separate question of whether the fruits of the litigation could be considered the property of the bankruptcy estate was not directly engaged. Section 102(4) of the Bankruptcy Act was not examined. In any event, in light of my interpretation of the Bankruptcy Act, I come to the conclusion that <span class="font-italic">Oasis </span>does not apply to Singapore bankruptcies, and, to the extent that <span class="font-italic">Sumikin</span> says otherwise, would respectfully decline to follow <span class="font-italic">Sumikin</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>in this regard. The distinction drawn in <span class="font-italic">Oasis </span>between property acquired pre- and post-insolvency cannot apply to bankruptcies in light of the express provision to the contrary in s 102(4) of the Bankruptcy Act. I did not see anything in <span class="font-italic">Neocorp </span>which would militate against the conclusion that the distinction in <span class="font-italic">Oasis </span>does not apply to bankruptcies. <span class="font-italic">Neocorp </span>was not concerned with the position of an individual bankrupt’s estate under the Bankruptcy Act at all.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 That said, I do not think that the Trustees’ arguments that <span class="font-italic">Buchler</span> has impliedly overruled <span class="font-italic">Oasis</span> takes them very far. <span class="font-italic">Buchler</span> did not concern third-party funding of insolvency litigation, but rather the funding of the liquidation itself. In <span class="font-italic">Buchler</span>, the liquidators claimed that their remuneration should be paid out of the assets of the company in priority to the claims of creditors under a debenture secured by a floating charge.<span class="font-italic"> </span>The House of Lords observed that when a company was both in administrative receivership and liquidation, its former assets are comprised in two separate funds: those subject to the floating charge belonged to the debenture holders, and those that were not subject to the floating charge belonged to the unsecured creditors. The Trustees relied on academic commentary surmising that office-holder recoveries (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> funds recovered by liquidators and bankruptcy trustees) might be understood as falling within the separate liquidators’ fund (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the fund available to the unsecured creditors), in which case <span class="font-italic">Buchler</span> would have impliedly overruled <span class="font-italic">Oasis</span> to the extent that such office-holder recoveries may be considered “property of the company” within the power of sale . It may be that this was what the House of Lords may have had at the back of their Lordships’ minds, but it was not so expressed in <span class="font-italic">Buchler </span>itself. In my view, the commentary was at best a speculation on the possible implications of the ruling in <span class="font-italic">Buchler</span>, and it would go too far to say that <span class="font-italic">Oasis</span> had thereby been overruled.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Additionally, the Trustees referred to Australian case law which took a contrary line even in corporate insolvency cases. In a number of cases including <span class="font-italic">Movitor Pty Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> (Receiver and manager appointed) (In liquidation) v Anthony Milton Sims</span> [1996] FCA 1320 (“<span class="font-italic">Movitor</span>”), <span class="font-italic">Elfic</span><span class="font-italic"> Limited and others v Macks and others </span>[2001] QCA 219 and <span class="font-italic">Cook</span><span class="font-italic"> (Liquidator), in the matter of Italiano Family Fruit Company Pty Ltd (in liq) v Italiano Family Fruit Company Pty Ltd (in liq)</span> [2010] FCA 1355<span class="font-italic">, </span>the proceeds of an action by an insolvent company were regarded as part of the general assets of the company, and <span class="font-italic">Oasis </span>was not followed. I do not consider it open to me to adopt these given the endorsement of <span class="font-italic">Oasis </span>by the Singapore Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Neocorp</span>. I do note that in <span class="font-italic">Vanguard</span> there was consideration of both <span class="font-italic">Oasis </span>and <span class="font-italic">Movitor </span>but this was only in the context of the question whether the exercise of the statutory power of sale under s 272(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Companies Act would attract the application of the rules against maintenance and champerty.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Proposed assignment did not amount to maintenance or champerty</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The Trustees argue that the proposed agreement is not champertous as there would be no surrender of control over the legal proceedings to the assignees. They argue that <span class="font-italic">Vanguard</span> is authority for the proposition that the policy of promoting access to justice calls for such agreements to be given effect.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In my view, the proposed agreement is not champertous so long as the assignee has no control over the conduct of proceedings. <span class="font-italic">Vanguard </span>recognised as early as in 2015 that the ends of justice would be served by allowing third-party litigation funding, and laid down a number of criteria under which the assignment of a bare cause of action or the fruits of such actions would not offend the rules against champerty and maintenance (at [43]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The torts of champerty and maintenance (as well as their respective common law offences) were abolished through the Criminal Law Act 1967 (c 58) (UK), though as noted above, their legal significance as an aspect of public policy still lives on as exemplified by <span class="font-italic">Oasis</span>. The position in Singapore is now similar, with the abolishment in 2017 of liability in tort for maintenance or champerty via s 5A of the Civil Law Act, save that the abolition did not affect any rule of law as to when a contract is treated as being contrary to public policy or illegal.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Even before the amendments, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lim Lie Hoa</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v</span> <span class="font-italic">Ong </span><span class="font-italic">Jane Rebecca</span> [1997] 1 SLR(R) 775 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Lie Hoa</span>”), had already held that an assignment of a cause of action may not be champertous if it is ancillary to a transfer of property or there is genuine interest in the assignment. Relying on, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, <span class="font-italic">Lim Lie Hoa</span>, English cases such as <span class="font-italic">R (</span><span class="font-italic">Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport (No 8)</span> [2003] QB 381, as well as cases from other jurisdictions such as New South Wales and Hong Kong, the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Vanguard</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>held that the doctrine of maintenance and champerty has no application to the exercise of the statutory power of sale under s 272(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Companies Act, which permitted the sale of a cause of action as well as the proceeds from a successful claim upon that cause of action. In sum, an assignment of a cause of action or its fruits would be held valid if it was incidental to the transfer of property; or the assignee has a legitimate interest in the outcome of the litigation; or there is no realistic possibility that the administration of justice may suffer as a result of the assignment (<span class="font-italic">Lim Lie Hoa </span>at [32], [37] and [47]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25  It is thus apparent that <span class="font-italic">Vanguard </span>took a broad approach in considering whether a contract offended public policy for being champertous or in maintenance. In my view, a similar approach applies in respect of bankruptcy proceedings, given my conclusions on the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act above. So long as the criteria laid down in <span class="font-italic">Vanguard </span>are met, an assignment or sale of the proceeds of litigation by the Trustees would not run afoul of public policy. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The 2017 amendments to the Civil Law Act do not preclude common law developments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The Non-Parties argue that the amendments to the Civil Law Act allowing for third-party funding in respect of certain prescribed types of proceedings circumscribes the permissibility of third-party funding for other non-prescribed types of proceedings. In sum, the 2017 amendments to the Civil Law Act restrict the ambit of maintenance and champerty, permitting third-party funding in respect of international arbitrations. Section 5A, as noted above, abolished maintenance and champerty as torts, while preserving these doctrines as grounds for vitiation as being contrary to public policy or illegality:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Abolition of tort of maintenance and champerty</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">5A.</span>—(1) It is declared that no person is, under the law of Singapore, liable in tort for any conduct on account of its being maintenance or champerty as known to the common law.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Subject to section 5B, the abolition of civil liability under the law of Singapore for maintenance and champerty does not affect any rule of that law as to the cases in which a contract is to be treated as contrary to public policy or otherwise illegal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Section 5B prescribes a regime for third-party funding, applicable only to the prescribed dispute resolution proceedings:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Validity of certain contracts for funding of claims</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">5B.</span>—(1) This section applies only in relation to prescribed dispute resolution proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  A contract under which a qualifying Third-Party Funder provides funds to any party for the purpose of funding all or part of the costs of that party in prescribed dispute resolution proceedings is not contrary to public policy or otherwise illegal by reason that it is a contract for maintenance or champerty.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Under the Civil Law (Third-Party Funding) Regulations 2017 (No S 68/2017), s 5B applies only in respect of international arbitration proceedings, or related court or mediation proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The Non-Parties argue that development of third-party funding should be left to Parliament, citing in support the <span class="font-italic">Report </span><span class="font-italic">of the Law Reform Committee on Litigation Funding in Insolvency Cases</span> (February 2014) (Chairman: Ashok Kumar) (“the Report”), in which it was said that codification is recommended, and removes uncertainties that would arise from case law development of provisions not intended to govern litigation funding (at paras 63–66). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 That Report is not determinative of the issue: it is certainly not binding, and it preceded the High Court’s seminal decision in <span class="font-italic">Vanguard</span>. As the Non-Parties themselves acknowledged, the Report has not in fact been adopted by Parliament. It is thus of little assistance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The Non-Parties also refer to statements made by the Senior Minister of State for Law in the Second Reading speech explaining the 2017 amendments which introduced third-party litigation financing for international arbitration, indicating that third-party funding for such cases would be proceeded with as a test case, with a view to extension to other types of proceedings in the future (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (10 January 2017) vol 94). The Non-Parties then point to the absence of any similar legislative provision in respect of third-party funding for insolvency litigation, and argue that the development of the law – specifically, whether and when third-party funding should be extended to insolvency litigation –<span class="font-italic"> </span>should be left to Parliament.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In my view, the absence of express parliamentary provision does not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto </span>preclude the courts from developing the law as needed; the flexible and responsive development of the law is one of the great merits of the common law system. The absence of any legislation could be the product of many factors, including competing legislative priorities and the (non-)availability of parliamentary time. It does not mean that development in a particular area by the courts is to be closed off. In my view, what can be discerned from the parliamentary debates on the 2017 amendments was that Parliament had left the issue of the extent to which the rule against maintenance and champerty continued to operate to the courts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Had the legislature so wished, it could and would have statutorily overruled <span class="font-italic">Vanguard</span>. The parliamentary debates clearly show that the legislature was aware of <span class="font-italic">Vanguard</span>; that decision was referred to by one of the Members of Parliament in a question posed to the Senior Minister of State. The Senior Minister of State for Law said the following in reply:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As mentioned, we are first proceeding with third-party funding in the context of international arbitration and related proceedings. This is because we want to have the framework tested in a limited sphere, where those involved are typically well-advised, commercially sophisticated and better able to bear the reduction in damages. If the framework works well, as and when appropriate, the prescribed categories of proceedings may be expanded.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Non-Parties argue since Parliament was clearly aware of the decision in <span class="font-italic">Vanguard</span>, and yet decided to extend third-party litigation funding only to international arbitration, this indicated that such funding in insolvency would still be in maintenance and champertous, and that <span class="font-italic">Vanguard </span>was rendered obsolete. According to the Non-Parties, the parliamentary debates reflect Parliament’s intent for a very limited expansion of third-party funding, such that the proposed assignment, not falling within the ambit of that limited extension, would still be tainted by the doctrine of maintenance and champerty.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 It is not appropriate to refer to a judgment as being “obsolete”; a judgment stands unless it is overruled, whether by an appellate court or by legislation. <span class="font-italic">Vanguard </span>has not been so overruled, and remains good law. While it may be that there was some reference in the debate to <span class="font-italic">Vanguard</span> or at least its effect, nothing in the passage of the bill or the explanatory statement points to a statutory overruling of that case, even impliedly. Implied overruling only arises when a particular decision is incompatible with the statutory provision. That is not the case here, as s 5A leaves the scope of the doctrine of maintenance and champerty to be determined by the courts in the development of the common law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 As it stands, the doctrine of maintenance and champerty may vitiate contracts as a matter of public policy so as to prevent litigation from being driven not by the objective of resolving a genuine dispute between the parties, but by a desire to profit from the process itself. Of course, third-party funders are not in it for purely altruistic reasons, and a profit motive is to be expected. In my view, that profit motive is not objectionable <span class="font-italic">per </span><span class="font-italic">se</span>. What cannot be countenanced is the <span class="font-italic">sole</span> focus on such profit to the detriment of the administration of justice. That public interest is safeguarded by the criteria identified in <span class="font-italic">Vanguard</span>, which go towards ensuring that is the third-party has a sufficient interest before such funding would be allowed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I am reinforced in this approach by the decision in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Trikomsel Pte Ltd (In compulsory liqudation) and another</span>, High Court Originating Summons No 989 of 2018,<span class="font-italic"> </span>in which the court made a declaration that a funding agreement did not offend the doctrine of maintenance and champerty. No written decision has to date been issued for that case.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In the circumstances, therefore, I allow the Trustees’ application. I will hear the Trustees on the merits of the funding application itself, without the involvement of the Non-Parties. Further directions will be given for this hearing, as well as for arguments on costs orders. Time for any appeal application relating to the present case is extended until two weeks after costs are determined or other order of court.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Aedit Abdullah<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Andrew Chan, Alexander Yeo, Chew Jing Wei (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP)  for the applicant;<br/>David Chan, Cai Chengying, Shirin Swah (Shook Lin &amp; Bok LLP) for the non-parties.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
