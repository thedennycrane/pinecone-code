The Appellant therefore could not look to the Respondent for damages for loss of use after 25 August 2021.

On 21 January 2022, Malaysian Customs took the Van away from 57-J Jalan Serai and into their custody. As the parties and the DJ have done, I will refer to this event as Malaysian Customs having “seized” the Van, although I use the terms “seize” and “seizure” with reference to this timeframe loosely, since I note that the Notice of Seizure subsequently sent by Malaysian Customs to the Appellant stated that the Van was seized on 6 December 2022 (see [18] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I respectfully diverge from the DJ’s finding that the Respondent’s conversion of the Van ended when it was seized by Malaysian Customs on 21 January 2022. The High Court held in <span class="font-italic">Aries</span> at [79] that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">the conversion period only ended when [the defendant] could be said to have <span class="font-italic">ceased </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">to act</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>inconsistently with [the plaintiff’s] rights as owner, and when [the defendant] <span class="font-italic">began </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">to take steps</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>to allow [the plaintiff] to reclaim the [converted] equipment.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In my view, this calls for conduct on the part of the tortfeasor which indicates that he has ceased to act inconsistently with the chattel owner’s ownership rights. The occurrence of a discrete event that led to the tortfeasor passively losing possession of the converted chattel would not mean that the tortfeasor <span class="font-italic">ceased to act</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>inconsistently with the chattel owner’s ownership rights.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In the present case, the Respondent had done nothing, as at 21 January 2022, to return the Van to the Appellant, evince an intention to return the Van to the Appellant, or otherwise cease acting inconsistently with the Appellant’s rights as owner of the Van. While the action taken by Malaysian Customs on 21 January 2022 removed the Van from the Respondent’s possession, that did not involve any step taken of the Respondent’s own volition to cease acting inconsistently with the Appellant’s ownership rights over the Van. In my view, this was thus not a situation of the period of conversion by the Respondent having ended with Malaysian Customs’ seizure of the Van. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Rather, the germane inquiry is whether Malaysian Customs’ seizure of the Van broke the chain of causation between the Respondent’s wrongful act of conversion and the loss of the Van suffered by the Appellant. Conversion is “a single wrongful act and the cause of action accrues at the date of the conversion”: <span class="font-italic">General and Finance Facilities Ltd v Cooks Cars (Romford) Ltd</span> [1963] 1 WLR 644 at 648. It is undisputed that the Appellant has not regained possession of the Van to date. The questions which thus arise are whether the Respondent’s conversion caused, and to what extent the Respondent should be held liable for, the Appellant’s loss of the Van.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Before turning to these matters, I briefly address the DJ’s comment that the Appellant “may well be able to recover the Van from Malaysian Customs”.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Judgment at [66].</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This engages two considerations: (a) an anterior point of whether it can even be said that the Appellant suffered a loss of the Van; and (b) a latter issue of whether the Appellant has mitigated his loss (which I deal with at [59]–[63] below). On the anterior point, I am constrained to adjudicate the matter based on the evidence presently before me. There is no evidence indicating a probable prospect that the Van will be recovered. I therefore take the view that the Appellant <span class="font-italic">has</span> suffered loss of the Van, notwithstanding a possibility (which can only be speculated on) that the Van might be recovered. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Causation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I further find that the Respondent’s conversion of the Van on 1 February 2021 was the “but for” and legal cause of the Appellant’s loss of the Van. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Causation is made up of causation in fact and causation in law: <span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming Eric</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 782 (“<span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [52]. Causation in fact is concerned with the question of whether the relation between the defendant’s breach and the plaintiff’s damage is one of cause and effect in accordance with scientific or objective notions of physical sequence. It is concerned with establishing the <span class="font-italic">physical connection</span> between the defendant’s wrong and the plaintiff’s damage. The universally accepted test in this regard is the “but for” test: <span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal </span>at [52]. The “but for” principle poses the question of whether the plaintiff would have suffered the loss without (“but for”) the defendant’s wrongdoing. If he would not, the wrongful conduct was <span class="font-italic">a</span> cause of the loss: <span class="font-italic">Kuwait Airways </span><span class="font-italic">Corpn v Iraqi Airways Co (Nos 4 and 5)</span> [2002] 2 AC 883 (“<span class="font-italic">Kuwait Airways</span>”) at [72].

The court has to decide whether the defendant’s wrongful conduct constituted the “legal cause” of the damage. This recognises that causes assume significance to the extent that they assist the court in deciding how best to <span class="font-italic">attribute responsibility</span> for the plaintiff’s damage: <span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal </span>at [54]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The Respondent argues that his conversion of the Van on 1 February 2021 was “not connected” to Malaysian Customs’ seizure of the Van.

</div> I do not agree. But for the Respondent’s conversion and storage of the Van at 57-J Jalan Serai, uncustomed liquor would not have ended up stored in the Van while it was at 57-J Jalan Serai and Malaysian Customs would not have seized the Van on 21 January 2022 due to the uncustomed liquor found in the Van. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The Respondent suggests that the Appellant should be regarded as responsible for the uncustomed liquor found in the Van because (a) the Appellant was in Malaysia between 3 February and 21 April 2021 and it was possible that he placed the uncustomed liquor in the Van then; and (b) Malaysian Customs sent the Offer to Compound Offences dated 19 October 2022 to the Appellant stating “you are found to have committed the offence under the Customs Act 1967” after an interview with the Appellant on 30<span class="font-italic"> </span>June 2022.

</div> I do not accept this suggestion as it is founded on conjecture and not evidence. There is no evidence of <span class="font-italic">how</span> the Appellant could have placed uncustomed liquor in the Van when the Respondent kept the Van in the locked premises of 57-J Jalan Serai. In contrast, the objective evidence shows that the Appellant was away from Malaysia from 21 April 2021 to 24 March 2022 (see [10] above), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, for majority of the period that the Van was kept by the Respondent at 57-J Jalan Serai. There is also no evidence as to <span class="font-italic">why </span>Malaysian Customs chose to send the Offer to Compound Offences to the Appellant – that could simply have been because the Appellant is the owner of the Van. At the hearing of this appeal, the Respondent’s counsel candidly accepted that, although the Respondent had canvassed a similar suggestion in the proceedings below, the DJ had not made any finding that the Appellant was responsible for uncustomed liquor being found in the Van by Malaysian Customs on 21 January 2022. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The Respondent also argues that the seizure was not caused by him.

</div>
</div> However, it is immaterial that the Respondent may not have been responsible for storing the uncustomed liquor in the Van. The point remains that, but for his conversion of the Van and keeping it at 57-J Jalan Serai, uncustomed liquor could not and would not have been stored in the Van while it was at 57-J Jalan Serai and Malaysian Customs would not have seized the Van on 21 January 2022 upon discovering the uncustomed liquor in it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I also regard the Respondent’s conversion of the Van as the legal cause of the Appellant’s loss of the Van.

In this regard, the case of <span class="font-italic">Kuwait Airways</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>in which Lord Nicholls and Lord Hoffman elucidated the causal requirements in the context of the tort of conversion, is instructive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In <span class="font-italic">Kuwait Airways</span>, the defendant Iraqi Airways Co (“IAC”) was found to have converted ten of the claimant Kuwait Airways Corpn’s (“KAC”) aircraft against the backdrop of the 1990 Iraq war. Six aircraft were subsequently evacuated to Iran, impounded in Iran and returned only after more than a year, on KAC’s payment of a sum to Iran (the “Iran Six”). By a majority decision, the House of Lords allowed KAC to recover the cost of regaining the aircraft from Iran, the reasonable cost of repairing and overhauling the aircraft on their return, the cost of chartering substitute aircraft and any loss of profit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Analysing the application of the “but for” test in the tort of conversion to the Iran Six, Lord Nicholls (in the majority) stated at [78]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Consistently with its purpose of providing a remedy for the misappropriation of goods, liability is strict… <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the defendant still has the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">goods or their proceeds matters not</span>. … Baron Cleasby’s aphorism, uttered in 1872 in <span class="font-italic">Fowler v Hollins</span> LR 7 QB 616, 639, still represents the law: “<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">persons deal with the property in chattels or exercise acts of ownership over them at their peril</span>.” This, he observed, was regarded as a salutary rule for the protection of property.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In holding that the intervening acts of the Government of Iran did not excuse IAC from liability for the adverse financial consequences of the detention of the aircraft in Iran, Lord Nicholls stated at [91]–[92]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">91 The Iran Six were sent to Iran on the orders of the Government of Iraq.

Moreover, it bears repeating that the evidence does not show that the Respondent was prepared to return the Van at any time prior to 21 January 2022 (when Malaysian Customs seized the Van). In these circumstances, liability for loss of the Van should fall on the Respondent notwithstanding the actions of Malaysian Customs and notwithstanding that the Respondent no longer has possession of the Van.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Remoteness of damage</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I also find that the damage suffered by the Appellant as a result of the Respondent’s conversion, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the Appellant’s loss of the Van, is not too remote to be recovered.<span class="font-italic"> </span>Causation and remoteness of damage are two distinct inquiries: <span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal </span>at [51]. The inquiry into remoteness of damage follows after causation is established. It involves examining whether, and to what extent, the defendant should have to answer for the consequences which his breach has <span class="font-italic">caused</span>. By this stage of the inquiry, causation would already have been established and remoteness merely sets the limits of actionability for damage admittedly <span class="font-italic">caused</span> by the defendant’s wrong: <span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal </span>at [56]. The approach to restrict such liability is the test of reasonable foreseeability: <span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal </span>at [56]. In my view, the Appellant’s loss of the Van is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the Respondent’s conversion of the Van and there is no reason to limit the Respondent’s liability for such loss (which I have found that he caused at [44]–[55] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mitigation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I do not think there is basis to conclude that the Appellant failed to mitigate his loss of the Van. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">58 </span>It is trite that a plaintiff has a duty to take <span class="font-italic">reasonable</span> steps to mitigate the loss resulting from the defendant’s tort and cannot recover damages for loss which he could <span class="font-italic">reasonably</span> have avoided: <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The “Asia Star”</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[2010] 2 SLR 1154 (“</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">‘Asia Star’</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">”) at [24]</span>.<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">To minimise any potential unfairness to the aggrieved plaintiff, the courts have sought to ensure that the standard of reasonableness required of him is not too difficult to meet.

This matters because the reasonableness of any alleged inaction on the Appellant’s part cannot be assessed <span class="font-italic">in vacuo</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 On the Appellant’s part, he strenuously (and understandably) disputes liability for the customs offence and objects to paying a fine to compound the offence (see [17] above). To the extent that compounding the offence is necessary for Malaysian Customs to release the Van, I do not consider the Appellant’s refusal to do so an unreasonable failure to mitigate: <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">he is not required to act in a way which exposes him to financial or moral hazard</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> (see [58] above)</span>. What is less clear, however, is the nexus (if any) between compounding the customs offence and the release of the Van. The Offer to Compound Offences dated 19 October 2022 (see [17] above) made no mention, on its face, of seizing, making a claim for or forfeiting the Van. It was the Notice of Seizure dated 6 December 2022 (see [18] above) that referred to making a claim for or forfeiting the Van, but there was no mention, on its face, of having to compound the customs offence before making a claim for the seized Van. At the hearing of this appeal, the Appellant’s counsel submitted that both letters from Malaysian Customs had to be read together, and that, when read together, the inference was that Malaysian Customs would not release the Van without the Appellant first compounding the offence. In my view, this was a point concerning Malaysian law, of which there was no evidence. However, the Respondent’s counsel did not contest the Appellant’s understanding of Malaysian Customs’ correspondence. Instead, the Respondent’s argument was that the Appellant could choose not to compound the offence and “could have refuted the charge proving his innocence of the offence”.

</div> It is unclear what exactly the Respondent means by “refuted the charge” since the Appellant has not been <span class="font-italic">prosecuted</span> for any customs offence; of significance, however, is the implicit concession – that it is reasonable for the Appellant to choose not to compound the offence and to maintain his innocence – underlying the Respondent’s point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Next, while it is not disputed that the Appellant’s Malaysian solicitors had written to Malaysian Customs and to date have not received a response (see [18] above), it is unclear whether the Appellant had instructed his Malaysian solicitors to write to Malaysian Customs within the one-month deadline stipulated in the 6 December 2022 Notice of Seizure. The Appellant’s counsel was unable to shed light on this point at the hearing of this appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Ultimately, however, the above matters were for the Respondent to press at the trial below (including by adducing evidence of Malaysian law, if necessary) if he wished to contend that there were specific reasonable steps the Appellant could, but failed to, have taken to recover the Van from Malaysian Customs. The burden of proving any assertion that the Appellant failed to take all reasonable steps to mitigate his loss lies on the Respondent and has not been discharged. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The Respondent argues that “[i]t is unjust if the Appellant simply gets damages for the value of the Van, and then simply compounds the uncustomed goods offence, take[s] delivery of the Van and be double compensated”.

</div> However, it is mere speculation that the Appellant would act in such a manner, particularly after taking the position in these proceedings that it is objectionable and unreasonable to expect him to compound an offence which he did not commit. There would repercussions if it emerges that the Appellant deliberately misled the Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 For completeness, the Appellant did mitigate his loss by seeking and obtaining a COE rebate, which is elaborated on at [74] below, as part of my assessment of damages, to which I now turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Measure of damages</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The object of an award of damages for conversion is to compensate the plaintiff for the damage he has suffered: <span class="font-italic">Aries</span> at [92]. The normal measure of damages in conversion is the value of the goods converted at the time of conversion: <span class="font-italic">Chartered Electronics Industries Pte Ltd v Comtech IT Pte Ltd</span> [1998] 2 SLR(R) 1010 (“<span class="font-italic">Chartered Electronics</span>”) at [17]; <span class="font-italic">Marco Polo Shipping Co Pte Ltd v Fairmacs Shipping &amp; Transport Services Pte Ltd</span> [2015] 5 SLR 541 (“<span class="font-italic">Fairmacs (CA)</span>”) at [29]; <span class="font-italic">Fairmacs Shipping &amp; Transport Services Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Harikutai Engineering Pte Ltd and another</span> [2015] 1 SLR 904 (“<span class="font-italic">Fairmacs (HC)</span>”) at [24]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 One way of putting a monetary figure on the value of the goods converted is to use the “market value” of the goods because the “market value” is the best approximate of the loss suffered by the plaintiff who has been deprived of his goods: <span class="font-italic">Fairmacs (CA) </span>at [30]; <span class="font-italic">Fairmacs (HC) </span>at [24]; <span class="font-italic">Chartered Electronics </span>at [18].

By doing the best it can, the court may have regard to a variety of evidence. In this regard, courts have taken into account original cost less depreciation: <span class="font-italic">Fairmacs (HC)</span> at [60]. In practical terms, a court would have to carry out the assessment of damages in a flexible manner as regards what would be adequate proof of damage so as to achieve the purpose of compensatory damages: <span class="font-italic">Fairmacs (HC)</span> at [61]; <span class="font-italic">Robertson Quay Investment Pte Ltd v Steen Consultants Pte Ltd and another </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 623 at [27]–[28] and [30]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Value of the Van</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Accordingly, the measure of the Appellant’s damages for loss of the Van should be the value of the Van as at 1 February 2021, and I approach the assessment of the value of the Van with the above legal principles in mind.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The Appellant submits that the market value of the Van as at 1 February 2021 should be taken to be $75,000.

A “market” exists where there is a willing seller and willing buyer after negotiations: <span class="font-italic">Fairmacs</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> at [31].

Further, notwithstanding the facial similarities in vehicle model, registration date and COE expiry between the Van and the advertised van, it is uncertain that both vehicles were in such similar condition (contrast the advertised van’s description (even allowing for puff) at [69] above with the problems experienced with the Van set out at [72(c)] below) as to be considered of comparable value.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I also do not think that it would be appropriate, in this case, to determine the value of the Van by the cost of its replacement, taking such cost as the price at which the Van was bought.

</div> <span class="font-italic">Aries</span> at [93] referred to damages based on the “user principle”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Damages falling under what has been termed the “user principle” are assessed by reference to the fee that the defendant would reasonably have had to pay for a licence by the plaintiff to act.

In Gary Chan and Lee Pey Woan, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Torts in Singapore</span> (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2016) at para 11.061, the learned authors explain when damages may be awarded on the “user principle” in the tort of conversion, as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In cases involving <span class="font-italic">temporary deprivation of property</span>, a <span class="font-italic">claimant who has not suffered actual financial loss</span> may sometimes seek damages on the “user” principle, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a notional charge representing the rent or price for the claimant’s agreement to allow the defendant the use of the asset.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Aries</span> at [93], the High Court explained that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">[The plaintiff] did not claim for any loss or damage arising from the unavailability of the [converted] equipment for its own use during the [conversion period]</span>. Instead, it claimed damages based on [the defendant’s] use of the [converted] equipment <span class="font-italic">during the [conversion period]</span>.

This measure of damages compensates the plaintiff for the interference with or loss of his dominium over his goods: <span class="font-italic">Turf Club </span>at [213]; <span class="font-italic">Yenty Lily (trading as Access International Services) v ACES System Development Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 1 SLR 577 (“<span class="font-italic">Yenty Lily</span>”) at [43]. In the present case, the Van has not been returned to the Appellant at all. The Appellant has also sought (and I have awarded) compensation for loss of the Van, and it would result in double recovery if damages on the “user principle” were also awarded. An award of damages based on the “user principle” would thus be inapposite in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In this appeal, the Appellant says that he seeks damages for “loss of use” of the Van as <span class="font-italic">consequential loss</span> (see [28] above). It is unclear if he made this argument in the proceedings below. Damages for consequential loss are conceptually different from damages based on the “user principle”. At the same time, the Appellant relies in this appeal on <span class="font-italic">The Owners of the Steamship “Mediana” v The Owners, Master and Crew of the Lightship “Comet”</span> [1900] AC 113 (“<span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">‘Mediana’</span>”) at 117 for the proposition that his “loss of use” claim did not depend on him showing any particular use he was going to make of the Van .

</div> That point might be relevant in the context of damages based on the “user principle” (see <span class="font-italic">Yenty Lily</span> at [43]) (which I have declined to award at [79]–[81] above), but it does not apply to claiming for and proving consequential loss. Indeed, in the passage in <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> “Mediana” </span>at 117 relied on by the Appellant, the Earl of Halsbury LC went on to state that “when you are endeavouring to establish the specific loss of profit… you must shew it, and by precise evidence”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In any event, I find that there is no legal basis for the Appellant to be awarded damages for “loss of use” of the Van as consequential loss. It is an established principle that besides the value of the converted goods, a plaintiff may also be entitled to damages for consequential losses as a result of the act of conversion, provided the consequential losses are not too remote: <span class="font-italic">Chartered Electronics </span>at [19]. Examples of consequential losses include loss incurred through or by being deprived of the use of the goods: <span class="font-italic">Chartered Electronics </span>at [19]; <span class="font-italic">Fairmacs (CA)</span> at [29]. Loss through or by being deprived of the use of converted goods may be incurred in situations where the plaintiff has to hire substitute capacity until the converted goods are replaced, or where the plaintiff suffers losses of business or profits until the converted goods are replaced or substitute capacity is obtained (see <span class="font-italic">Kuwait Airways</span> at [95]). The Appellant has adduced no evidence of any such losses. Indeed, the conception of “loss of use” that the Appellant has in mind is different from that of consequential loss, and appears to effectively amount to loss of the Van itself. Loss of the Van is measured according to the value of the Van. Awarding the Appellant damages for loss of the Van <span class="font-italic">and</span> for “loss of use” of the Van, as he has claimed, would result in double recovery. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In short, there is no basis for the Appellant’s “loss of use” claim for damages and I do not allow it. It follows that there is no need to address either party’s arguments on the period for which “loss of use” should be compensated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 However, I make the following observations on the Respondent’s attempt to seek “variation” of the DJ’s award of damages based on “loss of use”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The Respondent’s first argument is that the period of loss of use under the Judgment should be “varied” to 13 December 2020, “being the operative date that the Van was deregistered, as stated in the letter of [25] August 2021 from LTA to the Appellant”.

</div> The Respondent concedes that this is a new point not raised in the Court below but purports that “[t]he Respondent only realised post Judgment that the operative date of deregistration is 13 December 2020”.

</div> I am unable to see how this could be the case when LTA’s letter of 25 August 2021, on which the Respondent relies for this new argument, was already in evidence in the proceedings below. There was no basis for the Respondent to make this new argument belatedly in this appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The Respondent’s second argument is that the period of loss of use under the Judgment should be “varied” to 26 February 2021 when the Appellant filed the 26 Feb 2021 JB Police Report to withdraw his 2 Feb 2021 JB Police Report (see [9] above).

</div> The Respondent says that the 26 Feb 2021 JB Police Report signified that “the Appellant had unconditionally withdrawn his claim for conversion” and “consented to the continued possession of the Van by the Respondent after [26] February 2021”.

</div> This argument essentially challenges the DJ’s decision that the conversion continued past 26 February 2021. The DJ expressly rejected the Respondent’s submission in the proceedings below that the Appellant’s withdrawal of his 2 Feb 2021 JB Police Report should be taken as the Appellant withdrawing his demand for the Van’s return or the end of the Respondent’s conversion.

</div>
</div> On a proper characterisation, the Respondent’s argument does not seek to “vary” the DJ’s decision on the period of loss of use, but seeks, in substance, to overturn the DJ’s holding regarding the Respondent’s conversion of the Van. It is not permissible for the Respondent to mount this challenge without having filed a Notice of Appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Order 55D of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) governs this appeal. The Respondent is presumably relying on O 55D r 7(5) of the ROC, which states that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A respondent who, not having appealed from the decision of the Court below, desires to contend on the appeal that the decision of the Court should be varied in the event of an appeal being allowed in whole or in part, or that the decision of that Court should be affirmed on grounds other than those relied upon by that Court, must state so in his Case, specifying the grounds of that contention. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 This rule mirrors O 57 r 9A(5) of the ROC which pertains to appeals to the Court of Appeal. While O 57 r 9A(5) (and, correspondingly, O 55D r 7(5)) of the ROC allows successful respondents to mount a case to affirm the judge’s ultimate decision by raising other arguments which did not find favour with the court below without needing to file a cross-appeal (<span class="font-italic">L Capital Jones Ltd and another v </span><span class="font-italic">Maniach Pte Ltd</span> [2017] 1 SLR 312 at [65] and [67]), it does not give <span class="font-italic">carte blanche </span>to a respondent to circumvent the need to file a cross-appeal in a situation where he is challenging a holding by the court that had gone against him (<span class="font-italic">Rals International Pte Ltd v Cassa di </span><span class="font-italic">Risparmio di Parma e Piacenza SpA</span> [2016] 5 SLR 455 at [23]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In any event, the “variations” sought by the Respondent have no substantive relevance to the issues in this appeal, given my decision that the Appellant is not entitled to claim damages for “loss of use” of the Van. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In conclusion, I allow the Appellant’s appeal to the extent of setting aside the award of damages, made by the DJ at [128(a)] of the Judgment, in respect of the Respondent’s conversion of the Van on 1 February 2021.
