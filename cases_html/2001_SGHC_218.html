<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><strong><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Grounds

of Decision</font></strong></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1. These two appeals arose from the trial in District Court Suit No.

50401 of 1999 in which the plaintiff sued the defendant for the refund of various sums of

money paid pursuant to a franchise agreement. The plaintiff averred that they had an

option to withdraw (without penalty) from the agreement within three months. This was

disputed by the defendant. The trial judge find in favour of the defendant. The plaintiff

appealed, contending that the franchise agreement (both sides agreed that it was an oral

contract) clearly provided an opt-out clause. In the course of counsel’s submission,

it became obvious that this appeal concerned a plain question of fact and one which hinged

on the acceptance of the witnesses’ testimonies. Counsel also sought to pull his case

through by his argument that I should infer from the testimonies, and the unsigned

franchise agreement, that the plaintiff’s version must be true. I am unable to agree

without the benefit of hearing the witnesses myself. I, therefore, am not satisfied that

there was a clear error in the finding by the trial judge. The plaintiff’s appeal is

therefore dismissed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2. I now turn to the defendant’s appeal. The appeal was on the

grounds that the trial judge erred in not granting various items of loss, and also that

she erred in not giving effect to an express term of the contract (cl 24(1)) that the

defendant purchase equipment from the plaintiff at their book value or fair market price

whichever is lower.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3. Mr. Merchant on behalf of the plaintiff argued that the defendant

did not particularize their damage in the counterclaim and cannot therefore be granted any

orders in respect of the items claimed by them. Mr. Ling in reply argued that general

damages require no particulars.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4. However, it seems to me that the items claimed by the defendant,

namely, balance of renovation costs, reinstatement costs of the premises, monthly losses

from the operation of the franchised outlet, and loss of royalties are special damages and

ought to be pleaded. In <i>Perestrello v United Paint Co Ltd</i> <nobr>[1969] 3 AER 479</nobr>, 485

Lord Donovan held that damages which are capable of substantially exact calculation are

what is commonly referred to as special damages. He stated that these are "no more

than an example of damage which is ‘special’ in the sense that fairness to the

defendant requires that it be pleaded". It is not unusual that the quantum of damages

is to be ascertained at a later date after the court has ruled on the question of

liability. But parties must appear at trial ready to argue both. It will not be fair to

the defendant, therefore, if no particulars are pleaded for him to meet. In the present

case, however, notwithstanding the lack of particulars, the plaintiff contested each of

the defendant’s counterclaim on merit at trial and, therefore, I am of the view that

no interference by me is warranted on appeal. The findings of the trial judge were again,

findings of fact and I have no cause to upset any of those findings.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5. As to whether the judge was wrong to order "a straight line

depreciation method over five years" to be used in calculating the cost of the one

item she granted. The trial judge was not wrong to order a valuation under cl 24(1) of the

unsigned franchise agreement having found as a fact that that was incorporated as a term

of the contract. However, I am of the view that the order should be varied for

clarity’s sake by deleting the above sentence from the orders. Apart from this, the

defendant’s appeal is dismissed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6. Each party is to bear his own costs.</p>
