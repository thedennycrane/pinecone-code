</div> However, several points (some of which were recognised by the DJ) hamstring the appellant’s argument.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In the first place, the <span class="font-italic">ex post facto</span> nature of the oral loan agreement, as alleged, brings into question its very existence. If the appellant truly did not intend to gratuitously pay out the Monies, one would expect him to have taken up the issue with the respondent <span class="font-italic">prior</span> to the making of such payments. The appellant did not do so, and only alleges that there was a conversation between him and the respondent <span class="font-italic">after</span> the Monies were paid.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The evidence supporting the existence of such a conversation between the parties (after the Monies were paid) is scant. There is no record of subsequent text messages or emails evincing the existence of such a conversation. The existence and details of the alleged conversation are also not mentioned in the appellant’s affidavit evidence. The following portions of the cross-examination of the appellant at trial are telling, and damaging for the appellant’s case:

First, the evidence concerning the existence of such a conversation between the parties only surfaced in the appellant’s <span class="font-italic">oral testimony</span>. This, in my view, suggests that it was an afterthought. Such a conversation, if it did occur, would be a key plank of the appellant’s case on the Monies, and ought to have been mentioned in his affidavit evidence given its importance. The appellant’s failure to do so shows up the veracity of his testimony in this regard. Second, even at trial, the appellant was unable to furnish <span class="font-italic">any</span> <span class="font-italic">details</span> of the alleged conversation, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, what exactly the parties said. This speaks to the conclusion that such a conversation never occurred. If it did occur, one would expect the appellant to have readily provided the details of the same at the earliest instance. He did not.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) There is also no evidence that the respondent <span class="font-italic">accepted</span> the appellant’s proposition that the Monies were to assume the nature of loans.

</div> Thus, even if the alleged conversation between the appellant and respondent did take place <span class="font-italic">after</span> the Monies were paid, there would still be insufficient basis to find that the parties reached <span class="font-italic">consensus ad idem</span>. At most, this would have been a unilateral view of the state of affairs on the appellant’s part – but unilateral thinking cannot give rise to a binding contract.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The appellant’s conduct between November 2010 (when the Monies were paid) and May 2015 (when the respondent’s employment was terminated) is telling. He never once pursued the matter with the respondent, and never chased for payment. There is no evidence (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, text messages) to this effect. The appellant indeed accepts that he did not “[request] for the return of the [Monies] from [the respondent], as [he] did not want [the respondent] to feel pressured”.

These facts lead to several legal and factual conclusions, which ultimately resolve the issue of the Car in favour of the appellant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the beneficial interest in the Car resided with the appellant</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The presumption of resulting trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I am persuaded that a presumption of resulting trust over the Car arose in favour of the appellant. Such a trust has often been referred to as a “purchase money trust”, and for good reason. The presumption of resulting trust operates where an individual makes a voluntary payment for the purchase of a property that is then vested in the other person or in both of them jointly. Thus, in the seminal decision of <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span><span class="font-italic"> Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council </span>[1996] AC 669 (“<span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span>”) decision, Lord Browne-Wilkinson stated the following (at 708A):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… where A makes a voluntary payment to B or <span class="font-italic">pays (wholly or in part) for the purchase of property</span> <span class="font-italic">which</span><span class="font-italic"> is vested</span> either <span class="font-italic">in B alone</span> or in the joint names of A and B, there is a presumption that A did not intend to make a gift to B: the money or property is <span class="font-italic">held on trust for A</span> (if he is the <span class="font-italic">sole provider of the money</span>) or in the case of a <span class="font-italic">joint purchase by A and B in shares proportionate to their contributions</span>…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Lord Browne-Wilkinson’s observations have been accepted locally (see for example the recent decision of <span class="font-italic">Estate of Yang Chun (Mrs) née Sun Hui Min, deceased v Yang Chia-Yin</span> [2019] 5 SLR 593 (“<span class="font-italic">Yang Chia-Yin</span>”) at [55]; see also <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan </span><span class="font-italic">Chye Terence and another </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 108<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [34]).

</div> it is a finding that the respondent has not shown to be obviously incorrect. Apart from suggesting in the Defence that it was the Company, not the appellant, that made the payments for the Car, the respondent has raised no evidence in support of his allegation. Accordingly, the entity in whom the beneficial interest in the Car was vested was the appellant, <span class="font-italic">not</span> the Company, since the purchase monies flowed from him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 On this note, counsel for the respondent emphasised during oral submissions that the <span class="font-italic">formal title</span> to the Car resided in the respondent, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Car was registered in the respondent’s name. This does not assist the respondent, because such formal title represents but the <span class="font-italic">bare legal interest</span> in the Car. The <span class="font-italic">beneficial</span> interest in the Car nonetheless resided with the appellant. Indeed, it is clear from Lord Browne-Wilkinson’s espousal in <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span> (see [23] above) that the vesting of formal title to property in a transferee is commonplace in situations involving the presumption of resulting trust; it does not defeat the value-furnishing transferor’s beneficial interest. This stems from the trite notion in the law of trusts that the legal and beneficial interests in property may be bifurcated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The appellant was never divested of his beneficial interest in the Car. The presumption of resulting trust can be displaced either by evidence of the transferor’s intention to make a gift to the transferee (<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>at [160(d)]), the presumption of advancement (<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>at [160(e)]), or a common intention, either at or subsequent to the acquisition, to hold the beneficial interest in a proportion other than that which corresponds with the parties’ respective contributions (<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>at [160(b)] and [160(f)]).  However, none of these apply in this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the Car was a gift</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 It must be borne in mind that while the legal burden of proving his case rested on the appellant at trial, it is the respondent who averred the existence of a gift – the DJ correctly recognised this at [45] of the GD. It is trite that he who asserts a fact must prove that fact. I am not persuaded that the respondent has done so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In emphasising that the Car was registered in the respondent’s name, counsel for the respondent also suggested that this was evidence of the appellant having bestowed a gift (of the Car) upon the respondent. This appears to be the only aspect of the evidence that the respondent can point to in support of his case. It however does not suffice as proof of a gift and fails to consider the context in which the appellant granted the respondent access to and use of the Car. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The Car was meant for the respondent’s use <span class="font-italic">in the course of the latter’s employment</span> with the Company. It was in the course of such employment that the appellant gave the respondent access to the Car. This is the appellant’s consistent evidence. The respondent does not dispute that he acquired possession of the Car under these circumstances, and that he <span class="font-italic">did use</span> the Car for work purposes during his employment. That the <span class="font-italic">formal</span> title to the Car was vested in the respondent is quite beside the point; this arrangement may conceivably have been put in place for a myriad of other reasons, such as for insurance purposes. This would make sense given that the respondent was the regular user of the Car on a daily basis – the parties do not dispute this.

</div> These are not negligible sums of money. Why would the appellant have furnished such valuable consideration? The respondent has offered no persuasive reason for why the appellant would gratuitously make a gift of such significant value.

</div> But there is no concrete evidence, contemporaneous or otherwise, to this effect, such as text messages or any other recorded correspondence.

</div> For the appellant to then inexplicably make a gift of such exorbitant value would be rather surprising, in my view.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Finally, and as recognised by the DJ (at [45] and [46] of the GD), the respondent’s own case undermines the notion that the Car was a gift. The respondent’s case is that the appellant agreed to pay all the outgoings in respect of the Car in so far as the respondent remained in the employment of the Company; in other words, upon termination of the respondent’s employment, the alleged agreement was for the respondent to foot the remainder of the bill (which he eventually did). This is inconsistent with the idea that there was an <span class="font-italic">unconditional birthday gift</span> comprising the entirety of the Car from the appellant to the respondent. It would indeed be very strange if the purported “birthday gift” was conditional on the respondent’s continued employment in the Company. This speaks to there being no such gift of this nature at all.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Thus, and in the light of the prevailing circumstances, I do not accept that the respondent has proved the existence of a gift.

The other issues considered by the DJ – in particular the issue of whether there was an express agreement between the appellant and the respondent for the latter to return the Car following the termination of the latter’s employment – are peripheral and have no bearing whatsoever on the outcome. What is pivotal is that the appellant, having paid all the initial purchase monies for the Car, including the 28 monthly HPA instalments for the car until 18 May 2015 and who was the guarantor for the loan repayments under the HPA, <span class="font-italic">never intended to divest himself of the beneficial interest in the same</span>.

</div>
</div> With respect, the DJ’s concerns in this regard are unfounded. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Tracing is the <span class="font-italic">process</span> by which an injured party, one who possesses a beneficial interest in property, attempts to assert a <span class="font-italic">proprietary</span> remedy over monies or property into which his beneficial interest has passed. This may be done, for example, by proving that the property in which he had a beneficial interest was converted into a different form, perhaps by being sold by the trustee in breach of trust. Tracing allows the injured party, in such a case, to assert a <span class="font-italic">proprietary</span><span class="font-italic"> interest</span> over the proceeds of sale of the property that <span class="font-italic">he</span> was rightly entitled to: see <span class="font-italic">Aljunied-</span><span class="font-italic">Hougang Town Council and another v Lim Swee Lian Sylvia and others and another suit </span>[2019] SGHC 241 at [633]; <span class="font-italic">Bhavika</span><span class="font-italic"> Manohar Godhwani v Manohar Hargun Godhwani and others </span>[2020] SGHC 147 at [68]. Such a proprietary remedy, in some cases, is preferable given that it may afford the injured party priority over the relevant monies/assets as against third parties. It also ensures compensation for an injured beneficiary where the errant trustee is insolvent and thereby unable to personally account for the value of the property disposed of in breach of trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The failure or inability to trace the proceeds of sale of property that was mishandled in breach of trust may preclude a proprietary remedy. What it does <span class="font-italic">not</span> do is extinguish an injured party’s right to a <span class="font-italic">personal</span> remedy for breach of trust. An errant trustee always owes a duty to the beneficiaries of the trust to <span class="font-italic">personally</span> account for trust property (save certain exceptional cases, which are irrelevant here). Successful tracing may be a requisite element for a claim in <span class="font-italic">restitution</span>, but that is quite different from a claim in breach of trust, which is not <span class="font-italic">dependent</span> on tracing (see <span class="font-italic">Skandinaviska</span><span class="font-italic"> Enskilda Banken AB (Publ), Singapore Branch v Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another and another suit </span>[2009] 4 SLR(R) 788 at [262]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In this case, the appellant did plead (in both the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) and the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 3)) that the respondent held the Car on trust for him.

</div> The respondent’s failure to return the Car on demand, and going further to sell it, was a clear breach of trust, and a failure to account for trust property.

After determining the open market value, <span class="font-underline">two further sums must be deducted:</span></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the <span class="font-italic">outstanding</span> HPA loan balance as at the date of the appellant’s demand; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) any instalment sum paid by the respondent towards the HPA <span class="font-italic">before</span> the date of the appellant’s demand. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This reflects the net quantum of the appellant’s beneficial interest in the Car as at the date of the respondent’s breach of trust. When assessed this way, there is no need to be concerned with the subsequent depreciation of the Car, the loss of use of the Car, the amount of any further HPA instalments paid by the respondent <span class="font-italic">after</span> the respondent’s failure to return the Car pursuant to the appellant’s request and the amount of sale proceeds of the Car pocketed by the respondent when he sold it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In other words, and to be absolutely clear, both the open market value of the Car <span class="font-italic">and</span> the outstanding HPA loan balance to be deducted are <span class="font-underline">to be assessed as of the date of the </span><span class="font-underline">Letter of Demand for the return of the Car by the appellant</span>. The date of the Letter of Demand on which the appellant, as beneficiary under the resulting trust, demanded for the return of the trust property is 30 June 2015. The respondent’s failure or refusal to return the Car on the appellant’s demand constituted a breach of trust that crystallised <span class="font-italic">at that point in time</span>. The calculation for the compensation awarded to the appellant must hence be construed from that reference point. I also briefly explain the basis for imposing the two deductions mentioned in the preceding paragraph.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The HPA loan <span class="font-italic">balance</span> must be deducted (as mentioned at [48(a)] above) because if the Car had been returned to the appellant on 30 June 2015 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, if the respondent had <span class="font-italic">not</span> acted in breach of trust) and sold off by the appellant immediately based on the open market value of the Car, the sum that the appellant would have obtained from the sale of the Car would have been <span class="font-italic">sans</span> the outstanding HPA loan balance. The appellant would have had to repay the outstanding loan balance. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Further, if there are any HPA instalments paid by the respondent <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">before</span> the date of the Letter of Demand, this is to be accounted for by subtracting from the sum assessed. These instalments are to be treated as “loans” to the appellant and paid by the respondent to the hire purchase company on behalf of the appellant, which the appellant must repay the respondent, hence the deduction mentioned at [48(b)] above. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I therefore allow the appeal in part.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) I dismiss the appeal as regards the Monies.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) I enter interlocutory judgment for the appellant with respect to the Car. The respondent is to pay the appellant damages to be assessed by the DJ in accordance with [48] and [49] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The parties are advised to jointly appoint an independent valuer, if they cannot agree on the open market value of the Car. This will expedite and reduce the cost of the assessment of damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Costs awarded below are set aside. All the costs below and the costs of the appeal are reserved to the DJ hearing the assessment of damages. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chan Seng Onn<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ashok Kumar Rai (Cairnhill Law LLC) for the appellant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kanagavijayan Nadarajan (Kana &amp; Co) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
