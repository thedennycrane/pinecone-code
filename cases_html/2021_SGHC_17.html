</div> Salzawiyah’s actions, therefore, were self-interested and motivated by financial gain. As observed by Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">Vasentha </span>at [40], “[o]ne who engages in drug trafficking activities for personal gain would bear a higher degree of culpability”. In this regard, Salzawiyah submits that she had been reluctant to participate in the drug trafficking operation and that it was Jumadi who had been the main driving force behind the drug trafficking operation, including the decision to ramp up the quantity of diamorphine bought and sold.

</div> This suggests a pattern of drug-related offending. Furthermore, it appears that the severity of the offending has escalated from possession and consumption of drugs to trafficking in them. As Menon CJ observed in <span class="font-italic">Vasentha </span>at [56], the presence of these relevant antecedents signals a greater need for specific deterrence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Second, Salzawiyah has also consented to the TIC Charges being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing (see [5] above).

</div>
</div> It is trite that the presence of TIC charges may result in an uplift in sentence, especially where the TIC charges and the charges proceeded with are similar in nature (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic"> v UI</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 500 at [38]). In the present case, all seven of the TIC Charges are drug-related – three relate to drug trafficking, two relate to drug possession, and two relate to drug consumption. Thus, they are similar to the charge proceeded with by the Prosecution against Salzawiyah. This reinforces the need for specific deterrence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Finally, I am cognisant of the fact that Salzawiyah was involved in trafficking a variety of drugs, including diamorphine, methamphetamine, cannabis and cannabis mixture. In <span class="font-italic">Vasentha </span>([7] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [67], Menon CJ explained this factor as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In my judgment, a higher sentence for an offender who is trafficking in a variety of drugs would be warranted where it can be reasonably inferred from this, together with any other circumstances including the absence of any other explanation, that there is a higher degree of sophistication in the offender’s drug operations or that these exist on a larger scale or that he is reaching out to a wider range of abusers. … In the final analysis, the question for the sentencing judge in each case is whether it can safely be inferred from this that the offender is more culpable or blameworthy such that this should be reflected in a more onerous sentence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In my view, the inferences referred to by Menon CJ should be drawn in this case. The variety of drugs, along with the evidence and findings made in the Main Judgment, show that the drug trafficking operation existed on a relatively large scale and that there was a certain degree of organisation. For instance, I found that the accused persons frequently dealt with large quantities of diamorphine (see [157] of the Main Judgment). Furthermore, the accused persons’ evidence and the notebooks in which they recorded drug-related transactions show that they had numerous customers and that they dealt with various types of drugs apart from diamorphine, such as methamphetamine, cannabis and methadone (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, see [158(a)], [158(b)] and [273] of the Main Judgment). The drugs were found in many parts of the Unit such as the living room, on both the beds in the bedroom and in the wardrobe located in the bedroom. There were also several digital weighing scales, many small empty plastic sachets, an electric plastic sealer and other paraphernalia for drug trafficking activities. In this context, Salzawiyah’s drug trafficking activities are clearly more blameworthy and require the imposition of a more onerous sentence.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Mitigating factors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 I shall now consider Salzawiyah’s mitigating factors. Salzawiyah’s counsel submit that she cooperated with the authorities upon arrest and was honest and truthful in her oral evidence at the trial.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Having considered the parties’ submissions, I find that minimal mitigatory weight should be given to Salzawiyah’s cooperation. Contrary to Salzawiyah’s submissions, she <span class="font-italic">did not </span>cooperate with the authorities upon arrest, nor was she <span class="font-italic">fully </span>truthful in her statements to the CNB or in her evidence at the trial. It was Salzawiyah’s case that she struggled during her arrest, which led to the CNB officers pinning her to the floor (see [286] of the Main Judgment). After her arrest, although Salzawiyah disclosed information regarding the drug trafficking operation and her involvement therein, she continued to deny the charge brought against her. This was similarly the case with her evidence at the trial, where she only admitted to possession of 9.81g of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking (see [51]–[52] of the Main Judgment). Although Salzawiyah disclosed her involvement with Jumadi and her general role in the drug trafficking operation, she maintained that she had no involvement in the purchase of the Bundles and the packets of diamorphine marked A1E1 and A1F1. In particular, she claimed that she had ceased her involvement in the drug trafficking operation by June 2017 and that she had not given Jumadi the money he used to purchase the Bundles. I rejected her evidence in this regard (see [277] and [285] of the Main Judgment). In these circumstances, the selective nature of Salzawiyah’s cooperation does not suggest true remorse for her actions. Furthermore, I disagree with Salzawiyah’s counsel that she was honest, as she was not fully forthright in her statements to the CNB and in her evidence at the trial. Therefore, little mitigating weight should be accorded in this respect.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Taking into account the indicative starting point, Salzawiyah’s culpability, as well as the aggravating and mitigating factors discussed above, I find that a sentence of 29 years’ imprisonment is appropriate. In reaching this decision, I am cognisant of the fact that the indicative starting point is already at the higher end of the sentencing range of 26 years’ to 29 years’ imprisonment. Given this significant length of imprisonment, any adjustment upwards should be made judiciously. Furthermore, as I have observed above, Salzawiyah was <span class="font-italic">not</span> the mastermind of the drug trafficking operation. She followed Jumadi’s lead in many respects. Thus, it might not be appropriate to impose the maximum sentence of life imprisonment, which is ordinarily reserved for the worst type of cases falling within the prohibition (see <span class="font-italic">Vasentha </span>([7] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [45], citing <span class="font-italic">Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 653 and <span class="font-italic">Sim Gek Yong v Public Prosecutor </span>[1995] 1 SLR(R) 185). Instead, having regard to Salzawiyah’s relatively high culpability and the aggravating factors discussed above, as well as the absence of any significant mitigating factors, a sentence of 29 years’ imprisonment is fair under the circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 This sentence of imprisonment is also in line with the sentencing precedents cited by the Prosecution and Salzawiyah’s counsel in their submissions. In this regard, I make two brief observations. First, many of the precedents cited by Salzawiyah’s counsel were cases in which the accused had pleaded guilty or where the accused had been a mere courier. These include the District Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Herman bin Juma’at </span>[2020] SGDC 9, which was emphasised by Salzawiyah’s counsel in their submissions.

</div>
</div>
</div> Given these significant points of distinction, I find such cases to be of limited precedential value. Furthermore, it bears noting that even in those cases, notwithstanding the mitigatory effect of a guilty plea and/or the lower culpability of a courier, the courts in those cases imposed imprisonment sentences ranging from 25 years to 29 years, depending on the factual matrix of those cases. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Second, the Prosecution and Salzawiyah’s counsel rely on unreported cases in support of their submissions. I place little weight on such cases, bearing in mind Valerie Thean J’s words of caution in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v BMF </span>[2019] SGHC 227 at [57] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The danger of placing undue reliance on unreported cases was highlighted by Chan Sek Keong CJ in <span class="font-italic">Luong Thi Trang Hoang Kathleen v Public Prosecutor </span>[2010] 1 SLR 707 at [21]. As Chan CJ noted, the court would not be able to properly appraise the facts and circumstances of the particular case, making it difficult to draw any meaningful comparison with the case at hand. Moreover, as observed by Chao Hick Tin JA in <span class="font-italic">Keeping Mark John v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 5 SLR 627 at [18], sentencing precedents without grounds or explanations are of relatively little precedential value, if at all, as they are unreasoned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Finally, I shall consider whether the imprisonment term of 29 years should be enhanced given that Salzawiyah is exempted from caning. As the High Court observed in <span class="font-italic">Amin bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 5 SLR 904 (“<span class="font-italic">Amin</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [53], the starting point is that an offender’s term of imprisonment should not be enhanced unless there are grounds to justify doing so. Furthermore, where deterrence is the dominant sentencing principle behind the imposition of caning, one of the court’s considerations is whether an additional term of imprisonment would be effective<span class="font-italic"> </span>in replacing the deterrent effect of caning (see <span class="font-italic">Amin </span>at [68]). As the court in <span class="font-italic">Amin </span>observed at [69]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… A key factor in this context is the length of imprisonment that the offence already carries. For example, if an offence carries a long minimum term of imprisonment, it is less likely to be the case that an enhancement of the sentence … in lieu of caning would likely provide an effective or meaningful deterrent to would-be offenders having regard to the sentence already prescribed for the offence. The marginal deterrent value of additional imprisonment would generally diminish in relation to the length of the original contemplated term of imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In this case, I note that the Prosecution is not seeking for an additional term of imprisonment to be imposed. This is an appropriate and fair approach. In my view, the appropriate punishment for Salzawiyah is 29 years’ imprisonment. Therefore, no additional term of imprisonment shall be imposed in lieu of caning. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Having determined the appropriate length of imprisonment, the remaining issue is the date on which the sentence should take effect. In this regard, I accept Salzawiyah’s submission that her sentence should be backdated to 22 June 2017, the date of her arrest.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary of findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In summary, I make the following findings: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Given that Salzawiyah has been convicted for trafficking in not less than 14.99g of diamorphine, the indicative starting point for the appropriate sentence is at the higher end of the sentencing range of 26 years’ to 29 years’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In this case, Salzawiyah’s culpability is relatively high. Although she was not the mastermind of the drug trafficking operation, she played an active and significant role in the drug trafficking operation. Furthermore, her actions were self-interested and motivated by financial gain. Notwithstanding any reservations she may have had, she continued<span class="font-italic"> </span>to participate in the drug trafficking operation, a decision for which she must now bear the consequences.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) There were several aggravating factors present in this case.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Salzawiyah has drug-related criminal antecedents, which evince an escalating pattern of offending. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Salzawiyah has seven TIC Charges, which are drug-related and similar to the trafficking charge on which she was convicted. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Salzawiyah was involved in trafficking a variety of drugs, which shows that the drug trafficking operation existed on a relatively large scale and required a certain degree of organisation.
