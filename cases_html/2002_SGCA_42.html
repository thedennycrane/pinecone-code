</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">1        This

appeal raised the question as to the meaning of the term "associate" in the

context of determining whether payments made by a company under liquidation to another

company were payments made to a "person connected" with the company, thus

rendering the payments made an unfair preference over other creditors of the company. The

point involved construing certain provisions in the Bankruptcy Act, which are made to

apply to the winding up or judicial management of a company.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2        The

court below held that the payments made by the appellants, Show Theatres, to the two

respondents (hereinafter referred to separately as "Shaw Pte" and "Eng Wah

Pte" respectively) were not payments made to "persons connected" with the

appellants and as those payments were made more than six months before Show Theatres were

placed under liquidation, the liquidator of Show Theatres (the liquidator) was not

entitled to recover the payment from the two respondents.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3        On 13

September 2002, we heard the appeal lodged by the liquidator and held that Shaw Pte and

Eng Wah Pte were "persons connected" with Show Theatres. As the payments were

made to the former within two years prior to the liquidation of Show Theatre, the payments

were presumed to constitute unfair preference. Therefore, the liquidator was entitled to

recover the same from Shaw Pte and Eng Wah Pte. We now give our reasons.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The facts</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4        The

facts giving rise to the action were these. Show Theatres were incorporated by Shaw Pte

and Eng Wah Pte in 1993, with the former holding 75% of its shares and the latter, 25%.

Shaw Pte was represented on the board of directors by Mr Shaw Vee Chung Harold and Mr Shaw

Vee King (the two Shaws) and Eng Wah Pte by Mr Goh Keng Beng. The two Shaws and Goh Keng

Beng were also directors of Shaw Pte and Eng Wah Pte respectively.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5        

Sometime in 1997, Show Theatres called on their shareholders to provide funds by way of

loans to the company which were required for their business needs. One of the purposes was

in relation to the purchase of shares in Chinatown Point and, for that, Show Theatres

needed a sum of $500,000. This sum was furnished by Shaw Pte and Eng Wah Pte in the

proportion of their shareholdings in Show Theatres, i.e., $375,000 and $125,000

respectively.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6        Some

two years later, on 6 August 1999, the two sums were repaid by Show Theatres to the two

respondents. It was common ground that at the time of the repayments, Show Theatres were

insolvent. The repayments were made more than six months, but less than two years, before

the presentation of the winding up petition.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7        On 24

October 2000, a creditor of Show Theatres presented a petition for the company to be wound

up. The winding-up order was granted on 17 November 2000. The liquidator, after reviewing

the records and accounts of the company, thought that the two repayments constituted

unfair preference and thus applied to court to have the two sums restored to the company.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8        In

the court below, the respondents raised three arguments to resist the liquidator’s

application. First, that the two sums were, in fact, moneys held by Show Theatres on a

trust, of the nature enunciated in <i>Quistclose Investments Ltd v Rolls Razor Ltd</i>

[1970] AC 567, for both the respondents. Second, that the rules laid down in the Companies

(Applications of Bankruptcy Act Provisions) Regulations [CABAR] were not valid as the

Minister had no such power to make them. Third, as the respondents were not "persons

connected" with Show Theatres and as the repayments were not made to them during the

period of six months before the winding up of the company, the presumption of unfair

preference did not arise and the payments were in order. </font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The issue</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9        

Before us, there was really only one issue. Were Shaw Pte and Eng Wah Pte "persons

connected with" Show Theatres when the repayments were made to them? The answer to

this question in turn depends on the meaning to be given to the term "associate"

in the definition of a "person connected with a company" laid down in CABAR. The

two other issues taken in the court below were, quite rightly, not seriously pursued

before us. They were adequately dealt with by the court below.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Relevant provisions</font></p>

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10        

Section 329(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50) provides that –</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">

    modifications as may be prescribed, any transfer, mortgage, delivery of goods, <u>payment</u>,

    voidable under section 98, 99 or 103 of the Bankruptcy Act 1995 (read with sections 100,

    101 and 102 thereof) shall in the event of the company being wound up be void or voidable

    in like manner. (Emphasis added).</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11        

Section 99(1) and (2) of the Bankruptcy Act provides that where an individual is adjudged

a bankrupt and he has, at the "relevant time", given an unfair preference to any

person, the Official Assignee may apply to court for an order to remedy the situation.

"Relevant time" is defined in s 100(1)(b) as meaning, in relation to the

situation where an unfair preference is given to a person who is an "associate"

of the individual, a period of two years, ending with the day on which the individual is

adjudged a bankrupt. The desire to prefer is presumed where the payment is made to an

associate of the bankrupt (s 99(4) &amp; (5) of the Bankruptcy Act).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12        

Section 101 defines who is an associate. The following subsections are germane to the

matter at hand:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13        

However, as recognised in s 329(1) of the Companies Act, these provisions of the

Bankruptcy Act have to be applied to a company in liquidation, or placed under judicial

management, with the necessary modifications. This is prescribed in CABAR, the regulations

made by the Minister pursuant to the powers conferred upon him under s 329(1). Regulation

3 provides that ss 98-103 shall be read subject to –</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"(a) the modifications set

    judicial management or being wound up …"</font></p>

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14        

Regulation 4 provides that any reference to an associate of a person or an individual who

has been adjudged a bankrupt in, inter alia, ss 99 and 100 (except s 101) of the

Bankruptcy Act "shall be read as a reference to a person connected with a company

… against which a winding-up order has been made." It seems to us that s 101 is

expressly excluded by regulation 4 because regulation 2 already defines an

"associate" to mean "an associate of a person or company as determined in

accordance with s 101 of the Bankruptcy Act, as modified by regulation 5".</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15        A

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16        For

</ol>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Proper construction</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17        The

problem is one of construction and it seems to us that much of the difficulty arose

because provisions meant to be applicable to the bankruptcy of an individual are made to

apply to the winding up or judicial management of companies. Although regulation 3 states

that those provisions of the Bankruptcy Act should be applied to a company under

liquidation subject to regulations 4 to 9 and "such textual and other

modifications" as may be necessary, the difficulty appears to be in determining what

should be the appropriate "textual and other modifications" to be made to s 101

in relation to a company under liquidation.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18        

Regulation 4 clearly spells out that as far as ss 99 and 100 of the Bankruptcy Act are

concerned, references therein to an associate of a bankrupt individual shall be read, in

relation to a company under liquidation or judicial management, to refer to "a person

connected with a company". Under regulation 2, a "person connected with a

company" is, inter alia, "an associate of a director of the company." Who

is an "associate" is defined in s 101, as modified by regulation 5. By virtue of

section 101(4), as far as the three directors of Show Theatres were concerned, they would,

as they were directors of Shaw Pte and Eng Wah Pte, be treated as employed by the latter

two companies. Thus, the two Shaws were associates of Shaw Pte and vice versa. The same

would be the position as between Eng Wah Pte and Goh Keng Beng. Following from that,

taking the case of Eng Wah Pte, the latter would be an associate of Goh Keng Beng, who was

a director of Show Theatre. Accordingly, Eng Wah Pte was a person connected with Show

Theatres. The same was the position between Shaw Pte and Show Theatres. The effect of this

construction is that where two companies have a common director or common directors, one

company will be treated as connected with the other.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19        In

the court below, the judge could not reach the same conclusion as we did because he

considered that the opening phrase of s 101(4), "A person is an associate of an

individual" should be modified to read "A person is an associate of the company

under liquidation". By so construing s 101(4), he held that the two Shaws were

associates of Show Theatres only. Section 101(4) would not operate to deem the two Shaws

as associates of Shaw Theatre or vice versa. This, in turn, meant that Shaw Pte could not

be a person connected with Show Theatres. The same position applied as between Eng Wah Pte

and Show Theatres.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20        As

we see it, the expression "an individual" in s 101(4) should not be read to

refer only to the company under liquidation. This would not be consistent with the second

limb of s 101(4) where it is provided that "any director … of <u>a</u> company

should be treated as employed by <u>that</u> company" and "that company"

must be referring to "<u>a</u> company". It is clear that the provisions of s

101(4) are of general application, otherwise they would not have used the article <u>a</u>.

We are fortified in this view by the opening words of regulation 5 which read "in

addition to the provisions of s 101 … by which the question whether a<i> person</i>

is an associate of another <i>person</i> is to be determined", repeating the words of

s 101(1) "any question whether a <i>person</i> is an associate of another <i>person</i>".

It must be borne in mind that under the Interpretation Act a "person" is defined

to include "any company, or association or body of persons …" In other

words, s 101(4) should apply to any situation which calls for a determination of the

relationship between two entities. It should not be confined to apply only to the

situation of a <u>person</u> being an associate of the company under liquidation. On this

construction, Shaw Pte would be an associate of the two Shaws and as the two Shaws were

also directors of Show Theatres, Shaw Pte would be a person connected with Show Theatres.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Policy considerations</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21        We

were mindful that this ruling could have some repercussions in view of the corporate

practice in Singapore, where it is a common phenomenon to see a person sitting on the

boards of several companies. We do not, however, see anything seriously objectionable in

the construction we have given. All it means is that whenever two companies have a common

director or common directors, they are to be treated as "connected with" each

other. In this regard, it is vitally important to bear in mind the clear objective behind

ss 98 to 101. What is prescribed in those sections is a scheme for the protection of

creditors generally. It underscores the need for transparency. Because of the connection

due to common directorship, a payment to a "connected" company made within the

period of two years prior to the liquidation of the company is presumed to be made in

unfair preference and it is for the "connected" company to rebut that

presumption. It is right, and not unfair, to assume that a director exercises influence

within the company.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22        

Therefore, it is wholly justified to require a "connected" company to show that

the payment received was not an instance of unfair preference. If it could be shown that

the payment was made for proper commercial considerations, the presumption would be

rebutted: see <i>Re Fairway Magazines Ltd</i> [1993] BCLC 643 at 649 per Mummery J. There

is really no overriding policy or commercial consideration which militates against this

construction. Indeed, in the interest of maintaining good business practices and to

protect all persons who, in good faith, have dealings with the company, there should be

closer scrutiny and stricter rules governing transactions between related companies.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Additional point</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23        The

same conclusion could also be reached by applying the definition of a "person

connected with a company" in regulation 2 of CABAR, read together with ss (6) and (9)

of s 101. This argument was, however, not raised by the appellants in the court below and

the appellants accordingly asked for leave to raise it pursuant to O 57 r 9A(4) of the

Rules of Court. As this was a point of law, and no further evidence was needed to make the

submission, there was no reason why leave should not be granted : see <i>Cheong Kim Hock v

Lin Securities (Pte)</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=6309&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1992] 2 SLR 349</a>.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24        As

will be recalled, another definition of a "person connected with a company" is

"an associate of the company". Section 101(6) provides that "a company is

an associate of an individual if that individual has control of it." Section

101(9)(b) amplifies the concept of control by providing that an individual shall be taken

to have control of a company if, inter alia, "he is entitled to exercise, or control

the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any general meeting of the

company." The subsection further provides that "where two or more persons

together satisfy that condition, they shall be taken to have control of the company."

(hereinafter referred to as the proviso to s 101[9]).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25        The

respondents argued that the word "individual" in s 101(6) should, like the same

word in s 101(4), be read, in the context of the present case, to mean "the company

in liquidation". In our opinion, such a reading would be in error and would undermine

the very objective implicit in ss 98-101 of the Bankruptcy Act as this illustration will

show:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<u><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Illustration</font></p>
</u><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Suppose Company A has control

    over Company B. Knowing that Company B is already insolvent, Company A decides to cause

    Company B to return a loan given by Company A to Company B. On the respondents’

    interpretation, Company A and Company B would only be deemed associates if Company B (the

    insolvent company) has control over Company A and not the other way round.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">26        In

our opinion, the construction contended for by the respondents would give rise to an

anomalous result, and with respect, an absurd result, as that is precisely the kind of

transaction which the law should seek to restrain. Like the construction we gave to s

101(4), the words "an individual" in s 101(6) should simply be read as

"another company".</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">27        

Following from this interpretation, Shaw Pte and Eng Wah Pte were, therefore,

"associates" of Show Theatres, as the former collectively exercised complete

control of Show Theatres. It could not be disputed that Shaw Pte and Eng Wah Pte acted in

concert in getting Show Theatres to repay them the two sums.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">28        In

this connection, the respondents submitted that they were separate legal entities and that

it was necessary for the appellants to prove that each of the respondents individually was

an "associate" of Show Theatres. In our opinion, this submission overlooks the

proviso to s 101(9). If two companies, X and Y, <u>both receive repayments</u> from the

insolvent company, and between them they exercised 1/3 or more of the voting power of the

latter company, then by virtue of the proviso they are deemed to be associates of the

latter. And if X and Y were to hold 100% of the voting power in the insolvent company the

proviso should apply to the situation with even greater force. All the more so where it

was clear that the two companies (like Shaw Pte and Eng Wah Pte here) had acted in concert

in getting their loans repaid by the insolvent company. This would be wholly in line with

the scheme to render void payments made in unfair preference. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">29        

Accordingly, this would be a further basis to hold that Shaw Pte and Eng Wah Pte were

companies "connected with" Show Theatres.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Position in UK</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">30        In

passing, we would mention that the conclusion we reached herein is consistent with the

position prevailing in the United Kingdom, although we should add that the UK legislation

(Insolvency Act 1986) is clearer, as it does not suffer from the drafting complexity

arising from importing and adapting rules governing individual bankruptcy into the regime

of corporate insolvency. The UK Insolvency Act 1986 is a piece of consolidating

legislation, bringing within one umbrella enactments of both company insolvency and

individual bankruptcy, with separate parts in the Act dealing with each aspect and a

common part applying to both company insolvency and individual bankruptcy. The definition

of a "person connected with a company" in CABAR is in all material respects the

same as that provided for in the English 1986 Act. As we see it, the intention implicit in

s 329(1) and the regulations in CABAR was to follow the scheme of things applicable in the

UK.</font></p>
