JP Nelson averred that Builders Hub had fraudulently created the Five Cappitech Documents and delivered them to JP Nelson in order to deceive JP Nelson into making a total downpayment of $155,160 to Builders Hub (the “Downpayment”). This sum amounted to 45% of the contract price (being $344,800) between JP Nelson and Builders Hub for air-conditioning systems.

Firstly, Builders Hub averred that JP Nelson was seeking to review the merits of the Adjudicators’ decisions, which was outside the court’s supervisory jurisdiction. This was because JP Nelson’s setting aside application was centred on the issue of whether the Adjudication Application lodged on 24 June 2022 was premature, which had been fully canvassed in the Adjudication Determinations.

</div> Thirdly, Builders Hub argued that in any event, the Adjudicators had correctly found that the Adjudication Application was not prematurely filed.

The Five Cappitech Documents were not even submitted as part of the adjudication bundle of documents.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Second, JP Nelson failed to satisfy the second step of the test as the facts in question were not material to the issuance of the Adjudication Determinations. The Five Cappitech Documents were not material because they related only to the main contract works and not to any part of the claims for variation works (as the only disputed claims) on which the Adjudication Determinations were based. Further, the Response Amount, which JP Nelson claimed was tainted by fraud, was paid before the Adjudication Determination was issued. Additionally, JP Nelson’s liability to Builders Hub was reduced by the Response Amount in the Adjudication Review Determination to reflect the payment made by JP Nelson. Therefore, no part of the amount eventually awarded to Builders Hub by the Adjudicators contained the sum of $329,284.98.

This claim was solely based on <span class="font-italic">work done</span> for the completion of piping, ducting and cable work for the air-conditioning system.

</div>  If the court were to consider whether the Adjudication Application was made prematurely, and to subsequently make a finding on whether parties had varied the contractual date for submitting payment claims, that would amount to reviewing the merits of the Adjudication Determinations. This would fall outside the court’s supervisory jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In my view, it was entirely within the court’s supervisory jurisdiction to determine whether Builders Hub had lodged the Adjudication Application prematurely. The timeliness of the Adjudication Application was a question that determined compliance with s 12(2) and s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA, and therefore went to the jurisdiction of the Adjudicator. I agreed with Builders Hub that the Adjudicators were fully entitled to make a finding in relation to the Adjudicator’s jurisdiction, but the court was not bound by this finding. These are for the reasons that I explain below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment (Amendment) Act 2018 (Act 47 of 2018), which took effect on 15 December 2019, introduced a non-exhaustive list of grounds for setting aside an adjudication determination under s 27(6) of the SOPA. Section 27(6)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the SOPA specifically provides that a party can commence court proceedings where the adjudication application was not made in accordance with the SOPA. In this case, if the Adjudication Application was lodged prematurely, it would be non-compliant with ss 12(2) and 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA: see <span class="font-italic">Newcon</span><span class="font-italic"> Builders </span>at [30]. Section 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) prescribes that an adjudication application must be made within seven days “<span class="font-italic">after the entitlement … first arises</span>” [emphasis added]. The wording of the statute makes clear that the entitlement to make an adjudication application must have first arisen. This entitlement is governed by s 12(2) of the SOPA, which, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, provides that where the claimant disputes a payment response by the respondent, and the dispute is not settled <span class="font-italic">by the end of the dispute settlement period</span>, the claimant is entitled to make an adjudication application under s 13 of the SOPA. Therefore, if the Adjudication Application was made before Builders Hub’s entitlement to do so arose, it was not a valid adjudication application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Prior to the enactment of s 27(6)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the SOPA, the Court of Appeal had already made clear in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Citiwall Safety Glass Pte Ltd v Mansource Interior Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 1 SLR 797 at [49] that a court in a setting aside application is concerned with:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…  the propriety of the [adjudication determination] itself (that is to say, with <span class="font-italic">issues relating to the jurisdiction of the adjudicator, including non-compliance with the SOPA</span>, and procedural propriety in the adjudication, including whether there was a breach of natural justice).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I recognised that on a plain reading of s 27(6)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the SOPA, the provision could conceivably cover any breach of the Act regardless of the materiality of the breach. This contrasted with the seemingly narrower view taken in the case law prior to its enactment. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chua Say Eng</span> observed that an adjudication determination could be set aside if:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> … the claimant, in the course of making an adjudication application, had not complied with one (or more) of the provisions under the Act <span class="font-italic">which </span><span class="font-italic">was so important that it was the legislative purpose that an act done in breach of the provision should be invalid …</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 However, I made no finding on whether Parliament intended to invalidate all adjudication and review applications that were “not made in accordance” with the provisions of the SOPA. In the case of <span class="font-italic">Newcon</span><span class="font-italic"> Builders, </span>which was decided before the enactment of s 27(6)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the SOPA, Loh J found that an adjudication application made before the expiry of the dispute settlement period was invalid. Further, Loh J held that the court was entitled, as part of its supervisory jurisdiction, to set aside an adjudication determination which had been rendered pursuant to a premature adjudication application in breach of ss 12(2) and 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA (<span class="font-italic">Newcon</span><span class="font-italic"> Builders</span> at [45]). Loh J provided extensive reasoning for this conclusion (at [23]–[45] of <span class="font-italic">Newcon</span><span class="font-italic"> Builders</span>), with which I respectfully agree. In my judgment, these arguments applied with even greater force in this case, where the Adjudication Application was alleged to be made even earlier than in <span class="font-italic">Newcon</span><span class="font-italic"> Builders,</span> <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>before the dispute settlement period arose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In my judgment, it made no difference that the Adjudicators had determined the validity of the Adjudication Application. In my earlier decision of <span class="font-italic">Lendlease Singapore Pte Ltd v M &amp; S Management &amp; Contracts Services Pte Ltd</span> [2019] SGHC 139 (“<span class="font-italic">Lendlease</span>”), I considered an application to set aside an adjudication determination on the grounds that the adjudication application had been lodged by the defendant out of time, in breach of s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA (<span class="font-italic">Lendlease </span>at [1]). Crucially, this jurisdictional objection had been canvassed in the adjudication process. The plaintiff had already detailed its objections that the adjudication application was lodged out of time in the plaintiff’s adjudication response, and the adjudicator below dismissed the plaintiff’s objection in the adjudication determination (<span class="font-italic">Lendlease </span>at [4]–[5]). Nonetheless, I set aside the adjudication application because the contractual terms clearly showed that the time for lodging the adjudication application began to run from the date of physical service of the payment, as opposed to the date stated in the payment claim, which meant that the application was lodged out of time (<span class="font-italic">Lendlease </span>at [18]–[19]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Builders Hub also relied on the case of <span class="font-italic">Emergent Engineering Pte Ltd v China Construction Realty Co Pte Ltd</span> [2022] SGHC 276 (“<span class="font-italic">Emergent Engineering</span>”) to support its position that JP Nelson was essentially mounting a backdoor attempt to review the merits of the Adjudicators’ decisions.

</div>
</div>
</div> In my judgment, Builders Hub had misapplied the decision in <span class="font-italic">Emergent </span><span class="font-italic">Engineering</span>. In that case, the respondent had sought to set aside the adjudication determination on the basis that the applicant was not entitled to serve payment claim 25 (“PC 25”) because the respondent had terminated the sub-contract (<span class="font-italic">Emergent Engineering</span> at [48]). However, the court in <span class="font-italic">Emergent Engineering </span>held that there was no genuine question of the adjudicator acting in excess of his jurisdiction. The respondent in that case did not allege that any of the requirements for service of payment claims, stipulated under s 10 of the SOPA, were breached. In fact, it was undisputed by parties that PC 25 was compliant with all the payment claim requirements under s 10 of the SOPA. Therefore, the respondent’s case was not based on s 27(6)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA, which provides that a party to an adjudication may commence proceedings to set aside an adjudication determination on the ground that the payment claim was not served in accordance with s 10 of the SOPA (<span class="font-italic">Emergent Engineering</span> at [48]). Instead, it was premised fundamentally on the respondent’s disagreement with the adjudicator’s finding that the respondent had not validly terminated the sub-contract. This contrasted with the present case, where the finding of whether the parties had varied the contractual date for submitting payment claims has a bearing on s 27(6)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the SOPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In short, JP Nelson was entitled to seek a review of whether the Adjudication Application had been lodged prematurely.

</div> Having reviewed all the evidence before me, I held that the Adjudicators came to the correct decision. The evidence was strong that both parties intended to vary the contract terms on submission for payment claims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I highlighted the following facts. Firstly, the language of the agreement recorded in the Minutes was mandatory and not permissive. The Minutes stated that Builders Hub “<span class="font-italic">shall</span>” submit progress claims on every third week of the month. It was unsustainable for JP Nelson to argue that at most, the Minutes suggested that Builders Hub <span class="font-italic">could</span> serve its payment claim on the third week of each month.

</div> Furthermore, it did not make sense for parties to record that Builders Hub was <span class="font-italic">permitted</span> to serve its payment claim on the third week of each month, because Builders Hub was clearly already allowed to do so under cl 22.1.1 read with cl 22.1.4 of the REDAS Conditions of the original contract.

I was unconvinced by JP Nelson’s argument that the 18 April Email was completely unrelated to PC 37. According to JP Nelson, this was illustrated by how the subject title stated “Progress Claim no. 36”, not PC 37, and how the reference to requiring more time to prepare the claim was in relation to “this month”, as opposed to any other payment claim.

</div>
</div>
</div> In my view, if there had been no agreement to vary the dates for payment claim submissions, there was no reason for Builders Hub to inform JP Nelson that they needed “a little more time to prepare our claim”. This was because, based on the original contract, Builders Hub would only have had to submit payment claim 36 by 8 May 2022, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>it had a period of three weeks from the 18 April Email to furnish payment claim 36. Furthermore, it was undisputed that JP Nelson did not respond to the 18 April Email. If JP Nelson disagreed that it had previously directed that payment claims are to be served on the third week of the month, it would be more probable for JP Nelson to have replied to the 18 April Email and to have expressed its disagreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 For completeness, Builders Hub’s conduct after the alleged variation of Contract was a neutral factor. JP Nelson argued that in spite of the alleged variation, 15 out of the 20 claims served by Builders Hub after Meeting No 35, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, payment claims 18 to 37, were not served on the third week of the month. On the other hand, none of those payment claims were served on the eighth of the month either. Therefore, I found that the contractual terms on service of payment claims had been varied by parties, and the Adjudication Application was not premature.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In the alternative, Builders Hub averred that JP Nelson was estopped from insisting that PC 37 was required to be submitted on the 8th day of each month. JP Nelson’s failure to respond to the 18 April Email and failure to object that there was an agreement amounted to a representation that Builders Hub was to submit its payment claims on the third week of the month.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The Adjudicator found that even if parties had not agreed to vary the Contract:

To set aside the adjudication determination, the innocent party would therefore have to establish (<span class="font-italic">Facade Solution</span> at [30]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The facts which were relied on by the adjudicator in arriving at the adjudication determination.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) That those facts were false.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) That the claimant either knew or ought reasonably to have known them to be false.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) That the innocent party did not, in fact, <span class="font-italic">subjectively</span> know or have <span class="font-italic">actual</span> knowledge of the true position throughout the adjudication proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Notably, the requirement set out at [64(d)] is restricted to subjective or actual knowledge because there is no need for the innocent party to show that the evidence of fraud could have been obtained or discovered with reasonable diligence during the adjudication proceedings (<span class="font-italic">Facade Solution</span> at [31]). This is because parties, in dealing with the adjudicator, are expected to act with utmost probity, and a fraudulent party should not be allowed to get away with fraud because he had not been found out earlier in the course of the adjudication proceedings (<span class="font-italic">Facade Solution </span>at [33]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In the second step, the innocent party must establish that the facts in question were material to the issuance of the adjudication determination.

In other words, the facts must have been an operative cause in the issuance of the adjudication determination, based on the reasoning and arguments at the time the determination in question was made (<span class="font-italic">Facade Solution </span>at [35]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Where an adjudication determination was obtained by fraud, the court is generally unsympathetic to the claimant, as the claimant would have engaged in deliberate and dishonest conduct to acquire benefits to which it was not entitled. On this basis, fraud unravels all and the starting point is that the adjudication determination that was corrupted by fraudulent conduct would be tainted in its entirety, and the whole must fail. This serves to discourage claimants from committing fraud. However, in exceptional circumstances, the court may exercise its discretion to sever the impugned portion of an adjudication determination to permit the claimant to retain the balance adjudicated sum. This discretion would be exercised where the fraud was <span class="font-italic">de minimis </span>both in terms of nature and quantum, such that the policy consideration of facilitating cash flow under the SOPA would outweigh the need to uphold public confidence in the administration of justice. The factors that the court should consider include: the nature of the fraud, the quantum of the claim affected by the fraud and the requirements of textual and substantial severability as enunciated by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Rong Shun Engineering &amp; Construction Pte Ltd v CP Ong Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2017] 4 SLR 359 at [155]: see <span class="font-italic">Facade Solution</span> at [61].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Before I considered the elements of the test in <span class="font-italic">Facade Solution</span>, I made the following findings of fact.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The falsity of the Five Cappitech Documents</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Firstly, I found that Builders Hub had fraudulently submitted the Five Cappitech Documents to deceive JP Nelson. It was undisputed that Builders Hub sent the Five Cappitech Documents to Builders Hub (see above at [18]–[19]). On the face of it, each document, except for Cheque No 128899 (which was allegedly sent by Builders Hub to Cappitech), originated from Cappitech. However, in Cappitech’s 16 November Email, it denied ever issuing the four documents to Builders Hub, nor receiving Cheque No 128899.

</div> I found this explanation to be unbelievable.

In PC 37, under Items H(1)(a)(i) and H(1)(a)(ii) on “Air-conditioning system”, Builders Hub only claimed an additional 5% of the contract sum from the previous payment claim. The percentage increase was from 70% in payment claim 36 to 75% in PC 37. Subsequently, in Interim Valuation 37, JP Nelson certified the 5% claimed under Items H(1)(a)(i) and H(1)(a)(ii). This 5% then formed part of the Response Amount of $329,248.98. To be clear, however, the remaining 70%, had been claimed in previous payment claims, and was therefore not part of the 5%. Further, in Interim Valuation 37, Builders Hub stated that the “<span class="font-italic">Reason for Difference</span>” from the previous valuation was “Based on Workdone”.

The court is careful not to find fraud unless it is distinctly pleaded and proved; but once it is proved, it vitiates judgments, contracts and all transactions whatsoever …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In my judgment, Builders Hub was still holding onto the fruits of its fraud, and this was something that the court had the power to interfere with.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 On 26 August 2022, the Contract between JP Nelson and Builders Hub was terminated. It was undisputed that Builders Hub had received at least 75% of the price for the air-conditioning system works. However, Builders Hub never supplied the air-conditioning units to JP Nelson. In relation to the contract for air-conditioning system works, Builders Hub only completed the piping, ducting and cable tray works for the air-conditioning systems. <span class="font-italic">Prima facie</span>, this meant that 75% of the contract price for air-conditioning system works was apportioned to ducting, piping and cable tray works. Otherwise, JP Nelson would have overpaid for its air-conditioning system works.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Both parties had tendered further submissions on the 75% valuation for the air-conditioning works in Interim Valuation 37. JP Nelson argued that the costs of the air-conditioning units would far exceed the 25% of the contract price that Builders Hub had quoted, and therefore there had been overpayment. Based on Builders Hub’s computations, which relied on Cappitech’s fake quotation sum of $310,990, the air-conditioning equipment cost roughly 54% of the contract sum, and the piping and cable tray works cost about 46% of the contract sum.

</div>
</div> This also exceeded the 25% allocation for air-conditioning units installation that Builders Hub had claimed. Therefore, on both parties’ cases, Builders Hub had been overpaid for the air-conditioning works contract. Taking Builders Hub’s case at its highest, it had been overpaid by a sum of $5,540.73.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 By the end of their contractual relationship, JP Nelson had overpaid Builders Hub, and this was a result of the Downpayment that had been induced by fraud. These monies continued to remain in the hands of Builders Hub. Further, by virtue of its fraud, Builders Hub also acquired another substantive benefit – it secured an early payment in the form of the Downpayment. Conversely, when JP Nelson made early payment, it was exposed to risk of losing the Downpayment, especially if Builders Hub became insolvent. The court takes a serious view towards fraud, and there is no public interest in allowing a litigant who had acted fraudulently to retain the fruits of its fraud. According to Builders Hub, this amounted to about $5,540, and JP Nelson was unable to provide a figure that was substantially higher. As Denning LJ said, “fraud unravels everything” The question then is, what constitutes “everything”? In my judgment, to simply order Builders Hub to repay the sum overpaid would be an inadequate expression of the court’s disapprobation towards fraud. Builders Hub would hardly be worse off, and this order would not account for the early payment received by Builders Hub. Such a lenient view would be insufficient to deter fraudulent conduct. On the other hand, to invalidate the entire Payment Claim would unfairly punish Builders Hub as the amount claimed was far in excess of the $155,160 which was the subject of the fraud. In the circumstances of the case, I held that the Review Adjudicated Amount should be reduced by the amount that the Builders Hub had unlawfully gained as a result of its fraud, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>$155,160.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In the circumstances, JP Nelson succeeded on its ground on fraud. I ordered that the Adjudication Review Amount be reduced by the amount of $155,160, and Builders Hub is ordered to repay JP Nelson the sum of $155,160, being the sum that Builders Hub had unlawfully gained by the fraud. As JP Nelson had partially succeeded in its application, and in view of the conduct of Builders Hub, I ordered costs in favour of JP Nelson. Having regard to parties’ submissions, as well as all the relevant factors, I awarded JP Nelson $12,000 in legal costs (inclusive of disbursements) plus GST. Builders Hub shall pay these costs to JP Nelson, with interest from the date of judgment at 5.33%.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Lee Seiu Kin<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chuah Chee Kian Christopher, Tan Jia Wei Justin, Huang Zixian, Chiam Yunxin, Koh Huini Valerie and Lim Qin Yong (WongPartnership LLP) for the applicant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lee Peng Khoon Edwin, Amanda Koh Jia Yi, Smrithi Sadasivam and Yap Wei Xuen Mendel (Eldan Law LLP) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-center font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
