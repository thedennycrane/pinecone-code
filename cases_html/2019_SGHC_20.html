Andrew Tani told Tony Lie that he was looking for an investor to provide USD 1 million which would go towards an initial order of the MSP Products in order to gain exclusive distributorship.  Tony Lie agreed in principle to invest the USD 1 million but later had second thoughts. The MSP Products consisted of a range of lubricants and in order to place an order, it was necessary to specify the particular MSP Products and the quantity of the same. As the Plaintiffs had no knowledge which of the MSP Products would sell well, there was a risk that demand for the MSP Products in Indonesia might not match the Plaintiffs’ order composition for an initial USD 1 million order. He was therefore prepared to invest only USD 500,000 to determine if the MSP Products could sell well in Indonesia and, if so, which of them.

As can be seen in the letter, Patricia Yong addressed the question of replacement and refund in an ambiguous and non-committal way. She gave assurances that “[r]eplacement of products [would] never occur” because of the way orders for MSP Products were made and similarly, “there [would] be no need to stipulate a refund policy”. I find that the fact that Patricia Yong agreed to sign the 26 March 2010 Letter supports a finding that there had been discussions about replacement and refund at the 10 March 2010 Meeting. That in turn tends to support a finding that Representations in that regard had been made. The non-committal language of the 26 March 2010 Letter is explained by Andrew Tani’s evidence that when Patricia Yong learnt about the Representations, she was upset and requested Andrew Tani to draft the 26 March 2010 Letter.

</div> It is possible to construe the ambiguous and non-committal phrasing of the 26 March 2010 Letter on replacement and refund as an attempt by Patricia Yong to assure the Plaintiffs that they would not arise, in the hope that Tony Lie would thereby be given some comfort and reassurance.

In my view, Andrew Tani’s evidence and the motivation behind the 26 March 2010 Letter must be read in the light of Andrew Tani’s role in the transaction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 As noted earlier, Andrew Tani stood to earn commission from any order for MSP Products which the 1st Plaintiff made. As such, it is understandable that he would have wanted to ensure that Tony Lie (who was effectively funding the entire venture) proceeded with the investment. In that light, I find that Andrew Tani’s evidence on the reason why the 26 March 2010 Letter was drafted the way it was and the motivation behind the 26 March 2010 Letter is credible. He was trying to satisfy Tony Lie who only invested in the 1st Plaintiff because of the Representations and at the same time accommodate Patricia Yong who was unhappy that Avram had made those Representations. He admitted as much in his testimony.

At the same time, he had to ensure that Patricia Yong’s unhappiness about the Representations was addressed. Andrew Tani therefore drafted the 26 March 2010 Letter the way he did.

</div> The Plaintiffs argue that if, amongst the Representations, Avram had not represented that the 1st Plaintiff would obtain exclusive distributorship without having to make a firm order for USD 1 million worth of MSP Products, there would have been no reason for her to declare that “Indonesia is finally exclusively represented”, since according to the Defendants’ themselves, in order to satisfy clause 3.6 of the AMA, there had to be a single order for USD 1 million worth of the MSP Products.

First, there was never any other invoice after the 8 April 2010 Invoice (see above at [60] to [710]). Second, despite Patricia Yong’s declaration in the said email, the Exclusive Distributorship Right was in fact never granted to the 1st Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The Defendants argue that the Exclusive Distributorship Right was not granted because the 1st Plaintiff did not meet the criteria for exclusive distributorship under the AMA.

</div> and <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Yardley</span> [2002] AC 164 (“<span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span><span class="font-italic"> v Yardley</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Kayford</span>, the company, Kayford Ltd, carried on a mail order business in bedding quilts, stretch covers for chairs and the like. The customers either paid the full price in advance or paid a deposit. After an advertising campaign by the company in August 1972, similar to previous campaigns, money came in for goods, but the company found itself unable to obtain supplies to meet all the orders. Mr Kay, the managing director of the company, was becoming concerned for the customers of the company who had sent and were sending money for goods. He met his accountants and was advised that a separate bank account should be opened by the company and all further moneys paid by customers for goods not yet delivered should be paid into this account and withdrawn only when the goods had been delivered. The object of doing this was so that if the company had to go into liquidation, these sums of money could and would be refunded to those who paid them. Mr Kay did as advised.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 When the company went into liquidation, the question for the court was whether the money in the bank account was held on trust for those who paid it, or formed part of the assets of the company available to creditors in the insolvency. Megarry J held that the money in the bank account was held on trust for the customers; by paying the money into a separate account, the company had set up a trust account so that the customers were not mere creditors but were beneficiaries of the trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Commenting on <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Kayford</span> and cases following it, the author of <span class="font-italic">Parker and Mellows</span>: <span class="font-italic">The Modern Law of Trusts</span> (A. J. Oakley) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 9th Ed, 2008) (“<span class="font-italic">Parker &amp; Mellows</span>”) observed at [9 – 065]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It has to be admitted that it is not easy to justify the existence of a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust in cases of this kind. Those paying money in question never had any intention of becoming anything other than general creditors of the recipient. Consequently, it is not easy to see why the unilateral creation of proprietary rights in their favour does not amount to an undue preference if the only reason why they did become beneficiaries of a trust rather than general creditors of the recipient is that unilateral act.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 It is curious why counsel for the Plaintiffs sought to rely on this case. From the Plaintiffs’ closing submissions, it appears the case was cited for 2 propositions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) that, to constitute an express trust, there is no need to use the words “trust” or [“confidence”] or the like. The question is whether or not in substance an intention to create a trust has been manifested; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) “that the sender of the money may create a trust by using appropriate words when he sends the money or the [recipient] may do it by taking suitable steps on or before receiving the money. If either is done, the obligations in respect of the money are transferred from contract to property, from debt to trust…”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 To begin with, the material facts of <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Kayford</span> are quite different from the case at hand. In the former, the trust was created by the unilateral act of the recipient company setting up a separate bank account into which the moneys paid by customers were deposited. The customers did not contemplate any trust when they paid the money.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In contrast, the Plaintiffs assert that when the sum of USD 1 million was paid to the 1st Defendant, it was with the understanding and/or on the basis of Representations made by Avram that the Balance Sum was to be a deposit for the second order if it was made and that it would be refunded in the event no such order was made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Clearly, <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span><span class="font-italic"> v Yardley </span>is more to the point. As I explain below, on the basis of that case, it is open to the Plaintiffs to submit that by reason of the pleaded facts as outlined above, a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust of the Balance Sum came into being at the time the deposit was made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 But before I go further, it is instructive to briefly recount the eponymous House of Lords decision in <span class="font-italic">Barclays Bank v </span><span class="font-italic">Quistclose Investments</span> [1970] AC 567 (<span class="font-italic">Barclays </span><span class="font-italic">Bank v Quistclose</span>). There, a company needed money to pay a dividend upon its ordinary shares. It obtained a loan from <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> Investments on the basis that the money was only to be used for the purpose of paying the dividend. The money loaned by <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> Investments was paid into a separate account with the company’s bankers, and it was agreed that the account would ‘only be used to meet the dividend’ (<span class="font-italic">Barclays </span><span class="font-italic">Bank v Quistclose </span>at 579). However, before the dividend was paid, the company went into liquidation. The question whether the money in the separate account was trust money became critical. If <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> Investments was a mere unsecured creditor of the company, it would enjoy no priority over other creditors in the liquidation. The bank which held the money could in exercise of its right of set off apply the money in payment of the larger debt owed to it by the company. Per contra, if the money in the account was held on trust for <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> Investments, it would be entitled to the money in the separate bank account in priority over all others including the bank.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The House of Lords held that the common intention of the company and <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> Investments was such that the money was held on trust unless and until it was applied for the intended purpose of payment of the dividend, in which event <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> Investments would become merely an unsecured creditor. However, since the purpose was never accomplished the money remained trust property beyond the reach of the bank.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 In the later decision of <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span><span class="font-italic"> v Yardley</span>, the House of Lords made a finding of a trust in somewhat different circumstances. In that case, the claimant loaned a sum of money to the borrower by paying the same to the borrower’s solicitor. The solicitor gave an undertaking to the claimant to utilise the money solely for the purchase of property on behalf of the borrower. The House of Lords held that the solicitor’s undertaking had given rise to a trust which Lord Millett called a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust.  Unlike in <span class="font-italic">Barclays </span><span class="font-italic">Bank v Quistclose</span>, where the payer and the recipient company were held to have intended that the money should be held on trust, in <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span><span class="font-italic"> v Yardley</span>, the lender and the recipient solicitor merely agreed on the restriction that the money advanced could only be used for the purchase of property on behalf of the borrower; the claimant had not actually intended that the sum advanced should be held by the borrower’s solicitors on trust for the claimants. The House of Lords held that the restriction on the purpose for which the money could be utilised meant that the money was not at the free disposal of the solicitor who had received it; consequently, independent of the subjective intention of the claimant, the effect of the undertaking was that they had been holding the sum advanced on trust for the claimant with power to apply it in the acquisition of property by the borrower.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 As Lord Millett said at [74]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The question in every case is whether the parties intended the money to be at the free disposal of the recipient: in re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd [1995] I AC 74, 100 per Lord Mustill. His freedom to dispose of the money is necessarily excluded by an arrangement that the money shall be used exclusively for the stated purpose, for as Lord Wilberforce observed in the <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> case [1970] AC 567, 580:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“A necessary consequence from this, by a process simply of interpretation, must be that if, for any reason, [the purpose could not be carried out,] the money was to be returned to [the lender]: the word ‘only’ or ‘exclusively’ can have no other meaning or effect.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In <span class="font-italic">Attorney-General v </span><span class="font-italic">Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council </span>[2015] 4 SLR 474 (“<span class="font-italic">AHPETC</span>”), Quentin Loh J (“Loh J”) analysed Lord Millett’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span><span class="font-italic"> v Yardley</span>, and summarised the propositions of law thus (<span class="font-italic">AHPETC </span>at [114]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) Whenever a donor transfers money to a recipient for a specified purpose, a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust may arise.

Such trusts arise where a settlor or testator carries out some intentional act other than the creation of a relationship of trustee and beneficiary from which the court infers a relationship of trustee and beneficiary. They consequently arise from the unexpressed but presumed intention of the settlor or testator. The two alternative names appear to stem from the fact that such a trust is not only implied by the court but also often causes the beneficial interest arising thereunder to “result” to the settlor or his estate, or to the testator’s residuary beneficiaries or intestate successors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 It is therefore somewhat curious that Loh J referred to an “express” <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust in [114] of his judgment where he helpfully summarised the propositions of law on the creation of a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust. (Perhaps what he meant to refer to was an express “<span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span>-type” trust).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The learned judge is in distinguished company, however, for Lord Millett himself in <span class="font-italic">Latimer v Commissioner of Inland Revenue</span> [2004] 1 WLR 1466 glossed over the distinction between an express trust and a resulting trust where he held at [41]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The only difference is that in the present case a resulting trust in favour of the settlor is express; whereas it is more usually implied”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In any event, the prescient remarks made in <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span> at [99], by his Lordship are apropos:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I do not think that subtle distinctions should be made between “true” <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trusts and trusts which are merely analogous to them. It depends on how widely or narrowly you choose to define the <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust. There is clearly a wide range of situations in which the parties enter into a commercial arrangement which permits one party to have a limited use of the other’s money for a stated purpose, is not free to apply it for any other purpose, and must return it if for any reason the purpose cannot be carried out”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Returning to our case, regardless of whether the <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust here is a resulting or express one (on the assumption that there is an express <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust, as Loh J posited), the Plaintiffs’ submission that a trust of the Balance Sum had been constituted in favour of the 1st Plaintiff is clearly made out. There is no doubt as regards the twin certainties of subject matter of the trust nor as to the intended beneficiary of the trust (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>certainty of object) (see <span class="font-italic">AHPETC </span>at [114(b)]). The Balance Sum was paid to the 1st Defendant on deposit until the 1st Plaintiff decided to place a second order. If a second order was not proceeded with, the Balance Sum was to be returned to the 1st Plaintiff. It was never intended to be at the free disposal of the 1st Defendant. In my opinion, the Balance Sum was thus held by the 1st Defendant on a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose</span> trust.

</div> and that Plaintiffs have not proved that she knew of the Representations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 With regard to the factual question raised as to her knowledge, the evidence earlier reviewed shows that she knew of the Representations. The two invoices of 10 March 2010 (the same day that the Representations were made) were issued with her knowledge if not on her instructions. The 26 March 2010 Letter which she signed in April of that year showed that she was upset with the Representations and sought, with Andrew Tani’s help, to downplay their significance. However, she stopped short of disavowing the Representations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 As regards the law, the locus classicus is the Privy Council decision in <span class="font-italic">Royal Brunei Airlines </span><span class="font-italic">Sdn Bhd v Philip Tan Kok Ming</span> [1995] 2 AC 378 (“<span class="font-italic">Royal Brunei Airlines</span>”) where Lord Nicholls delivered their Lordships’ judgment in what was described as a “magisterial opinion” by Lord Millett in <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span><span class="font-italic"> v Yardley</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 In dealing with the question as to what constitutes dishonesty in the context of dishonest assistance in the breach of trust, Lord Nicholls opined, (<span class="font-italic">Royal Brunei Airlines </span>at 389):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Whatever may be the position in some criminal or other contexts … in the context of the accessory liability principle acting dishonestly … <span class="font-italic">means simply not acting as an honest person would in the circumstances. This is an objective standard. </span>At first sight this may seem surprising. Honesty has a connotation of subjectivity, as distinct from the objectivity of negligence. Honesty, indeed, does have a strong subjective element in that it is a description of a type of <span class="font-italic">conduct assessed in the light of what a person actually knew at the time</span>, as distinct from what a reasonable person would have known or appreciated. Further, honesty and its counterpart dishonesty are mostly concerned with advertent conduct, not inadvertent conduct…. However, these subjective characteristics of honesty do not mean that individuals are free to set their own standards of honesty in particular circumstances. <span class="font-italic">The standard of what </span><span class="font-italic">constitutes honest conduct is not subjective. Honesty is not an optional scale, with higher or lower values according to the moral standards of each individual.</span> If a person knowingly appropriates another’s property, he will not escape a finding of dishonesty simply because he sees nothing wrong in such behaviour.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 This yardstick for dishonesty was followed by the Court of Appeal (“CA”) in <span class="font-italic">Bansal </span><span class="font-italic">Hermant Govindprasad and another v Central Bank of India</span> [2003] 2 SLR(R) 33 (“<span class="font-italic">Bansal</span>”). However, <span class="font-italic">in George Raymond </span><span class="font-italic">Zage III and another v Ho Chi Kwong and another</span> [2010] SGCA 4 (“<span class="font-italic">George Raymond </span><span class="font-italic">Zage III</span>”) the test for dishonesty was revisited as the court in <span class="font-italic">Bansal</span> had not considered two relevant cases decided not long after <span class="font-italic">Royal Brunei Airlines</span>, namely <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span><span class="font-italic"> v Yardley </span>and our High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Malaysian International Trading Corporation </span><span class="font-italic">Sdn Bhd v Interamerica Asia Pte Ltd</span> [2002] 2 SLR (R) 896 which followed <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span><span class="font-italic"> v Yardley</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span><span class="font-italic"> v Yardley</span>, a solicitor (the “1st solicitor”) was acting for a client in connection with the purchase of land. The client needed to borrow £1 million in order to complete the purchase. A lender was found who was willing to lend that money but only if repayment was secured by a solicitor’s personal undertaking. The 1st solicitor was unwilling to give such an undertaking. The client then approached another solicitor (the “2nd solicitor”) who held himself out as acting for the client and received the money after his firm gave an undertaking that “(1) The loan moneys will be retained by us until such time as they are applied in the acquisition of property on behalf of our client. (2) The loan moneys will be utilised solely for the acquisition of property on behalf of our client and for no other purposes. (3) We will repay to you the said sum of £1 million together with interest”. On the client’s instructions, the 2nd solicitor released the money to the 1st solicitor after having received assurances from the client through the 1st solicitor that the money would be used in the acquisition of property. The 1st solicitor regarded the money as held on account for the client. On the client’s instructions, he then paid it out. The 1st solicitor took no steps to ensure that the money was only applied in the acquisition of property; a substantial part of it was used by the client for other purposes. The 2nd solicitor then went bankrupt and the loan was not repaid. The lender sued the 1st solicitor alleging that he had dishonestly assisted in the 2nd solicitor’s breach of trust. The trial judge found that the 1st solicitor had not been dishonest. However, he also found that he was clearly aware of the terms of the undertaking that the money would be applied in the acquisition of property and that he had received them on the footing that they would be so applied. Nevertheless, he had regarded the money as held simply to the order of the client.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The CA reversed the judge’s finding that the 1st solicitor had not been dishonest as it conflicted with the factual finding that he was aware of the terms of the undertaking and that he had received the funds on that footing. On appeal, the majority in the House of Lords reversed the CA’s finding of dishonesty, holding that it should not have substituted its own finding of dishonesty for that of the trial judge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Lord Hutton sought to elaborate on what <span class="font-italic">Royal Brunei Airlines</span> had established as the requisite standard of dishonesty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 In his statement, with which a majority of their Lordships agreed, he opined (at [35] and [36]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There is, in my opinion, a further consideration which supports the view that <span class="font-italic">for liability as an accessory to arise the defendant must himself appreciate that what he was doing was dishonest by the standards of honest and reasonable men</span>. A finding by a judge that a defendant has been dishonest is a grave finding, and it is particularly grave against a professional man, such as a solicitor. Notwithstanding that the issue arises in equity law and not in a criminal context, I think that it would be less than just for the law to permit a finding that a defendant had been “dishonest” in assisting in a breach of trust where he knew of the facts which created the trust and its breach but had not been aware that what he was doing would be regarded by honest men as being dishonest.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It would be open to your Lordships to depart from the principle stated by Lord Nicholls that dishonesty is a necessary ingredient of accessory liability and to hold that knowledge is a sufficient ingredient. But the statement of that principle by Lord Nicholls has been widely regarded as clarifying this area of the law and, as he observed, the tide of authority in England has flowed strongly in favour of the test of dishonesty. Therefore I consider that the courts should continue to apply that test and that your Lordships should state that <span class="font-italic">dishonesty requires knowledge by the defendant that what he was doing would be regarded as dishonest by honest people</span>, although he should not escape a finding of dishonesty because he sets his own standards of honesty and does not regard as dishonest what he knows would offend the normally accepted standards of honest conduct.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 This contrasted with the dissenting view of Lord Millett who opined (at [118]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There is no trace in Lord Nicholls’ opinion that the defendant should have been aware that he was acting contrary to objective standards of dishonesty.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Further elaborating, Lord Millett continued (at [121]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In my opinion Lord Nicholls was adopting an objective standard of dishonesty by which the defendant is expected to attain the standard which would be observed by an honest person placed in similar circumstances. Account must be taken of subjective considerations such as the defendant’s experience and intelligence and his actual state of knowledge at the relevant time. But it is not necessary that he should actually have appreciated that he was acting dishonestly; it is sufficient that he was.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 The result in <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span> <span class="font-italic">v Yardley </span>was that the 1st solicitor who was aware (i) that the 2nd solicitor (from whom he received the funds) had given his undertaking that the loan moneys would be held until such time as they were applied in the acquisition of property on behalf of the borrower; and (ii) that he (the 1st solicitor) had received the money on the footing that they would be so applied, was nevertheless not liable for dishonest assistance when he released the money to the client.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Lord Hoffmann in agreeing with Lord Hutton said (at [20]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">For the reasons given by my noble and learned friend, Lord Hutton, I consider that those principles [i.e. the principles laid down by the Privy Council in Royal Brunei Airlines require more than knowledge of the facts which make the conduct wrongful. <span class="font-italic">They require a </span><span class="font-italic">dishonest state of mind, that is to say, consciousness that one is transgressing ordinary standards of honest behaviour</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 The subjectivity in the requirement apparently introduced by Lord Hutton that the defendant had to know “that what he was doing was dishonest by the standards of honest and reasonable men” enabled the House of Lords to uphold the High Court finding that the 1st solicitor was not dishonest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 A later Privy Council decision in <span class="font-italic">Barlow </span><span class="font-italic">Clowes International Ltd (in liquidation) v Eurotrust International Ltd</span> [2006] 1 WLR 1476 (“<span class="font-italic">Barrow </span><span class="font-italic">Clowes</span>”) has since clarified that the majority decision in <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span><span class="font-italic"> v Yardley</span> did not depart from the objective test for honesty set out in <span class="font-italic">Royal Brunei Airlines</span>. Lord Hoffmann explained (at [15] and [16]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Their Lordships accept that there is an element of ambiguity in these remarks which may have encouraged a belief, expressed in some academic writing, that the <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span> case had departed from the law as previously understood and invited inquiry not merely into the defendant’s mental state about the nature of the transaction in which he was participating but also into his views about generally acceptable standards of honesty. But they do not consider that this is what Lord Hutton meant. The reference to “what he knows would offend normally accepted standards of honest conduct” meant only that his knowledge of the transaction had to be such as to render his participation contrary to normally acceptable standards of honest conduct. It did not require that he should have had reflections about what those normally acceptable standards were.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Similarly in the speech of Lord of Hoffmann, the statement (in para 20) that a dishonest state of mid meant “consciousness that one is transgressing ordinary standards of honest behaviour” was in their Lordships’ view intended to require consciousness of those elements of the transaction which make participation transgress ordinary standards of honest behaviour. It did not also require him to have thought about what those standards were.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The CA in <span class="font-italic">George Raymond </span><span class="font-italic">Zage III </span>therefore concluded at [22] “that for a defendant to be liable for knowing assistance, he must have such knowledge of the irregular shortcomings of the transaction that ordinary honest people would consider it to be a breach of standards of honest conduct if he failed to adequately query them.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 The conclusion was framed in that way (“if he failed to adequately query them”) to accommodate the particular circumstances of the case. For our purposes, it would not be inconsistent with that conclusion to frame the requirements for dishonest assistance in breach of trust as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The defendant must be aware of the facts which enable the court to make a finding of a trust whether or not the defendant appreciated that a trust was constituted, and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) With knowledge of the facts, he acts in relation to the trust in a manner which is contrary to normally acceptable standards of honest conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Avram and Patricia Yong were in complete charge of the 1st Defendant. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is reasonable to infer that as the directors of 1st Defendant, they were behind the actions of the 1st Defendant and were accessories to the breach of trust committed by the 1st Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Avram was the maker of the Representations and Patricia Yong, as I have found, was aware of the Representations. Both of them knew that when the sum of USD 1 million was paid by the 1st Plaintiff to the 1st Defendant, it was with the understanding and/or on the basis of the Representations made by Avram that the Balance Sum was to be a deposit for a second order if it was made and that it would be refunded if no such order was made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 By refusing to return the Balance Sum despite demands for the same and putting up untrue allegations that there was an order for USD 1 million worth of MSP Products, Avram and Patricia Yong acted in a manner contrary to normally acceptable standards of honest conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 I therefore find them liable for dishonest assistance in the 1st Defendant’s breach of trust.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Plaintiffs claim in unjust enrichment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 A third ground of the Plaintiffs’ claim is unjust enrichment. At para 22 of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1) the pleading reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Further and/or alternatively, by reason of the aforementioned, the Plaintiffs aver that the 1st Defendant has been unjustly enriched at their expense, and the 1st Defendant is liable to repay the said amount of US$479,233.60 to the Plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Nothing more was pleaded in that regard. In para 133 of the Plaintiffs’ closing submissions, they argue as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Since no order apart from that under the 8 April 2010 Tax Invoice had been placed, the 1st Defendant had no basis to retain the Balance Sum. To allow the 1st Defendants to retain the Balance Sum would be to enable the 1st Defendant to be unjustly enriched at the expense of the Plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 Then followed references to passages of <span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones</span>, The Law of Unjust Enrichment (9th edition) (“<span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones</span>”) (in 12-24 to 12-27): dealing with the doctrine of severability.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 There are three requirements for a claim in unjust enrichment, namely, </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) enrichment of the defendant;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) at the expense of the plaintiff; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) circumstances which make the enrichment unjust (i.e. the presence of an “unjust factor”): see <span class="font-italic">S</span><span class="font-italic">kandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (Publ),</span> <span class="font-italic">Singapore Branch v Asia Pacific Brew</span><span class="font-italic">eries (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another</span> [2011] 2 SLR 540 at [110].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 What is noticeably absent is any attempt by the Plaintiffs to explain how they satisfy the three requirements. In particular, there is no attempt to show how the 1st Defendant’s retention of the Balance Sum is within any of the categories which the law recognises as sufficient to render their retention unjust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 The Defendants contend that this failure on the part of the Plaintiffs to found the claim in unjust enrichment on any “unjust factor” is fatal to the Plaintiffs’ case.

Hence, at the lower level of generality the plaintiff must put his finger on a specific ground for restitution, a circumstance recognized as rendering the defendant’s enrichment ‘unjust’ and therefore reversible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 The CA then referred to the list of “unjust factors” summarised in 2 academic treatises, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic">The Law of Restitution</span> (Andrew Burrows) (Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed, 2011) (“<span class="font-italic">Burrows</span>”); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones</span>: <span class="font-italic">The Law of Unjust Enrichment</span> (Charles Mitchell, Paul Mitchell, and Stephen Watterson) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 8th Ed, 2011) (“<span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 <span class="font-italic">Burrows</span> (at p 86) stated as follows (<span class="font-italic">Anna </span>at [132]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As regards the cause of action of unjust enrichment, the main unjust factors can be as follows: mistake, duress, undue influence, exploitation of weakness, human incapacity, failure of consideration, ignorance, legal compulsion, necessity, illegality and public authority ultra vires exaction and payment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 Meanwhile, <span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones</span> (at [1-22]) sets out the list of unjust factors as follows (<span class="font-italic">Anna </span>at [133]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Lack of consent and want of authority; mistake; duress; undue influence; failure of basis; necessity; secondary liability; ultra vires receipts and payments by public bodies; legal incapacity; illegality; and money paid pursuant to a judgment that is later reversed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 The Plaintiffs’ claim is a bare assertion that the 1st Defendant was unjustly enriched at their expense. This is clearly deficient. Pointing to a similar deficiency in <span class="font-italic">Anna</span>, the CA borrowed the words of Mann J in <span class="font-italic">Uren </span><span class="font-italic">v First National Home Finance Ltd</span> [2005] EWHC 2529 (Ch) at [18], where the latter held,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“the claim fails because it does not plead facts which are capable of bringing the case within one of the established restitutionary claims or some justifiable extension of them.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 The authors of <span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones</span>: <span class="font-italic">The Law of Unjust Enrichment</span> (Charles Mitchell, Paul Mitchell, and Stephen Watterson) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 9th Ed, 2016) explain at [1-26]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A claimant must be able to point a <span class="font-italic">ground of recovery</span> that is established by past authority, or at least is justifiable by a process of principled analogical reasoning from past authority. ‘There is in English law <span class="font-italic">no general rule</span> giving the plaintiff a right of recovery from a defendant who has been unjustly enriched at the plaintiff’s expense’, and the court’s jurisdiction to order restitution on the ground of unjust enrichment is subject ‘to the binding authority of previous decisions’: they <span class="font-italic">do not have ‘a discretionary power to order repayment whenever it seems... just and equitable to do so’</span>. Claims in unjust enrichment must be pleaded by bringing them ‘within or close to some <span class="font-italic">established category or factual recovery situation’</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 Accordingly, the Plaintiffs’ claim in unjust enrichment fails.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 I should perhaps add that the Plaintiffs might have made out their case if greater pains had been taken in the pleadings.  The Plaintiff’s closing submissions did deal with the doctrine of severability but this was done in vacuo. Although one could possibly infer that what the Plaintiffs were trying to do was to found their claim upon the unjust factor of failure of consideration (or basis), given that this was not fleshed out in their pleadings, it was not open to  me to make a finding in favour of the 1st Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Legal Issue 3: Fraudulent Misrepresentation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 The Plaintiffs argue that the 1st Defendant and/or Avram are liable for fraudulent misrepresentation.

Since the case of <span class="font-italic">Pasley</span><span class="font-italic"> v Freeman</span> (1789) 3 TR 51, it has been settled that <span class="font-italic">a person can be held liable in tort to another, if he knowingly or recklessly makes a false statement to that other with the intent that it would be acted upon, and that other does act upon it and suffers damage</span>. This came to be known as the tort of deceit. In <span class="font-italic">Derry v Peek </span>(1889) 14 App Cas 337, the tort was further developed. It was held that in an action of deceit the Plaintiff must prove actual fraud. This fraud is proved only when it is shown that a false representation has been made knowingly, or without belief in its truth, or recklessly without caring whether it be true or false. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The essentials of this tort have been set out by Lord Maughan in <span class="font-italic">Bradford Building Society v Borders</span> [1941] 2 All ER 205. Basically there are the following essential elements. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">First</span><span class="font-italic">, there must be a representation of fact made by words or conduct. </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Second</span><span class="font-italic">, the representation must be made with the intention that it should be acted upon by the Plaintiff, or by a class of persons which includes the Plaintiff. </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Third</span><span class="font-italic">, it must be proved that the Plaintiff had acted upon the false statement. </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Fourth</span><span class="font-italic">, it must be proved that the Plaintiff suffered damage by so doing. </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Fifth</span><span class="font-italic">, the representation must be made with knowledge that it is false; it must be wilfully false, or at least made in the absence of any genuine belief that it is true.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 With respect to the first element, although the representation with regard to the refund of the Balance Sum was a representation as to a future intention, it may qualify as a representation as to an existing fact, namely the state of Avram’s mind at the time. Nevertheless, I disagree with the Plaintiffs that the 1st Defendant and/or Avram are liable for fraudulent misrepresentation. In particular, considering the fifth element, there is no evidence that when Avram made the Representation as to the refund on 10 March 2010, he did so with knowledge that it was false in that he or the 1st Defendant had no intention of honouring it. There is also no evidence that the Representations were made in the absence of any genuine belief that they were true. Indeed, the subsequent conduct of Avram and Patricia Yong served to show that there was genuine belief on their part that they were bound by the Representations (see above at [36] to [48] on the issuance of the 26 March 2010 Letter and [72] to [76] on the 1st Defendant’s financial records). The evidence suggests that it was only after the 1st Plaintiff failed to make a second order that the Defendants had a change of heart and decided not to honour the Representations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 Accordingly, the Plaintiffs fail in their claim in fraudulent misrepresentation. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The 1st Defendant’s counterclaim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 Finally, having found that there was no order apart from that under the 8 April 2010 Tax Invoice, the Defendants’ counterclaim must fail. What is telling is that the Defendants’ counsel did not advance any argument in the closing submissions in support of the counterclaim. Accordingly, I dismiss the 1st Defendant’s counterclaim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155  In the result:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) I declare that the Balance Sum in the amount of USD 479,233.60 is held by the 1st Defendant on trust for the 1st Plaintiff and order that the Balance Sum together with interest thereon at the rate of 5.33% per annum from the date of the Writ be paid by the 1st Defendant to the 1st Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) I declare that the 2nd and 3rd Defendants are accessories to the 1st Defendant’s breach of trust by reason of their dishonest assistance in the said breach and they are thus liable jointly and severally with the 1st Defendant for payment of the Balance Sum (together with the interest aforesaid).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) I also order that an account be taken before the Registrar and that all enquiries be made in that connection as to the use of the Balance Sum and all properties, assets, or benefits obtained or acquired from the use thereof (“Additional Sums”).
