<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In this action, the plaintiff, NEC Asia Pte Ltd
                    (now known as NEC Asia Pacific Pte Ltd) (“NEC”) claims against the
                    first defendant, Picket &amp; Rail Asia Pacific Pte Ltd (“D1”)
                    and/or the third defendant, Faisal Alsagoff (“D3”), the sum of US$
                    1,402,380.30 being the price of 2390 units of Mitsubishi High End Projectors
                    (“projectors”). The alternative claim of S$1,917,054 (being the
                    Singapore dollar equivalent of US$1,402,380.30) is for the amount of the
                    dishonoured cheque issued by the second defendant, Digital Network Pte Ltd
                    (“D2”), in favour of NEC as payee in purported payment of the
                    price of the projectors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       D1 is in liquidation and the action against D1
                    is stayed as a consequence. Chan Seng Onn J had earlier on 29 June
                    2010 refused NEC’s application for leave to continue with its claims
                    against D1. Hence, the action before me is against D3 personally and D2. I
                    should mention that NEC is no longer pursuing its claim for Goods &amp; Services
                    Tax (“GST”) against D3, a position NEC confirmed at the trial
                    through its counsel, Mr Francis Goh.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">NEC’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       NEC’s pleaded case is that in February
                    2008, NEC agreed with D1 to supply 2300 projectors at a unit price of US$658.20
                    and aggregate price of US$1,513,860 (“the February order”). The
                    February order was subsequently varied in June 2008 by D1’s letter dated
                    18 June 2008 whereby the number of projectors to be supplied was revised
                    upwards to 2390 projectors, and the price was adjusted downwards to US$586.77
                    per unit (“the June order”). The aggregate price of the June order
                    was US$1,402,380.30. NEC purchased the projectors from Mitsubishi Asia Pte Ltd
                    (“MEA”), and delivery of the projectors was made in June 2008
                    directly to KUB Telekomunikasi Sdn Bhd (“KUB”), the end purchaser
                    in Malaysia, whose vendor, HTI Industries Sdn Bhd (“HTI”) had
                    issued a purchase order for the projectors to D1. NEC pleaded that the delivery
                    in June 2008 was made with the knowledge of D1 and D3 who, in any event, never
                    objected to the delivery at the material time. Furthermore, D3 had in a letter
                    dated 12 August 2008, typed on the letterhead of Comat Academy Sdn Bhd
                    (“Comat”), thanked NEC for its prompt delivery and acknowledged
                    that the customer KUB had received the projectors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       As the projectors had been delivered, NEC asked
                    D1 for payment on 18 June 2008. D3 informed NEC that D1’s finance
                    director was not in the office to sign the cheque. NEC acceded to D3’s
                    request to collect the cheque at a later date. On 21 June 2008, NEC
                    received D2’s cheque for the sum of S$1,917,054 (which was the Singapore
                    dollar equivalent of US$1,402,380.30) post-dated to 8 August 2008. NEC’s
                    Vice-President Enterprise Business Group, Job Chan Siang Hong (Job”)
                    explained that D1 was not charged GST.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Hence, the figure
                    of S$1,917,054 was without the GST component. D2’s cheque signed by D3 was
                    for payment of 2390 projectors but payment was stopped by D3 who had refused to
                    pay for the projectors. NEC presented D2’s cheque for payment but it was
                    dishonoured. NEC sued for payment on 22 June 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       HTI was the parent company of Comat. At all
                    material times, D3 was a shareholder and director of HTI. He was also a director
                    of Comat. D3 was also the sole shareholder and director of D1 as well as the
                    sole shareholder and a director of D2 from 6 September 1996 to 24 August
                    2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       NEC’s main argument against D3 is that the
                    latter used the companies controlled by him interchangeably, including D1 and D2
                    to contract, to acknowledge receipt of the projectors and to make payment. D3
                    was the key person in the transaction with NEC and he had treated D1 as his
                    alter ego. As such, D3 cannot rely on the doctrine of separate legal personality
                    of a company to escape from his personal liability to pay NEC for the
                    projectors. The claim against D2 is for the amount of the dishonoured
                    cheque.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">D3 and D2’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       D3 and D2 do not dispute that the projectors
                    were delivered to KUB, and that KUB had paid HTI for the projectors. It was also
                    not disputed that after the projectors were delivered, HTI e-mailed its purchase
                    order to D1. The e-mail also explained that D1 as purchaser would be required to
                    issue its purchase order to NEC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       D3 advanced several reasons for D1’s
                    refusal to pay for the projectors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       First, there was no contractual relationship
                    between NEC and D1 or D3. The contract for the supply of projectors was between
                    MEA and Comat. Second, if there was a contract with NEC, it was between NEC and
                    Comat. D3’s position is that the order in June 2008 was meant to be an
                    entirely new contract between NEC and Comat, and not a variation of the order in
                    February 2008. Third, even if, the contract was between NEC and D1, D3’s
                    case is that there were no orders from the Malaysian companies in February 2008,
                    and therefore the documents generated and signed in relation to the alleged
                    February order were “invalid”. The projectors were never delivered
                    to D1 in February 2008, and NEC’s recognition of the February order as a
                    completed transaction was an “illegal” attempt by NEC to increase
                    its revenue for the fiscal year ended 31 March 2008. NEC also backdated
                    documents in respect of the June order so as to tie in that order with the
                    revenues booked in March 2008 for the earlier February order. In the
                    circumstances, NEC should not be allowed to enforce an illegal contract. Four,
                    if the contract was between NEC and D1, NEC’s claim for payment of
                    US$1,402,380.30 should be disallowed as it had breached the contract in several
                    ways: (a) delivered the projectors without D1’s prior instructions, (b)
                    failed to satisfy the User Acceptance Test (“UAT”), and (c) failed
                    to send invoices for the projectors to D1. Five, even if there was a valid
                    contract between D1 and NEC, and this contract had been duly performed by NEC,
                    D1 was the party responsible to make payment to NEC, and not D3
                    personally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     D2’s defence, not surprisingly, overlaps
                    significantly with D3’s, and the first four arguments raised by D3 above
                    at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> apply with equal force to D2’s
                    defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Defence pleaded other matters which are,
                    in my view, peripheral, irrelevant and, at times, misconceived. I therefore say
                    no more and will quickly move on to what I see are the main issues in
                    dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The supply of projectors and identity of the contracting
                parties</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Overview</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     It is helpful to begin by providing the
                    material facts to the dispute which is best done by identifying the various
                    individuals and companies that are involved. I shall make findings of fact in
                    the course of the narrative below. It will be evident from the narrative and
                    evidence before me that there is no basis, and hence no merit in D3’s
                    contention that the contractual relationship for the supply of projectors was
                    between either MEA and Comat, or NEC and Comat. The four-party
                    “pass-through deal”, which is explained below, was acknowledged by
                    D3 in his affidavit evidence-in chief and during cross-examination where he
                    accepted that the pass-through deal was between NEC and D1.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> For the reasons explained below, for there to
                    be a pass-through deal between MEA and NEC, D1’s involvement was critical.
                    From this perspective, there had to be a contractual relationship between NEC
                    and D1 rather than with any Malaysian entity. On a related note, it is not
                    disputed that some of the documentation relating to four-party pass-through
                    transaction had been backdated. They are all found in the Agreed Bundle where
                    the authenticity of the documents had been agreed. It is too late for D3 to take
                    issue with a document’s authenticity on grounds of backdating or
                    signature.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Analysis of the material facts and conclusions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It all began in January 2008. At that time,
                    NEC’s sales manager, Shawn Chia Lai Poh (“Shawn”), met D3,
                    Faisal Alsagoff, in MEA’s offices at Alexandra Road. Michael Woo
                    (“Michael”), the General Manager of the Visual Imaging Division of
                    MEA made the introductions. D3 was introduced as a director of HTI and Comat. On
                    that occasion, Shawn heard about the PPSMI (Learning Programme for Science, Math
                    and English) project. D3 explained that HTI and Comat would be tendering for the
                    PPSMI project through two bidding parties. The plan was for HTI to manage KUB as
                    one bidding party. The other bidding party, MIMOS (a Malaysian government-linked
                    company), would be managed by Comat. According to D3, the PPSMI project would
                    involve, <em>inter alia</em>, the supply of Mitsubishi
                    projectors. Shawn was told by Michael that for NEC to participate in the supply
                    of Mitsubishi projectors, Comat would have to be persuaded that NEC could add
                    value to the PPSMI deal. Michael agreed to “pass the deal” through
                    NEC provided the latter accepted (a) transfer of title to the projectors, (b)
                    assumed timely payment of the projectors to MEA, and (c) issued a performance
                    bond to either KUB or MIMOS (both were the Malaysian purchasing party acting on
                    behalf of either HTI or Comat) depending on whether KUB or MIMOS were the
                    purchasers. NEC agreed to Michael’s stipulations. However, it later
                    transpired that NEC Singapore was not in a position to contract directly with
                    Malaysian entities – HTI and Comat were Malaysian companies. I understand
                    that there is NEC Malaysia and NEC Singapore, and each NEC entity is responsible
                    for its respective geographical markets. As such, NEC Singapore was obliged by
                    its corporate policy to conduct business with entities in Singapore. This
                    corporate “impediment” highlighted the importance of D1 in the
                    commercial scheme/arrangement that was put in place in relation to the supply of
                    the projectors for PPSMI project by MEA, NEC, D1, and HTI/Comat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Specifically, D1, a Singapore company was, and
                    I so find, interposed in the supply of the projectors. Evidentially, I find that
                    D1 was an important and an indispensible link in MEA’s contract to supply
                    its projectors to NEC, and down the line from NEC to D1 and D1 to either Comat
                    or HTI depending on which Malaysian entity (<em>ie</em> KUB
                    or MIMOS) was the purchaser. To complete the commercial scheme/arrangement,
                    there would have to be a purchase order (as D3’s alluded to in paragraph 6
                    of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief) from either Comat or HTI. D3 again
                    referred to this in his written testimony:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17.8  The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants
                            would proceed to process the deal only when Comat or HTI had issued a PO
                            to the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In the context of the parties’
                    vernacular, this commercial scheme/arrangement was the mechanics of what was
                    called the “pass-through” deal where D3 in his written evidence
                    had described Michael as saying that MEA was agreeable to “pass the deal
                    through” to NEC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> What happened thereafter between NEC and D1
                    through D3 in February 2008 to June 2008 was pursuant to this commercial
                    scheme/arrangement, and I so find.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     There is no dispute that the anticipated
                    shipment in February/March 2008 did not take place. The PPSMI project was
                    delayed on account of the Malaysian General Elections. At one stage, on
                    31 March 2008, D3 indicated to Shawn that the projectors would not be
                    needed until April 2008. Michael also e-mailed Shawn on 31 March 2008 to confirm
                    that MEA would not invoice NEC for the 2300 projectors because of further delays
                    with the PPSMI project.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     There is evidence on how in June 2008, MEA
                    came to send 2390 projectors to KUB. According to Shawn, Ahmad Sharizal
                    (“Sharizal”), the managing director of HTI, contacted Irina Yeo of
                    MEA (“Irina”) in early June 2008 to deliver the projectors to KUB.
                    Irina called Shawn to get permission to deliver the projectors to KUB. Shawn
                    claimed that he had obtained the necessary approval to go ahead with the
                    delivery from NEC’s Senior Vice President of the Enterprise Business
                    Group, David Ng Eng Tuan (“David”), and Job Chan, the
                    Vice-President Enterprise Business Group. In relation to this issue, Job said he
                    learned that the projectors were delivered on 7 June 2008 when MEA’s
                    shipping documents were sent to him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> In
                    re-examination, Job clarified that the first time he became aware that the
                    projectors were delivered by MEA to the end buyer was at the meeting held on 20
                    June 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> David said that Shawn was transferred to
                    another department in March 2008, and after March 2008, he was not involved in
                    the discussions relating to this supply of projectors. It was on or about
                    18 June 2008 that the Managing Director of NEC, Tan Goh Beng, asked him to
                    handle the payment issue with D3.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Despite the conflicting evidence, what is
                    clear is that NEC did not obtain D1’s prior approval to deliver the
                    projectors to KUB. It appears from the e-mail thread that upon receipt of
                    Sharizal’s e-mail of 6 June 2008 (timed 6.20pm) asking for delivery
                    of the projectors, Chio Seng Kit (“Chio”) of MEA forwarded at
                    6.28pm Sharizal’s e-mail to D3. However, D3 claimed that he did not open
                    his e-mail, and he only knew of the delivery of the projectors on 9 June
                    2008 when Shawn informed him of it. Be that as it may, there is no dispute that
                    KUB received the projectors on 7 June 2008, and HTI was paid sometime in
                    June 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Significantly, there is evidence of a purchase
                    order from HTI to D1 which was in keeping with the commercial scheme/arrangement
                    as described. The understanding was that D1 would issue its purchase order to
                    NEC after receiving HTI or Comat’s purchase order. This brings me to an
                    e-mail dated 13 June 2008 from Kok Fook Onn (Kok”) to D1’s Ron Ng
                    where HTI’s purchase order dated 4 June 2008 was sent as an
                    attachment. Kok is from Comat. The subject matter of the e-mail was stated to be
                    “POs for the PPSMI 6 projects”. The attachment to the e-mail
                    entitled “PnR PO.doc.” was HTI’s purchase order dated 4 June
                    2008 and addressed to D1 for 2390 projectors –XD510U at the unit price of
                    US$592.70 and the aggregate price was stated to be US$1,416,553 in HTI’s
                    purchase order. The e-mail reads:</p>

                    meet D3 on 12 June 2008. Although D3 and Shawn did not mention this meeting
                    on 12 June 2008 in their written testimonies, D3 accepted that there was
                    such a meeting during cross-examination. D3 said that the meeting with Job on
                    12 June 2008 was to confirm the four-party pass-through deal. At that
                    meeting, Job was informed by Shawn that the quantity and price agreed in
                    February 2008 had to be revised following a request from the end buyer. He was
                    asked if NEC would accommodate D1. Job agreed and Shawn was tasked to amend the
                    paperwork.</p>

                    in pricing and quantity of projectors required for the PPSMI project and
                    amendment to the February 2008 order. D1 wrote:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Contemporaneously, D1 issued its purchase
                    order dated 13 June 2008 for 2390 units of projectors XD510U [MIT-277A] at
                    unit price of US$586.77. Terms of payment was stated as “LC 30
                    days”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     After the meeting on 12 June 2008, NEC
                    issued its quotation for the supply of 2390 units of projectors at a unit price
                    of US$586.77. The aggregate price was US$1,402,380.30. Although this quotation
                    was backdated to 10 June 2008, it was signed for and accepted by D1. The
                    quotation was subject to the following terms and conditions:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1. Prices quoted are valid for 90 days from date of this quote.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2. Prices are subjected to change without prior notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3. L/C Payment 60 days.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     D1’s single purchase order for all 2390
                    projectors was later cancelled to accommodate NEC’s request to split the
                    single order into several orders. Eleven replacement purchase orders, all dated
                    5 June 2008 (and exhibited at pages 76 – 86 referred to in
                    paragraph 7.3 of D3’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief), were issued
                    and signed by D1 as D3 had specifically accepted and acknowledged in
                    paragraph 7.3 of his affidavit of evidence-in chief.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> However, D3 claimed that
                    the orders were not fulfilled because NEC had cut-off the deal unilaterally on
                    23 June 2008, an accusation that is untenable from evidence before me. The
                    eleven purchase orders were intended to replace the February order. For example,
                    one of purchase order reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Remarks: The Above PO supersede (<em>sic</em>) your
                        Quotation Reference SC-0782-08 Dated 1 February 08.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The payment term as stipulated in the eleven purchase orders was
                    “LC 30 days or Cheque”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I have already concluded that D1 was an
                    important and indispensible link in the four-party commercial
                    scheme/arrangement. The commercial arrangement which involved the four entities
                    was apparently mentioned by MEA and it was repeated in HTI’s e-mail dated
                    6 June 2008 to MEA. Sharizal wrote:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear Chio,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As I explained to you an hour ago, I am not privy to the details of the 4
                        party deal involving MEA, NEC, P&amp;R and HTI. Notwithstanding the above,
                        it is within my authority to give you some form of comfort for the delivery
                        of the projectors. As such, you may accept this email of mine as
                        confirmation of our purchase of the Projectors, the terms of conditions
                        among, as follows ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I digress for a moment to comment that KUB’s letter of credit to
                    HTI as beneficiary was issued on 13 June 2008 well after the projectors
                    were received on 7 June 2008. In addition, Sharizal’s e-mail to MEA
                    was sent on 6 June 2008. Yet HTI’s purchase order to D1 was dated
                    4 June 2008. Evidently, some degree of backdating of documentation by the
                    parties had been necessary in the circumstances, and above all
                accepted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In my judgment, the facts in evidence plainly
                    militate against D3’s case that the contract for the supply of projectors
                    was between NEC and Comat. D3’s argument is untenable and plainly wrong.
                    For completeness, I should mention D3’s further allegation that the
                    contract was actually made between MEA and Comat in the middle of May 2008. This
                    claim was neither pleaded nor supported by the facts in evidence. There was no
                    formal letter or contact given to MEA despite Sharizal’s promise to do so
                    in his e-mail of 6 June 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">NEC’s claim against D3 personally </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I now come to the next identity issue.
                    NEC’s case is that the contract for the supply of projectors was with D3
                    personally as he was the controlling mind and will of D1; that D3 used the
                    companies under him interchangeably, including D1 and D2, to contract, make
                    payment and receive the projectors. In short, D3 was the key person in the
                    transactions with NEC; he had used D1 and D2 to structure the transaction with
                    NEC, and was in fact the true contracting party in the transaction. These
                    factors made up NEC’s contention that D1 was D3’s alter ego, and D3
                    could not rely on the doctrine of separate legal personality of a company to
                    escape his personal liability. In response, D3’s case is that the contract
                    was with D1. I must point out that firstly, the alter ego argument is distinct
                    from the situation (which was not the argument advanced) where a person has
                    agreed to be personally liable in relation to a transaction, but performance of
                    his contractual obligation is through an entity. In this example, the original
                    contractual arrangement remains in force whilst performance is carried out by
                    others. Secondly, NEC is not relying on the ground of sham or facade as an
                    exception to the doctrine of separate legal personality. Cases like <em>Asteroid Maritime Co Ltd v Owners of the ship or vessel
                        “Saudi Al Jubail”</em> [1987] SGHC 71
                        (“<em>Saudi Al Jubail</em>”) and
                        <em>Children’s Media Ltd v Singapore Tourism
                        Board</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 524 (“<em>Children’s Media Ltd</em>”) were instances where the
                    court lifted the corporate veil when the corporate vehicle was found on the
                    evidence to have been used as a sham or a facade.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In <em>Children’s
                        Media</em>, the corporate veil was lifted after the court found that
                    the first defendant corporation acted as a facade to allow the third defendant
                    to evade his legal obligations. The court also found that the first defendant
                    was a corporate vehicle used by the second and third defendants to bear all
                    liabilities whilst the sponsorship moneys collected by the first defendant were
                    pocketed by the second and third defendants. The court’s decision was
                    upheld on appeal. The appellate court found that the first and second
                    appellants, Children’s Media Ltd and Tribute Third Millennium Ltd, were no
                    more than corporate puppets compliantly dancing to the tune of the third
                    appellant, Anthony Hollingsworth, who treated their assets as his own, and their
                    liabilities should also be his (see decision of the Court of Appeal reported in
                    [2009] 1 SLR(R) 524 at [9]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In <em>Saudi Al
                        Jubail</em>, Lai Kew Chai J found that the beneficial owner of the
                    vessel was using the companies Omega Shipping Company Limited and Saudi Al
                    Jubail Navigation Co. Ltd as mere corporate names which he abused as a cover for
                    his own trading and shipowning activities. Furthermore, the affairs and accounts
                    of the companies were not kept separate from one another or from his own
                    personal affairs. Unsurprisingly, the court lifted the corporate veil and
                    treated these companies as mere extensions of the owner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In <em>Sitt Tatt Bhd v Goh Tai
                        Hock</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 44, the corporate veil was not lifted
                    because there was no evidence that the corporation in question was created as a
                    sham or facade to shield the defendant from responsibility from what was
                    described as nefarious transactions. These three cases are therefore irrelevant
                    and do not assist D3.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The alter ego argument is another ground to
                    lift the corporate veil; it is a distinct ground, different from the one based
                    on fraud of the company’s controller. The key question that must be asked
                    whenever an argument of alter ego is raised is this: is the company carrying on
                    the business of its controller? This is inevitably a question of fact. In
                        <em>Smith, Stone and Knight, Ltd v Mayor, Alderman and
                        Citizens of the City of Birmingham</em> [1939] 4 All ER 116,
                    Atkinson J found that the subsidiary company was operating a business on
                    behalf of its parent company because its profits were treated entirely as those
                    of the parent company’s; it had no staff and the persons conducting the
                    business were appointed by the parent company, and it did not govern the
                    business or decide how much capital should be embarked on it. In those
                    circumstances, the court was able to infer that the company was the agent or
                    nominee of the parent company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     NEC relied on three main reasons to support
                    its alter ego argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     First, D3 was the only witness who gave
                    evidence for D2. He was extremely involved in the trial, and was often seen
                    prompting his counsel, Mr Singh during cross-examination of NEC’s
                    witnesses. NEC submitted that this behaviour suggested that D3 had a vested
                    interest in the matter, and was not merely an employee or officer of D1 or
                    D2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Second, D3 was closely linked to most of the
                    corporate entities involved in this transaction. He was the sole shareholder of
                    D1 and D2, and a director and shareholder of both HTI and Comat. He was the
                    signatory of letters from D1, Comat, as well as the cheque issued by D2. His
                    deep personal involvement was evident in the way he interchangeably used the
                    pronoun “I” when referring to D1 and D2’s actions. To
                    illustrate, NEC referred to D3’s answers in cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">And why did you stop payment on the
                        cheque?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I stopped the payment for the cheque – I
                            presume you’re referring that I need to issue a purchase order
                            between HTI and the 1st defendant – er, because to complete the
                            pass-through transaction. When I issue --- sorry, when the 1st defendant
                            issues an invoice to HTI, I would have to include a GST charge of 7%
                            because I have no evidence of exporting any goods, so I would have to
                            add into my invoice any amount of 7% which amounts to about $150,000.
                            With no tax invoice --- corresponding tax invoice from NEC, I could not
                            knock off this 7% against an input tax of 7%, so I would have to incur
                            --- sorry, the 1st defen --- defendant would have to incur a tax
                            liability of a $150,000. Secondly, my earning --- the earnings of the
                            1st defendant would have been inflated by 1.9 million and without a
                            corresponding invoice to expense out, there would be an 18% corporate
                            tax debt on these earnings, which would amount to about $350,000. My
                            total tax liability --- sorry, the 1st defendant’s tax liability
                            would have been half a million dollars. The 1st defendant was looking at
                            making a profit of only $20,000. I cannot, in the best interest of the
                            1st defendant, allow this transaction to happen.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Third, D3 had caused D2 to issue a cheque to
                    NEC as payment in order to fulfil D1’s payment obligations under the
                    contract. This was despite the fact that D2 was not involved in the contract at
                    all. This showed, so the argument ran, that D3 regarded himself as the real
                    party to the transaction, and that it did not matter which of his companies was
                    used to deal with different parts of the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In the present case, NECs first and second
                    arguments are insufficient to establish that D3 had employed D1 and D2 as his
                    alter ego in transacting with NEC. Evidence of sole shareholding and control of
                    the company without more will not move the court to intervene. Nothing adverse
                    can be read into D3’s prompting or giving instructions to his counsel
                    during the trial. If anything, I would attribute it more to his command and
                    knowledge of the facts and documents than anything else. Finally, D3’s
                    frequent use of the pronoun “I” when referring to D1 and
                    D2s’ actions was nothing more than habit. It is certainly could not be
                    used as evidence that these companies were his alter ego.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     As for D2 paying for the debt of D1, the
                    evidence is that NEC wanted to be paid for the projectors that were already
                    delivered and was willing to accept a cheque payment from another company in the
                    same group of companies as D1.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> There is no evidence that D2 was a
                    corporate vehicle and alter ego of D3 in the entire transaction, other than an
                    independent commercial player. Again there is nothing damning in D3 causing D2
                    to issue a cheque to NEC in respect of a debt owed by D1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Above all, NEC’s contention ran counter
                    to its own conduct throughout the entire course of events. NEC had always
                    regarded D1, and not D3, as its counterparty in the four-party pass-through
                    deal. It is worth noting that NEC had earlier rejected D3’s offer of
                    interposing D2 in the commercial scheme as it was an inactive company. Indeed,
                    NEC had asked D3 to provide evidence of D1’s financial standing before
                    agreeing to accept D1 as a suitable counterparty in the pass-through deal. There
                    were other occasions where NEC pointed to D1 as its counterparty. For example,
                    around the time D2’s cheque was dishonoured, Comat sent a letter to NEC on
                    12 August 2008 suggesting that it was NEC’s counterparty. NEC
                    instructed lawyers who in rejecting the suggestion firmly maintained the
                    position that it had no contractual relations with Comat, and that its contract
                    was only with D1.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     For these reasons, D3 was not NEC’s
                    counterparty: D1 is a separate legal personality and the alter ego argument is
                    unsustainable on the facts in evidence. Accordingly, D3 is not personally liable
                    to NEC for the supply of the projectors pursuant to the pass-through
                    deal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Is payment of the price due?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     D3’s contention is that NEC’s
                    claim should be dismissed as payment was not due. First, NEC had breached the
                    contract by delivering the projectors without D1’s prior instructions.
                    Second, the UAT requirement was not satisfied; and third, NEC failed to send the
                    invoices to D1. The allegation of illegality is discussed in another part of
                    this judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">June order: was it new or a variation of February order </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     It seems to me that it does not really matter
                    to the outcome of the case whether the June order was a new contract or a
                    variation of the February order. From NEC’s point of view, the distinction
                    is, however, important because it had earlier recognised the February order as a
                    sale, and hence revenue for the fiscal year ended 31 March 2008.
                    NEC’s position is that the June order was a variation of the February
                    order. D3 disagreed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     It is not controversial that the question of
                    whether the June order was a variation of the February order, or an entirely new
                    contract, is a question of mixed fact and law. In my judgment, there is
                    sufficient evidence to establish that the June order was a variation of the
                    February order which, in my judgment, was a conditional sale; it was conditional
                    pending receipt by D1 of a purchase order from either HTI or
                Comat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     I have earlier referred to the pass-through
                    deal, and the commercial scheme/arrangement put in place as the mechanics of the
                    pass-through deal. Like I said, it was in keeping with the commercial
                    scheme/arrangement that in February 2008, D1 accepted NEC’s ten quotations
                    to supply a total of 2,300 units of projectors at a unit price of USD658.20. The
                    aggregate price was USD1,513,860. NEC’s quotations of various dates in
                    February 2008 were subject to the following terms and conditions:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1. Prices quoted are valid for 90 days from date of this quote.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2. Prices are subjected to change without prior notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3. Payment Terms: Monthly payment for 24 months.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The quotations had the words ‘Accepted by Customer” at
                    the bottom of the page, together with D1’s stamp and address of D1, and
                    was signed by D1’s staff Chris Foo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     As it was a pass-through deal, NEC purchased
                    the projectors from MEA. The documentation in the Agreed Bundle shows that each
                    NEC quotation to D1 in February 2008 was correspondingly supported by a delivery
                    order and tax invoice from MEA. Notably, the MEA documentation had various dates
                    in February 2008. Included in the bundle of Agreed Documents is also NEC’s
                    purchase order to MEA for 2300 projectors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In my judgment, there was an agreement to sell
                    2300 projectors, but this sale was conditional upon HTI or Comat issuing a
                    purchase order to D1. Even though there was an unsigned copy of HTI’s
                    purchase order dated 27 February 2008 addressed to D1,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>it is common ground that the
                    PPSMI project was delayed, and that in June 2008, HTI issued its purchase order
                    to D1 for 2390 projectors. The terms of payment under HTI’s purchaser
                    order at US$598.75 per unit was stated as “Letter of Credit 30 days from
                        delivery”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     D3 stated that at the end of May 2008, HTI
                    received an order from KUB for 2390 projectors. Prior to that, in the middle of
                    May 2008, Comat met MEA to negotiate directly for a reduced unit price of
                    US$598.75 and the quantity to be supplied was 2390 projectors. Shortly after
                    that meeting, D3 gave the impression in his written testimony that new terms
                    were agreed upon at a later meeting attended by Michael and Choi from MEA, Shawn
                    from NEC, D3, and Kok representing Comat. The relevant terms are summarised as
                        follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_i"></a>(i)     All previous documents relating to
                        the supply of projectors were to be purged.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     The June order would be a completely new deal
                        with new prices and new terms and conditions.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     NEC would prepare a Performance Bond for
                        HTI.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     MEA
                        would drop its price to HTI/Comat by 2%. 1% would go to NEC and the other 1%
                        to D1 for processing and pass-through fees. (This 1% would translate to
                        S$20,000 of profit to D1).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_v"></a>(v)     Payment from D1 to NEC would be by Letter of Credit as
                        this would ensure proper delivery documentation;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_vi"></a>(vi)     The transaction would be zero rated
                        for GST purposes; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_vii"></a>(vii)     D1 would proceed to process the deal only when
                        Comat/HTI had issued a purchase order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I make a few points at this juncture. The
                    opening sentences of paragraph 17 of D3’s written testimony are
                    misleading as it gives the reader the impression that a binding agreement was
                    reached at that meeting. If such an agreement on the terms set out in
                    sub-paragraphs 17.1 to 17.8 was reached as alleged, it would not have been
                    legally possible for Sharizal, as managing director of HTI, to inform MEA in his
                    e-mail of 6 June 2008 that HTI was buying the projectors on the terms set
                    out in his e-mail; and that HTI would issue a formal letter and contract to MEA,
                    but in the meantime, MEA could rely on his e-mail confirmation to deliver the
                        projectors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> If
                    there was such an agreement as alleged, the subsequent paperwork did not match
                    the alleged new terms. Furthermore, if there was an agreement as alleged, there
                    would have been no need for Shawn to arrange a meeting on 12 June 2008 for
                    Job and D3 to meet. The meeting was to inform Job of the variation of the
                    February order and to raise and discuss D3’s request for NEC’s
                    accommodation to revise the quantity and price. When questioned by Mr Goh
                    on the alleged agreement in paragraph17, D3 initially said that it was not an
                    agreement but a “plan”;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> and
                    from a plan, it was later watered-down by D3 to “a rough
                        guideline”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> of the pass-through
                    arrangement. So even if direct delivery was not in accordance with the
                    “agreed plan”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> it was not contractual in
                    nature and that could be the reason why D3 at the material time never objected
                    to direct delivery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     By and large, the documentation, which was
                    signed on behalf of D1 in June 2008, showed that D1 had treated the June order
                    as a variation of the February order. For example, D1’s letter to NEC
                    dated 13 June 2008 was marked for the attention of Shawn and also addressed
                    to him. It referred to the changes as a revision of the February order and that
                    D1 would be sending NEC an amended purchase order (see text of letter at
                        <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> In his written testimony, D3
                    said he rejected a letter dated 13 June 2008 “addressed to Goh
                        Beng”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> The letter I had referred to was marked for
                    Shawn’s attention and it was also addressed to Shawn.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In a letter backdated to 18 June 2008,
                    which was from D1 to NEC and signed by D3, the June order was treated as a
                    variation of the February order:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Based on the back to back understanding that we have with the payment

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Both D3 and Shawn testified that the 18 June letter which was
                    marked for the attention of Tan Goh Beng had been voided at NEC’s request.
                    NEC wanted D1 to issue a fresh letter marked for the attention of Eiji Seki, but
                    no such letter was signed by D3. Accordingly, NEC was wrong to rely on the
                    18 June letter which had been cancelled. I do not accept the position
                    adopted by D3. Until actually replaced, there was only one letter dated
                    18 June 2008 and marked for the attention of Tan Goh Beng in existence and
                    binding on D1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Finally, I refer to D1’s eleven purchase
                    orders dated 5 June 2008 (mentioned in the 18 June 2008 letter). D3
                    accepted those purchase orders as D1’s as they were signed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> The D1’s purchase orders made
                    reference to the February order. For example, the purchase order with reference
                    number SC-0782-08-R1 was annotated with a remark which stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The above PO supersede (sic) your Quotation Reference SC-0782-08-08 dated
                        01 Feb 08.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In light of the above evidence, I find that
                    the June order was a variation of the February order between NEC and
                D1.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Performance of the supply contract</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Delivery</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     There is no doubt that NEC had, through MEA,
                    caused the projectors to be sent to the end buyer, KUB. NEC gave written
                    confirmation of its authorisation to MEA to deliver the 2390 units of projectors
                    directly to KUB in a letter which was backdated to 3 June 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> I do not think it matters
                    that this written confirmation was backdated to 3 June 2008. The fact of
                    the matter is that it is common ground that the projectors were delivered on 7
                    June 2008 to KUB by MEA directly.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> Crucially, and it is also common ground
                    that when MEA sent the projectors to KUB, it purported to give delivery on
                    HTI’s behalf.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>
                    Thereafter, HTI issued its purchase order to D1 with instructions to D1 to issue
                    its purchase order to NEC. At the risk of repetition, D3 confirmed that the
                    projectors were paid for by KUB and that HTI received payment sometime in June
                    2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The key question here is whether NEC had
                    agreed or acquiesced to the delivery of the projectors to KUB directly. At the
                    heart of the defence is that NEC cannot recover the sum it seeks to recover in
                    this action without effecting delivery to D1, or at the very least obtaining
                    D1’s authorisation to directly deliver the projectors to
                KUB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     D3 claimed that the projectors were sent to
                    KUB without D1’s authorisation. Shawn confirmed that D1’s
                    authorisation prior to delivery was not sought. Both David and Job in their
                    written testimonies stated that they did not know of the direct delivery until
                    the MEA shipping documents were forwarded to NEC. It is not known when the
                    shipping documents were forwarded. In re-examination, Job clarified that the
                    first time he became aware that the projectors were delivered by MEA to the end
                    buyer was at the meeting on 20 June 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> Be
                    that as it may, I am satisfied that direct delivery by MEA to KUB was in
                    accordance with the pass-through deal and NEC’s obligations under its
                    contract with D1 as the projectors were for the PPSMI project. There were many
                    opportunities for D3 to object but he did not do so. This was certainly odd
                    since one might have expected the authorisation issue to have arisen much
                    earlier if the delivery of the projectors was done without D1’s authority.
                    The missed opportunities on the various occasions highlighted below give
                    credence and support the view that direct delivery was agreed by the parties in
                    the pass-through deal or accepted by D1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     First, the e-mail sent by HTI to MEA on
                    6 June 2008 regarding the delivery of the projectors to KUB was forwarded
                    to D3 as soon as MEA received it. Even if as D3 claimed, he did not open the
                    e-mail of 6 June 2008 until later, there is no doubt that he knew about it
                    from Shawn on 9 June 2008. D3 did not protest or voice his objections at
                    that point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Second, Comat had sent an email to Ron of D1
                    and copied to D3, Shawn and Sharizal of HTI, to notify them of the pass-through
                    deal and the identity of the contracting parties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> Hence, by 13 June 2003, D3 was
                    already aware of the direct delivery and his conduct showed that he was
                    agreeable to or had approved direct delivery. Instead of protesting about direct
                    delivery, D3 went on to affirm by conduct the June order and delivery. The
                    evidence showed that D3 caused D1 to issue its purchase order to NEC on
                    13 June 2008 for the purchase of 2390 projectors at the price of
                        US$1,402,380.30.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> This purchase order was signed by D3. Later
                    on, this single order was split into eleven purchase orders. Again D3 accepted
                    in his written testimony that they were issued and signed. There is also the
                    18 June 2008 letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Third, D3’s e-mail to NEC on
                    26 June 2008 again shows that direct delivery was agreed between the
                    parties. In this email, D3 complained to NEC that he had not been given the
                    warranties and delivery documents (and not the absence of D1’s prior
                    authorisation): <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear Shawn,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">What is happening? I cannot contact you at all</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There are several outstanding matters</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1) Warranty statement. I need to submit this to the government. If not NEC
                        and Mitsubishi products will be blacklisted for govt jobs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2) Where are all the delivery documentation? I have nothing. The govt will
                        charge me for GST evasion! This is serious.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3) Where is my receipt for my cheque I send to Goh Beng?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4) Who is going to compensate me for the defect? The projectors were
                        delivered without the asset tags. We were penalized RM 250 per projector.
                        Who is going to pay? I am going to bill NEC for this. You can settle with
                        Mitsubishi. Not my problem.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5) Who is the rude piece of shit from your accounts dept that called my
                        FC? His name sounds like “Kim Liong”. Can we have someone else
                        to coordinate with?</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Notably, D3 did not protest that direct delivery to KUB had taken
                    place with D1’s prior authorisation. Instead, D3 complained that the
                    projectors were delivered to KUB without asset tags and warranty statements, and
                    that he had no documentation on the delivery. In context, in the case of direct
                    delivery by MEA to the end buyer of 2390 projectors, the only delivery order one
                    would expect to see would be the MEA’s delivery order, especially when MEA
                    had stated in its delivery order that the delivery was made on behalf of HTI. It
                    would be incongruous to put in circulation in June 2008 delivery order(s) per se
                    from NEC to D1. The direct delivery in June 2008 to the end user in Malaysia is
                    to be compared with the paperwork for the shipment initially anticipated to be
                    in February/March 2008. In the bundle of Agreed Documents are
                    (a) pre-signed delivery orders of various dates in February 2008 issued by
                    MEA to NEC; (b) NEC’s purchase orders to MEA (only one purchase order
                    was signed) and (c) pre-signed delivery orders dated February 2008 from NEC
                    to D1. From those documents, one sees provision for delivery within Singapore to
                    D1 at its Woodlands address.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In the circumstances, I find that direct
                    delivery was agreed between the parties. The projectors had been delivered, and
                    the sale price was due and payable. I find that payment was not conditional upon
                    D1’s receipt of NEC’s delivery orders for the 2390 units of
                    projectors. It seems to me that MEA’s delivery order and export documents
                    such as MEA’s packing lists, and cargo clearance permit all form a part of
                    the documentation produced in the four-party pass-through deal that would
                    suffice as documentary proof of delivery for the purpose of payment in the
                    four-party pass-through transaction between NEC and D1.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Other breaches of the contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     D1 maintained that NEC was not entitled to
                    payment because any payment was conditional upon the NEC resolving the UAT
                    failures as reported (“the UAT argument”). D3 also contended that
                    no invoices had been rendered to D1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In relation to the UAT argument, one has to
                    look at the contractual documents. I start first with the February order and its
                    terms and conditions. NEC’s quotations, which were accepted by D1, listed
                    down three terms and conditions, namely: the quantity of projectors to be sold,
                    the price at which they are to be sold, as well as how the price was to be paid.
                    There was no provision that payment was subject to the projectors passing the
                    UAT. There was also no provision that payment was due after the invoices were
                    received by D1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The terms of payment stipulated in the eleven
                    purchase orders dated 5 June 2008 was “LC 30 days or Cheque”.
                    In this case, D1 did not give a letter of credit to NEC. In May 2008, Comat and
                    MEA had discussed the changes to quantity and price and this was agreed to by
                    NEC at the meeting on 12 June 2008 attended by Job, Shawn and D3. After the
                    meeting, NEC issued one document (a quotation) dated 10 June 2008 which was
                    accepted and signed by D1.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> The terms accepted by D1 were:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1. Prices quoted are valid for 90 days from date of this quote.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2. Prices are subjected (sic) to change without prior notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3. L/C Payment 60 days</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Subsequently, D1 issued to NEC a purchase order dated 13 June
                    2008. The term of payment was stipulated as “LC 30 days”. This was
                    accompanied by a letter dated 13 June 2008 marked for the attention of
                    Shawn and addressed to Shawn (see <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>
                        above).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> That
                    letter only referred to changes in quantity and price. Later, D1 issued eleven
                    purchase orders to replace the single order of 13 June 2008. The payment
                    term was “LC 30 days or Cheque”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     According to Job, it was at the meeting on
                    20 June 2008 that D3 raised for the first time that payment by cheque would
                    be subject to UAT. In the Defence, D3’s plea is that NEC had orally agreed
                    that payment would only be made once UAT requirements were completed and the
                    transactional documentation delivered to D1. Job informed Shawn and Doris that
                    the UAT point was raised at the meeting held on 20 June 2008. Job
                        wrote:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear both,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have summarized our discussion with P&amp;R tonight. Please follow up
                        accordingly when you meet tomorrow afternoon.</p>

                            letter to proof they are part of the group.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Whilst this email referred to “UAT
                    acceptance”, it did not explain what this exactly entailed. D3 said that
                    the asset tag would come under “UAT acceptance”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> During cross-examination, Job accepted that
                    UAT was raised orally “but it was not commercially recorded because
                    it’s (sic) a very minor issue.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> Job
                    clarified that he was referring to affixing an ownership tag on the projectors.
                    It was a very minor issue that was quickly resolved by MEA’s
                        technicians.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> D3 did not refute Job’s
                    evidence that the asset tag problem had been resolved. In cross-examination, D3
                    disclosed that no penalty of RM250 per projector was imposed by KUB. I note that
                    D3 had in his e-mail of 26 June 2008 said that this penalty of RM250 per
                    projector was referable to projectors without asset tags. During
                    cross-examination, D3 brought up the problem with the projector’s lamp
                    which he said was corrected by MEA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> In the
                    circumstances, and in the absence of particulars and evidence of any other
                    outstanding UAT failures, and absence of a corresponding counterclaim from D1 on
                    the matter, D3’s excuse to stop payment until rectification of “all
                    reported UAT failures”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> was plainly fanciful, and without any
                    merit whatsoever.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In relation to the invoices, NEC admitted that
                    it did not invoice D1. Whilst it is normal for a seller to invoice the buyer in
                    the course of business, there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that
                    D1’s payment obligation would arise only after invoicing D1. In this case,
                    the replacement purchase orders, which were back-dated to 5 June 2008,
                    stipulated as a term payment “LC 30 days or Cheque”. The
                    undisputed evidence is that on 18 June 2008, David went to see D3 to ask
                    for payment as the projectors had been delivered on 7 June 2008. A cheque
                    was not forthcoming as the excuse was that D1’s finance director was out.
                    D3 promised to send a cheque later and NEC agreed to wait. NEC received
                    D2’s cheque post-dated to 8 August 2008 on 21 June 2008.
                    NEC’s omission to invoice D1 was not a valid reason for non-payment. At
                    the most, NEC’s failure to issue the invoices might amount to a breach of
                    contract allowing D1 to commence a counterclaim for an abatement of the purchase
                    price.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the contract was void for illegality</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Mr Singh raised illegality as a defence to
                    payment. Specifically, he contended that the supply contract was void for common
                    law illegality. Under the doctrine of common law illegality, a contract is
                    unenforceable if the party seeking to enforce the contract has incited the
                    commission of, or actively participated in, the illegal performance as in the
                    case of <em>Ashmore Benson Pease &amp; Co Ltd v Dawson</em>
                    [1973] 1 WLR 828. Mr Singh argued that this principle was applicable in the
                    present case. NEC had booked the February order as revenue even though there was
                    no physical delivery of the projectors to D1 in February/March 2008. NEC charged
                    GST in the invoices when the supply was for export and the sale would be zero
                    rated. NEC’s motivation was to ensure that NEC could meet its sales and
                    revenue targets for the fiscal year ended 31 March 2008. Mr Singh argues
                    that what NEC did was illegal and the contract between NEC and D1 was tainted
                    and thereby void.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In my judgment, Mr Singh cannot rely upon
                    any principle of illegality. It is plain that the principle upon which
                    Mr Singh seeks to rely is one which is dependent upon there being found in
                    the contract as a matter of its true construction a requirement to carry out an
                    act which is unlawful in the place of performance. There is no merit in
                    D1’s contentions. The contract between NEC and D1 was not tainted by
                    illegality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     NEC does not dispute that the contract was
                    supposed to be zero-rated and that no GST would be charged as it was an export
                        deal.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> The documentation was prepared and pre-signed in
                    expectation and with some degree of confidence that the projectors would be
                    delivered by March 2008<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span>, and that there would be
                    export documents to substantiate the transaction as zero-rated. As it turned
                    out, the delivery was delayed. At that time, Job was told by Shawn that the
                    projectors would be needed in April 2008. NEC also obtained MEA’s
                    assurance that it would not in the meantime bill NEC. Based on the aforesaid
                    information, Job explained that NEC decided to recognise the February
                    transaction for that particular fiscal year first, and that the GST would be
                    reversed at a later stage when proper export documentation was available. This
                    explained why GST was reflected in the invoices despite the contract being a
                    zero rated one. NEC’s witness Shintaro Miki, the vice president of NEC,
                    testified that there was indeed a reversal of the GST<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span>which had initially been booked, as was
                    initially planned by NEC. Further, according to the IRAS e-Tax Guide on GST: A
                    Guide on Exports (9th Edition) at page 3, NEC would have been unable to
                    charge zero-rated GST on the transaction at the point of time when it had
                    declared its GST return. Pursuant to the Inland Revenue Authority of
                    Singapore’s policy, if the company does not have custody of the goods to
                    be exported, nor control over the export arrangement, the company is required to
                    treat the sale as a local supply and charge GST accordingly. This was the case
                    for NEC when it declared its GST return in March 2008, as the projectors had yet
                    to be exported and they did not have the export documentation required to prove
                    that the transaction was zero-rated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     As can be seen, the revenue recognition was an
                    internal matter as far as NEC was concerned. No invoices were actually sent to
                    D1 as it was not NEC’s intention to ask D1 for payment before shipment.
                    The anticipated shipment in February/March 2008 did not take place. The PPSMI
                    project was delayed on account of the Malaysian General Elections. NEC also did
                    not expect the pricing and quantity to change from the numbers in the February
                    order. Instead of April 2008, there was a further delay of almost two months
                    before the projectors were finally shipped out in June 2008 to KUB in Malaysia
                    for the PPSMI project. The pre-mature revenue recognition in March 2008 was a
                    misjudgment. However, it would not and did not, in my view, affect or taint the
                    underlying transaction, that is to say, the pass-through deal, which was simply
                    a four-party commercial arrangement. The pass-through deal was not illegal. The
                    performance of the pass though deal was also not illegal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">NEC’s claim against D2</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     NEC’s claim against D2 is based on the
                    D2’s cheque for S$1,917,054.00. NEC presented the Cheque on 11 August
                        2008<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> but was informed
                    that the cheque payment had been stopped.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In this case, I find that D2 had issued the
                    cheque to NEC in order to discharge D1’s obligation to make payment to NEC
                    under the supply contract. Accordingly, NEC had given good consideration to D2
                        (<em>ie</em>, releasing D1 from its payment
                    obligations) in exchange for its issuance of the cheque. NEC is a holder for
                    value in respect of the cheque under s 27 of the Bills of Exchange Act
                    (Cap 23, 2004 Rev Ed).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Section 55 of the Bills of Exchange Act
                    sets out the liability of a drawer of a bill of exchange or a cheque:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) The drawer of a bill, by drawing it —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) engages that on due presentment it shall be accepted and paid
                        according to its tenor, and that if it be dishonoured, he will compensate
                        the holder or any indorser who is compelled to pay it, provided that the
                        requisite proceedings on dishonour be duly taken;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) is precluded from denying to a holder in due course the existence of
                        the payee and his then capacity to indorse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">According to Guest, A.G., Chalmers and Guest on Bills of Exchange and
                    Cheques (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 17<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2009) at
                    [7-023], the drawer of a cheque promises that the cheque will be paid upon
                    presentment for payment. Hence, prima facie, D2’s act of issuing the
                    cheque to NEC renders it liable to NEC for the sum of S$1,917,054 should the
                    cheque be dishonoured.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conditional payment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     D2’s defences against NEC’s claim
                    mirror the first four arguments raised by D3 as to why he should not be held
                    liable (above at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>). I have already
                    rejected these four arguments and do not intend to go through them in full
                    again.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     I will deal only with D2’s strongest
                    argument, which is that its cheque was not meant to be presented for payment
                    until the UAT was satisfied and the export documents and invoices delivered to
                    D1. In response, Mr Goh suggested to D3 (who denies it) that the real
                    reason why D2’s cheque was post dated to 8 August 2008 was for it to
                    coincide with the expiry date of the CIMB Bank letter of credit as D2 had to
                    await funds (represented by the proceeds of the CIMB Bank letter of credit) to
                    meet the cheque.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> I accept Mr Goh’s
                    case theory as plausible, because at that time, NEC knew that D2 was not an
                    active company. The only reason why NEC would have accepted D2’s cheque
                    was because it knew that D2 would be receiving funds from the CIMB Bank letter
                    of credit later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     In addition, D2’s cheque was given in
                    lieu of D1’s obligation to provide NEC with a letter of credit on terms
                    back to back with CIMB Bank letter of credit from HTI. In the 18 June 2008
                    letter D3 had indicated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Based on the back to back understanding that we have with the payment
                        terms in-lieu of the back to back LC that we have received for this Project,
                        hereby we will issue a post dated cheque of $S1,917,054.OO (USD 1,402,380.30
                        Exchange Rate: USD 1.367) to ensure our buying commitment from NEC Asia for
                        this Project.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Kindly note that this cheque is issued from The Digital Network Pte Ltd
                        which is part of the Picket and Rail Group of Companies</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     There is nothing in the 18 June 2008
                    letter that shows that D2’s commitment to pay NEC was subject to other
                    conditions. Furthermore, the CIMB Bank letter of credit that KUB provided to HTI
                    was not subject to any conditions on documentation,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> meaning that HTI could have
                    presented it for payment without any accompany documents as none was identified.
                    Given that the cheque was meant to stand in place of the letter of credit that
                    D1 was supposed to be issued to NEC, and this was supposed to be “back to
                    back” with the CIMB Bank letter of credit issued by KUB to HTI, it is a
                    reasonable inference that the payment by cheque was not subject to
                    conditions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Accordingly, NEC’s claim against D2
                    succeeds and D2 is liable to pay the sum of S$1,917,054.00 to NEC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Result</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     For the reasons given:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_a"></a>(a)     NEC’s claim against D3
                        personally is dismissed. As for costs, NEC is to pay 35% of D3’s costs
                        of the action.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_77-p2_b"></a>(b)     NEC succeeds in its claim against D2 in the sum of S$1,917,054.00 together
                        with interest at the rate of 5.33% from the date of the Writ of Summons to
