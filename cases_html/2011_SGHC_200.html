<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The parties, Mdm Chan Pui Yin (“the
                    Plaintiff”) and Mr Lim Tiong Kei (“the Defendant”)
                    were divorced after being married for more than 17 years, and the matrimonial
                    ancillary matters came before me for determination. These included the division
                    of the matrimonial assets, the issue of custody, care and control for the only
                    child of the marriage, Dawn Lim Yu Fen (“Dawn”), and the issue of
                    maintenance for the Plaintiff and Dawn. I made the following orders on 3 May
                    2011:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“5. Orders made:-</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(a)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The Plaintiff
                            and Defendant are to have joint custody of their daughter, Dawn, with
                            care and control to the
                            Plaintiff.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(b)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The Defendant
                            shall have liberal access to Dawn, including overnight
                        access.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(c)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The Defendant is to pay
                            maintenance to Dawn at $2,500 per month with effect from 3 May
                            2011.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(e)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">(i) The Plaintiff is
                            awarded the sum of $1,140,000 being 30% of the matrimonial home valued
                            at $3,800,000.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(ii) The Plaintiff is awarded the sum of $3,285,238.60 being 30%
                            (inclusive of adverse inference drawn against the Defendant) of all
                            remaining assets valued at $10,950,795.34.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(iii) Consequently, the Defendant is to pay the Plaintiff the sum of
                            $3,491,253.39 being the total award due to the Plaintiff less the value
                            of the assets in the Plaintiff’s sole name.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(iv) The sum of $3,491,253.39 is to be paid in three
                            instalments as follows:-</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(a)    The sum of $1,140,000 by 3 August

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(b)    The sum of $1,175,626.70 by 3 November

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(c)    The sum of $1,175,626.70 by 3 February
                                    2012</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(v) The sum of $103,000 due from the Plaintiff to the Defendant is to
                            be deducted from the 1st instalment payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(vi) The Plaintiff and Dawn are to move out of the matrimonial home
                            within 7 days of receipt of the 1st instalment payment or the date of
                            the Transfer of the Plaintiff’s 30% share in the matrimonial home
                            based on a valuation of $3,800,000, whichever is the earlier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Defendant has appealed against that part of
                    the Order of Court dated 3 May 2011 that pertains to paragraphs 5(e)(ii), (iii),
                    and (iv). In short, the appeal is against the Plaintiff’s share of 30% of
                    all remaining matrimonial assets valued at $10,950,795.34. The matrimonial
                    assets in the common pool for division are tabulated in Annexure A to this
                    Grounds of Decision. They included the property known as No 804 Dunearn Road,
                    Singapore 289671 (“the Dunearn property”) and registered in the
                    sole name of the Defendant, a unit known as #08-14 Golden Mile Complex, a
                    commercial property in which the Plaintiff has an interest, her CPF monies,
                    shares, insurance policies and bank account balances. The Dunearn property with
                    a current value of $9.75m is the single most significant asset in the pool of
                    matrimonial assets available for division. The total worth of the assets in the
                    Plaintiff’s name in the pool was $933,985.21. The orders on division were
                    for monetary sums to be paid to the Plaintiff and they were not intended to be
                    orders for the sale of the properties. The mechanism for achieving the division
                    ordered was for the parties to retain the assets in their respective names and
                    for the Defendant to pay the Plaintiff the sum of $3,491,253.39 being the
                    difference between the total sum awarded less the total worth of the assets in
                    the Plaintiff’s name ($4,426,238.60-$933,985.21 =
                $3,491,253.39).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       There is no appeal against the orders made in
                    respect of the division of the matrimonial home, namely the property known as No
                    27 Goldhill Drive, Singapore 308975 (“the Goldhill property”). The
                    Goldhill property was held to be the matrimonial home as on the facts in
                    evidence the property clearly satisfied the statutory definition in
                    s 112(10) of “matrimonial assets” in the Women’s
                    Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       There is also no appeal against the orders on
                    maintenance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       I should mention that the Defendant had
                    initially fought the Plaintiff for sole custody, care and control of Dawn.
                    However, counsel for the Defendant, Mr Imran Hamid (“Mr
                    Imran”) subsequently confirmed that the Defendant would agree to an order
                    granting both parents joint custody of Dawn with care and control to the
                    Plaintiff. Counsel for the Plaintiff, Ms Carrie Gill (“Ms Gill”)
                    confirmed the Plaintiff’s consent to such an order, if made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Since the Defendant’s appeal is limited to
                    paragraphs 5(e)(ii),(iii) and (iv) of the Order of Court dated 3 May 2011,
                    for expediency, I will confine this Grounds of Decision to the division of the
                    matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The parties were married on 26 February 1992.
                    The Plaintiff instituted divorce proceedings against her husband, the Defendant,
                    on 13 November 2008, and the Interim Judgment of Divorce IJ3515/2009 was granted
                    on 12<sup></sup>August 2009. The Plaintiff is presently about 58 years of age, and
                    she works in the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce as an Associate, drawing a
                    stated gross monthly income of $5,200. The Defendant is presently about 61 years
                    of age and he runs his own trading company, Chop Nam Huat Sdn Bhd, in Brunei,
                    drawing a stated net monthly income of BN$8,000. Dawn was born on 6 October 1992
                    and she will turn 19 this year. Dawn is a student at LASALLE College of the
                    Arts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       According to the Plaintiff, the couple lived in
                    the Defendant’s apartment known as #05-02, Silver Tower, a private
                    condominium located along Cairnhill Road when they were first married
                    (“the Silver Tower property”). After Dawn was born, the family
                    moved to the Goldhill property which was home to Dawn and the Plaintiff for the
                    last 18 years. The family’s living arrangements were that the Plaintiff
                    and Dawn resided with the Defendant’s parents in the Goldhill property,
                    with the Defendant working and living in Brunei for the most part of the year
                    except for the occasional visits to his family in Singapore for 10-12 days at a
                    time. This was the family’s living arrangement for the last 18 years. The
                    Defendant admitted to being an absent spouse and father for the most part of the
                    year except for the occasional visits to his family in Singapore, and the annual
                    family vacations. Family life for Dawn was growing up with one parent in the
                    same house as her paternal grandparents, and in a family environment where her
                    father’s many siblings would frequently drop by the Goldhill property
                    whenever they called upon their parents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In the early years of the marriage, the
                    Plaintiff had her mother live with herself and Dawn in the Goldhill property.
                    Her mother would care for Dawn when the Plaintiff was out at work. She would
                    prepare Dawn’s meals as well as accompany her to kindergarten and
                    enrichment classes. This arrangement came to an abrupt halt when the
                    Plaintiff’s mother fractured her hip in 1997, and she went to live with
                    her other daughter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Even though the Defendant had settled into
                    living in Brunei, he paid for the maintenance and repairs to the Goldhill
                    property, all the household expenses, family outings, transport and vacations.
                    He also paid for Dawn’s expenses including expenses related to her studies
                    and her daily allowance. The Defendant also paid for the two renovations to the
                    Goldhill property. From 2002 or 2003, after the Plaintiff had depleted her
                    savings on medical expenses for her parents and bad investments, the Defendant
                    gave her a monthly allowance of $1,500. The Plaintiff contended that since
                    September 2009, the Defendant had stopped giving her the monthly allowance and
                    Dawn’s maintenance. In the past, the Defendant would leave behind
                    pre-signed cheques with the Plaintiff to enable her to settle Dawn’s
                    expenses and to provide for her monthly allowance. The Defendant’s sister,
                    Cecilia, was tasked to handle payment of utilities bills and other outgoings
                    from funds that were deposited into a POSB joint account which the Defendant had
                    opened with Cecilia. The Defendant claimed that he had to trouble his sister
                    because the plaintiff did not want to be bothered by this
                        “chore”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Goldhill property was purchased by the
                    Defendant’s father in 1968. It was transferred to the Defendant and his
                    two brothers in 1974. Later on the Defendant took over his brothers’
                    shares. According to the Defendant, the shares were paid for by himself and his
                    father. The Defendant became the registered owner of the Goldhill property on 8
                    June 1993.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> It was the Defendant’s case
                    that two-thirds of his interest in the Goldhill property was gifted to him by
                    his father. His position was that the Goldhill property was <em>not</em> a matrimonial asset as it was his parents’ matrimonial
                        home.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The parties tendered
                    valuation reports of the Goldhill property and for the purposes of division, and
                    taking the average of the two valuations, the figure of $3,800,000 was treated
                    as its current value. Notwithstanding the Defendant’s denial, I held that
                    the Goldhill property was the matrimonial home based on the evidence before me
                    (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Silver Tower property was registered in
                    the Defendant’s name. It was bought in 1984 some eight years before the
                    parties were married. After marriage, the parties lived there for a few months
                    until Dawn was born. The property was sold in an <em>enbloc</em> sale in 2007, and with the sale proceeds, the Defendant
                    purchased the Dunearn property which was registered in his sole name. According
                    to the Plaintiff, she wanted her husband to include her name as co-owner but he
                    refused with the excuse that he had borrowed money to finance the purchase and
                    he did not want her to be involved in the loan. There was only one property
                    known as No 5 Springside Walk (“the Springside property”) that was
                    owned by the couple in their joint names. The Springside property was a terrace
                    house in Sembawang which was purchased in February 2001 (going by the option to
                        purchase<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>), but it was
                    eventually sold in 2007 at a loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Dunearn property should be considered a matrimonial asset
                and be available for division</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It is patently clear from the
                    Defendant’s Notice of Appeal filed on 2 June 2011 that his dissatisfaction
                    with the orders made was primarily with the division of the Dunearn property.
                    The property had appreciated in value over the years to stand at between $9m and
                    $10.54m in the first quarter of this year based on valuation reports submitted
                    by the parties. For the purposes of division, and by taking the average of the
                    two valuations, the figure of $9.75m was adopted as its current value.
                    Mr Imran’s written submissions adopted the Defendant’s stand in
                    his affidavit: that the Dunearn property was <em>not</em> a
                    matrimonial asset.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> In the course of the hearing, however,
                    Mr Imran departed from his written submissions, and accepted, and rightly
                    in my view, that the Dunearn property, which was acquired during the marriage,
                    was a matrimonial asset. His case was that the property should not be included
                    in the pool of assets because there was no financial contribution to its
                    acquisition from the Plaintiff, and that the Plaintiff’s non-financial
                    contributions to the marriage and family were such that the equity of the case
                    was not with her. He cited <em>Ong Boon Huat Samuel v Chan Mei
                        Lan Kristine</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 729 (“<em>Ong Boon Huat</em>”) in support of his proposition
                    that the Court has the power to exclude a matrimonial asset from the pool of
                    assets for division.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Defendant’s reasons for exclusion
                    are paraphrased as follows: that the parties had never lived at the Dunearn
                    property, and currently the Defendant’s brother resides there; that the
                    Plaintiff had not made any financial contribution whatsoever to the acquisition
                    of the Dunearn property in 2007; and that it was registered in his sole
                    name.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Ms Gill argued that the Plaintiff had in fact
                    made financial contribution to the Dunearn property even though her contribution
                    was very small. The Dunearn property was bought in February 2007 before the
                        <em>enbloc</em> sale of the Silver Tower property was
                    completed in April 2007. The Plaintiff had contributed $197,812.98 to the
                    purchase of the Springside property which was purchased for $1,358,000 in 2001.
                    This property was sold for $1,150,000 with completion taking place in January
                    2007, and $344,600 of the sale proceeds were utilised to pay the balance of the
                    Option fee and Stamp fees for the Dunearn property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Defendant’s documentary evidence
                    supported his assertion that the Plaintiff did not contribute financially to the
                    acquisition of the Dunearn property and her claim that she did so was unfounded.
                    First, the Springside property was sold at a loss of $246,673, and according to
                    the Defendant, he had effectively absorbed the Plaintiff’s share of the
                    loss on the property. Second, the funds withdrawn from the Plaintiff’s CPF
                    account to finance the purchase of the Springside property were returned in full
                    with interest to the Plaintiff’s CPF account. Third, the Defendant meant
                    for the remaining proceeds of $927,573.42 from the sale of the Springside
                    property to be used to pay back the money borrowed from his father to acquire
                    the same. After $344,600 of these proceeds were used to pay for the balance of
                    the Option fee and Stamp fees for the Dunearn property, the remaining
                    $562,222.99 was deposited in a HSBC bank account held in the parties’
                    joint names<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. According to the
                    Defendant, the purchase price of the Dunearn property was about $5m and the
                        <em>enbloc</em> sale of the Silver Tower property
                    yielded about $4m. To purchase the Dunearn property, the Defendant had to borrow
                    money from his father again. With his father’s permission, he utilised
                    $927,573.42 from the sale of the Springside property to fund the purchase of the
                    Dunearn property (hereafter referred to as “the Springside
                        funds”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Court of Appeal in <em>NK v
                        NL</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 743 observed that the exclusion of
                    particular matrimonial assets from the overall computation and division exercise
                    in favour of dividing only certain assets could prejudice the fair and equitable
                    division. Andrew Phang JA (delivering the judgment of the appellate court) at
                        [38] agreed with the reasoning of
                    Lee Seiu Kin JC (as he then was) in <em>Tham Lai Hoong v Fong
                        Weng Sun Peter Vincent</em> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 391 at [12] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“To exclude some assets from this consideration could contribute to
                        a misapprehension in the mind of the judge as to the extent of the
                        matrimonial assets as well as the extent of each party’s contribution
                        thereto...”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Phang JA emphasised that any attempt to
                    exclude particular assets from the overall computation has to be strictly
                    scrutinised as the court’s overarching duty is to achieve a just and
                    equitable division in all the circumstances of the case (at [40]). One instance where exclusion of a
                    matrimonial asset was allowed is the case of <em>Ong Boon
                        Huat</em>. In that case, it was a short marriage- it lasted only 19
                    months - and both spouses had treated the disputed property as a solo venture by
                    the husband. Leong Wai Kum, <em>Elements of Family Law in
                        Singapore</em> (LexisNexis, Singapore 2007) at p 643 observed
                    that the Court of Appeal’s decision was based on the unusual facts of the
                    case where the entire risk of the investment was for the husband to assume, and
                    the wife could not in fairness be allowed to then ask for a share where by good
                    fortune the property appreciated in value and the husband profited from his
                    acquisition of the property. Professor Leong cautioned against extending the
                    decision beyond the special facts of the case. Indeed, the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>NK v NL</em> (at [40]) clarified its decision in <em>Ong Boon
                        Huat</em> by stating that the court’s mandate is to achieve a
                    just and equitable division so that any attempt to persuade the court to deviate
                    from its duty must be strictly scrutinised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     As mentioned earlier in <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>, Mr Imran conceded that the Dunearn
                    property was a matrimonial asset but that it should be excluded from division
                    for the reasons alluded to in <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above. It
                    was not the Defendant’s case, and there was no evidence, that the Silver
                    Tower property was gifted to the Defendant. Gifts from third parties and assets
                    purchased with money obtained from the sale of pre-marriage assets (not gifted)
                    are two completely different matters. The reason, so it seemed, as to why the
                    Plaintiff’s name was not included in the Dunearn property was because the
                    Defendant had told the Plaintiff that he did not want her to be liable for the
                    loan taken to finance the purchase. The Defendant had not refuted the
                    Plaintiff’s evidence on this point.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Be that as it may, the position
                    taken by Mr Imran at the hearing was that the property was a matrimonial
                    asset. Crucially, as to whether it should be excluded from the pool of assets
                    for division, the Defendant was not able to satisfy me on the evidence that this
                    was a proper case for exclusion. In the event, the Dunearn property fell
                    available for division. I now come to Mr Imran’s argument that the
                    Plaintiff did not contribute financially and non-financially to the acquisition,
                    improvement or maintenance of the Dunearn property and therefore she should not
                    be given any share of the property. I disagreed with his submissions (see also
                        <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a> below). Typically, the court will
                    scrutinise all the circumstances of the case, and there are many other factors
                    that the court will take into consideration in determining a just and equitable
                    division of the matrimonial assets (see also <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The court will consider the factors listed in
                    s 112(2) of the Women’s Charter if they are applicable (per LP
                    Thean JA in <em>Lim Choon Lai v Chew Kim Heng</em>
                    [2001] 2 SLR(R) 260 at [14]).
                    In the present case, s 112(2)(a) is less significant to the extent of being
                    inapplicable given the dynamics of this family. Section 112(2)(a) states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Power of court to order division of matrimonial
                            assets</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>112</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) It shall be the duty of the court in deciding whether to exercise its
                        powers under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have regard to
                        all the circumstances of the case, including the following matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) the extent of the contributions made by each party in money, property
                        or work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial
                        assets;</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Plaintiff had no involvement in the Dunearn property simply
                    because the Defendant’s style and preference was to turn to his siblings
                    whenever he wanted help. As will be seen later, the Defendant trusted his
                    siblings more than he did the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In this case, the court should give
                    consideration and weight to the indirect non-financial contributions of the
                    Plaintiff to the marriage and welfare of the family. Section 112(2)(d)
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>112. (2) ..</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d) the extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare of
                        the family, including looking after the home or caring for the family or any
                        aged or infirm relative or dependant of either party;</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Section 112(2)(d) is particularly important
                    for the home-maker wife whose contributions are likely to be to the welfare of
                    the family, including looking after the home or caring for the family. To
                    illustrate, I refer to <em>Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo
                        Nancy</em> [2011] 2 SLR 1157 (“<em>Yeo
                        Chong Lin</em>”). In that case, the direct financial
                    contributions were made by the husband while the indirect non-financial
                    contributions were made by the wife. The husband also paid for the expenses of
                    the family and the children’s education overseas. The appellate court did
                    not disturb Judith Prakash J’s finding that the wife contributed to the
                    family and the marriage to the best of her ability by taking on the roles of
                    homemaker and mother. Prakash J viewed the matrimonial assets on a global basis
                    and divided the assets to the wife and the husband in proportions of 35:65
                    respectively. The Court of Appeal commented that “35% of a large pool of
                    matrimonial assets would be [just] to a spouse whose contributions were all in
                    the domestic sphere” (at [82] of the judgment). Again in <em>Koh Bee Choo v Choo Chai Huah</em> [2007] SGCA 21,
                    the home-maker wife did not make direct contribution to the assets acquired by
                    the husband. The wife’s claim was based on her contribution to the welfare
                    of the family. The court recognised the importance of non-financial
                    contributions to the welfare of the family and noted that s 112(2)(d) of
                    the Women’s Charter obliges the court to take into account the extent of
                    the contributions made by each party to the welfare of the family, including
                    looking after the home or caring for the family. Finally, in <em>AHJ v AHK</em> [2010] SGHC 148, both parties worked
                    throughout the marriage. The wife claimed that her indirect contributions were
                    demonstrated, <em>inter alia</em>, in her care of the
                    husband’s parents when he was overseas and her sacrifices in giving up her
                    studies for the family. The wife continued to work after the birth of their son
                    who was taken care of by the wife’s mother during the daytime. In relation
                    to a property known as the St Martin’s apartment, the wife claimed that
                    she took care of the property and secured the tenant whilst the husband was
                    overseas. The husband disputed this, arguing that he had given a power of
                    attorney to his sister to deal with the property. Whilst the husband agreed that
                    the St Martin’s property was within the pool of matrimonial properties for
                    division, he submitted that the wife’s indirect contributions were
                    miniscule, and that she should not be given any share of this property. Agreeing
                    that the wife’s indirect contributions were insignificant, Tay Yong
                    Kwang J nevertheless adopted a broad perspective in the division and
                    awarded the wife 20% of its net value. Separately, in the division of the
                    matrimonial home, the wife did better and was awarded 45% of the net value after
                    deducting the outstanding loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Returning to the present case, the real issue
                    is whether or not there was indeed evidence that the Plaintiff had made little
                    or no indirect contribution whatsoever to the marriage and family as the
                    Defendant wanted this court to believe. On this issue, I concluded that the
                    evidence pointed in the Plaintiff’s favour. I now turn to the
                    Plaintiff’s indirect contributions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Indirect contributions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The salient feature of this case is the
                    family’s long term living arrangement where the Plaintiff and Dawn lived
                    in Singapore and the Defendant worked and resided in Brunei. For the last 18
                    years, the Plaintiff and Dawn resided at the Goldhill property together with the
                    Defendant’s father, and when the Defendant visited Singapore he too would
                    stay in the property. His family saw him several times a year for 10-12 days
                    during each of his visits to Singapore. The Defendant’s mother also
                    resided at the Goldhill property until she passed away in February
                2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Defendant was an absent spouse and father.
                    The Defendant’s absence from home was felt by the Plaintiff who said that
                    she had to cope without her husband’s emotional and physical support, and
                    that she was Dawn’s primary caregiver and disciplinarian. Notwithstanding
                    the Defendant’s absence, the Plaintiff maintained that she tried her best
                    to be a filial daughter-in-law to the Defendant’s parents. She attended to
                    their ad hoc needs and that she would make time for them whenever they needed a
                    listening ear. On festive occasions, the Defendant’s siblings and their
                    respective family members would gather at the Goldhill property and she would
                    prepare the meals sometimes with the assistance of her sister-in-law. In the
                    Defendant’s absence, she saw to preserving his family relations (the
                    Defendant has 17 siblings (excluding spouses) and more than 30 nephews and
                    nieces) and would observe cultural civilities like giving gifts, and making
                    hospital visits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     It was not disputed that in the 1990s, the
                    Plaintiff bought and sold shares with funds from the Defendant. The disagreement
                    between the parties in this area concerned the amount of the capital. The
                    Defendant alleged that he gave $1m to the Plaintiff. His complaint was that the
                    Plaintiff had not accounted to him for the capital of $1m. In reply, the
                    Plaintiff said that (a) she could not remember the size of the capital outlay
                    save that they lost $800,000-$900,000 in the Asian financial crisis; and (b) the
                    Defendant had previously accepted the losses and had never asked her to account
                    until she filed for divorce.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In these proceedings, the Defendant had not
                    produced documents to show that exactly $1m was given to the Plaintiff or used
                    by the Plaintiff to trade in shares. I considered this omission to be unusual
                    seeing that he was in the habit of retaining documents of concern to him, from
                    the most important ones like papers relating to property transactions dating
                    from as far back as the 1970s to the mundane like monthly credit card
                    statements, catering bills and receipts. I have already gained a clear
                    impression of his habit from the voluminous documents produced in the
                    Defendant’s affidavits. In my view, the Defendant had yet to make good his
                    bare assertion that $1m was given to the Plaintiff to invest. I do not therefore
                    see a need for the Plaintiff to account to the Defendant for the $1m as he had
                    demanded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The Plaintiff accepted that with the funds
                    provided by the Defendant she traded in shares on their behalf. It was a joint
                    effort as she was not the sole decision maker and that she would at times
                    consult the Defendant before making the trades. She would monitor the share
                    prices and look after the paperwork and the settlement of the trades. It was
                    evident that while the marriage was ongoing and the relationship between the
                    parties was good, there was a level of cooperation and trust between them in
                    investing in the stock market. Even though the entire or the bulk of the capital
                    was lost during the Asian financial crisis in 1997, the inference to be drawn
                    from the Plaintiff’s activities in the stock market as described, which
                    was not unreasonable nor implausible, was that the Plaintiff and the Defendant
                    wanted to make money in the stock market, and this common goal was part and
                    parcel of their joint effort to accumulate wealth for the family. The
                    Plaintiff’s efforts in this regard should not be ignored or trivialised
                    simply because the venture failed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Mr Imran submitted that the Defendant’s
                    objection was to the level of contribution the Plaintiff had supposedly made
                    during the marriage bearing in mind that the Plaintiff had a full-time job and
                    the domestic chores were undertaken by a full-time maid who was supervised by
                    the Defendant’s mother. The Defendant has many siblings and he maintained
                    that they had been supportive of the Plaintiff and Dawn. For instance, his
                    sister, Cecilia, who was a teacher used to tutor Dawn and monitor her school
                    work. Furthermore, it was the Defendant’s siblings and full-time maid
                    rather than the Plaintiff who cared for the Defendant’s parents. His
                    evidence was that the maid was employed for the purpose of looking after his
                    aging parents although she did the housework and washed and ironed the
                    Plaintiff’s clothes. In any case, the Defendant countered that the
                    Plaintiff could not have cared for his parents as she was constantly at odds
                    with her mother-in-law and had complained frequently about her father-in-law.
                    That said, Mr Imran at the hearing of 21 January 2011, however,
                    conceded paragraph 20(w) of the Plaintiff’s 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Affidavit which was consistent with the Plaintiff’s evidence that she
                    tried her best to be a filial daughter-in-law to the Defendant’s
                    parents:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">During the weekends, I would often go marketing whenever possible, so as
                        to prepare home-cooked meals personally for my daughter and the
                        Defendant’s parents at home. On many occasions, when the Defendant was
                        in town, I would request for him to take his car from his brother to take me
                        to the market but the Defendant often asked me to do the same, making me
                        feel very frustrated. There are time when he would even inconvenience his
                        sister by making her take me to the market, this making me feel that he is
                        shirking his responsibility to others instead of fulfilling it
                        himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     It is clear that the Plaintiff was a single
                    parent to Dawn. She was mother to Dawn, and she was involved in the daily care
                    of the child. Although she probably received some help from the
                    Defendant’s relatives to take care of Dawn given that she had full-time
                    employment, it could not be denied that she was effectively a single parent and,
                    in any event, the Defendant’s relatives should not be regarded as his
                    proxies. Any argument that the Plaintiff was (a) a full-time working mother and
                    could not have been Dawn’s primary caregiver; (b) assisted by a full-time
                    maid who did the household chores; and that (c) the maid was supervised by the
                    Defendant’s mother before her health deteriorated in October 2007 meant
                    that her indirect contribution was minimal was totally blinkered and was
                    therefore rejected. In the words of Tay Yong Kwang JC (as he then was) in
                        <em>Lee Chung Meng Joseph v Krygsman Juliet Angela</em>
                    [2000] 3 SLR(R) 965 at [41]
                    (and approved by the Court of Appeal in <em>Pang Rosaline v Chan
                        Kong Chin</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 935 (“<em>Pang Rosaline</em>”) at [18]), “[h]aving a maid in the household, or a number of
                    maids for that matter, does not mean abdication of parental responsibility
                    towards the child”. Emphasising the need for cogent evidence if a spouse
                    is to succeed in the allegation of little or no indirect contribution to the
                    marriage, care of the household and well being of the family - it is a common
                    occurrence in today’s society that spouses work full-time - Andrew
                    Phang JA (delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal) said (at
                        [19]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Indeed, the acceptance of a contrary proposition must presuppose that
                        spouses who work full-time cannot, <em>ipso facto</em>,
                        spare any time to contribute towards the marriage or the family at all and
                        would necessarily have to sacrifice their all (and, consequently, their
                        marriage as well as family) at the altar of work. Whilst obviously
                        undesirable, this is not to state that such a situation is impossible.
                        However, this would have to be established by cogent evidence. It was clear
                        that such evidence was <em>not</em> forthcoming in the
                        present appeal. Put simply, there was nothing in the evidence before us
                        which suggested that the wife had, in fact, sacrificed herself as well as
                        her family and marriage at the altar of work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     None of the evidence highlighted by
                    Mr Imran pointed to or was a sign of an abdication of parental
                    responsibility by the Plaintiff towards Dawn. Whilst Mr Imran conceded that
                    as Dawn’s mother, the Plaintiff was the primary caregiver, Mr Imran,
                    however, disputed the Plaintiff’s claim that she had looked after the
                    household including the Defendant’s parents. I have already mentioned the
                    Defendant’s claim that it was his siblings and the full-time maid rather
                    than the Plaintiff who cared for his parents. In reply to the Defendant’s
                    allegations in <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above, the Plaintiff
                    explained that despite the occasional problems with her mother-in-law, they had
                    lived together in the same home for 16 years and that they had grown close and
                    learned to live with each other and accommodated each other’s needs. For
                    the sake of her mother-in-law, she only divorced the Defendant after her
                    mother-in-law’s death. As noted, Mr Imran at the hearing of
                    21 January 2011 conceded paragraph 20(w) of the Plaintiff’s
                        1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit which was consistent with the
                    Plaintiff’s position that she tried her best to be a filial
                    daughter-in-law to the Defendant’s parents (see <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     I now come to the Defendant’s claim that
                    he maintained regular telephone and e-mail contact with his family whilst he was
                    away in Brunei. He produced three emails in 2008 as proof, but this did not
                    impress me at all.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> As I noticed earlier, the Defendant
                    was able to exhibit numerous documents to support his assertions, and I had
                    naturally expected to see a lot more e-mails if he had been in contact with his
                    family as often as he wanted this court to believe. I also noticed that despite
                    his counsel’s submissions that the Defendant “takes great care to
                    be involved and interact with Dawn”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>, the
                    Defendant had to be reminded to keep in contact with his daughter. I have seen
                    e-mails from the Defendant’s sister urging or reminding him to contact his
                    daughter despite his apparent frustration at her monosyllabic responses in
                        conversations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> From the Defendant’s record of
                    the annual holidays, the time spent together as a family was remarkably short in
                    some years considering that it was their annual vacation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> It is not disputed that the
                    Defendant has had and continues to have a very difficult relationship with his
                    daughter, and I did not find this state of affairs surprising since he was
                    hardly around during her formative years. I have noted an observation made by
                    the Defendant’s sister in her e-mail dated 31 May 2007 to the
                    Defendant that Dawn resented his long absence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> However, the Defendant blamed
                    the Plaintiff for creating a rift in the father-daughter relationship, an
                    accusation which the Plaintiff had strenuously denied and she had singled out
                    his constant absence from Dawn’s life as the main reason for the state of
                    their relationship, and his parenting style as another factor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Division of matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     I begin with the principles of a “just
                    and equitable” division of matrimonial assets as Phang JA reiterated
                    in <em>Pang Rosaline</em> at [23] which bear repeating:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The first centred on the fact that the division of matrimonial assets
                        under s 112 of the Act is not – and cannot be – a precise
                        mathematical exercise and that the court’s discretion is to be
                        exercised in broad strokes instead (see, for example, the decision of this
                        court in [<em>Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye</em>
                        [2007] 3 SLR 520 at [33]-[35]]; indeed,
                        as this court pointed out, in <em>NK v NL</em>
                        [[2007]3 SLR 743 at [28]].
                        “It is essential that courts resist the temptation to lapse into a
                        minute scrutiny of the conduct and efforts of both spouses, which may be
                        objectionable in disadvantaging the spouse whose efforts are difficult to
                        evaluate in financial terms”. In this regard, it was also pointed out
                        in <em>NK v NL</em> (at [22]-[27]), that
                            <em>direct</em> financial contributions are
                            <em>not</em> to be considered as a <em>prima facie</em> starting point although they
                        nevertheless constitute a factor which should be considered by the court
                        pursuant to the exercise of its discretion under s 112 of the Act
                        (which involves what is essentially a multi-factorial approach). We have
                        also referred to the need to ensure that <em>indirect</em> contributions are also accorded due
                        recognition.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     With the above principles in mind, I turn to
                    the present case. I have taken into consideration the length of the marriage and
                    the family’s long term living arrangement and family dynamics. I have
                    considered the Plaintiff’s indirect contributions to the marriage and the
                    family including her parents-in-law (see <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a>-<a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> above). I have
                    also taken into consideration the Defendant’s financial as well as
                    non-financial contributions to the acquisition of assets and to the care of the
                    family and the home. He had provided for the family in terms of financial
                    contributions to the household and family expenses, family holidays and the bulk
                    of Dawn’s expenses including her school fees. I accepted that there was
                    payment of $1,500 monthly to the Plaintiff which she used to defray expenses for
                    the household, pets and her personal expenses. I have taken into consideration
                    the Defendant’s medical conditions (he suffers from a growth in his brain
                    stem and trigeminal neuralgia) and I noted his need to make provision for his
                    own medical expenses. His health will have a bearing on his future earning
                    capacity. Fortunately for the Defendant, he is already well-off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     As stated earlier, Mr Imran submitted
                    that bearing in mind that the Plaintiff did not contribute financially to the
                    acquisition of the matrimonial assets, and based on her indirect contributions,
                    she should be awarded 20% of the value of the matrimonial home and certainly not
                    as high as 50% as argued for by Ms Gill. In his view, the Plaintiff should
                    not be given a share of the Duneran property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I decided to divide the matrimonial home
                    separately from the rest of the assets in the overall pool. As I see it, after
                    the resolution of the ancillary matters, the Plaintiff would require housing for
                    herself and Dawn whom she has care and control of for most of the time as the
                    Defendant continues to reside in Brunei, and also that the Plaintiff has been
                    given only a nominal maintenance of $1 by this court. In addition, Mr Imran
                    informed the court that the Defendant’s father, who is in his late 80s,
                    still lives in the Goldhill property and that the Defendant does not wish to
                    move his father elsewhere. In this case, I was mindful that the value of the
                    Dunearn property was significantly higher than the value of the matrimonial
                    home, and at the same time, it was in connection with the Dunearn property that
                    an adverse inference was drawn against the Defendant for keeping his share of a
                    second unit in the Silver Tower condominium a secret and then revealing it as
                    ostensibly his father’s retirement fund in the flow chart exhibited at
                    p 38 of the Defendant’s 4<sup>th</sup> Affidavit.
                    (see <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> to <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     After viewing everything from a broad
                    perspective in determining what a just and equitable division would be, I
                    decided that the Plaintiff should received a 30% share in the Goldhill property
                    based on the valuation of $3.8m, and I so ordered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     For the remaining assets available for
                    division, they are worth $10,950,795.34. The most valuable asset is the Dunearn
                    property. Similarly, having regard to the same factors discussed above, and in
                    the light of the Defendant’s non-disclosures which I will come to shortly,
                    I decided that the Plaintiff should receive a 30% share of the remaining
                    matrimonial assets based on the value of $10,950,795.34, and I so
                    ordered.</p>

                        [52]), and the court is entitled to
                    draw adverse inferences against those parties which fail to do so. An adverse
                    inference is drawn if there is a <em>prima facie</em> case
                    of non-disclosure of material facts (see <em>Koh Bee Choo v Choo
                        Chai Huah</em> at [28]). In
                    particular, the non-disclosure, and the inference drawn for the non-disclosure,
                    has to be about a matter which can properly be taken into account in arriving at
                    a fair and equitable division. If an adverse inference is drawn, one way the
                    court can give effect to it is to order a higher proportion of the known
                    matrimonial assets to be given to the other spouse, as was done in <em>NK v NL</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In these proceedings, there was evidence that
                    pointed towards the Defendant’s failure to disclose material facts that
                    would have a bearing on the court’s assessment of a fair and equitable
                    division. I should for completeness mentioned that unlike the Plaintiff, the
                    Defendant who had equally accused the Plaintiff of non-disclosure did not come
                    close to showing, evidentially, that her non-disclosure, if any, would affect
                    the fair and equitable division. I therefore say no more about the
                    Defendant’s allegations of non-disclosure and now turn to his instances of
                    non-disclosures.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     First, the unchallenged allegation made by the
                    Plaintiff that the Defendant owned not only #05-02 Silver Tower but that he also
                    owned a half share in another unit in the same development.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> In the
                    Plaintiff’s 3<sup>rd</sup> Affidavit, she accused the
                    Defendant of lying about the size of the <em>enbloc</em>
                    payout and exhibited some e-mails and attachments thereto that pointed to (a)
                    the Defendant’s interest in a second unit in the Silver Tower condominium,
                    and (b) his sister’s reminders to keep the second unit a secret from the
                    Plaintiff. At this juncture, I digress to point out that the image quality of
                    some of the printed e-mail exhibits in the Plaintiff’s
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Affidavit was very poor, suffering from ills
                    such as graininess and blacked out text from the use of non-photocopy safe
                    highlighters. The upshot of this clearly defeats the objective of highlighting a
                    document. It is the responsibility of counsel to ensure that the client’s
                    documentary evidence placed before the court is properly presented as the lack
                    of care and attention to such details can adversely affect the outcome of the
                    case. Besides, it is irritating and annoying for the reader and creates a bad
                    impression all-round. Needless to say, the extracts referred to in this Grounds
                    of Decision can only come from the legible portions of the exhibits. That said,
                    the relevant extracts of three e-mails exhibited by the Plaintiff that touched
                    on the second unit are set out below. I should mention that Messrs Lee &amp; Lee
                    were the lawyers involved in the <em>enbloc</em>
                    sale.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     It is quite obvious that the Defendant’s
                    sister in her e-mail of 2 April 2007 was referring to the Springside funds when
                    she suggested to the Defendant to make use of the money in the HSBC bank.
                    Further contemporaneous documentary evidence pointing to the Defendant’s
                    interest in the second unit in the Silver Tower condominium including what he
                    received for his share in the second unit is set out below:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_1"></a>(1)     On 4 December 2007, the
                        Defendant’s sister wrote to the Defendant:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">You can keep the bungalow [the Dunearn property]. Just spend a few

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_2"></a>(2)     There were two
                        attachments to the sister’s an e-mail dated Tuesday, April 17, 2007 at
                            9.47am.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> The first attachment was about
                        the E$AVER ACCOUNT –SGD -9179 and it showed a cheque deposit of
                        $2,580,593.93 into the account on 12 April 2007. Interestingly, the second
                        attachment stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“Another $2,580,593.93 (2<sup>nd</sup> unit of
                        Silver Tower (Nam Huat) was banked in on 11 April 2007.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The first e-mail-comment at <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a> above is consisted with the paragraph 20(v)
                    of the Plaintiff’s 1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit where she had
                    earlier described the Defendant’s initial intention to re-develop the
                    Dunearn property but the plans were cancelled and the existing house was painted
                    before the Defendant’s brothers moved in to stay in the
                property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Exhibited at p 55 of the
                    Defendant’s 4<sup>th</sup> Affidavit is a Maybank cheque
                    dated 12 April 2007 and drawn on the bank account of Nam Hwatt Realty Co
                    Pte Ltd in favour of the Defendant for the sum of $2,580,593.93. The exact
                    figure of $2,580,593.93 was referred to in the second e-mail attachment at
                        <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a> above (the date
                    “11 April 2007” was plainly a typographical error since the
                    date on the cheque was 12 April 2007). Mr Imran had used this cheque
                    as evidence of the father’s loan to purchase the Dunearn
                        property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> Ms Gill
                    questioned the cheque exhibited at p 55 of the Defendant’s
                        4<sup>th</sup> Affidavit. She observed that the Defendant
                    had deposed that he made use of the money available from the sale of the Silver
                    Tower and the Springside funds to pay for the Dunearn property thereby
                    suggesting that there was no need for another substantial loan from the
                    Defendant’s father to purchase the Dunearn property. The bulk of the sales
                    proceeds from the sale of the Silver Tower property amounting to $3,902,347.33
                    were deposited into a Standard Chartered E-Saver Account in the names of the
                    Defendant and his sister, Cecilia. After paying the balance of the Option fee
                    and stamp fee, the available Springside funds were eventually deposited into the
                    same Standard Chartered E-Saver Account.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> The Defendant explained that
                    Springside funds were his father’s money since the acquisition of
                    Springside property had been financed by the father. If this was true, and
                    assuming that counsel for the Defendant was mistaken in submitting that the
                    cheque of $2,580,593.93 constituted the father’s loan to acquire the
                    Dunearn property, could the cheque of $2,580,593.93 be the Defendant’s
                    father’s “retirement funds” as alluded to in paragraph 27 of
                    the Defendant’s 3<sup>rd</sup> Affidavit? The Defendant
                    said that the Standard Chartered account was opened to “facilitate the
                    purchase of another property from the proceeds of the sale of the Silver Tower
                    property. The account was also opened to park part of my father’s
                    retirement funds”. No further explanation was proffered as to the value
                    of the “retirement funds” and it is certainly curious as funds
                    “parked” in the Standard Chartered account were bound to be mixed
                    with the Defendant’s own funds. At p 38 of his
                        4<sup>th</sup> Affidavit, the Defendant exhibited a flow
                    chart and in there he referred to the sum of $2,580,593.93 as “Lim Peck
                    Oh’s funds (father)”.At paragraph 48 of the Defendant’s
                        4<sup>th</sup> Affidavit, the Defendant claimed that moneys
                    belonging to his father had since been returned to him. Unless substantiated by
                    the Defendant to the contrary, the Plaintiff had, in my view, established a
                        <em>prima facie</em> case that the Maybank cheque for
                    $2,580,593.93 was the Defendant’s share of the sale proceeds from the
                        <em>enbloc</em> sale of the second unit, namely #
                    05-04, a unit registered in the name of Nam Hwatt Realty Co Pte Ltd. It was
                    therefore the true nature of this sum of money and its whereabouts after the
                    fixed deposit accounts were supposedly closed that the Defendant had failed to
                    disclose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I now turn to second area where the Defendant
                    had not explained satisfactorily, and where the Plaintiff had accused him of
                    failure to make full and frank disclosure. This related to the sum of
                    $415,789.24 in a fixed deposit account which the Defendant said was used to pay
                    for the Plaintiff’s debt to her of $103,677.12, the balance of which was
                    subsequently given to Cecilia. He accepted that Cecilia in her e-mails had
                    informed him of her investment with the money given to her but he rationalised
                    that as the money was hers, she could do whatever she wished with the
                        money.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> I doubted his explanation for the
                    unambiguous language used in the e-mails is unequivocal. Despite the
                    Defendant’s general comments in paragraph 56 of his
                        4<sup>th</sup> Affidavit, it is quite clear from the e-mails
                    below that the Defendant’s sister was trading in shares for herself and
                    the Defendant.</p>

                    above were compelling for what was stated and they revealed a state of affairs
                    where the sister and brother (the Defendant) were secretive about the
                    latter’s net worth, and actively promoted this secrecy. Other instances of
                    conduct apparent from the e-mails also bore out their penchant for secrecy. For
                    example, in the sister’s e-mail of 27 March 2007 to the Defendant,

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     As the story unfolded, the Plaintiff did file
                    for divorce on 13<sup>th</sup> November 2008. Coincidentally on
                    the same day, the Defendant received an e-mail from his brother, Ronnie Lim
                    (“Ronnie”), reporting on the outcome of his inquiry to set up a
                    trust. Ronnie wrote:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Charlie,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Spoke to Han Kee Fong. Basically, <em>I told him that you
                            are toying with the idea of a trust fund</em>. <em>I told him that the trust fund should include these two

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The incriminating revelations in <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> and <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a> above were
                    unethical to say the least, and the sister’s advice and Ronnie’s
                    inquiry on the Defendant’s behalf were quite consistent with the
                    siblings’ past behaviour as demonstrated by the Defendant’s efforts
                    to keep the Plaintiff in the dark as to his interest in a second apartment in
                    Silver Tower Condominium. His willingness to maintain secrecy had severely
                    damaged his credibility. A bare assertion by the Defendant that he had made full
                    and frank disclosure would not be good enough in the circumstances. A terse and
                    dismissive reply that the e-mails were obtained illegally without more would
                    equally not suffice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     This leads me to the Defendant’s claim
                    that he has no bank account in Brunei and maintained that all his cash was in
                    his Singapore bank account. The assertion that he has no bank account in Brunei
                    is incredulous seeing that he had worked and resided in Brunei for more than 20
                    years, and his salary was paid in Brunei. In relation to the Defendant’s
                    declared salary of BN$8,000 a month from the company, Chop Nam Huat Sdn Bhd, the
                    Defendant is one of two directors of the company, and the Financial Statements
                    for the years 2009 and 2010 indicated that sums of BN$263,250 and BN$276,250
                    respectively were used to remunerate these directors. Looking at the figures,
                    the Defendant’s annual director’s remuneration would, on a monthly
                    basis, work out to more than the declared monthly sum of BN$8000. Furthermore,
                    the Defendant’s Last Will and Testament dated 31st October
                        2005<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> and updated at an unspecified date indicated
                    “Fixed Deposits in Brunei” as a component of his assets available
                    for distribution although the value of these accounts was not disclosed. The
                    Defendant, however, claimed that the 2005 Will had been revoked, but he had not
                    explained what had become of those sizeable fixed deposits. His assertion that
                    he does not have any fixed deposits in Brunei misses the point; it is an
                    incomplete answer and is thus unsatisfactory and unacceptable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The Defendant also appeared to have other
                    accounts held jointly by him together with Cecilia, although he denied this and
                    maintained that he only had one such account, POSB No. [xxx], held jointly with
                    Cecilia and used for the purposes of paying bills. Despite acknowledging the
                    existence of this account, the Defendant failed to disclose any other details
                    about it, including, crucially, the remaining balance in the
                account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The evidence above supported the
                    Plaintiff’s accusations that the Defendant had not been full and frank in
                    his disclosure of all the information relevant to these ancillary proceedings,
                    and accordingly I drew an adverse inference against him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Given the nature of the evidence pointing
                    towards undisclosed assets, it is impossible to even estimate what their value
                    could amount to and add a corresponding value into the pool for division.
                    Instead, I found it just and equitable to award the Plaintiff a higher
                    proportion of the disclosed assets. I am fortified in my approach by the
                    decisions of <em>NK v NL</em> and <em>Yeo
                        Chong Lin</em>. Accordingly, as a consequence of the adverse
                    inferences against the Defendant, I awarded the Plaintiff a further 10% of the
                    value of the disclosed assets of $10,950,795.34.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     For the reasons stated, I made the orders set
                    out in <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above. I also ordered that each
                    party bear his or her own legal costs.</p>
