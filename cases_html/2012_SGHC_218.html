<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This application arose out of DC Suit 3104 of
                    2009/Y (“the DC Suit”). The plaintiff in the DC Suit and in this
                    Originating Summons was Tan Kee Huat (“the plaintiff”). The
                    defendant in the DC Suit and in this Originating Summons was Lim Kui Lin
                    (“the defendant”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff commenced the DC Suit in 2009 to
                    recover damages arising from injuries that he sustained when his taxi was
                    involved in a collision with a vehicle driven by the defendant. The insurers of
                    the defendant’s vehicle conducted the defence on his behalf. Subsequently,
                    negotiations took place and the defendant’s insurers agreed that he should
                    consent to interlocutory judgment being entered against him on the basis that
                    the defendant would bear 85% of the damages sustained by the plaintiff.
                    Accordingly, interlocutory judgment for damages to be assessed was entered by
                    consent in the DC Suit on 17 March 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Originating Summons herein was filed on 17
                    May 2012. The plaintiff prayed for an order that the action be transferred from
                    the District Court to the High Court and be tried as a suit on the basis that
                    the sum involved exceeded $250,000, the limit of the District Court’s
                    jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       I heard the application on 13 August 2012 and
                    allowed it on the basis that the interlocutory judgment was set aside so that
                    after the proceedings had been transferred to the High Court the defendant would
                    be able to defend the suit and argue that his liability, if any, should be for
                    less than 85% of the plaintiff’s damages. The defendant and his insurers
                    are not happy with this outcome and have lodged an appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 14 October 2008, the plaintiff was driving
                    his taxi along Upper East Coast Road when it was involved in a collision with
                    vehicle no SGR1857K, driven by the defendant. As a result of the accident, the
                    plaintiff suffered personal injuries. He was taken to Changi General Hospital
                    where he complained of pain in the right foot. X-rays of his right foot showed
                    fractures of the neck of the third and fourth metatarsals. The plaintiff was
                    treated for pain and was discharged with analgesics and crutches. He was given
                    two weeks’ hospitalisation leave.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       A medical report dated 12 February 2009 stated
                    that on 21 October 2008, the plaintiff was seen in the Orthopaedics Clinic of
                    Changi General Hospital. He complained of neck pain, back pain and right foot
                    pain and swelling arising after the accident. An MRI scan of his cervical spine
                    was performed and the result was normal. He was treated with analgesics and his
                    right foot was kept in a cast. Upon subsequent reviews, his neck and back pain
                    had apparently resolved and his fractures were healing. The plaintiff was to be
                    reviewed again in late February 2009 and his diagnoses were: (a) neck and back
                    strain and (b) right foot third and fourth metatarsal fractures. The letter
                    stated that the plaintiff’s hospitalisation leave was from 21 October 2008
                    to 25 February 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiff continued to complain of pain and
                    a further MRI scan was conducted in June 2009. The plaintiff attended regularly
                    at the outpatient clinic for treatment complaining of intermittent pain over his
                    right foot, neck and lower back region. In a report dated 13 August 2009, a
                    senior consultant at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Changi General
                    Hospital, Dr Low Boon Yong, stated that the plaintiff’s foot injury had
                    recovered well and the cervical spine had recovered satisfactorily. There was no
                    evidence of residual disability in either area and occasional backaches could be
                    treated with analgesics.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 1 September 2009, the plaintiff who had
                    applied for, and obtained, legal aid, started the DC Suit. As stated above, on
                    17 March 2010, interlocutory judgment for damages to be assessed was entered
                    against the defendant after the defendant agreed to bear 85% of the damages as
                    assessed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The matter then proceeded in the District Court
                    and a hearing of the assessment of damages was first scheduled for 17 August
                    2011. Neither this hearing nor a subsequently hearing fixed for the 11 May 2012
                    went on, however.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In the meantime, the plaintiff had consulted
                    Dr Ho Kok Yuen, Consultant Anaesthesiologist of the Pain Management Centre,
                    Singapore General Hospital. In a medical report dated 28 January 2010, Dr Ho
                    opined that the plaintiff suffered from the following injuries:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     Discogenic low back pain at L3/4 and
                        L4/5 discs;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     L4/5 and L5/S1 disc bulge and protrusion respectively;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     Bilateral S1 radiculopathy with
                        bilateral foot pain; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_d"></a>(d)     Healed fractures of the 3<sup>rd</sup>
                        and 4<sup>th</sup> metatarsal bone of the right
                    foot.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In further medical reports dated 5 July 2010,
                    4 August 2010 and 22 August 2011, Dr Ho opined that the plaintiff was unable to
                    work as a taxi driver any more due to his condition and recommended that the
                    plaintiff undergo a trial implantation of spinal cord stimulation to ease his
                    alleged pain. This was as the plaintiff’s pain was not controlled even by
                    stronger painkillers such as methadone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The defendant’s insurers then required
                    the plaintiff to go for re-examination by a specialist they had chosen, Dr W C
                    Chang, Consultant Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgeon. Dr Chang saw the plaintiff on
                    10 August 2011. In his report, Dr Chang stated that the plaintiff’s neck
                    pain had resolved. He further reported that the issues with the
                    plaintiff’s back were pre-existing age related asymptomatic degenerative
                    disc disease. This was as the plaintiff was 48 years old. Dr Chang was of the
                    opinion that the surgical procedures recommended by Dr Ho were unnecessary and
                    that the fractures of the right foot that the plaintiff had suffered had healed
                    well and the residual pain complained of was inconsistent with the good recovery
                    seen clinically and in the x-rays. Dr Chang opined that the plaintiff could be
                    gainfully employed in any sedentary position and this included driving a
                    taxi.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The plaintiff’s position was that he was
                    not able to drive a taxi at any time after the accident and could not work
                    thereafter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Application to transfer</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The plaintiff’s application in these
                    proceedings was supported by an affidavit filed by his present solicitor, Mr V
                    Ramakrishnan. Mr Ramakrishnan deposed that the plaintiff’s former
                    solicitors had commenced the action in the District Court based on the medical
                    reports mentioned in the statement of claim (which were dated between 12
                    November 2008 and 13 August 2009, the last report being that of Dr Low Boon
                    Yong) thinking that the damages would not exceed $250,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     However, as matters developed, the plaintiff
                    had been on medical leave since the accident and had not been able to go back to
                    work. He had subsequently been diagnosed with four conditions as stated in Dr
                    Ho’s medical report of 5 July 2010. As a taxi driver, he had earned $2,500
                    a month and he had since lost 42 months’ worth of income amounting to
                    $105,000. This loss was continuing. On the basis of Dr Ho Kok Yuen’s
                    medical report dated 22 August 2011 there was a potential claim for either loss
                    of earning capacity or loss of future earnings. He would also need expensive
                    medical treatment to deal with his pain. A trial of a spinal cord stimulation
                    (as recommended by Dr Ho) would cost $5,000 and if that succeeded, follow up
                    treatment involving an implantable pulse generator would cost between $50,000
                    and $52,000 and the battery would have to be replaced after nine years at a cost
                    of $45,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Mr Ramakrishnan also gave details about the
                    plaintiff’s depression. The plaintiff had had depression in 2007 and 2008
                    and his symptoms worsened in 2010 because he was troubled by chronic pain, his
                    unemployment and financial difficulties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Mr Ramakrishnan gave the following estimation
                    of the plaintiff’s claim for general and special damages:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In Mr Ramakrishnan’s opinion, the
                    damages recoverable by the plaintiff well exceeded the $250,000 limit and the
                    plaintiff’s action should therefore be transferred to the High
                    Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In a subsequent affidavit, Mr Ramakrishnan
                    explained why the two hearings which had originally been fixed for the
                    assessment of damages had not gone on. In respect of the first hearing on 17
                    August 2011, counsel for the defendant had objected to the admission of the
                    plaintiff’s Supplementary Bundle of Documents and also asked the plaintiff
                    to file an affidavit of evidence in chief. This led to the hearing being
                    adjourned. Subsequently, the plaintiff obtained an order to file the
                    Supplementary List of Documents, his Affidavit of Evidence in Chief and the
                    Notice for Appointment for Assessment of Damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The matter was fixed before an Assistant
                    Registrar on 2 December 2011 to take hearing dates. This appointment was
                    adjourned to 13 January 2012 and then to 16 March 2012 because the defendant
                    wanted to obtain the plaintiff’s medical reports from the Institute of
                    Mental Health. Eventually, the assessment was fixed for a half day hearing on 11
                    May 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     At the 11 May 2012 hearing, counsel for the
                    defendant submitted a Surveillance Report dated 9 May 2012 from Ariel Protection
                    Pte Ltd. Plaintiff’s counsel then asked for an adjournment in order to
                    take instructions from the plaintiff on this report. This adjournment was
                    granted. It was after this that the application to transfer the proceedings was
                    filed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Neither of Mr Ramakrishnan’s affidavits
                    stated why the plaintiff had only applied for a transfer of proceedings to the
                    High Court in May this year. I asked Mr Ramakrishnan this question. His response
                    was that after he had taken over the matter from the plaintiff’s previous
                    solicitors, he had suggested to the plaintiff that the matter be transferred.
                    The plaintiff, however, was reluctant because he wanted a speedy disposal of the
                    matter and was concerned that if a transfer took place, there would be a delay.
                    It was only after the assessment hearing in the Subordinate Courts was adjourned
                    twice that the plaintiff decided to apply for the transfer as in any case
                    resolution of his claim was going to be delayed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The defendant opposed the application. He
                    filed an affidavit in which he set out the factual background of the case. He
                    then went on to state why he considered that the case should not be transferred
                    to the High Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The defendant’s first point was that the
                    plaintiff’s claims had not been substantiated. In this respect, the
                    defendant produced various medical reports and made various arguments as to why
                    the defendant’s medical reports should be accepted instead of the
                    plaintiff’s medical reports. Further, the plaintiff’s claims for
                    permanent impotency, for depression and for the cost of a maid were
                    unsubstantiated. If the aggravated claims were not allowed, the
                    plaintiff’s damages would fall within the jurisdiction of the District
                    Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The second point was that the plaintiff had
                    delayed unduly in making his application to transfer. He had known of his
                    alleged conditions in 2009/2010 and at hearings before the Assistant Registrar
                    in the District Court had quantified his claim at an amount which fell within
                    the High Court jurisdiction. The plaintiff therefore could have made his
                    application earlier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The third point was that liability for the
                    matter had been finalised. The defendant had agreed to liability at 85% on the
                    basis that damages would be assessed within the jurisdictional limit of the
                    District Court. If the transfer were to be allowed, the prejudice caused to him
                    would be immense and could not be compensated by an order as to
                costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Reasons for the decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The application was brought under s 54B of the
                    Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 2007 Rev Ed) which provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    Where it appears to the High Court, on the
                            application of a party to any civil proceedings pending in a subordinate
                            court, that the proceedings, by reason of its involving some important
                            question of law, or being a test case, or <em>for any
                                other sufficient reason</em>, should be tried in the High
                            Court, it may order the proceedings to be transferred to the High
                            Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     At the hearing, both parties relied on the
                    leading authority on this type of application <em>viz</em>
                    the decision of the Court of Appeal in <em>Keppel Singmarine
                        Dockyard Pte Ltd v Ng Chan Teng</em> [2010] 2 SLR 1015
                        (“<em>Keppel Singmarine 2010</em>”). The
                    plaintiff also relied on an earlier Court of Appeal decision in the same case
                    [2008] 2 SLR(R) 839 (“<em>Keppel Singmarine
                        </em><em>2008</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In <em>Keppel Singmarine
                        </em><em>2008</em>, the Court of Appeal held that
                    in respect of a case commenced in the Subordinate Courts, the entering of an
                    interlocutory judgment is not a legal affirmation of the lower court’s
                    jurisdiction over the plaintiff’s claim for the entire duration of the
                    proceedings (see [32]). Further, at [35] the Court noted that as to what
                    constitutes “sufficient reason” for a transfer of proceedings in
                    the context of s 54B(1), some Commonwealth jurisdictions had expressly enacted
                    that the fact that the amount to be awarded to the claimant is likely to exceed
                    the jurisdictional limit of the inferior court would be a proper ground for a
                    transfer. The Court went on to state at [38] that it agreed that a possibility
                    of a plaintiff’s damages exceeding the jurisdictional limit of the
                    District Court would ordinarily be regarded as a “sufficient
                    reason” for a transfer of proceedings to High Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The plaintiff’s submissions were that
                    his case was a proper one for transfer because his damages were likely to amount
                    to more than $250,000. Secondly, there had been a material change in his
                    condition since the time that he had filed his writ in the Subordinate Courts as
                    shown by the medical reports. Thirdly, there would be no prejudice to the
                    defendant because it would make no difference to the defendant whether the
                    application for transfer was filed before the interlocutory judgment was made or
                    thereafter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The defendant resisted the application. After
                    carefully considering counsel’s arguments, however, I was of the view that
                    the plaintiff’s case was a proper case for transfer to the High Court and
                    that he had shown sufficient cause for the transfer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The defendant’s first point was that the
                    plaintiff had not obtained proper medical evidence to demonstrate a material
                    change in his medical condition after the commencement of the action. The
                    defendant went into a somewhat detailed discussion of the various medical
                    reports on the plaintiff’s condition and the various doctors who had
                    treated the plaintiff. The basic point of the defendant was that the doctor
                    whose reports were relied on most by the plaintiff, Dr Ho, was not an
                    orthopaedic surgeon but a consultant anaesthesiologist. In the defendant’s
                    view, Dr Ho was not qualified to comment on the orthopaedic condition of
                    the plaintiff or to assess his condition. Much more weight had to be given to
                    the plaintiff’s own orthopaedic surgeon, Dr Sayampanathan, who stated in
                    March 2009 that the plaintiff’s back pain had resolved. The
                    defendant’s orthopaedic surgeon, Dr Chang, had come to the conclusion
                    that the plaintiff’s back injuries were not due to the accident but were
                    the result of age related degeneration. His view was that the procedures
                    recommended by Dr Ho were unnecessary, the plaintiff’s pain was not
                    consistent with the good recovery demonstrated by the x-rays and that the
                    plaintiff’s long term pain management treatment could lead to drug
                    dependency and serious side effects. The defendant also emphasised that there
                    was inadequate evidence supporting the plaintiff’s new claims for
                    impotency and depression. Dr Ho was not qualified to give a medical report
                    on these conditions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     I noted the defendant’s criticisms of
                    the medical evidence relied on by the plaintiff. I thought, however, that the
                    hearing of the application was not the correct forum to determine which
                    doctor’s evidence was more credible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     No doubt Dr Ho is not an orthopaedic surgeon
                    but he is a specialist in pain management and has issued several reports which
                    support the plaintiff’s stand that his condition deteriorated after he
                    commenced the action. Both Dr Ho and Dr Chang are well qualified medical
                    specialists, <em>albeit</em> in different areas and without
                    the benefit of cross-examination to determine exactly why they have come to the
                    differing conclusions evinced in their respective medical reports and the
                    benefit of analysis of their evidence and the logic and coherence of their
                    professional opinions, the court is not able to reach any conclusion on the true
                    physical condition and abilities of the plaintiff. I considered that there was,
                        <em>prima facie</em>, credible evidence to support the
                    plaintiff’s assertion of continuing disability leading to an inability to
                    return to work and a substantial loss of earnings. It may be that the plaintiff
                    is malingering as the defendant insinuates but such a determination can only be
                    made after a full hearing. In the meantime, even if I disregard the
                    plaintiff’s rather late complaints about impotency and depression, the
                    other conditions that he complained of would, if established, support a
                    quantification of damages which would exceed the District Court
                limit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I was therefore of the opinion that the
                    plaintiff had, <em>prima facie</em>, established the
                    material change in circumstances necessary to support his application for a
                    transfer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The defendant’s next point was that even
                    if I accepted that the plaintiff had suffered a material change in condition and
                    that there was a possibility that his claim would exceed the District Court
                    limit, on the authority of <em>Keppel Singmarine 2010</em>,
                    the mere existence of a sufficient reason would not automatically entitle the
                    plaintiff to have the proceedings transferred to the High Court. Instead, I
                    should undertake a holistic evaluation of all the material circumstances and
                    assess the prejudice that might be visited upon the party resisting the transfer
                    (see <em>Keppel Singmarine 2010</em> at
                [17]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In the present case, the defendant argued,
                    that in the holistic evaluation, I should take account of two points. The first
                    was that the plaintiff had clearly and irrevocably affirmed the jurisdiction of
                    the District Court. The second point was that the defendant would suffer
                    irretrievable prejudice if the transfer was allowed and he could not be
                    compensated by an order as to costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In respect of the first point, the defendant
                    noted that the plaintiff had not only entered consent interlocutory judgment but
                    had filed for a Notice of Appointment for Assessment of Damages twice. Further,
                    the plaintiff had obtained an order of court on 11 October 2011 which gave
                    further directions for the assessment of damages. Two hearings had been fixed.
                    The first had not gone on because the plaintiff had put forward new medical
                    reports and at the second tranche, the plaintiff had not prepared an opening
                    statement for the assessment, so it could not go on. The plaintiff had full
                    knowledge of his supposed material change in circumstances when he had taken the
                    various actions referred to earlier but had only applied on 17 May 2012 to
                    transfer the matter to the High Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     When I made the holistic evaluation of the
                    circumstances relating to the application, I considered that this point was the
                    strongest point made by the defendant. The plaintiff had clearly taken steps to
                    carry proceedings in the District Court beyond the entry of the interlocutory
                    judgment. The defendant had responded and also prepared for the assessment in
                    the District Court. In assessing the weight to be given to this factor, I also
                    took into account the consideration that the work done by both sides would be as
                    useful to an assessment in the High Court as it would have been to an assessment
                    in the District Court. The work was not, therefore, wasted. I also took account
                    of the fact that it was not wholly the plaintiff’s fault that both the
                    assessment hearings had not gone on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     As regards the first hearing, fixed on 17
                    August 2011, it did not go on because the defendant’s lawyer asked for the
                    date to be vacated on various grounds. The plaintiff had produced a
                    supplementary bundle of documents on his earnings which the defendant’s
                    lawyer had not seen and needed to take instructions on before cross-examining
                    him. Also, the defendant’s lawyers wanted the plaintiff to file a
                    supplementary affidavit-of-evidence in chief to exhibit two documents which had
                    been mentioned in his list of documents but were not included in his original
                    affidavit-of-evidence in chief. In any case, the hearing had been fixed for only
                    one morning because at the time of fixing, the plaintiff had not undergone
                    medical examination by the defendant’s medical specialist and
                    defendant’s counsel had worked on the basis that the plaintiff would be
                    cross-examined first and the doctors would be produced at a further hearing.
                    Therefore, he was not able to deal with the plaintiff’s doctors at that
                    hearing. I note that in any case the assessment hearing could not have been
                    completed on 17 August 2011 since only half a day had been allocated on the
                    basis that the medical evidence would be adduced later. The defendant’s
                    medical evidence was not even ready then.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     As for the second hearing, the
                    plaintiff’s evidence was that it was vacated because of the new evidence
                    produced at the last moment by the defendant. This assertion was contained in Mr
                    Ramakrishnan’s affidavit. The defendant did not deny that on affidavit. At
                    the hearing, his counsel submitted that the 11 May 2012 hearing was
                    adjourned because the plaintiff had not prepared an opening statement for the
                    assessment. There was no evidence that that was the main reason for the
                    adjournment. I think it highly unlikely that the court would vacate a date
                    simply because an opening statement had not been prepared especially in a case
                    like the present which contains no novel questions of law but turns on facts and
                    medical opinion. In the case of the second hearing, it appeared to me that the
                    responsibility for the vacation of the date had to be laid at the
                    defendant’s door.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Moving on to the point about prejudice, the
                    defendant submitted that both parties had agreed to proceed on the basis that
                    the damages to be awarded would be circumscribed by the jurisdiction of the
                    District Court. To re-open a consent interlocutory judgment without showing
                    sufficient reason for the transfer of proceeding would prejudice the defendant
                    as the plaintiff would be re-litigating the maximum quantum payable by taking
                    the matter to the High Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     It seemed to me that the above argument was
                    stating the obvious. If there was no sufficient reason for the transfer, then
                    the defendant would be prejudiced. If there was sufficient reason for the
                    transfer, then the defendant could not argue that he would be prejudiced even if
                    the result of the transfer would mean that the damages eventually paid by the
                    defendant came up to more than the District Court limit. Therefore, the
                    defendant was essentially saying that he would be prejudiced by a transfer. This
                    argument was not open to the defendant. The prejudice that he had to establish
                    could not be simply the fact that the transfer would lead to a higher damages
                    award. If the defendant’s argument were to be the law then no case of this
                    kind could ever be transferred to the High Court. In <em>Keppel
                        Singmarine 2010</em>, the Court of Appeal found that the appellant in
                    that case would be prejudiced by the transfer of the proceedings to the High
                    Court but it emphasised at [17] that the “prejudice” suffered by
                    the appellant was <em>not</em> simply that the damages
                    awarded could exceed the District Court jurisdictional limit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In <em>Keppel Singmarine
                        2010</em>, the Court of Appeal considered it as a significant
                    consideration that the appellant’s insurers in that case had, after the
                    interlocutory judgment was entered, set aside only a reserve of $250,000
                    pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. In
                    this case, there was no evidence of any similar reserve or any particular
                    prejudice that the defendant or his insurers would suffer by reason of the
                    transfer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The only possible prejudice which the
                    defendant was able to point to was his inability to recover costs from the
                    plaintiff as the plaintiff is legally aided. Counsel submitted that even if the
                    court were minded to consider that the prejudice suffered by the defendant could
                    somehow be compensated by an order as to costs, such an order could not be made
                    in view of the plaintiff’s status. I did not find this argument convincing
                    either. To accept it would mean that legally aided litigants could never apply
                    for a transfer of their proceedings from the District Court to the High Court no
                    matter how good their reasons were because the defendant could not ask for a
                    costs order to compensate him. I did not accept that this would be the proper
                    principle to implement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I noted that in <em>Keppel
                        Singmarine 2010</em>, the Court of Appeal took the view that even if
                    the proceedings were transferred on the condition that the consent order was to
                    be set aside, the appellant would be prejudiced by the transfer because the
                    parties might have to re-litigate their respective liabilities. In that case,
                    the application to transfer proceedings was made six to seven years after the
                    date on which the accident took place and the Court considered that many
                    practical difficulties might arise if the issue of liability had to be
                    reopened.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In this case, however, at the time of the
                    hearing less than four years had elapsed since the accident. Although the time
                    lapse was not ideal, there was no evidence that it had led to any particular
                    difficulty in conducting the litigation. Further, the defendant did not submit
                    that any particular practical problem would be encountered in re-litigating the
                    case if the consent order were to be set aside. Indeed, it was the
                    defendant’s submission that if the court were minded to allow the transfer
                    to the High Court, the consent interlocutory judgment <em>must</em> be unravelled and the issue of liability be reopened and
                    re-litigated in view of the defendant’s increased exposure to a much
                    larger claim for damages. The circumstances here were, therefore, different from
                    those in <em>Keppel Singmarine 2010</em> and this element
                    of prejudice did not exist in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     On an overall consideration of the
                    circumstances, I was satisfied that the plaintiff had established sufficient
                    cause to support a transfer of the case to the High Court. I was also satisfied
                    that there was no good reason why the court’s discretion should not be
                    exercised in favour of the plaintiff. I considered that any prejudice that the
                    defendant might sustain by reason of the transfer would be adequately met by
                    setting aside the consent judgment so that the defendant could re-litigate the
                    extent to which he was liable for the accident. The defendant was not able to
                    satisfy me that he would be irretrievably prejudiced in any way by the
                    transfer.</p>
