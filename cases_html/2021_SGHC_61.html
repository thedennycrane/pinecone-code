Party autonomy allows parties a wide latitude to agree on almost all aspects of how a dispute is to be arbitrated. In the context of a multi-party contract, that autonomy may include the ability to agree on <span class="font-italic">who</span> may be party to an arbitration reference in the event a dispute arises.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Underpinning the principle of party autonomy is the fundamental principle of consent or agreement of the parties. Thus, in an area of dispute resolution where consent plays such a central role, the notion of a “forced joinder” of a party would appear somewhat out of place and, some might say, anathema to the very definition of consent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Certain institutional arbitration rules do, however, empower an arbitral tribunal to order a forced joinder of third parties in certain circumstances. Among these are the London Court of International Arbitration Rules 2014 (“<span class="font-weight-bold">LCIA Rules</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> 2014</span>”). I refer in particular to Article 22.1(viii) of the LCIA Rules 2014.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 In this regard, a “forced joinder” refers to a third party consenting to be joined as a party to extant arbitration proceedings on the application of one of the arbitrants <span class="font-italic">despite</span> objections to the joinder raised by <span class="font-italic">the other </span><span class="font-italic">arbitrant(s)</span>. Thus, notwithstanding the impression given by the phrase, a “forced joinder” does not in fact refer to forcing a third party to join an arbitration against its wishes. Nevertheless, the application of a forced joinder has been viewed as a significant derogation from the principle of party autonomy and consent (see, for example, the Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">PT First Media TBK (formerly known as PT Broadband Multimedia TBK v Astro Nusantara International BV and others and another appeal </span>[2014] 1 SLR 372 (“<span class="font-italic">PT First Media</span>”) at<span class="font-italic"> </span>[188]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The application before me in Originating Summons No 1446 of 2019 (“<span class="font-weight-bold">OS 1446</span>”) raised interesting issues revolving around the proper interpretation and ambit of Article 22.1(viii) of the LCIA Rules 2014. As there is sparse authority on forced joinders in general and Article 22.1(viii) of the LCIA Rules 2014 in particular, this case presents a good opportunity to consider the issues in greater detail. I thus provide the full grounds for my decision. I start by summarising the material facts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The plaintiff is CJD (“<span class="font-weight-bold">p</span><span class="font-weight-bold">laintiff</span>”).

The Tribunal considers that the Respondent is correct to say that the Tribunal has the power to allow a third party to be joined in the arbitration if an existing party applies for joinder and if the third-party consents in writing to be joined. The Tribunal also considers that the Respondent is correct to say that such consent may be given in the arbitration clause itself, or in a document made after the arbitration has commenced. These two points are clear from the wording of Article 22 of the LCIA Rules.

Competence of arbitral tribunal to rule on its jurisdiction</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) The arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement. For that purpose, an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. A decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail <span class="font-italic">ipso jure</span> the invalidity of the arbitration clause.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) A plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised not later than the submission of the statement of defence. A party is not precluded from raising such a plea by the fact that he has appointed, or participated in the appointment of, an arbitrator. A plea that the arbitral tribunal is exceeding the scope of its authority shall be raised as soon as the matter alleged to be beyond the scope of its authority is raised during the arbitral proceedings. The arbitral tribunal may, in either case, admit a later plea if it considers the delay justified.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) The arbitral tribunal may rule on a plea referred to in paragraph (2) of this Article either as a preliminary question or in an award on the merits. If the arbitral tribunal rules as a preliminary question that it has jurisdiction, any party may request, within thirty days after having received notice of that ruling, the court specified in Article 6 to decide the matter, which decision shall be subject to no appeal; while such a request is pending, the arbitral tribunal may continue the arbitral proceedings and make an award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In Singapore, both Article 16 of the Model Law and s 10 of the IAA allow the High Court to review a tribunal’s determination regarding its jurisdiction. However, unlike Article 16 of the Model Law which allows the High Court to review only a positive ruling by a tribunal on its jurisdiction, s 10 of the IAA was enacted by Parliament to allow the High Court to review both positive and negative rulings (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(9 April 2012) vol 89 at 65 (K Shanmugam, Minister for Law) and <span class="font-italic">Rakna</span><span class="font-italic"> Arakshaka Lanka Ltd v Avant Garde Maritime Services (Pte) Ltd </span>[2019] 2 SLR 131 (“<span class="font-italic">Rakna</span>”) at [52]). Section 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) in particular applies where a tribunal makes a ruling that it has no jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In contrast, s 24 of the IAA applies only to an “award”. This is defined in s 2 of the IAA as referring to “a decision of the arbitral tribunal on the substance of the dispute and includes any interim, interlocutory or partial award but excludes any orders or directions made under section 12”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 This distinction is important because following <span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Asuransi Jasa Indonesia (Persero) v Dexia Bank SA </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 597 (“<span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Asuransi</span>”), it is clear that the definition of an award does not include a negative determination or ruling on jurisdiction. This is because such a determination or ruling is not a decision on the substance of the dispute. On the contrary, it is a decision <span class="font-weight-bold">not</span> to determine the substance of the dispute (<span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Asuransi</span> at [66]). Thus, in the context of OS 1446, as the Decision was not an “award”, s 24 of the IAA would not apply. Indeed, both parties were in agreement that the Decision was not an award as defined in the IAA.

</div> In a similar vein, the objection raised by the 2nd defendant would also fall within s 10(2) of the IAA – this was because it was a plea, raised during the Arbitration, that the Tribunal “has no jurisdiction” to join the 2nd defendant as a party to the Arbitration. I was therefore satisfied that there was indeed a “plea” that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction, which the Tribunal had ruled on in the Decision. Section 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA was therefore engaged. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I add that my decision above is consistent with the approach taken by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Rakna</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [56]–[57] that an objection or “plea” on a tribunal’s jurisdiction need not be in any specified form. There is also nothing in the wording of s 10(2) of the IAA that limits the application of that provision only to instances where the “plea” of the lack of jurisdiction is raised by the party applying to the High Court to decide the matter. On the contrary, s 10 expressly states that “<span class="font-weight-bold">any party</span> may, within 30 days after having received notice of that ruling, apply to the High Court to decide the matter” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Decision was a negative determination on jurisdiction </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 It is settled law that the true nature of a ruling by a tribunal is determined by its substance and not its form. The mere titling of a document as an award (or in this case a “Decision on the [plaintiff’s] Joinder Application”) does not render it as such (<span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Asuransi </span>at [70]–[71]; see also the Court of Appeal’s approach in <span class="font-italic">Rakna</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [59]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In this case, the Tribunal had indicated in its separate partial award on jurisdiction and preliminary applications dated 8 October 2019 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the first of the three applications referred to above at [15]) that it would be issuing “one or more Procedural Orders” in respect of the Joinder Application and the application relating to security for costs. Nevertheless, it is evident that the Decision concerned, in substance, a ruling by the Tribunal on its <span class="font-italic">jurisdiction</span> to order a joinder of the 2nd defendant to the Arbitration<span class="font-italic">. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In considering the plaintiff’s request to join the 2nd defendant to the Arbitration, the Tribunal referred expressly to Article 22.1(viii) of the LCIA Rules 2014 which provides that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Arbitral Tribunal shall have the power, upon the application of any party or (save for sub-paragraphs (viii) …) upon its own initiative, but in either cases only after giving the parties a reasonable opportunity to state their views and upon such terms (as to costs and otherwise) as the Arbitral Tribunal may decide:  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(viii) to allow one or more third persons to be joined in the arbitration as a party provided any such third person and the applicant party have consented to such joinder in writing following the Commencement Date or (if earlier) in the Arbitration Agreement; and thereafter to make a single final award, or separate awards, in respect of all parties so implicated in the arbitration; </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The Tribunal considered that its powers to effect a joinder under Article 22.1(viii) were premised on the fulfilment of two “‘threshold requirements’, without which the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to allow joinder”. Firstly, an existing party to the Arbitration must apply for joinder, and secondly, the third party must consent in writing to be joined (Decision at para 126). It dismissed the Joinder Application on the basis that the second threshold requirement had not been met, namely, the 2nd defendant had not consented in writing to being joined to the Arbitration (Decision at para 130). It also declined to consider any arguments that were, in its view, related to the merits of the Joinder Application as it was not “entitled to take [them] into consideration” (Decision at para 131).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Adopting the approach in <span class="font-italic">Rakna</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [59] and <span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Asuransi </span>at [71], I was satisfied that the Decision was, in substance, a ruling by the Tribunal on its jurisdiction. It was also a negative ruling in light of the Tribunal’s refusal to join the 2nd defendant to the Arbitration. In the circumstances, only s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA was applicable (not Article 16 of the Model Law) and which enabled <span class="font-italic">any party</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>to apply to the High Court within 30 days of the Decision for the court to decide the issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Both parties made clear in their submissions (both written and oral) and <span class="font-italic">aides memoire </span>that their primary position was that the Decision was <span class="font-italic">not</span> an award. I agree. The Tribunal had taken pains to make it explicit that the Decision “[was] not an award” and was “made without prejudice to, and does not purport to address, the substantive issues in dispute” in the Arbitration (Decision at paras 135 and 139). It is also plain from the Decision that the Tribunal did not touch on any aspect of the merits of the dispute in rendering the Decision. As noted at [28] above, the Decision does not fall within the definition of an “award” that could be set aside under s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA. In the circumstances, I did not have to consider the plaintiff’s alternative prayer any further. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">There was no consent in writing by the 2nd defendant to being joined  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 A tribunal’s own view of its jurisdiction has no legal or evidential value before a court that has to determine that very question.

OS 1446 thus hinged on whether the second or third permutations had been met. Drilling further down, it was also not in dispute that the plaintiff, as the applying party, had (quite obviously) consented in writing to the 2nd defendant being joined. Its application to the Tribunal would constitute consent in writing of the applying party, after the Commencement Date, to the 2nd defendant being joined. The crux was whether the <span class="font-italic">2</span><span class="font-italic">nd defendant</span>, by virtue of it having signed the Joint Venture Agreement and being a party to the arbitration agreement in clause 36.3, had also thereby <span class="font-italic">consent</span><span class="font-italic">ed in writing</span> <span class="font-italic">to be</span><span class="font-italic">ing joined</span> as a party to the Arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I answered this question in the negative. Fundamentally, I disagreed with the plaintiff’s contention that simply being a signatory and party to the Joint Venture Agreement and therefore, the arbitration agreement, was sufficient in and of itself to constitute consent by the 2nd defendant <span class="font-italic">in writing </span><span class="font-italic">to being joined</span> in any arbitral reference involving any of the other parties to the Joint Venture Agreement. I disagreed with this argument for two reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 First, the plain wording of Article 22.1(viii) does not lend itself to such an interpretation. The provision refers to the consent by the third person “<span class="font-italic">to such joinder</span><span class="font-italic"> in writing</span>…” being contained “in the Arbitration Agreement” if such consent was given earlier than the Commencement Date [emphasis added]. There is no mention in the rule of the requisite consent in writing being found simply by being a party to an arbitration agreement no matter how generally worded. That rule could quite easily have been drafted in those terms if indeed that was the intent of the drafters of the LCIA Rules 2014. It would, in my view, involve a strained and unnatural reading of Article 22.1(viii) to hold that the requisite consent in writing <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">to be</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ing joined</span> existed simply by virtue of the third person having signed the contract containing the arbitration agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Such a broad reading of “consent” would mean that so long as a proposed joinder party was party to a contract containing an arbitration agreement incorporating the LCIA Rules 2014, it could be joined to any ongoing arbitration involving other parties to the contract at any point, regardless of its views on the matter. In my view, this is problematic for two reasons. Firstly, the joinder party would be forced to live in a state of uncertainty as to whether it would be called upon to defend itself or advance claims in the ongoing arbitration from the commencement of the arbitration till its eventual conclusion. Such a joinder could also conceivably occur at any point in the arbitral proceedings, including, after the close of pleadings or the evidentiary hearings. Second, the joinder party might well be deprived of the opportunity to nominate or participate in the selection of its own arbitrator if it was indeed joined to the arbitration. Such an outcome would represent a significant derogation from the fundamental requirement of party autonomy in international commercial arbitration.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I also noted that no authority was cited by the plaintiff where a tribunal or a court has concluded that under Article 22.1(viii) of the LCIA Rules 2014 or other equivalent arbitral rules, the consent of a third party in writing to being joined could be found simply by virtue of that third person being a party to, and having signed the contract containing the arbitration agreement, without more.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Second, it is of course entirely possible and, consistent with the freedom conferred by party autonomy, that an arbitration agreement could be drafted in terms that clearly and unambiguously stipulate that a third person (by being a party to the contract and the arbitration agreement contained therein) thereby also signifies its consent in writing to being joined as a party in any arbitral reference between any of the other parties to the arbitration agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In my view, clause 36.3 of the Joint Venture Agreement did not contain any such clear and unambiguous wording. It bears emphasising that the very idea of a forced joinder in the context of arbitration is considered a drastic one (see <span class="font-italic">PT First Media </span>at [188] and [197]). Therefore, in a multi-party contract such as the present, the wording of both the relevant rule in the LCIA Rules 2014 <span class="font-italic">and</span> the arbitration agreement must be clear and unambiguous in (a) empowering an arbitral tribunal to allow a forced joinder, and (b) containing or evidencing the express consent in writing to such joinder by the third person proposed to be joined (<span class="font-italic">PT First Media</span> at [177] and [197]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 On the one hand, the wording of Article 22.1(viii) clearly empowers an arbitral tribunal to permit a joinder of a third person based on the relevant parties’ consent in writing “to such joinder” being contained in the arbitration agreement itself. However, the wording of clause 36.3 of the Joint Venture Agreement on the other does not, in my judgment, contain the necessary clear and unambiguous consent in writing of the 2nd defendant to being joined to the Arbitration between the 1st defendant and the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Mr David Chan, counsel for the defendants submitted that, in effect, the plaintiff was (despite its submissions to the contrary) seeking to persuade this court to <span class="font-italic">infer</span> consent in writing by virtue of the 2nd defendant having signed the Joint Venture Agreement and thereby being a party to it and the arbitration agreement contained therein.

</div>
</div>
</div> Mr Chan also contended that even if such consent could be inferred on the facts, that was insufficient for purposes of Article 22.1(viii). I agreed with the defendants’ submissions. It is clear that for Article 22.1(viii) to be triggered, the consent of the third person to being joined must be <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">express</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">in writing</span>. Therefore, even assuming, <span class="font-italic">arguendo</span>, that consent could be implied or inferred in this case by virtue of the 2nd defendant being a party to the Joint Venture Agreement and the arbitration agreement, it would, in my view, still not be enough to meet the threshold requirements of Article 22.1(viii) of the LCIA Rules 2014. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 As for the plaintiff’s contention that the 2nd defendant’s conduct could be taken as suggesting that it had consented to the joinder, this was clearly a non-starter for the same reasons laid out at [55]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 For the reasons above, I found that the Tribunal did not err in dismissing the Joinder Application. I agreed with the Tribunal’s reasoning at paragraphs 127 and 128 of the Decision as reproduced at [17] above. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The doctrine of double separability </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 My conclusion above was sufficient to dispose of OS 1446. However, the defendants had a second arrow in their quiver which would also, in my view, be determinative of OS 1446. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 That second arrow was the doctrine of “double separability”. As noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">PT First Media</span> at [166], the doctrine of double separability distinguishes between the original arbitration contract between the parties and the <span class="font-italic">separate</span> contract that arises between the arbitrants to a dispute in a particular arbitration reference. It is because the third person (who may be a party to the <span class="font-italic">original</span> arbitration contract) is a stranger to the <span class="font-italic">second</span> contract that arises between the arbitrants in the arbitration reference that the third person’s consent to being joined is required, and indeed, essential (<span class="font-italic">PT First Media </span>at [166]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In <span class="font-italic">PT First Media, </span>the Court of Appeal was concerned with the question of whether r 24(b) of the 2007 Singapore International Arbitration Centre Rules (“SIAC Rules 2007”) allowed the tribunal to join parties that were not parties to the underlying contract or the arbitration agreement contained therein. For context, the said rule gives an arbitral tribunal the power to “allow other parties to be joined in the arbitration with their express consent, and make a single final award determining all disputes among the parties to the arbitration”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The Court of Appeal held at [192] that the words “other parties” referred to “other parties to the agreement to arbitrate who are not yet party to the arbitration reference”. It also provided a hypothetical example to illustrate the utility of r 24(b) of the SIAC Rules 2007 in the course of its analysis (at [192]–[193]) as follows:  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">192 … r 24(b) would very much serve a useful purpose. It is not difficult to imagine, for example, a tripartite commercial transaction involving A, B and C with all three parties agreeing to submit any disputes inter se to arbitration. Separate disputes between A and B and A and C then arise in short succession. A and B may have already formally commenced arbitration in respect of their dispute. When the dispute between A and C is sought to be resolved, A has two options. The first is to have a separate arbitration to resolve its dispute with C. The other option would be for A to apply in the arbitration between itself and B, for C to be joined into that arbitration. The efficacy of such joinder is palpable, and r 24(b) serves that useful function …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">193 It is also sensible that only C’s consent would be required in such circumstances, given that all three parties would already have consented to the same arbitration agreement. Mr Landau uses the same factual matrix to demonstrate how it is precisely because of the doctrine of ‘double separability’ that recourse to r 24(b) would be necessary for C to be joined to an arbitration between A and B. As the arbitration reference for the first arbitration between A and B had already been constituted, a procedural mechanism for C to be joined would be necessary, notwithstanding that C had agreed, through the arbitration agreement, to arbitrate its disputes with A and/or B (see <span class="font-italic">Syska</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [166] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In this regard, the hypothetical example above broadly resembles the situation that presented itself in OS 1446. C would, broadly, be equated with the 2nd defendant, with A being the plaintiff and B the 1st defendant. Therefore, <span class="font-italic">despite</span> C (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> the 2nd defendant) already being a party to the arbitration agreement, C’s consent to <span class="font-italic">being joined</span> in an arbitration between A (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> the plaintiff) and B (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> the 1st defendant) would <span class="font-italic">still</span> be required. Drawing on the example above, merely being a party to the arbitration agreement contained in clause 36.3 of the Joint Venture Agreement was <span class="font-italic">not</span>, in and of itself, sufficient to signal consent in writing from the 2nd defendant to being joined and being made party to that second contract between the 1st defendant and plaintiff arising out of the arbitration reference in the Arbitration. I found this argument persuasive and it was one which the plaintiff was unable to respond to satisfactorily.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 As for the objections raised by the plaintiff that the Tribunal should have considered its arguments that the 2nd defendant was, in essence, the real party to the Joint Venture Agreement and the 1st defendant was merely its agent, I was of the view that these arguments had no merit and I had no hesitation rejecting them. They amounted, in substance, to an invitation that this court pierce (or at the minimum, look behind) the corporate veil, which was something I was not prepared to do based on affidavit evidence. In any event, these arguments potentially raised issues that involved the law of Narnia as the law governing the Joint Venture Agreement (on which no evidence was led). More importantly, the arguments raised by the plaintiff seemed to impinge on the underlying dispute and its merits, which this court had no business traversing in the context of this application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Finally, I add that the dismissal of this application would not cause any material prejudice to the plaintiff. The plaintiff would not be without recourse or be deprived of an opportunity to bring the 2nd defendant into the arena in order to advance a claim against it. On the contrary, the plaintiff had already intimated, in its Statement of Defence and Counterclaim filed in the Arbitration, its intention to issue a separate request for arbitration against the 2nd defendant, and have those proceedings consolidated with the Arbitration. That is a course of action entirely within the plaintiff’s rights under the arbitration agreement in the Joint Venture Agreement.
