<p xmlns=""><font color="#3322AA" size="4"><strong>Judgment:</strong></font></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p></p></font>1.  In the late seventies, Sri Jaya (Sdn) Bhd ("Sri Jaya") borrowed

considerable sums of money from RHB Bank Bhd ("RHB")  at that time known as

"United Malayan Banking Corpn Bhd"  to purchase and develop two blocks of flats on

a piece of land at Paya Lebar ("the said property"). As Sri Jaya was unable to repay these

loans in full, RHB - in Suit No. 5904 of 1983 - commenced legal proceedings against Sri Jaya. This

suit was concluded on 2 October 1991 when a consent judgment was entered against Sri Jaya. By that

judgment ("the 1991 judgment") the court ordered the sale of the said property was

obtained and the judgment went on to state:

<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"<u>AND BY CONSENT IT IS THIS DAY ADJUDGED</u> that judgment be

    entered for the Plaintiffs against the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendants as follows:-</p>
<p align="justify">(1) The sum of $2,838,508.36 and interest thereon at 11.25% per annum on the

    first $1,400,000.00 and 12.50% per annum on the excess over $1,400,000.00 from the 18<sup>th</sup>

    November 1983 to judgment and under paragraph 2 of the Statement of Claim less all proceeds

    received from the sale of the said properties if and when sold."</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">RHB thereafter sold the said property for $6.5 million. The sale was completed on

31 August 1994.</p>
<p xmlns="">2.  After the sale, RHB  on 18 January 1995  sent a letter to Sri Jaya informing Sri

Jaya that after taking into account the sale proceeds there was, as at 5 January 1995, still a

shortfall of $795,087.19 on which interest would run at $170.63 per day from 6 January 1995.</p>
<p xmlns="">3.  Sri Jaya  in Suit No. 253/99  commenced proceedings against RHB for negligence in

handling the sale of the said property and, on 29 December 2000, obtained judgment in its favour.

The effect of the judgment was that:

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(1)    RHB had to pay Sri Jaya an additional $3.19 million over

  and above the $6.5 million that the said property was     sold for;</p>
<p align="justify">(2)    RHB was entitled to deduct the outstanding amount still

  due to RHB under the 1991 judgment from the $3.19      million; and</p>
<p align="justify">(3)    RHB was to pay Sri Jaya interest on the balance due to

  Sri Jaya at the rate of 3% per annum from the date of the writ.</p>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">RHB was also ordered to pay the costs of Sri Jaya.</p>
<p xmlns="">4.  In the course of the trial in Suit No. 253/99, the letter from RHB to Sri Jaya dated 18

January 1995 referred to above was produced but as the issue in Suit No. 253/99 related solely to

the negligence or otherwise of RHB in the conduct of the sale, the question of whether that letter

reflected the true entitlement of RHB was not gone into.</p>
<p xmlns="">5.  After obtaining the judgment in Suit No. 253/99, when the parties addressed themselves

to the issue of what the outstanding balance due under the 1991 judgment was, differences of opinion

arose as to (a) whether the pre-judgment interest payable under that 1991 judgment was to be on

a compound or simple interest basis; and (b) whether the post-judgment interest payable on the 1991

judgment was to be calculated on the principal sum alone or the principal sum plus interest payable

up to the date of the 1991 judgment. To resolve these differences, Sri Jaya commenced this

originating summons.</p>
<p xmlns="">6.  I ruled that under the 1991 judgment, pre-judgment interest was to be calculated on a

simple interest basis and post-judgment interest should be calculated on the composite sum of

principal plus interest up to the date of the judgment. RHB was dissatisfied with my decision and

has appealed. I now give my grounds.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><u><b>Simple interest or compound interest</b></u>.</p>
<p xmlns="">7.  RHBs claim that they were entitled to compound interest under the 1991 judgment was

based on the fact that the mortgage documents pursuant to which the loans were extended to Sri Jaya

stipulated compound interest. Relying on the case of <i>Diversey (Far East) Pte Ltd v Chai

Chung Ching Chester &amp; Ors</i> <nobr>[1993] 1 SLR 535</nobr>, Mr Tan Bar Tien (acting for RHB) submitted that

the court, in construing the meaning to be given to the words in a judgment, can look into the

documents underlying the judgment. He also submitted that it was normal practice for bankers to

charge compound interest and the courts should give effect to this practice.</p>
<p xmlns="">8.  Mr Denis Tan (who appeared for Sri Jaya) submitted that if RHB had wanted Sri Jaya to

pay the contractual interest stipulated in the mortgage document, RHB should have, in its pleadings,

specifically asked for that contractual interest. He pointed out that in this case not only had RHB

failed to raise the claim for compound interest in its pleadings, it had also obtained a consent

judgment that did not contain that stipulation. Mr Denis Tan submitted that as the 1991 judgment

did not mandate compound interest, only simple interest was payable.</p>
<p xmlns="">9 . Where a party seeks interest at a contractual rate it is incumbent on that party to raise

that claim in its pleadings. I accepted Mr Denis Tans submission that in the absence of such a

claim, there was no basis for the court to grant contractual interest. There was another

feature in this case that negated RHBs position. The 1991 judgment was a consent judgment. In

other words, the parties had mutually agreed to settle their disputes on the terms contained in the

consent judgment. In those mutually agreed terms, whilst there was reference to interest being

payable, there was no reference to interest being paid on a compounded basis. The only reasonable

conclusion that one could draw from the fact that the terms do not specify compound interest is that

it was not the intention of the parties, in asking for the consent order, that compound interest

would be payable. For the court to rule otherwise would mean that the court is re-writing the

agreement reached between the parties. I therefore rejected RHBs claim that the interest under

the 1991 judgment should be on a compound interest basis and ruled that the 1991 judgment mandated

interest only on a simple interest basis.</p>
<p xmlns="">10. The case of <i>Diversey</i> relied on by RHB can be distinguished on the facts. In that case,

the parties had entered into a formal settlement agreement and the consent judgment subsequently

obtained specifically referred to that settlement agreement. In those circumstances, the court held

that the judgment order and the settlement agreement should be read together. In the present case,

the consent judgment itself was the settlement agreement. The consent judgment did not refer to any

other document. There was therefore no justification for the court to look at any other document to

ascertain or clarify the terms of the consent judgment.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><u><b>Post-judgment interest</b></u>.</p>
<p xmlns="">11. RHB did not, for the post-judgment period in respect of the 1991 judgment, seek interest on a

compounded basis. Mr Tan Bar Tien accepted that for this period Sri Jaya should pay the (simple)

interest prescribed under Order 42 rule 12. The parties were agreed that the prescribed rate at the

relevant time was 8% per annum. The only issue raised with regard to post-judgment interest was

whether interest should be calculated on the basis of the principal sum alone or whether it should

be calculated on the principal sum together with the interest payable thereon up to the date of

judgment ("the composite sum").</p>
<p xmlns="">12. Mr Denis Tan, relying on s 9 of the Civil Law Act (Ch 43, 1994 Ed) ("the Act"),

submitted that post-judgment interest should be payable only in respect of the principal sum.

Section 9 of the Act (now s 12) provided as follows:

</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify">9. - In any proceedings tried in any court of record for the recovery of any

  debt or damages, the court may, if it thinks fit, order that there shall be included in the sum

  for which judgment is given interest at such rate as it thinks fit on the whole or any part of the

  debt or damages for the whole or any part of the period between the date when the cause of action

  arose and the date of the judgment.</p>
<p align="justify">Provided that nothing in this section </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) shall authorise the giving of interest upon interest;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) shall apply in relation to any debt upon which interest is payable as of

    right whether by virtue of  any agreement  or otherwise; or</p>
<p align="justify">(c)  (not relevant).</p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Mr Denis Tan submitted that the award of interest, under Order 42 rule 12, on the

composite sum would amount to giving interest upon interest and be a breach of s 9(2) of the Act.</p>
<p xmlns="">13. I could not accept that submission. To begin with, s 9(1) of the Act related to the payment

of interest for the period "between the date when the cause of action arose and the date of the

judgment". That section therefore concerned itself only with interest in respect of the

pre-judgment period and not the post-judgment period. Mr Denis Tans submission on s 9(1) of the

Act would therefore be germane to the award of pre-judgment interest (considered above). It is

relevant to note, in that context, that sub-section (2)(b) of s 9 preserves, in respect of the

pre-judgment period, any contractual rights to interest that the parties may have agreed on.</p>
<p xmlns="">14. The applicable provision, insofar as post-judgment interest is concerned, was Order 42 rule

12 of the Rules of Court. Under those provisions, every judgment debt (unless otherwise agreed by

the parties) carried interest at the prescribed rate from the date of judgment until the judgment is

satisfied. The question to ask therefore is: what was the judgment debt? Once the judgment debt is

established, interest is payable on that judgment debt in accordance with Order 42 rule 12.

As at the date of the 1991 judgment, the judgment debt was the principal sum plus the interest

payable thereon under the judgment, ie the composite sum. I therefore held that the post-judgment

interest payable in this case under Order 42 rule 12 was 8% per annum on the composite sum.<font size="4"></font></p>
