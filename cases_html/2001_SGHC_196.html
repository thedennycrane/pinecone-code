<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><strong><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Grounds of Decision</font></strong></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1. This was an appeal (in Registrars Appeal No. 56 of 2001) against the

learned Assistant Registrars decision on 28 March 2001 in Suit No. S595 of 2000/H refusing to

grant a stay of proceedings on the ground of <i>forum non conveniens</i>. I dismissed the appeal on

17 April 2001 and the defendant has now appealed against my decision (in Civil Appeal No. 600060 of

2001).</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><strong>The facts</strong></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2. This was a claim by the plaintiff (Yuninshing) against the defendant (Mondong)

for damages of US$530,000 arising from an alleged breach of a foreign exchange contract.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3. Both parties are Indonesian nationals; they are also related in that Mondong

is the uncle of Yuninshing. The claim arose out of an oral agreement reached in a conversation

between the parties sometime in June 1999, at the home of Yuninshings parents in Surabaya,

Indonesia. At that time, Yuninshing desired to buy US dollars to deposit into her Singapore account,

while Mondong wished to convert US dollars in Singapore to Indonesian Rupiahs in his Jakarta

account. It struck them that by entering into a direct exchange agreement, they would save on the

exchange rate in the open forex market.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4. The arrangement worked well initially and transactions took place between June

1999 to mid-November 1999 without any problems. During this period, Yuninshing remitted sums in

Indonesian Rupiahs (IR) from her accounts with Bank Central Asia and Bank Danamon in Surabaya, to

Mondongs accounts in the Jakarta branches of the respective banks. In return, Mondong would

usually fax her a telegraphic transfer application form showing the corresponding remittance in US

dollars into her Singapore account with Republic Central Bank (RCB) or N M Rothschild &amp; Sons

(Rothschilds). Such telegraphic transfers were done via Thomas Cook Travel Services Pte Ltd

(Thomas Cook), HBZ International Exchange (HBZ), and Christiana Bank, Singapore (Christiana Bank),

depending on which had the most attractive prevailing rate, and also via Dutair &amp; Sea Cargo

Services Pte Ltd (Dutair Singapore), a company controlled by Mondong. On certain occasions, when

Mondong had bank-notes to exchange, cash payments in US dollars would also be made to Yuninshings

representive, Mr Ko Ahok, in Jakarta.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5. The subject of Yuninshings claim was the following two sums of monies which

were deposited into Mondongs account:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) IR 2,047,400,000 (equivalent to US$290,000), deposited on 25 November 1999;

  and<br/>

  (b) IR 1,722,000,000 (equivalent of US$240,000), deposited on 29 November 1999.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6. After these deposits were made, Mondong faxed to Yuninshing two telegraphic

transfer application forms from Thomas Cook indicating the remittance of the sums into her

Rothschilds account. However, the plaintiff was later informed by Rothschilds and Thomas Cook

that no such remittances had been made. Yuninshing therefore claimed that Mondong had failed to

remit to her account the sum of US$530,000, equivalent to IR 3,769,400,000, which was the combined

total of the two deposits.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7. Yuninshing filed this claim against Mondong on 7 August 2000. The first round

of proceedings was however largely unfruitful. Mondong entered an appearance on 25 September 2000

and took out an application for inter alia, a declaration that the Singapore courts had no

jurisdiction to hear the matter. The application was allowed by the learned Assistant Registrar on 9

January 2001, but the order was subsequently set aside by consent on 30 January 2001 (in Registrars

Appeal No. 9 of 2001).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8. In the second round of proceedings that followed, Mondong sought, inter alia,

a stay of proceedings on the ground that Singapore was not the appropriate forum to try the matter.

The application was heard by the learned Assistant Registrar on 28 March 2001. She refused to grant

a stay on the ground of <i>forum non conveniens </i>and ordered costs against Mondong. It was

against her decision (which I affirmed) that Mondong lodged the present appeal.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><strong><br/>

Preliminary Issues</strong></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9. There were three preliminary issues which I took into consideration in

determining this appeal:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) Firstly, Mondong had in the interim commenced legal proceedings in the

  District Court of Surabaya on 19 March 2001 (Register Case Number: 141/Pdt.G/2001/PN). In those

  proceedings, he claimed that he had overpaid Yuninshing and that it was the latter who in fact

  owed him IR 1,250,450,000 from the series of transactions. The Surabaya action was however quite

  inexplicably revoked upon Mondongs request on 11 April 2001.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) Secondly, it was noteworthy that the Surabaya proceedings constituted the

  conclusion of a series of vacillating defences advanced by Mondong. These defences were relevant

  as they indicated the type of evidence required in the main action itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10. Initially, Mondong claimed that he had made part payment of US$450,000 out of

the US$530,000 in the following manner:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Date Payment Amount</p>
<p align="justify">25 Nov 99 Cash payment to Mr Ko Ahok US$100,000<br/>

  30 Nov 99 Cash payment to Mr Ko Ahok US$30,000<br/>

  30 Nov 99 Deposit into bank US$200,000<br/>

  02 Dec 99 Deposit into bank US$100,000<br/>

  02 Dec 99 Deposit into bank US$20,000</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11. He admitted that he had failed to remit the remaining US$80,000 as his

courier was apprehended by the Indonesian Customs authorities and fined as a result.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12. Yuninshing however contended that these cash payments and deposits were in

respect of previous remittances and not the present claim in question. Mondong subsequently revised

his position and claimed that due to a miscalculation, he had actually made full payment of the

US$530,000 and that he had in fact overpaid Yuninshing a nett amount of IR 1,673,950,000 (in his 3<sup>rd</sup>

affidavit affirmed on 29 December 2000, at para 33 ). He later revised this figure to IR

1,810,450,000 (in his 4<sup>th</sup> affidavit affirmed on 12 February 2001 para 33). Finally, he

adjusted the figure once more to IR 1,250,450,000 (in his 5<sup>th</sup> affidavit, affirmed on 22

March 2001 at para 77), which was the amount eventually claimed against Yuninshing in the Surabaya

proceedings. In fact the IR figures which appeared in Mondongs 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup>

affidavits are incorrect as they are in millions instead of billions.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13. It was clear from Mondongs affidavits that the crux of the dispute did not

lie with the remittances he received from Yuninshing in Jakarta. The contested issue is whether he

had satisfied his contractual obligation to remit US dollars back to Yuninshing in Singapore. I also

note that Mondong did no great favour to his credibility by repeatedly miscalculating the quantum of

what was merely six (6) months worth of transactions, which were all in large lump sum amounts.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14. The third issue of note is the fact that Mondong has substantial assets

within jurisdiction against which a judgment can be enforced. To this end, Yuninshing had obtained a

Mareva injunction from the High Court on 2 April 2001 preventing Mondong from dissipating his

individual and matrimonial assets in Singapore up to the value of US$600,000, in particular:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) A residential property (held on joint tenancy with his wife Baliati) at No.

  5 Tanjong Rhu Road, #02-02 Waterside Condominium, Singapore 436002;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) A commercial warehouse at 3, Upper Aljunied Link, #01-04, Blk B, Joo Seng

  Warehouse, Singapore 367902; and</p>
<p align="justify">(c) Majority shares in Dutair Singapore, held by Mondong and his wife Baliati,

  with an authorised capital of S$150,000 and a paid-up capital of S$100,003.</p>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

T<strong>he law</strong></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15. The principles governing a stay on the ground of <i>forum non conveniens </i>are

well established; the <i>locus classicus </i>of this area of law is <i>Spiliada Maritime Corporation

v Cansulex Ltd</i> [1987] AC 460. For ease of reference I lay out the key passage in this case by

Lord Goff of Chieveley (at p 476):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) The basic principle is that a stay will only be granted on the ground of <i>forum

  non conveniens</i> where the court is satisfied that there is some other available forum, having

  competent jurisdiction, which is the appropriate forum for the trial of the action, i.e. in which

  the case may be tried more suitably for the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) As Lord Kinnears formulation of the principle indicates, in general the

  burden of proof rests on the defendant to persuade the court to exercise its discretion to grant a

  stay  Furthermore, if the court is satisfied that there is another available forum which is

  prima facie the appropriate forum for the trial of the action, the burden will then shift to the

  plaintiff to show that there are special circumstances by reason of which justice requires that

  the trial should nevertheless take place in this country."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16.<i> The Spiliada</i> has been affirmed and applied locally by our Court of

Appeal in <i>Brinkerhoff Maritime Drilling Corp &amp; Anor v PT Airfast Services Indonesia &amp;

Anor</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=6364&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1992] 2 SLR 776</a>, <i>Eng Liat Kiang v Eng Bak Hern</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=9446&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1995] 3 SLR 97</a>, <i>Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Bhavani Stores Pte Ltd</i>

<p align="justify" xmlns="">17. In <i>PT Hutan</i>, Chao Hick Tin JA commented that whether the process

contemplated by Lord Goff in <i>The Spiliada</i> was a two-stage process or a one-stage process,

telescoping two into one, did not really matter, for, as he explained (at p 55):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"The ultimate question remains the same: Where should the case be suitably

  tried having regard to the interest of the parties and the ends of justice."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18. I respectfully agreed and applied the <i>Spiliada</i> test as follows: Had

the defendant satisfied this court that the Indonesian court, having competent jurisdiction, was the

appropriate forum for trial of the action, having regard to the interests of all the parties and the

ends of justice? If so, had the plaintiff shown that there were any special circumstances why the

trial should nevertheless have taken place before this jurisdiction?</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><strong><br/>

The appropriate forum</strong></p>
<p align="justify">(i) The Residence of the Parties</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19. Both parties are Indonesian citizens, and Yuninshing herself resides in

Surabaya.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20. It was unclear where Mondong habitually resides. He purported to reside at

Greenville Block Q, No. 5, Jakarta, Indonesia, and admitted that he was under police investigations

for deception and fraud, which arose when Yuninshing and other parties lodged complaints against

him. As a result, the Indonesian police had issued a Police Order dated 28 June 2000 requiring him

to report on Mondays and Thursdays to the Directorate of General Offences, Indonesian Police

Intelligence. However, he had stopped reporting to the Directorate since 11 September 2000 on the

grounds that he was ill and receiving treatment at Mount Elizabeth Hospital, Singapore.

Consequently, the Indonesian police had placed him on the wanted list.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21. Mondong however maintained that he still resided in Indonesia but had gone

into hiding as "<i>unwanted elements</i>" might resort to "<i>strong arm tactics</i>"

if he turned up at the police station. He further alleged that Yuninshing and her mother wielded

substantial influence in Indonesia and might use force against him to resolve the dispute. To

support this claim, he referred to a letter purportedly written by Yuninshing informing him that

"<i>if the matter could not be settled immediately, Mama would pay somebody (known to Mamas

Boss) to solve this matter, definitely they would use a force.</i>" (sic)</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22. Conversely, Yuninshing alleged that Mondong frequently visited Singapore and

had strong family ties here. She alleged that his wife, Baliati, resided here, his three children

were educated here, and that they lived at the Waterside condominium he owns.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23. Having considered the evidence, I found that Mondongs account did severe

disservice to his appeal. If he truly lived in fear in Indonesia from both legitimate as well as

illegitimate scrutiny, it seems, quite contrarily, that it would have been to his personal advantage

to have the matter heard in Singapore. Ironically, it should have been Yuninshing who would express

preference for litigation in Indonesia. Whatever the truth may be as to Mondongs habitual

residency, it is clear to me that as a fugitive in Indonesia, he would be ill-disposed to enter an

appearance in any court of law within that jurisdiction. Conversely, insofar as he has both

residential and commercial interests in Singapore, as well as freedom of movement within this

jurisdiction, the issue of residency seems to me to weigh more heavily in favour of this forum.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(ii) Witnesses and documentary evidence</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24. The crux of the dispute lay in Mondongs alleged failure to perform his

contractual obligation in Singapore. I would reiterate that the methods of contractual performance

by Mondong included:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) Cash payments of US dollars to Mr Ko Ahok in Jakarta; and</p>
<p align="justify">(b) Telegraphic transfers from Thomas Cook, HBZ, Christiana Bank and Dutair

  Singapore, to Yuninshings accounts with Republic Central Bank and N M Rothschild &amp; Sons in

  Singapore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25. With regard to the cash payments, Yuninshing had represented that Mr Ko Ahok

is an old family friend and would be willing and able to travel to Singapore to attend as a witness.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26. In respect of the telegraphic transfers, I likewise found that as contractual

performance was to take place in Singapore, documentary proof would be easily attainable within this

jurisdiction. The relevant institutions such as Thomas Cook, Rothschild's, as well as Dutair

Singapore are located in Singapore. It is unnecessary, as Mondong submits, to procure Indonesian

witnesses who handled the transactions on the Jakarta end to prove the remittance. Further, the

documents from the above-mentioned financial institutions in Singapore as well as from Christiana

Bank and HBZ, would likely be in English and in any case, I could not see that translation of bank

statements from Bahasa Indonesia would prove of much difficulty to this court. Accordingly, I found

that with regard to the witnesses and documentary evidence necessary for the main trial, the balance

of convenience clearly lay with a trial within this jurisdiction.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(iii) Illegality</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27. Mondong had submitted at various stages of the proceeding that the oral

agreement was illegal under the laws of Indonesia for several reasons, and as such best dealt with

in an Indonesian court. Firstly, he claimed the agreement was in reality designed to flout currency

controls in Indonesia, in that Mondong was effectively smuggling Yuninshings rupiahs out of

Indonesia by courier to convert into US dollars in Singapore. In support of this contention Mondong

claimed that on one occasion his courier was caught and heavily fined. Secondly, he alleged that

Yuninshing had also entered into the agreement for the purpose of tax evasion and money laundering.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28. With regard to currency controls, the law in Indonesia has been helpfully set

out by Minang Warman Sofyan &amp; Associates Law Offices, in a letter addressed to Yuninshings

solicitors dated 23 October 2000 (see exhibit Y8 in Yuninshings 3<sup>rd</sup> affidavit filed on

12 March 2001 at p 55). At the material time, the applicable provisions were Indonesian Government

Regulation No. 18 of 1998 dated 17 January 1998, the Decision of the Board of Executive Directors of

Bank Indonesia No. 30/181A/KEP/DIR dated 17 January 1998 and No. 30/217A/KEP/DIR dated 6 March 1998.

The combined effect of these provisions was that the transportation of a sum of between five million

to ten million IRs into or out of Indonesia required the making of a declaration, and the

transportation of a sum in excess of ten million IRs required a permit from Bank Indonesia.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29. The present transaction would clearly have been an illegal one if it had

specifically provided for the transporting of rupiahs into or out of Indonesia without a permit,

given the quantum of the sums involved. However, I did not find that the contract contemplated such

a transaction. It is within ordinary commercial practice to effect a standing foreign exchange

arrangement <i>inter partes</i> in order to save on losses resulting from open market trading.

Furthermore, there is evidence that Yuninshing had performed such transactions legally via

telegraphic transfer when Mondong had no US dollars to exchange with her. In such circumstances, she

had purchased US dollars from Rothschild's and remitted IRs into the ABN-AMRO Bank in Jakarta. It is

highly unlikely that she would have done so if she had an arrangement with Mondong to illegally

smuggle rupiahs out of Indonesia. Moreover, had Yuninshing been privy to an illegal contract, it is

doubtful that she would have reported Mondong to the Indonesian authorities for fraud in the first

place.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30. It seemed far more likely to me that Mondong had simply acted on his own

initiative to illegally smuggle rupiahs out of Indonesia. Such action does not, without more, taint

the contract with illegality. A contract capable of legal fulfilment is not rendered illegal simply

because of the nefarious means by which the promisor chooses to fulfil it.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31. As for money laundering and tax evasion, I found that the claims made by

Mondong were bare assertions and completely unsupported by evidence. Accordingly, I found that the

issue of illegality was quite simply a red herring.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><strong><br/>

Special circumstances justifying refusal of stay</strong></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32. Had Mondong been able to convince me that, prima facie, Indonesia was the

more appropriate forum for the hearing of this dispute, there would nevertheless have existed

special circumstances in favour of refusing a stay of proceedings. The matter had already proceeded

to an advanced stage within this jurisdiction. As of the hearing date, the parties had filed several

affidavits (Yuninshing had filed five and Mondong six). Both parties had also adduced substantial

documentary evidence within their affidavits. The Statement of Claim and the Defence for the main

action had likewise been filed. In addition, Yuninshing had obtained interim relief in the form of a

Mareva injunction to secure her chances of satisfaction upon judgment.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33. In contrast, the Surabaya claim had quite inexplicably been retracted by

Mondong on 12 April 2001. Further, in view of Mondongs fugitive status, there was no indication

that there would remain any worthwhile assets in Indonesia against which a potential judgment could

be enforced. Thus, even if Yuninshing succeeded in a fresh action in Indonesia, she would in all

likelihood still have to apply to our courts to enforce the ruling as a judgment debt, if indeed by

such time there were still assets remaining within this jurisdiction.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34. The burden was upon the defendant to persuade this court to exercise its

discretion to grant a stay on the grounds of <i>forum non conveniens</i>. As emphasized by Lord Goff

in <i>The Spiliada</i> and our Court of Appeal in <i>PT Hutan</i>, this is not simply a question of

practical convenience, but of whether the forum is the most appropriate one in the interests of all

parties and the ends of justice. Although the oral agreement was concluded in Surabaya and

remittances by Yuninshing took place in Jakarta, the central issue in dispute was contractual

performance by Mondong in Singapore, that is, the remittance of US dollars into Yuninshings bank

accounts in Singapore. Proof of this issue would largely be found within this jurisdiction. Further,

Mondongs fugitive status in Indonesia suggested that he was unlikely to enter an appearance

before or place his assets at the disposal of, the Indonesian courts. Conversely, there was every

indication that he had a residential presence in Singapore and, by his own account, it seemed to be

to his personal advantage to attend court within this jurisdiction. Finally, proceedings in

Singapore were at a very advanced stage, with numerous affidavits filed by both parties and a Mareva

injunction obtained to secure enforcement of a prospective judgment. It was clear that the interests

of the parties and the ends of justice pointed towards Singapore as the place of adjudication of

this claim.</p>
