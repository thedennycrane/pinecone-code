A critical threshold question in the Mexican proceedings is this: who has authority to represent the plaintiffs in those proceedings? Is it the lawyers whom the plaintiffs appointed in August 2017, when the defendants still owned and controlled the plaintiffs? Or is it the lawyers whom the plaintiffs appointed in September 2017, following an event of default and after bondholders had assumed <span class="font-italic">de jure</span> ownership and control of the plaintiffs?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The plaintiffs commenced this originating summons in January 2018 seeking declarations and permanent injunctions regarding the defendants’ right to control the plaintiffs and to use that control to carry into effect the restructuring proceedings.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 A <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> is a statutory, court-supervised restructuring procedure available to an insolvent commercial debtor to restructure its business and debts. It is a mode of debtor in possession restructuring analogous both to a creditors’ scheme of arrangement under Singapore and English insolvency law and to proceedings under Chapter 11 of the US federal Bankruptcy Code. Like these analogues, the purpose of a <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> is to protect a debtor who is in default of its payment obligations from individual creditor action in order to give the debtor the breathing space to formulate a restructuring or reorganisation plan for the collective benefit of its creditors and other stakeholders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 A <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> is territorially limited to Mexico. Therefore, although a company incorporated outside Mexico may file a <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> petition, any reorganisation will be confined to the company’s business and assets in Mexico.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 A debtor commences a <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> by filing a <span class="font-italic">concurso</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>petition with the designated Mexican court.

</div> A declaration of an event of default would allow the Bond Trustee to displace the defendants’ ownership and control of the plaintiffs and to vest it in the bondholders’ nominee.

</div> The federal court’s reasoning proceeded as follows. The validity of cl 15.1(g) of the bond agreement was governed by Norwegian law and was subject to the jurisdiction of the Norwegian courts. But the effect of cl 15.1(g) was to allow Perforadora to be dispossessed of the rigs and thereby to end any prospect of a successful <span class="font-italic">concurso</span>. The issue before the <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> court was whether, in light of its effect on Perforadora’s <span class="font-italic">concurso</span>, cl 15.1(g) was unenforceable under Art 87 of the LCM and contrary to Mexican public policy. That issue is governed by Mexican law, not Norwegian law.

</div> A <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> court in Mexico seised of a <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> filed under Mexican law had the jurisdiction to decide the issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In February 2021, the <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> court suspended the effects of the Bond Trustee’s declaration of an event of default. It held that cl 15.1(g) of the bond agreement imposes a detriment on the first plaintiff by the mere fact of Perforadora commencing insolvency or restructuring proceedings. Art 87 of the LCM therefore empowered the <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> court to “legally disregard” cl 15.1(g) even though it was a stipulation bargained for between the Integradora Group and the bondholders. The <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> court therefore “revoked” cl 15.1(g) and “rendered invalid” all consequences flowing from the declared event of default.

Without such a basis, I do not consider that I have the power to enter any sort of judgment against the first and third defendants. I consider it particularly important to establish that legal basis on the merits in a case such as this, where the third defendant submits that granting the plaintiffs the relief they seek will nullify the decisions of the Mexican courts leading to the findings summarised at [69]–[70] above and raise issues of judicial comity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Second, it is the plaintiffs’ stated intention to enforce my judgment in Mexico. I consider it necessary to satisfy myself, on the merits rather than by concession, that the plaintiffs have established a legal basis for the final relief lest the failure to do so proves, in itself, to be an obstacle to enforcement. The third defendant has already taken the position before me that I should not give any weight to a January 2019 decision of the Norwegian court on cl 15.1(g) of the bond agreement in favour of the Bond Trustee because the Norwegian court did not, for a different reason, consider it necessary to satisfy itself on the merits that the plaintiffs had established a basis for the final relief that it granted them.

The first defendant is not represented before me and is not bound by the third defendant’s concession as to the legal basis for granting relief against him. I must therefore satisfy myself on the merits that the plaintiffs have established a legal basis for final relief against the first defendant. That legal basis, as will be seen, depends on establishing a legal basis for final relief against the third defendant. It is therefore necessary, in any event, for me to be satisfied that the plaintiffs have established a legal basis for relief against the third defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Third defendant: breach of implied contract </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I accept the plaintiffs’ submission that the legal basis for granting the final relief they seek against the third defendant lies in an implied contract between each of them and the third defendant that incorporates as a term the substance of Art 115A. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 One of the central issues on appeal in <span class="font-italic">Oro Negro </span><span class="font-italic">(CA)</span> was whether the plaintiffs had a good arguable case that the second and third defendants were contractually bound by Art 115A by virtue <span class="font-italic">only</span> of their having accepted appointment as directors of the plaintiffs (at [56]). The plaintiffs relied on <span class="font-italic">Anglo-Austrian Printing and Publishing Union (Isaacs’ Case) </span>[1892] 2 Ch 158 (“<span class="font-italic">Isaacs’ Case</span>”), <span class="font-italic">Chee </span><span class="font-italic">Kheong Mah Chaly and others v Liquidators of Baring Futures (Singapore) Pte Ltd </span>[2003] 2 SLR(R) 571 (“<span class="font-italic">Chaly Mah</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Tengku Dato</span><span class="font-italic">’ Ibrahim Petra bin Tengku Indra Petra &amp; Ors v Perdana Petroleum Bhd (formerly known as Petra Perdana Bhd) </span>[2013] 8 MLJ 280 (“<span class="font-italic">Tengku Dato Ibrahim</span>”) to submit that accepting appointment as a director was enough in itself for Art 115A to bind the second and third defendants (see<span class="font-italic"> Oro Negro </span><span class="font-italic">(CA)</span> at [57]). The second and third defendants argued that there must be something more than merely accepting appointment as a director for Art 115A to bind them (see <span class="font-italic">Oro Negro</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA) </span>at [57]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The Court of Appeal (at [60]) accepted that the plaintiffs had indeed established a good arguable case on this central issue, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a case with sufficient merit to support interlocutory relief. As the plaintiffs now seek final relief against the first and third defendants, I have to determine not whether the plaintiffs merely have a good arguable case on this issue but whether they have established that case on the merits. With respect, I come to the same conclusion as the Court of Appeal on the merits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Oro Negro (CA)</span> analysed <span class="font-italic">Isaacs’ Case</span>, <span class="font-italic">Chaly </span><span class="font-italic">Mah</span> and <span class="font-italic">Tengku Dato Ibrahim</span> in detail before concluding that the plaintiffs had a good arguable case. I analyse the same three cases briefly before concluding that the plaintiffs have more than a good arguable case but have in fact established the third defendant is bound by an implied contract which incorporates as a term the substance of Art 115A.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Isaacs’ Case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 I begin with <span class="font-italic">Is</span><span class="font-italic">aacs’ Case</span>. In that case, Sir Henry Isaacs signed a company’s memorandum and articles of association in his capacity as a subscribing shareholder for one share in the company. The company’s articles of association also expressly appointed him as a director of the company upon incorporation. Under the articles, a person was qualified to hold office as a director only if he subscribed for 100 shares of £10 each in the company. A director appointed upon incorporation was given one month after incorporation to subscribe for the shares. The articles provided that, if the director failed to do so: (a) he would be deemed to have agreed to subscribe for the 100 shares; and (b) the company was thereupon entitled to allot the shares to him forthwith. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Sir Henry acted as a director of the company from incorporation until it went into liquidation. But he failed to subscribe for 99 additional shares in the company within one month of incorporation, or indeed at all, as required by the articles. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The company went into liquidation just 16 months after incorporation. The question arose whether Sir Henry was a contributory for 100 shares or only for his one subscriber share, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether he had an obligation to contribute an additional £990 to the company’s capital for the benefit of its creditors, arising from the 99 shares for which had failed to subscribe.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 At first instance, Stirling J accepted that Sir Henry <span class="font-italic">qua </span>director of the company was not a party to the express statutory contract comprising the company’s memorandum and articles of association even though Sir Henry <span class="font-italic">qua </span>shareholder was a party to that contract. Stirling J held that Sir Henry <span class="font-italic">qua </span>director was nevertheless bound by an implied contract with the company to subscribe for an additional 99 shares in the company within one month after his appointment as a director. As Stirling J held (at 164–165):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]here ought to be inferred an agreement between [Sir Henry] and the company, on his part that he will serve the company on the terms as to qualification and otherwise contained in the articles of association, and on the part of the company that he shall receive the remuneration, and all the benefits which those articles provide for directors. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 On appeal, Lindley, Bowen and Kay LJJ affirmed Stirling J’s judgment. They held unanimously that the articles amounted to the company’s offer to Sir Henry of the terms on which he was to become a director of the company and that he had accepted the company’s offer by his conduct in taking up appointment as a director and especially in acting as a director of the company until it went into liquidation. The acceptance being by conduct, the fact that Sir Henry had signed the memorandum was not essential to bring the implied contract into existence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Chaly Mah</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The second case the Court of Appeal analysed in <span class="font-italic">Oro Negro (CA)</span> is <span class="font-italic">Chaly Mah</span>. In that case, a company’s articles provided that every officer of the company was entitled to be indemnified out of the assets of the company against any liabilities he may incur in the discharge of his office. The question was whether this provision was incorporated into the contract between the company and an accounting firm appointed to office as its auditors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Answering the question in the affirmative, the Court of Appeal held that the auditors had clearly accepted their appointment to their office on the footing of the articles. The Court of Appeal accepted that the articles constitute a contract only between a company and its members and generally do not bind third parties (see <span class="font-italic">Hickman v Kent </span><span class="font-italic">Or Romney Marsh Sheep-Breeders’ Association </span>[1915] 1 Ch 881). But the Court of Appeal also held that in the particular circumstances of a case, a separate contract between the company and a third party who is not directly bound by the articles can incorporate provisions from the articles of association (see <span class="font-italic">Chaly Mah </span>at [24]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Tengku Dato Ibrahim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The third case that the Court of Appeal analysed in <span class="font-italic">Oro Negro (CA)</span> is <span class="font-italic">Tengku Dato Ibrahim</span>. In that case, directors of a company sued the company seeking to be indemnified against legal fees they had incurred in successfully defending a derivative action brought against them <span class="font-italic">qua </span>directors by a minority shareholder of the company. Article 170 of the company’s articles of association gave the directors an express right to such an indemnity. The directors had contracts of employment with the company. But they were not able to point to any words, whether in writing or even in conversation, incorporating Art 170 into their contracts of employment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Mohamad Ariff J in the High Court of Malaya at Kuala Lumpur began his analysis by accepting that “relatively little may be required to incorporate the articles by implication” into a contract between a company and its director (at [19]), citing the <span class="font-italic">dictum</span> of Stanley Burton J in <span class="font-italic">Globalink</span><span class="font-italic"> Telecommunications Ltd v Wilmbury Ltd</span> [2003] 1 BCLC 145 at [30]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The articles of association of a company are as a result of statute a contract between the members of the company and the company in relation to their membership. The articles are not automatically binding as between a company and its officers as such. In so far as the articles are applicable to the relationship between a company and its officers, the articles may be expressly or impliedly incorporated in the contract between the company and a director. They will be so incorporated if the director accepts appointment ‘on the footing of the Articles,’ and relatively little may be required to incorporate the articles by implication: <span class="font-italic">per</span> Ferris J at para [26] of his judgment [in <span class="font-italic">John and others v Price Waterhouse (a firm) and another</span> [2002] 1 WLR 953).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101  Mohamad Ariff J went on to hold that the reason “very little” may be required to incorporate a term in a company’s articles of association into a contract between the company and a director is because it is an obvious and necessary condition of appointing a person to the office of a director of a company that he is so appointed precisely on the footing of the company’s articles (at [27]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [H]ow else can directors be appointed to the board except on ‘the footing of the articles’? It is an obvious necessary precondition for a valid board appointment. In this sense, the view that ‘it takes very little’ to incorporate the articles into the director’s contract can be more readily and realistically understood. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">He therefore held that it was obvious that the directors had been appointed “on the footing of the articles” of the company, and that the right to an indemnity conferred by Art 170 had been incorporated as a term of the contract between the directors and the company (at [29]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Oro Negro (CA)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 As a result of its analysis of these cases, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Oro Negro </span><span class="font-italic">(CA)</span> held that the plaintiffs had established a good arguable case that an implied contract incorporating as a term the substance of Art 115A arose between each plaintiff and the second and third defendants because their consent to appointment to the office of a director in a plaintiff gave rise to an agreement that each of them would serve that plaintiff based on the terms of the plaintiffs’ constitution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The Court of Appeal gave four reasons for its holding that the plaintiffs had a good arguable case on this issue. First, it did not lie in a person’s mouth to say that he was not familiar with a company’s constitution at the time he accepted appointment as a director of the company (at [70]). Second, the only reasonable inference on the facts of <span class="font-italic">Oro Negro (CA)</span> was that the second and third defendants must have agreed that their terms of service as directors were to incorporate the terms of the plaintiffs’ constitutions (at [70]). Third, it did not matter that Art 115A was inserted into the plaintiffs’ constitutions after the second and third defendants had accepted appointment. That was because they continued to serve as directors after it had been inserted (at [71]). Finally, and in any event, the second and third defendants knew the content of Art 115A because they had signed all of the internal corporate documentation that had been necessary to insert that article into each plaintiff’s constitutions as required by the bond agreements and the charge (at [71]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 In my view, the rule to be extracted from the authorities is that where a term in a company’s constitution imposes an obligation or confers a right on a person appointed to an office within a company, including but not limited to the office of director, and that person is aware of that term, accepts appointment as a director of the company and thereafter acts as a director of the company, that term is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> incorporated into an implied contract between that person and the company. All of this is, of course, subject to contrary agreement. Therefore, no implied contract will arise if the company and the officer enter into an express and separate contract which: (a) excludes the relevant terms in the constitution; (b) is inconsistent with the terms in the constitution; or (c) expressly provides that it sets out exclusively the terms on which the officer has been appointed to his office.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The implied contract is like any other contract. If the director acts contrary to that term, he is in breach of the implied contract. A breach of the contract carries the usual consequences, typically an award of damages for the breach and, in appropriate cases, an award of equitable relief such as an injunction or specific performance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In the present case, Art 115A expressly obliged each director of each plaintiff “not [to] carry into effect…any filing for…<span class="font-italic">concurso</span> mercantile or judicial restructuring” for that plaintiff unless “the Independent Director (whose vote is necessary) has voted in approval”. That obligation in Art 115A was a term of the third defendant’s contract <span class="font-italic">qua</span> director with each plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The third defendant does not dispute – indeed, cannot credibly dispute –that he was aware of Art 115A when he acted as a director of each plaintiff or, more accurately, continued to act as a director of each plaintiff after Art 115A had been inserted into its constitution. Furthermore, he was personally involved in inserting Art 115A into each plaintiff’s constitution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Liability in contract is strict. It therefore makes no difference to the third defendant’s liability for breach of his implied contract that he acted, as he claims, out of the best of motives, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in accordance with what he believed to be the best interests of the plaintiffs, in accordance with what he believed to be his fiduciary duties, and with a genuine belief that complying with Art 115A was inconsistent with those duties and with a genuine belief that Art 115A was ineffective under Mexican law.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Art 115A required Mr Cochrane’s vote of approval before the third defendant could carry into effect the content of the Shareholders’ Resolutions, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to cause each plaintiff to file a <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> petition. I find that the third defendant did cause each plaintiff to file a <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> petition without Mr Cochrane’s vote of approval. The third defendant has accordingly breached the implied contract between himself and each plaintiff. He is liable in the usual way for damages to each plaintiff for the loss he has caused it to suffer by reason of his breach and to be restrained by inunction from continuing his breach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Given that I have accepted the plaintiffs’ primary legal basis in contract for granting final relief (see [80] above), it is unnecessary for me to consider the plaintiffs’ alternative basis under the Companies Act (see [81] above) or its further alternative basis in the tort of conspiracy (see [82] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">First defendant: inducing breach of contract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 I accept the plaintiffs’ submission that the legal basis for granting the final relief they seek against the first defendant lies in its inducement of the third defendant to breach his implied contract with the plaintiffs. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The elements of the tort</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 A person is liable in tort for inducing a breach of a contract if: (a) the person acts with the requisite knowledge of the existence of the contract, even if it lacks knowledge of the precise terms of the contract; (b) the person had the intention – which is to be determined objectively – to interfere with the performance of the contract; and (c) the contract in question is a valid one (see <span class="font-italic">Tribune Investment Trust Inc v Soosan Trading Co Ltd </span>[2000] 2 SLR(R) 407 at [17]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 A contract for the purposes of this tort must include the implied contract that arises between a director and a company incorporating a term in the company’s constitution that imposes an obligation or confers a right on the director. There is no basis on which to suggest otherwise. Indeed, where the term in the constitution touches on the internal corporate governance of a company, as Art 115A does, the tort of inducing a breach of contract can be seen as a valuable ancillary legal right for shareholders to ensure proper corporate governance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The first defendant cannot credibly dispute that it was aware of the existence of each plaintiff’s constitution and of the second and third defendants’ obligation <span class="font-italic">qua</span> directors to comply with Art 115A in each constitution. At the material time, the first defendant was the sole shareholder of the first plaintiff and the first plaintiff was the sole shareholder of the second to sixth plaintiffs. As the plaintiffs put it, that makes the first defendant the “ultimate parent” of all six plaintiffs.

</div> His evidence is that doing so was also consistent with his fiduciary duties to each plaintiff. He says also that he understood at the time, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, on 31 August 2017, that Art 115A was ineffective as being contrary to Art 87 of the LCM and Mexican public policy and would not operate to restrain the third defendant from carrying out his fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the plaintiff.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 I do not accept that the third defendant “understood” any of this in August 2017. As my recounting of the litigation in Mexico has shown, whether Art 115A is or is not effective as a condition precedent to filing a <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> petition under Art 87 of the LCM is a hotly contested issue on which the Mexican courts themselves have been deeply divided for four years, until the <span class="font-italic">amparo</span> court’s decision in December 2021. Despite that, the issue continues to be contested, as that decision is itself on appeal. The third defendant is not a psychic and his claimed understanding in August 2017 may well be contradicted on appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Further, I do not accept that complying with Art 115A would have been inconsistent with the fiduciary duties that the third defendant owed to the plaintiffs. Art 115A does not prevent the plaintiffs’ directors from commencing self-imitated Insolvency Matters in respect of any of the plaintiffs. It merely requires Mr Cochrane’s vote of approval in order to do so. Mr Cochrane himself owes fiduciary duties to the plaintiffs. He would breach those duties if he simply did the bondholders’ bidding, just as the third defendant would breach those duties if he simply did the first defendant’s bidding. There is no basis on which to suggest that Mr Cochrane would have withheld his vote of approval if it was otherwise in the best interests of the plaintiffs to file restructuring petitions. It is an important point that Art 115A is not an absolute bar on the plaintiffs’ commencing self-initiated Insolvency Matters. It is merely a bar on the first defendant’s right, as the first plaintiff’s sole shareholder, to dictate how and where the plaintiffs are to be restructured, without regard to the bondholders’ bargained for rights and interests.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In my view, the third defendant intended on 31 August 2017, at the very latest, to carry out a plan to put the rigs out of the reach of bondholders by carrying into effect the Shareholders’ Resolutions without Mr Cochrane’s vote of approval, and without even allowing him an opportunity to vote, in breach of Art 115A. The third defendant’s reliance on Art 87 of the LCM and his fiduciary duties to the plaintiffs as justifications for bypassing Mr Cochrane are nothing but disingenuous <span class="font-italic">ex post</span> facto rationalisations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 I am further satisfied that the third defendant’s intent can properly be attributed to the first defendant. The third defendant was a director of the first defendant at the material time. The second defendant was chief legal counsel for the first defendant at the material time. The first defendant was, at that time, dealing with the apprehended insolvency of itself and of the plaintiffs in substance as a single economic problem to be solved, even if the first defendant’s <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> was to be initiated separately from the plaintiffs’ <span class="font-italic">concursos</span> as a matter of legal form. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 I therefore consider that the first defendant intended, before the Shareholders’ Resolutions were passed, to induce the third defendant to breach his implied contract with the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) In passing the Shareholders’ Resolutions</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 I next consider the first defendant’s intent when it passed the Shareholders’ Resolutions on 20 September 2017. All but one of the Shareholders’ Resolutions were signed by the second defendant as the “authorised representative” of the first defendant with respect to the first plaintiff, and as the authorised representative of the first plaintiff with respect to the remaining plaintiffs.

</div> In context, the necessity for doing so was quite obviously to stop Perforadora losing possession of the rigs.

If an objective case had been established in at that time that the plaintiffs were insolvent or in severe financial distress and ought to file restructuring petitions, Mr Cochrane could well have decided not to vote against such proceedings but instead simply to withhold his vote of approval for any proposal to file those petitions anywhere but Singapore. That would have avoided the current standoff in Mexico and allowed the plaintiffs to take possession of the rigs.

</div> Determining this originating summons on the merits therefore risks giving rise to the two undesirable consequences of duplicate proceedings.

</div> For this analysis, I therefore treat them as a single proceeding in Mexico, as a matter of Mexican procedural law. I am also prepared to accept that it is immaterial that each plaintiff’s <span class="font-italic">c</span><span class="font-italic">oncurso</span> was a separate proceeding from commencement in September 2017 until consolidation in December 2021. It is during that period that the Mexican courts issued most of the decisions that the third defendant relies on to argue that this originating summons is an abuse of process. The significant point is that, unless and until an appellate court reverses the consolidation, all of those earlier decisions are now to be treated as having been made in a single consolidated <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> covering the first defendant, Perforadora and all six plaintiffs.

There are therefore now only eight parties to this originating summons: the six plaintiffs, the first defendant and the third defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 The question which arises is how to identify the parties to the consolidated<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">concursos</span>. In most jurisdictions, insolvency and restructuring proceedings are commenced, as a matter of form, like civil proceedings. In this narrow sense, therefore, the parties to proceedings such as a <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> will at the very least include the debtor. Where the proceeding is initiated by a creditor, and again in this narrow sense, the petitioning creditor will also be a party. The <span class="font-italic">C</span><span class="font-italic">oncursos</span> in this case were all self-initiated. All six plaintiffs, the first defendant and Perforadora are therefore parties to the consolidated c<span class="font-italic">oncursos</span>. No creditors are parties to the consolidated <span class="font-italic">concursos</span>. Certainly no director of any of the plaintiffs – such as the third defendant – is a party to the consolidated <span class="font-italic">concursos</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 When applying the abuse of process analysis to insolvency and restructuring proceedings, however, the inquiry into identity of parties cannot be applied in this narrow procedural sense. That is because insolvency and restructuring proceedings are fundamentally different in substance from civil proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Civil proceedings are founded either on a <span class="font-italic">lis</span> or a statutory right of action and are commenced by one or more claimants against one or more defendants. The claimant commences the proceedings because it is dissatisfied with the <span class="font-italic">status quo</span> or fears an imminent change in the <span class="font-italic">status quo</span>. Its objective in invoking the coercive powers of the court by commencing the proceedings is to vindicate a personal or proprietary private right which it claims entitles it to a judgment effecting a change in the <span class="font-italic">status quo</span> or preventing the imminent change in the <span class="font-italic">status quo</span>. On the other side of the <span class="font-italic">lis</span> is the defendant, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the person against whom the claimant is asking the court to exercise its coercive powers and enter a judgment. The parties to the proceedings are simply the two or more legal persons between whom the claimant asserts the <span class="font-italic">lis</span> to exist. It is therefore the claimant who defines the parties by choosing to name some but not other legal persons as either a claimant or a defendant upon commencement. The parties are not defined by some legal or factual relationship to the claimant or to the <span class="font-italic">lis</span>. That is why the parties to civil proceedings can be identified simply by looking at the title to the proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 The utility of the concept of a party in civil proceedings is that it defines exclusively the universe of persons against whom the effects of a judgment are opposable. A judgment in civil proceedings has four fundamental effects. First, it terminates the court’s power to alter the parties’ substantive rights and obligations in the proceedings, or in a defined phase of the proceedings, leaving the court to exercise only an ancillary or adjectival power relating to the interpretation or implementation of the judgment. Second, the judgment resolves the <span class="font-italic">lis</span> by adjudication and with finality, rendering its subject-matter <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>. Third, the judgment binds the parties to comply with its terms. Fourth, the judgment merges the parties’ pre-judgment substantive rights and obligations into the judgment. The judgment has these four effects against, and <span class="font-italic">only</span> against, the parties to the proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 Insolvency proceedings (such as a bankruptcy or winding up application) and restructuring proceedings (such as a scheme of arrangement or a <span class="font-italic">concurso</span>) are substantively and substantially different from civil proceedings. The objective in commencing these proceedings is not to get the court to enter a judgment vindicating a private right by changing the <span class="font-italic">status quo</span> for the individual benefit of a claimant asserting a <span class="font-italic">lis</span>. Instead, the objective is to get the court to enter a judgment effecting a fundamental change in the status of the debtor for the collective benefit of all those who have an interest in its estate. A judgment in these proceedings is therefore quite different from a judgment in civil proceedings. The change of status effected by the judgment binds the whole world; it does not bind only those persons who are parties to the proceedings as a matter of civil procedure. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 A judgment entered in insolvency or restructuring proceedings does not have any of the four fundamental effects of a judgment entered in civil proceedings. The court effects the desired change in the debtor’s status by its judgment upon proof only that the change is warranted by the applicable criteria. The criteria usually include at least proof of the debtor’s insolvency or severe financial distress. A judgment does not terminate these proceedings in the same way as a judgment in civil proceedings, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by bringing an end to the court’s jurisdiction to alter the parties’ substantive rights and obligations. Instead, the judgment serves merely to initiate the particular collective proceeding in question. Even after judgment, the court continues to have the power to alter substantive rights and obligations. That is in addition to the power to make ancillary or adjectival orders in supervising and rendering assistance to the insolvency professionals and to all those who have an interest in the debtor’s estate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 A judgment entered in insolvency and restructuring proceedings undoubtedly binds the whole world to recognise the change in the debtor’s status that it has effected. But the judgment does not bind anyone in any other respect. Thus, it does not give rise to a <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> and does not effect any merger. For example, the mere fact that a creditor secures a winding up order does not mean that the court has adjudicated in any sense upon the creditor’s debt, whether as to liability or quantum. The substantive rights of both the debtor and the creditor and the power of the liquidator, and ultimately the court, to adjudicate upon the debt remain entirely unaffected by the judgment entered in the insolvency or restructuring proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 Both before and after judgment is entered, an insolvency court has the power to decide a disputed issue, to make the necessary orders in the course of supervising or rendering its assistance in the collective proceeding. When it does so, it has the power to alter substantive and procedural rights and obligations and to bind persons to those alterations. Those persons need not be parties to the proceeding in the narrow procedural sense. Thus, for example, the very act of commencing insolvency or restructuring proceedings typically subjects all persons with an interest in the debtor’s estate to the court’s power to bind those persons to a moratorium on individual action in order to protect the collective nature of the proceedings and to advance its purpose. These persons become subject to this aspect of the court’s power even before it adjudicates upon whether a change in the debtor’s status is warranted and even if no change in status ultimately takes effect, <span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> if the proceedings are dismissed or withdrawn. Whether before or after judgment, the court possesses and exercises this jurisdiction over persons by reason of the legal or factual relationship to the debtor or to its estate, not (as in civil proceedings) merely because the claimant chose to name the person as a party when commencing the proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 The effect of these orders is not confined to the persons who are parties to the insolvency or restructuring proceedings in the narrow procedural sense. These orders will bind those persons over whom the court exercises its personal jurisdiction and against whom it directs its orders, so long as it does so in accordance with the applicable insolvency or restructuring law and the applicable rules of civil procedure. It is in this way that an insolvency court takes jurisdiction over and makes orders binding insolvency professionals it has appointed, creditors, members or shareholders, officers and even former officers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 For these reasons, when applying the abuse of process analysis to insolvency proceedings, it is far more meaningful to look for a person over whom the insolvency court exercised jurisdiction in entering judgment or in making an order rather than for a “party” as that concept has developed as a matter of civil procedure. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 Applying this extended test, I accept that there is identity of parties (for lack of a better term) with regard to the third defendant in the decisions of the Mexican court leading to the findings I have summarised at [69]–[70] above. The effect of these decisions is – at least for the purposes of the consolidated <span class="font-italic">Concursos</span> – to restore the third defendant to his status as a director of the plaintiffs. The Mexican courts consider it to be within their jurisdiction – both as to the subject-matter and as to the person – to alter his status in this way as a matter of Mexican insolvency law and as a matter of Mexican civil procedure. I therefore conclude that the third defendant was a party to these decisions for the purposes of the abuse of process analysis. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Same or similar issues</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 The third defendant next submits that this originating summons raises three issues for my decision that the Mexican courts have already adjudicated upon in their decisions leading to the findings summarised at [69]–[70] above. Those three issues are:

In my view, the<span class="font-italic"> </span>issues before the Mexican courts in the consolidated <span class="font-italic">c</span><span class="font-italic">oncursos</span> and the issues before me on this originating summons operate on two separate and parallel planes, in two senses. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 The first sense in which the issues operate on separate planes is that the issues arise under different bodies of law in different systems of law. The issues before me on this originating summons arise under Singapore contract law, Singapore tort law and Singapore company law. Those issues are: (a) whether the third defendant breached his implied contract with the plaintiffs which incorporates as a term the substance of Art 115A; (b) whether the first defendant induced the third defendant to breach that contract; and (c) whether the corporate acts which the plaintiffs undertook upon and by reason of the event of default are valid. The issues before the Mexican courts in the consolidated<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">concursos</span>, on the other hand, arise under Mexican insolvency law and public policy. Those issues are whether the Mexican courts are entitled or obliged, under Art 87 of the LCM and Mexican public policy: (a) to disapply Art 115A in deciding whether to admit the <span class="font-italic">Concursos</span>; and (b) to disregard cl 15.1(g) of the bond agreement in determining the consequences of the event of default. The issues before the Mexican courts in the consolidated <span class="font-italic">concurso</span><span class="font-italic">s</span> and the issues before me in this originating summons arise under two different bodies of law within two different systems of law. There is no identity of issues.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 The second sense in which the issues operate on separate planes is that, in this originating summons, the question in issue is the authority of a director of any of the plaintiffs – such as the second and third defendants in September 2017 – to carry into effect the Shareholders’ Resolutions without complying with Art 115A. That too is a question of Singapore law. That too is not the subject matter of any of the decisions in the consolidated <span class="font-italic">concursos</span>. The issue decided by the Mexican courts is whether Art 87 of the LCM and Mexican public policy allow the Mexican courts to disapply Art 115A in considering the issue of authority.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 Despite the third defendant’s attempts to frame the issues in the consolidated <span class="font-italic">concursos</span> in terms which appear superficially identical to the issues on this originating summons, the two proceedings in my view raise very different issues. I have been asked to and have decided only issues of Singapore contract law, tort law and company law. I have not been asked to decide and I have not decided any issue as to the scope of Art 87 of the LCM or of Mexican public policy. My decision on the issues in this originating summons are not intended to have any bearing – and indeed cannot have any bearing – on the past or future decisions of the Mexican courts on issues of Mexican law and public policy.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Same or similar relief</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 Finally, the third defendant submits that the plaintiffs seek in this originating summons the same relief as they seek in the consolidated <span class="font-italic">c</span><span class="font-italic">oncursos</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, relief intended to prevent the Guerra Lawyers from continuing the <span class="font-italic">Concurso</span><span class="font-italic">s</span>, whether in reliance on the Shareholders’ Resolutions or otherwise.

But none of the relief that the plaintiffs seek in this originating summons is directed at the Guerra Lawyers or has its basis in any issues of Mexican law. Instead, the relief sought here is directed only to the first and third defendants, as the former shareholder and a former director of six Singapore companies.

It will be a rare case where litigation between two parties over an issue that <span class="font-italic">has not previously been </span><span class="font-italic">litigated </span>between them will amount to a collateral attack (<span class="font-italic">Beh Chew </span><span class="font-italic">Boo v Public Prosecutor </span>[2021] 2 SLR 180 at [72], citing <span class="font-italic">In</span><span class="font-italic"> re Norris </span>[2001] 1 WLR 1388 at [26] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough). Examples of an impermissible collateral attack are best illustrated by <span class="font-italic">Hunter v Chief Constable of West Midlands Police </span>[1982] AC 529 (“<span class="font-italic">Hunter</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Ashmore v British Coal Corporation </span>[1990] 2 QB 338 (“<span class="font-italic">Ashmore</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 In <span class="font-italic">Hunter</span>, the plaintiff attempted to relitigate in a civil court a factual issue which had been decided against him by a criminal court in a trial in which he was the accused. The plaintiff had had a full opportunity to contest the issue before the criminal court. His attempt to bring a civil claim raising the same issue was struck out as an abuse of the process of the court, being a collateral attack on the decision of one court in another court of coordinate jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 In <span class="font-italic">Ashmore</span>, the plaintiff made a sexual discrimination claim against the British Coal Board. A large number of other women were also interested in pursuing similar claims. As a matter of case management, the employment tribunal selected for trial a number of sample cases on the basis that they raised issues that were common to all the claims, including the plaintiff’s claim. The plaintiff did not attempt to put her claim forward for selection as a sample case even though her claim raised an issue that was arguably unique. Her claim was therefore stayed while the sample cases were tried. After the sample cases had been tried and dismissed, the plaintiff attempted to have the stay in her case lifted in order to litigate the issue unique to her case. The English Court of Appeal held that allowing her to litigate her claim in these circumstances would be an abuse of process, being analogous to a collateral attack on the tribunal’s decision on the sample cases. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 For the reasons I have already given, I do not consider the plaintiffs to be relitigating any issues that have been decided by the Mexican courts. The issues before me are issues of Singapore contract law, tort law and company law, not issues of Mexican insolvency law and public policy.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 For the following reasons, I do not accept that considerations of judicial comity are relevant to the issue of whether to make the interim injunctions permanent. Although the third defendant makes his submissions only on his own behalf, I analyse his submissions as they apply to both the third defendant and to the first defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Anti-suit injunction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 In my view, the permanent injunctions are not properly classified as anti-suit injunctions. I say that for two reasons. First, the effect of the injunctions is not to restrain <span class="font-italic">the </span><span class="font-italic">plaintiffs</span> from maintaining the <span class="font-italic">Concursos</span>. The injunctions merely restrain <span class="font-italic">a former shareholder</span> of the first plaintiff and <span class="font-italic">a former director</span> of the plaintiffs from causing the plaintiffs to maintain the <span class="font-italic">Concursos</span>. Second, even if the effect of the injunctions is the same as an anti-suit injunction, that is not their intended effect. I take these two reasons in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Effect of the injunctions</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 The effect of the permanent injunctions is to restrain in perpetuity two persons who have never had any power to exert any control over any of the plaintiffs as a matter of Singapore law to commence or maintain unilaterally any Insolvency Matter from purporting to exert such control to maintain the<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Concursos</span> or to commence fresh <span class="font-italic">concursos</span> in any of the plaintiffs’ names. The injunction is not a restraint on the plaintiffs from maintaining the <span class="font-italic">Concursos</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 Despite the permanent injunctions, each plaintiff remains entirely at liberty to commence a fresh <span class="font-italic">concurso</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>or even to maintain the existing <span class="font-italic">Concursos</span> if (but <span class="font-italic">only</span> if) that plaintiff: (a) <span class="font-italic">does not </span>rely on the Shareholder’s Resolutions but instead procures a new ratifying resolution from its current shareholder; and (b) <span class="font-italic">does </span>secure Mr Cochrane’s vote of approval in compliance with Art 115A to ratify maintaining the <span class="font-italic">Concursos</span> or to commence fresh <span class="font-italic">concursos</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 The only effect of the injunctions is to restrain <span class="font-italic">the first and third defendants</span> in perpetuity from causing any plaintiff to commence or maintain a <span class="font-italic">c</span><span class="font-italic">oncurso</span> whether in reliance on the Shareholders’ Resolutions or otherwise. Those injunctions are warranted against the first defendant because it ceased to be a shareholder of all of the plaintiffs in October 2017. Those injunctions are warranted against the third defendant: (a) because he did not secure Mr Cochrane’s vote of approval before carrying into effect the Shareholders’ Resolutions; and (b) because he ceased to be a director of all of the plaintiffs in September 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 The injunctions are not directed at a litigant in foreign proceedings but only against two persons who, it could be said, continue to be in a position to exercise control over the plaintiffs, either as a shareholder or as a director. Accordingly, I do not accept that making the interim inunctions permanent has the same effect as an anti-suit injunction.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Nature of the injunction</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 In any event, as the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Oro Negro (</span><span class="font-italic">CA)</span> at [1]–[2], an injunction granted to enforce a negative covenant in a contract is not to be classified as an anti-suit injunction simply because one of its effects is to<span class="font-italic"> </span>restrain a person from commencing or maintaining foreign proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 The proper classification of the injunction is not a mere matter of form. The legal principles governing the court’s discretion to grant each class of injunction are substantively different. In an application for an anti-suit injunction, considerations of comity take centre stage. That is because the anti-suit injunction is intended to affect a foreign court, albeit indirectly. Therefore, the power to grant an anti-suit injunction must be exercised with caution. That is so, even if the injunction is, in form and substance, directed <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">personam</span> to the defendant and not to the foreign court (see <span class="font-italic">Société Nationale </span><span class="font-italic">Industrielle Aerospatiale v Lee Kui Jak</span> [1987] AC 871 at 892C and 892F; approved in <span class="font-italic">John Reginald Stott Kirkham and others v Trane US Inc and others </span>[2009] 4 SLR(R) 428 (“<span class="font-italic">Kirkham</span>”) at [25]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 But where foreign proceedings are commenced or maintained in breach of a negative covenant in a contract, the court will not be diffident in granting an injunction simply because one of its effects will be to restrain the defendant from commencing or maintaining the foreign proceedings (see <span class="font-italic">Kirkham</span> at [29]). That is so whether the contract containing the negative covenant is between the parties to the litigation (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Sun Travels &amp; Tours Pvt Ltd v Hilton International Manage (Maldives) Pvt Ltd</span> [2019] 1 SLR 732 at [67]–[68]) or between a party to the litigation and a person who it could be said is entitled to act as its agent in commencing and maintaining the litigation (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Oro Negro (CA)</span> at [101]–[102]). The critical point in both situations is that the court grants the injunction as a remedy for a breach of contract, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, as redress for a substantive civil wrong within its jurisdiction that has been established on the merits in civil proceedings properly brought before it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 In <span class="font-italic">Oro Negro (CA)</span>, the Court of Appeal restored the interim injunctions which had been granted at first instance. It held that the injunctions were sought, not to restrain the first and third defendants from maintaining the<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Concursos</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>but to enforce Art 115A (see <span class="font-italic">Oro Negro </span>at [100]). In that sense, the intent of the interim injunctions was merely to restrain the first and third defendants from claiming to act on behalf of the plaintiffs, all of whom are Singapore companies, and not to affect the Mexican courts directly or even indirectly. As such, no considerations of comity were engaged at all.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Oro Negro (CA)</span> was considering whether to restore the interim inunctions on the principles applicable to the grant of <span class="font-italic">interim</span> injunctions. I am considering whether to make those interim injunctions <span class="font-italic">permanent</span>. Therefore, with respect, the Court of Appeal’s analysis in <span class="font-italic">Oro Negro (CA)</span> is strictly speaking <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> on the issue before me. Nevertheless, I consider that the same analysis must apply to the grant of permanent injunctions. Art 115A is a negative covenant in each plaintiff’s constitution. Each of the plaintiff is a Singapore company. As a matter of Singapore law, Art 115A obliges the third defendant not to cause each plaintiff – by purporting to be its director and agent – to carry into effect the Shareholders’ Resolution for that company, given that Mr Cochrane had not given his vote of approval. No considerations of comity are engaged as against the third defendant. Art 115A is also the basis of a duty in tort on the first defendant – in relation to a Singapore company and under Singapore law – not to induce the third defendant to breach his implied contract with each plaintiff. No considerations of comity are likewise engaged as against the first defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 For these reasons, I do not consider that the permanent injunctions are properly classified as anti-suit injunctions even if one of their effects is to restrain the plaintiffs from maintaining the <span class="font-italic">Concursos</span> or commencing fresh <span class="font-italic">concursos</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Anti-enforcement injunction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 The third defendant submits, in the alternative, that the permanent injunctions are properly classified as a particular type of anti-suit injunction known as an anti-enforcement injunction.

</div> In making this submission, the third defendant relies on the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sun Travels &amp; Tours Pvt Ltd v Hilton International Manage (Maldives) Pvt Ltd</span> [2019] 1 SLR 732 (“<span class="font-italic">Sun Travels</span>”) to argue that the plaintiffs must establish exceptional circumstances in order to secure the permanent injunctions because they are anti-enforcement injunctions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 I do not accept the third defendant’s submission for two reasons.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186  The permanent injunctions, once again, rest only on considerations of Singapore contract law and company law as against the third defendant and on considerations of Singapore tort law and contract law as against the first defendant. The proceedings in Mexico, once again, operate on a separate and parallel plane. The permanent injunctions have nothing to do with <span class="font-italic">the </span><span class="font-italic">plaintiffs’</span> entitlement to enforce the decisions of the Mexican courts on that plane. The injunctions also have nothing to do with the first and third defendant’s power to enforce the decisions of the Mexican courts in their own right, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, not through the plaintiffs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 The permanent injunctions cannot properly be classified as anti-enforcement injunctions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) <span class="font-italic">Sun Travels</span> distinguished</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 In any event, even if the permanent injunctions are properly classified as anti-enforcement injunctions, I consider that this case can be distinguished from <span class="font-italic">Sun Travels</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 In <span class="font-italic">Sun Travels</span>, a party (Hilton) secured an arbitral award against another party (Sun) in an arbitration seated in Singapore. In December 2015, Hilton began proceedings to enforce the award in the Maldives, where Sun was incorporated, carried on business and therefore had its assets. While the enforcement proceedings were pending, and in breach of the arbitration agreement between Hilton and Sun, Sun commenced suit against Hilton in the Maldivian civil courts on the same subject matter as the award in Hilton’s favour. In March 2017, the Maldivian court entered judgment for Sun and against Hilton in terms opposite to the award. Hilton appealed against the March 2017 judgment. Meanwhile, Hilton had had to terminate the December 2015 enforcement proceedings on technical procedural grounds. In April 2017, Hilton commenced fresh enforcement proceedings against Sun. In June 2017, a Maldivian court dismissed the second enforcement proceedings, holding that the Maldivian civil judgment entered in March 2017 in Sun’s favour prevented the award from being enforced in the Maldives. Hilton then applied in Singapore for an anti-suit injunction against Sun. At first instance, a judge of the General Division granted Hilton a permanent injunction restraining Sun from relying on the March 2017 judgment. Sun appealed to the Court of Appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 The Court of Appeal set aside the injunction because Hilton had failed to seek the assistance of the Singapore court – as the court of the seat of the arbitration – before the Maldivian civil court went into the merits and entered judgment against Hilton in Sun’s Maldivian suit. Therefore, considerations of comity had reasserted themselves. Hilton was unable to make out exceptional circumstances justifying the Singapore courts restraining enforcement of the Maldivian judgment. The Court of Appeal therefore set aside the anti-enforcement injunction granted by the General Division (at [125]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 In my view, the plaintiffs’ application is distinguishable from <span class="font-italic">Sun Travels </span>on two grounds. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 First, the plaintiffs have not been guilty of any delay which results in considerations of comity reasserting themselves and therefore warrants exceptional circumstances to be demonstrated. The Court of Appeal noted in <span class="font-italic">Sun Travels</span> that the general rule is that an applicant seeking an anti-suit or anti-enforcement injunction has to do so without delay. Further, a plaintiff’s delay is not excused simply because it is making jurisdictional objections in the foreign courts (at [118]). As Leggatt LJ observed in <span class="font-italic">Aggeliki Charis </span><span class="font-italic">Compania Maritima SA v Pagnan SpA (The “Angelic Grace”) </span>[1995] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 87 (at [118]), to allow a plaintiff to make jurisdictional objections in a foreign court and then to seek injunctive relief in the forum only if the objections fail would be the “reverse of comity.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 The Court of Appeal accepted, in <span class="font-italic">Sun Travel</span><span class="font-italic">s</span>, that Sun had behaved vexatiously and oppressively by commencing the Maldivian suit. More importantly, the Court of Appeal accepted that Sun had breached a negative covenant in a contract over which the Singapore court had jurisdiction by doing so. But the advanced stage of Sun’s Maldivian suit and of Hilton’s enforcement proceedings by the time Hilton sought relief in Singapore meant that issues of comity had reasserted themselves. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Court of Appeal required Hilton to establish exceptional circumstances on the usual principles. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 In our case, the Guerra Lawyers commenced the <span class="font-italic">Concursos</span> in September 2017. The plaintiffs approached the Singapore court – as the court having jurisdiction over the plaintiffs and their constitutions as a matter of contract law and company law – in January 2018. The plaintiffs then pursued their claims for interim relief in Singapore in parallel with the Sainz Lawyers’ objections to the <span class="font-italic">Concursos</span> in Mexico. The first substantive decision of the <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> court was the decision to dismiss the Petitions in May 2018. No delay has occurred in this case to allow considerations of comity to reassert themselves. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 Second, the nature of the permanent injunctions that the plaintiffs seek is completely different from the permanent injunction which the General Division granted in <span class="font-italic">Sun Travels</span>. That injunction expressly and directly prevented Sun from relying on the March 2017 judgment. And it did so even though Hilton had participated in Sun’s suit leading up to that judgment and even though Sun had filed an appeal against that judgment. The permanent injunctions in this case do no more than restrain the first and third defendants from causing the plaintiffs to commence or maintain any <span class="font-italic">c</span><span class="font-italic">oncursos</span>. The plaintiffs, remain entirely able to enforce all the decisions of the Mexican courts, so long as they act in accordance with their constitution as interpreted and applied under Singapore law. The injunctions do not purport to restrain <span class="font-italic">the plaintiffs</span> – who are the putative litigants in the Mexican proceedings –<span class="font-italic"> </span>from enforcing any decisions of the Mexican courts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Interference with or nullification of Mexican judgments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 The third defendant submits that I should not grant the plaintiffs the final relief they seek because it will interfere with the execution of the Mexican judgments in Mexico or nullify the Mexican decisions. I do not accept that this is the effect of the permanent injunctions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 First, granting final relief to the plaintiffs will not interfere with or nullify the Mexican judgments. The relief I have granted, for the reasons I have given, has been granted by a Singapore court as a matter of Singapore law to vindicate causes of action arising and asserted under Singapore law and are directed – not against the plaintiffs or the Mexican courts – but against persons who it could be said continue to have the power to exert control over the plaintiffs as Singapore companies. I have not been asked to decide any issues of Mexican law and have not decided any issues of Mexican law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 Likewise, the Mexican courts in the consolidated <span class="font-italic">concursos</span> has thus far not been asked to decide any issues of Singapore law and have not decided any issues of Singapore law. In particular, the Mexican courts have not ruled on whether the first and third defendants continue – as a matter of legal reality – to have the power to exert control over the plaintiffs. The decision that the Mexican courts have made is only that – by a legal fiction permitted or mandated by Art 87 of the LCM and Mexican public policy – the Mexican courts are entitled to disapply or disregard Art 115A and cl 15.1(g) of the bond agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 Nothing in the final judgment I have entered can nullify anything done or to be done by the Mexican courts, unless the Mexican courts now choose to decide issues of Singapore law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 Second, even if the effect of the final judgment I have entered is to interfere with or nullify the Mexican judgments, this is not a relevant consideration. I have already established that the injunctions are neither anti-suit injunctions nor anti-enforcement injunctions. In view of this, considerations comity fall away.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Relief sought is futile </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 The third defendant next submits that this originating summons should be dismissed because the relief that the plaintiffs seek is futile bearing in mind the purpose for which the plaintiffs seek the relief. The submission proceeds on three grounds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 First, the third defendant submits that the Guerra Lawyers are not parties to this originating summons and will not be bound by any final relief which I grant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 Second, the third defendant submits that the primary purpose of the plaintiffs in commencing this originating summons is to secure relief which the plaintiffs can use to halt the <span class="font-italic">Concursos</span>. None of the declarations and injunctions that the plaintiffs seek will assist them in halting the <span class="font-italic">Concursos</span>. That is because the decisions of the Mexican courts have already resulted in the findings summarised at [69]–[70] above. This includes the Mexican court’s decision recognising the August 2017 powers of attorney as continuing in force and as sufficient to empower the Guerra Lawyers to maintain the <span class="font-italic">Concursos</span> as the plaintiffs’ agents. The only way in which any of those findings can be altered and the <span class="font-italic">Concursos</span> halted is by a subsequent decision of the Mexican courts, not by this court granting the plaintiffs final relief.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 Third, the third defendant submits that he plays no part in directing the steps that the Guerra Lawyers are taking in the consolidated <span class="font-italic">c</span><span class="font-italic">oncursos</span> purportedly on the plaintiffs’ behalf. He points to Guerra Lawyers’ evidence that they are “acting on behalf of the Plaintiff[s] independently and in what they deemed to be in the best interests of the Plaintiffs since the grant of the [August 2017 powers of attorney] to date”.

That also means that the Guerra Lawyers’ absence before me on this originating summons is therefore no bar to granting the final declaratory and injunctive relief to the plaintiffs that I have granted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 Second, whatever may be the intent of the plaintiffs in seeking the final relief, my intent is simply to grant them redress for causes of action under Singapore law which they have established before me and over which I have subject matter jurisdiction and against defendants over whom I have personal jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 Third, while it is an open question what the plaintiffs can do with this final judgement in Mexico, it remains the case that the plaintiffs are all companies incorporated in Singapore. The <span class="font-italic">C</span><span class="font-italic">oncursos</span> are proceeding on the basis that the plaintiffs’ centre of main interests is in Mexico. It is likely at some point that proceedings will have to be commenced in Singapore to recognise the <span class="font-italic">C</span><span class="font-italic">oncursos</span> as a “foreign proceeding” within the meaning of Art 2(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the Third Schedule (the “Third Schedule”) of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 (2020 Rev Ed). The Third Schedule sets out the terms on which the Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (30 May 1997) (the “Model Law”) promulgated by the UNCITRAL has been enacted as part of Singapore law. The extent to which those who are now and then exerting control over the plaintiffs have complied with the interim injunctions restored by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Oro Negro (CA)</span> and the permanent injunctions that I have now granted will be a relevant factor for the Singapore court in deciding whether extend recognition under the Model Law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 Fourth, I simply do not accept that the Guerra Lawyers are conducting the <span class="font-italic">Concursos</span> independently of both the first defendant and the third defendant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 For all of the foregoing reasons, I have allowed the plaintiffs application for final relief in this originating summons and entered final judgment against the first defendant and the third defendant in the terms set out at [78] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 I have also ordered the first and third defendants to pay to the plaintiffs a single set of the plaintiffs’ costs of and incidental to this application, such costs fixed at $25,000 including disbursements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 The assessment of the damages payable by the first and third defendants to the plaintiffs has been adjourned pending the third defendant’s appeal against my judgment. Subject only to the assessment, Originating Summons 126 of 2018 is now concluded at first instance.</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left">Vinodh Coomaraswamy<br/>Judge of the High Court</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ajaib Hari Dass, Ragini Parasuram and Shawn Tien (Haridass Ho &amp; Partners) for the plaintiffs;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The first defendant unrepresented;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Paul Seah, Siew Guo Wei, Natalie Ng and Grace Ho (Tan Kok Quan Partnership) for the third defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
