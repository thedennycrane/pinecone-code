BWG subsequently formed the view that, despite its performance of its obligations under the contract, BWF had failed to pay its invoice of US$30,245,600. There is no dispute that this sum of US$30,245,600 remains unpaid.

Notwithstanding this, BWG served a statutory demand on BWF. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 By the present originating summons, BWF sought to restrain BWG from bringing winding up proceedings against it, being of the view that the contract between parties obliged them to proceed to arbitration to deal with their various disputes.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Parties were introduced to each other by a Singapore-incorporated company dealing in fuels and related products (“BWX”). BWF’s case is that, in order to facilitate a wider transaction between BWG and BWX, between 10 to 13 April 2018, BWX, through its oil trader Mr Shi, approached BWF’s deputy director Mr Bui through a series of telephone conversations and WhatsApp chat messages to offer BWF a position as an intermediary between BWG and BWX. As such an intermediary, BWF’s role was to pay BWG upon payment by BWX,

</div> and did not take on any of the operational, credit risks or liabilities related to the wider transaction. 400,000 net U.S. barrels of Lula normal crude oil (“the Cargo”) was to be sold by BWG to BWF and thereafter, by BWF to BWX using two separate agreements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 On 13 April, after Mr Bui confirmed BWF’s participation with Mr Shi, a trader in BWG’s employ, Mr Chew contacted Mr Bui by WhatsApp with what he termed a “Deal Recap”. This Deal Recap was then sent to Mr Bui over email, followed by an amended Deal Recap, a series of documents being exchanged from 19 to 24 April, and finally, a facsimile from BWG to BWF on 27 April 2018. This facsimile on 27 April is the contract (“the Contract”) upon which the invoice of US$30,245,600, and later disputed statutory demand, rests. The Contract is silent on BWF’s role as an intermediary and responsibility to pay BWG only when paid by BWX. Clause 12 stipulates that it is governed by English law and disputes are to be referred to arbitration in London. The onward contract between BWF and BWX (the “BWF-BWX Contract”) was finalised by facsimile on 3 May 2018.

The contention was that this transaction in question involved the purchase of cargo from Petrobas, to Hai Yuan, and on to Haike. Unauthorised copies of the documents had been made by an employee of Haike, which were then used as source documents to create the documents that were used in this case. Ms Li believed that the present transaction was a phantom trade, creating only an impression of a physical trade, in order for BWX to obtain a loan from BWG.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  BWG’s Written Submissions on CWU 260/2018, tendered on 29 November 2018, p 2.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This contention had variations more fully detailed below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 I held that the existence of a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> dispute was sufficient for the court to grant the injunction sought. While a clear admission on liability and quantum or other abuse of court process would disentitle BWF to the benefit of the arbitration clause, such was not the case here. At the same time, in view of the variance in High Court decisions on the applicable standard, I considered whether the other defences raised substantive triable issues. I also concluded that they did. In respect of CWU 260/2018 brought by BWF against BWX, I was of the view that these proceedings had no bearing on the application. I therefore granted the injunction sought. My reasons follow.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable standard</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I start with the threshold issue of the applicable standard for an injunction in these circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Bona fide prima facie dispute</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In <span class="font-italic">BDG</span>, the High Court rejected the standard of triable issues in favour of that of a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> dispute. Agreeing with the approach of the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Salford Estates</span><span class="font-italic"> (No 2) Ltd v Altomart Ltd (No 2) </span>[2015] Ch 589 (“<span class="font-italic">Salford</span>”), the court held that so long as there was a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> dispute that was subject to an arbitration agreement, and there were no indications that issues were not raised <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>, the court should grant an injunction to restrain winding up proceedings (see [21] and [23] of <span class="font-italic">BDG</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The court observed, at [22], that while the objective of the triable issue standard was “to ensure that winding-up is not staved off on flimsy or tenuous grounds”, that objective was less pressing in the face of an arbitration clause where the “countervailing concern is to hold parties to their agreement if they have made a bargain that disputes are to be arbitrated…”. Although the learned judge acknowledged the possibility that the lowered standard of a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> dispute may cause an increase in the number of applications by companies desperate to fend off their creditors and stymie the winding-up regime in Singapore, he noted at [23] that: first, if issues were not raised <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>, then there would be no <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> dispute; and secondly, any apparent injustice suffered by the creditors would have to be assessed in the context of the bargain struck between the creditors and the company in the agreement containing an arbitration clause.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Following this decision, Harris J in the Hong Kong Court of First Instance took the same position in <span class="font-italic">Lasmos Ltd v Southwest Pacific Bauxite (HK) Ltd</span> [2018] HKCU 702 (“<span class="font-italic">Lasmos</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Substantial dispute</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In <span class="font-italic">VTB</span>, the defendant opposed a winding up application by the plaintiff on the basis that there was a disputed debt between them that was governed by an arbitration agreement. It was argued that the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Metalform Asia</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Holland Leedon Pte Ltd </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 268 (“<span class="font-italic">Metalform Asia</span>”) was binding on the High Court. <span class="font-italic">Metalform Asia</span> concerned a debtor company seeking an injunction to restrain a winding up application by a creditor of an undisputed debt. There, the appellant argued that it had a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> cross-claim on substantial grounds which exceeded the undisputed debt, and that an injunction should be granted on that basis. The learned judge found, at [58], that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">… Metalform </span>stands for the principle that <span class="font-italic">even if</span> there is a dispute between the parties which goes to the crux of the applicant-creditor’s winding up petition <span class="font-italic">and</span> such dispute is governed by an arbitration agreement, the standard of proof is that of triable issues. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Vinmar</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 <span class="font-italic">Vinmar Overseas (Singapore) Pte Ltd v PTT International Trading Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 2 SLR 1271 (“<span class="font-italic">Vinmar</span>”) is a decision of the Court of Appeal that was not brought to the attention of the Court in <span class="font-italic">VTB</span>. I was of the view that it followed from <span class="font-italic">Vinmar</span> that the relevant standard ought in principle to be that of a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> dispute. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I start with reference to party autonomy, first emphasised by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tjong Very Sumito</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Antig Investments Pte Ltd </span>[2009] 4 SLR(R) 732 (“<span class="font-italic">Tjong Very Sumito</span>”) at [28]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">An unequivocal judicial policy of facilitating and promoting arbitration has firmly taken root in Singapore…More fundamentally, <span class="font-italic">the need to respect party autonomy (manifested by their contractual bargain)…has been accepted as the cornerstone underlying judicial non-intervention in arbitration</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In <span class="font-italic">Tjong Very Sumito</span>, the Court of Appeal held at [46] that in situations involving a stay of court proceedings in favour of arbitration under s 6 of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”), a “merely asserted dispute suffices to warrant a stay of court proceedings without any inquiry into the genuineness or merits of the defence”. The Court declined to investigate the merits of a defence on the basis that a dispute exists as long as one party disputes or denies a claim, regardless of how easily that party can be proven wrong (see [44] of <span class="font-italic">Tjong Very Sumito</span>). In the words of Saville J in <span class="font-italic">Hayter v Nelson and Home Insurance Co</span> [1990] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 265 at 268, which was cited in <span class="font-italic">Tjong Very Sumito</span> at [44]:  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Two men have an argument over who won the University Boat Race in a particular year.

It held that where there was an exclusive jurisdiction clause, Singapore courts, when considering whether there was strong cause to refuse a stay (“the strong cause test”), should disregard the merits of the parties’ cases. This marked a departure from a long line of Singapore decisions that began with <span class="font-italic">The Jian He</span> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 432 (“<span class="font-italic">The Jian He</span>”). <span class="font-italic">The Jian He</span> line of decisions held that a relevant factor under the strong cause test was whether the party seeking a stay had a genuine defence (see [84]–[94] of <span class="font-italic">Vinmar</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The court highlighted that “the rule in <span class="font-italic">The Jian He</span> is inconsistent with the central principle of party autonomy that pervades the law in this field”, and that dismissing an application for a stay of proceedings based on an exclusive jurisdiction clause simply because there is no genuine defence would fail to give effect to the parties’ agreement (see [114] of <span class="font-italic">Vinmar</span>). The Court of Appeal also alluded at [119] to the desirability of coherence in the law achieved by aligning the law governing exclusive jurisdiction clauses, <span class="font-italic">forum non convenience</span> and International Arbitration Act applications: across these various areas, the merits of the defence would be irrelevant on the issue of a stay.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 This principle of party autonomy is relevant to the facts at hand, unless the insolvency context prevents its application. Would the interfacing issue of the company winding up regime pose a countervailing point of principle? <span class="font-italic">Chimbusco</span> explains at [22] that a bankruptcy court should be able to have recourse to the summary judgment standard in order to protect the interest of a meritorious creditor; otherwise, a creditor would have to incur additional costs by having to safeguard his interests in different proceedings. If a bankruptcy court were to dismiss outright a bankruptcy application on the strength of a shadowy case, the creditor would be put to the further expense and inconvenience of filing a writ and a statement of claim and making a summary judgment application, whereupon the very same issues that were canvassed before the bankruptcy court would have to be rehearsed in detail. That is the rationale behind the use of the substantive defence standard. Where parties have agreed to an arbitration clause, however, this principle is not in play: there is another that must be considered. This is that parties have chosen, ahead of disputes arising, how they would wish such disputes to be dealt with. In absence of contrary intent, such disputes must include any that would create cause, or give <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> on the part of a creditor, to wind up the other party. To put the point another way, <span class="font-italic">Tjong Very Sumito</span> suggests it is an abuse of process to resort to judicial facilities where parties have agreed otherwise (see [19], [71]). A creditor who wishes to file winding up proceedings knowing that the debt which is its premise is the subject of a dispute which was earlier agreed to be arbitrated, would be misusing judicial facilities if good reason to renege upon his contractual bargain is absent. The principle in focus where an arbitration clause is engaged is that of party autonomy, and it extends into the insolvency context. To hold otherwise, as pointed out by Sir Terence Etherton C in <span class="font-italic">Salford</span> at [40], would encourage parties to bypass the arbitration agreement as a standard tactic by presenting a winding up petition, thereby pressuring the alleged debtor with the draconian threat of liquidation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 One issue remains, which is whether <span class="font-italic">Metalform</span><span class="font-italic"> Asia</span> is binding on the High Court on this very question. <span class="font-italic">VTB</span> held that it was. In <span class="font-italic">Metalform Asia</span>, there was a cross-claim that was to be referred to arbitration; it was on this basis that the court decided that winding up proceedings should be restrained to allow for the arbitrator to first determine the quantum of the cross-claim, and whether it was equal to or in excess of the undisputed debt (see <span class="font-italic">Metalform Asia</span> at [89]). The Court of Appeal decided that the applicable standard to stay court proceedings in situations where there was a genuine cross-claim, was the “unlikely to succeed” standard (see <span class="font-italic">Metalform Asia</span> at [87]),  which has been subsequently noted to be no different from the triable issues standard (see <span class="font-italic">Denmark Skibstekniske Konsulenter A/S I Likvidation (formerly known as Knud E Hansen A/S) v Ultrapolis 3000 Investments Ltd (formerly known as Ultrapolis 3000 Theme Park Investments Ltd)</span> [2011] 4 SLR 997 at [26]); <span class="font-italic">VTB</span> at [55]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In <span class="font-italic">Paal Wilson &amp; Co A/S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal (The Hannah Blumenthal)</span> [1983] 1 A.C. 854, Lord Denning describes the task of distinguishing between <span class="font-italic">ratio decidendi</span> and <span class="font-italic">obiter dicta</span> as “formidable” and, in certain cases where appellate courts write single judgments, “exceedingly difficult” for lower courts. In my respectful opinion, <span class="font-italic">Metalform Asia</span>’s <span class="font-italic">ratio</span> could be distilled into the following: the existence of security does not reduce the quantum of a cross-claim, a partially secured cross-claim was still a cross-claim for the amount claimed; a cross-claim calls into question the <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> of a creditor to wind up a company on the same basis as a disputed debt; and that the standard applicable where an application was made to stay a winding up petition on the basis of a serious cross-claim on substantial grounds, being “unlikely to succeed”, ought also to be the standard applicable in deciding an application to restrain the filing of a winding-up petition. The significance of an arbitration clause was not directly engaged in <span class="font-italic">Metalform Asia</span><span class="font-italic">;</span> dealing with the arbitration clause in the cross-claim was not a necessary step to the Court of Appeal’s decision. No arguments were mounted on the significance of the cross-claim’s submission to arbitration with regard to the applicable standard for granting injunctions. Both parties in <span class="font-italic">Metalform Asia</span> had agreed that the arbitrator was the proper adjudicator for the cross-claim issue (see [89] of <span class="font-italic">Metalform Asia</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I held, therefore, that the relevant standard was that of a <span class="font-italic">bona fide prima facie</span> dispute. I turn, then, to explain why this standard was met on the facts of this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Application of the threshold standard on the facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 What may form the content of a <span class="font-italic">prima facie bona fide</span> dispute? Taking reference from the Court of Appeal’s preference, highlighted in <span class="font-italic">Vinmar</span> at [119], for coherence in the law relating to exclusive jurisdiction, <span class="font-italic">forum non convenience</span> and arbitration applications, I am of the view that I should draw guidance from the Court of Appeal’s articulation of the approach to be applied in <span class="font-italic">Tjong Very Sumito</span> and <span class="font-italic">Vinmar</span>. These decisions make clear that a court need not be concerned with the merits of parties’ arguments when considering whether there is a <span class="font-italic">bona fide prima facie</span> dispute<span class="font-italic">. </span>Mere allegations of dispute would not suffice; only where an applicant for a stay is guilty of an abuse of process would the Court decline to grant a stay (see <span class="font-italic">Tjong Very Sumito</span> at [59]; <span class="font-italic">Vinmar</span> at [131]). In <span class="font-italic">BDG</span>, the High Court considered and dismissed contentions made on abuse of process, at [32]. An example of abuse raised in <span class="font-italic">Tjong Very Sumito </span>at [59] and [61], which was subsequently affirmed in <span class="font-italic">Vinmar</span> at [131], was that of an applicant who had made a clear and unequivocal admission as to both the liability and quantum of a claim, but seeks a stay for no reason other than its alleged inability to pay. Such an applicant cannot be said to have raised issues <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>, and his application for a stay would be refused. As the Court of Appeal noted, the threshold for abusive conduct is very high, and would only occur in exceptional situations (see <span class="font-italic">Vinmar</span> at [131]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 English and Hong Kong authorities do not differ. Explaining the effect of <span class="font-italic">Salford</span> at [10] of <span class="font-italic">Eco Measure Market </span><span class="font-italic">Exchange Ltd v Quantum Climate Services Ltd</span> [2015] BCC 877, Alan Steinfeld QC sitting as a deputy High Court judge in the Chancery Division stated: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">What the Court of Appeal decided in clear terms in the <span class="font-italic">Salford Estate</span> case was that, where there is an arbitration clause, it is sufficient to show that the debt is ‘disputed’ and for that it is sufficient to show that the debt is not admitted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Reasons could also arise out of the insolvency context. Harris J in <span class="font-italic">Lasmos</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> at [29]-[30], reiterated <span class="font-italic">Salford</span>’s approach that arbitration clauses are relevant to the court’s exercise of discretion, they do not oust the winding up jurisdiction. Therefore, “exceptional” circumstances could still exist for the continuation of winding up proceedings. For example, there could be an urgent need to appoint independent persons to investigate potentially misappropriated assets that were missing from the company, or a substantial concern that there had been fraudulent preferences, or a need to engage the statutory avoidance provisions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Of the various issues raised in this case, two had potential to “exclude the existence of a dispute”, as framed by <span class="font-italic">Tjong Very Sumito</span> at [61].

I turn, first to this.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether BWF has made an admission</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The Court of Appeal made clear in <span class="font-italic">Tjong Very Sumito</span> at [63], that an admission must be clearly stated, and must extend to both liability and quantum. This approach is premised on the wish to limit judicial intervention in arbitration: “Even admitted (but unsatisfied) claims may evolve into disputes that warrant arbitration in accordance with the existing agreement to arbitrate.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 BWG argued that BWF had admitted to the Disputed Debt in correspondence with it,

</div>
</div>
</div> As this was raised for the first time at the hearing and the facts of CWU 260/2018 were not before the court, I allowed further written submissions on this point. In due course, four new arguments were raised instead. Counsel for BWG appeared to concede that estoppel was inapplicable, and that his four new arguments did not affect the validity of BWF’s argument that their liability to pay was triggered only when paid by BWX.

</div> BWG’s four supplementary issues were as follows: waiver by election; approbation and reprobation; lack of clean hands on BWF’s part; and abuse of process. After considering these submissions and CWU 260/2018, I was of the view that they did not assist BWG. I explain briefly why. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">Waiver by election</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 It was common ground that three requirements were necessary before waiver by election could apply: (i) a concurrent existence of two inconsistent sets of legal rights; (ii) knowledge of the facts which have given rise to the two sets of rights as a prerequisite to election; and (iii) an unequivocal representation by the party making the election in relation to the right or remedy being waived (see <span class="font-italic">UAM v UAN</span> [2018] 4 SLR 1086 at [45]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In my view, there was no inconsistency in BWF’s assertion of its rights. The essential factual material supporting its winding-up claim against BWX was the Settlement Agreement that was entered into, rather than a claim for price under the BWF-BWX Contract for the delivery of the Cargo. As to knowledge, it appears that BWF only came to a new understanding of the underlying transaction around August 2018. More importantly, it is at once plain that the steps taken by BWF to enforce its rights against BWX did not at any point in time amount to an unequivocal representation that it would <span class="font-italic">waive</span> any rights it possessed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">Approbation and reprobation</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 There is no dispute that the doctrine of approbation and reprobation, as stated by Belinda Ang J in <span class="font-italic">Treasure Valley Group Ltd v Saputra Teddy and another</span> <span class="font-italic">(Ultramarine Holdings Ltd, intervener) </span>[2006] 1 SLR(R) 538 at [31], entails that a person who, “having accepted a benefit given him by a judgment cannot allege the invalidity of the judgment which conferred the benefit”. While no judgment has yet been obtained in this case, BWG argued that following the English decisions such as <span class="font-italic">Express Newspapers v News (UK) Ltd</span> [1990] 1 WLR 1320, and <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra Limited and Haysport Properties Limited v Lloyds Bank Plc</span> [2018] EWHC 672 (Ch), English law has embraced a version of the doctrine of approbation and reprobation that has been extended to be of general application (“the extended doctrine”).

</div> This extended doctrine would not be limited to situations where the relevant benefit was obtained in a prior judgment, and could be applied to situations where inconsistent positions are taken. Reliance was also placed on the decision of <span class="font-italic">Likpin International Ltd v Swiber Holdings Ltd and another</span> [2015] 5 SLR 962 where Steven Chong J (as he then was) frowned upon inconsistent positions being taken across cases even where the doctrine did not strictly apply. It was BWG’s position that, even if the doctrine were not strictly applicable, the court should take a dim view of BWF taking inconsistent positions in CWU 260/2018 and the present proceedings.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Two distinctly inconsistent positions would be required to have been adopted in CWU 260/2018 and in this application for this issue to merit consideration at all. But BWF’s premise of its action against BWX in CWU 260/2018 was not a claim for price under the BWF-BWX Contract. BWF was in CWU 260/2018 relying on the Settlement Agreement, which is a separate contract altogether between BWF and BWX. BWF’s assertion that the underlying contracts between BWG and BWX could be suspect was not therefore inconsistent. For completeness, I also considered whether an argument could be made that BWF’s arguments in this setting aside would suggest that the Settlement Agreement wholly lacked consideration, because the Settlement Agreement, which is the premise for CWU 260/2018, compromises previously assumed liability arising out of the BWF-BWX Contract. However, CWU 260/2018 is at a preliminary stage, as is this dispute between parties. No assertion has yet been made by BWF in respect of the consideration for the Settlement Agreement nor has BWX or any party in the CWU made any assertion that the Settlement Agreement is not valid in any way that BWF has been required to counter. And perhaps rather fundamentally, BWF does not seek to prove any assertion – whether inconsistent or otherwise – in the present application, but merely to make the point that the proper forum to look into or make findings on any such assertions would be arbitration. Whether, at that point, BWF may advance its contentions, is an issue to be dealt with under English law by an arbitrator in London. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">Lack of clean hands</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 BWG argued that BWF should be denied its requested injunction as it had acted inequitably in denying that it owed BWG the Disputed Debt, commencing winding-up proceedings against BWX despite maintaining that it did not owe BWG for the same Cargo, and initially refusing to present the affidavit that it had filed in support of CWU 260/2018 on the basis that those proceedings were irrelevant to the present decision.

</div>
</div> To make such an argument, BWG must demonstrate that BWF’s conduct was related to the equity sued for, and reflected “a depravity in the legal as well as moral sense” (see the Court of Appeal’s guidance in <span class="font-italic">EC Investment Holding Pte Ltd v Ridout Residence Pte Ltd and others and another appeal</span> [2012] 1 SLR 32 at [92]). I am of the view that at this stage, BWG’s assertions concerning BWF’s purportedly inequitable conduct falls far short of the required standard.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">Abuse of process</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 To support contentions on abuse of process, BWG sought to rely upon <span class="font-italic">Beckkett</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Deutsche Bank AG and another </span>[2011] 1 SLR 524, where a party commenced Indonesian proceedings in order to undermine the pending judgment of the Court of Appeal, and <span class="font-italic">Chandra Winata</span><span class="font-italic"> Lie v Citibank NA </span>[2015] 1 SLR 875, where a plaintiff attempted inconsistent pleadings, in circumstances where he knew or ought to know the facts, in a manner that offends common sense. Neither is applicable here. It is clear from <span class="font-italic">Vinmar</span> at [129], that while the concept of abuse of process pervades the whole law of civil procedure, a court in considering this issue in the context of a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> dispute, would not easily find that there has been an abuse of process. Abuse of process is a high threshold to be met in exceptional circumstances. BWG’s attempt to use abuse of process here, as a band-aid of sorts, was not persuasive. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Substantive defences raised by BWF</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The conclusions above were sufficient to conclude that parties ought to proceed to arbitration on the <span class="font-italic">bona fide prima facie</span> threshold.

BWF relied on chat logs from 13 April 2018 and 3 May 2018 that recorded conversations between Mr Bui and Mr Shi, who were acting on behalf of BWF and BWX respectively, to demonstrate that it had been operating under the assumption that the pay-to-be-paid arrangement was always in place.

The Contract was governed by English law. I had regard to the expert opinion of Sudhanshu Swaroop QC. He opined that the purpose of an entire agreement clause, as stated in <span class="font-italic">MWB Business Exchange Centres Ltd v Rock Advertising Ltd</span> [2018] 2 WLR 1603 at [14], is to nullify “prior collateral agreements relating to the same subject matter”.

As was reasoned in <span class="font-italic">Springwell Navigation Corporation v JP Morgan Chase Bank</span> [2010] EWCA Civ 1221 at [170], a party is taken to have “read and understood” the terms and conditions in an entire agreement clause when it signs it. In his opinion, the circumstances surrounding the conclusion of the written contract and the parties’ reasons must be carefully scrutinised before the legal effect of an entire agreement clause could be determined. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 BWG did not file an affidavit on English law, but nonetheless disagreed with Swaroop QC’s contention that the entire agreement clause may not be applicable in the light of the lack of a signature in the Contract.

In this case, BWF takes the position that the main terms were first agreed on 13 April, and the 27 April email contained pro forma details. Based on the (unrefuted) opinion of Swaroop QC, it was clear that it was possible at English law, despite the entire agreement clause, to raise BWF’s contentions of a side tripartite agreement. While BWG denied that it was party to this side agreement, Mr Chew only approached Mr Bui after matters were first designed by Mr Shi. Mr Shi, who brokered the deal between parties, may have had BWG’s authority to so conclude. It is crucial that the role of Mr Shi, who brokered the deal between BWF and BWG, be properly understood. He was in direct communications with Mr Bui and Mr Chew during the April period of negotiation, up to the conclusion of the written BWF-BWX Contract on 3 May 2018,

Regarding the substitution of a non-negotiable bill of lading, counsel for BWG relied on sub-clause A8 of the International Chamber of Commerce’s International Commercial Terms of 2000 (“INCOTERMS 2000”) for the proposition that a non-negotiable bill of lading would be sufficient as a “usual transport document”.

There are key differences between negotiable and non-negotiable bills of lading. For instance, where a non-negotiable bill of lading is used, the consignee needs to produce the bill of lading to obtain delivery from the carrier (see Indirra Carr, <span class="font-italic">International Trade Law</span> (Routledge, 5th Ed, 2014) at p 384). On its face, Clause 8.1 had not been complied with.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 BWF’s second contention, related to the first, was to whether BWG had title to the Cargo it sought to sell in the Contract. BWF contended that BWG had not tendered any evidence that BWG had obtained good title to the Cargo, or that delivery of the Cargo was in fact made to BWF. On the wording of Clause 8.1, without proper delivery of the Cargo, payment would not be due.

</div> Under Singapore law, an original bill of lading serves as a document of title (see <span class="font-italic">APL Co Pte Ltd v Voss </span><span class="font-italic">Peer</span> [2002] 2 SLR(R) 1119 at [48]; <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">“Cherry” and others</span> [2003] 1 SLR(R) 471 at [27]). As BWG delivered only copies of the non-negotiable bills of lading, not the original, such bills would, absent exceptional circumstances, be insufficient to constitute a document of title. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In response, BWG sought to argue that the doctrine of waiver by election applied because of emails sent by BWF between and on 17 April 2018 and 19 April 2018, 23 April 2018, and 24 April 2018 enclosing copies of the documents.

</div> For instance, BWG argued that BWF had acknowledged and accepted the adequacy of the loadport documents on 23 April 2018 by stating “Please find below discharge instructions for the subject delivery for vessels [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] kind compliance. Please forward the same to the Master of subject vessel”.

</div> Nevertheless, in the next line, BWF states “Kindly email us [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] following cargo documents urgently”, before proceeding to name the Cargo Manifest, the Certificate of Quality, the Certificate of Quantity and the Certificate of Origin. BWF has accordingly not made an unequivocal representation that it would accept the adequacy of the loadport documents; such an unequivocal representation is a necessary pre-requisite for the operation of the doctrine of waiver by election (see above at [49]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Rather interestingly, BWG’s response to BWF’s reliance on a side agreement was to contend that the Contract was the entire agreement, whereas BWG’s response to BWF’s reliance on the Contract was that the express provision of Clause 8.1 did not matter. Triable issues were made out regarding BFG’s title to the Cargo and the shipping documents used to trigger the payment condition specified in Clause 8.1.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the transaction was a disguised loan</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Undergirding BWF’s two contentions on Clause 8.1 was a more serious one, that BWX and BWG had engineered a circuitous transaction with BWF interposed as an intermediary trader, such that an amount of US $29,945,600 could be round-tripped from BWG to BWX.

</div>
</div>
</div> These purportedly misappropriated documents were to be tendered for payment under a letter of credit that BWG had established to “pay” for the Cargo. Ms Li, in particular, affirmed conversations with Hai Yuan’s general manager, a Mr Xu Yuan suggesting that Hai Yuan was the receiver named in the NOR tendered by BWG to BWF, and that the fake documents arose from unauthorised copies made by an employee of Haike.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 BWG disputed BWF’s claims, arguing that BWF had failed to adduce any evidence in support of its case, and that the mere fact that the Cargo was initially sold and bought by the same party is insufficient to render a contract illegal. While the evidence is rather thin on this point, and the illegality point is not properly framed, this defence is consonant with the first three raised. Clearly there is a triable dispute between parties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In summary, I held that BWF should be granted an injunction to restrain BWG from taking out winding-up proceedings. BWF’s additional prayer for the Statutory Demand to be set aside was not granted as this is a remedy appropriate to individuals confronting the threat of bankruptcy proceedings (as permitted by Rule 97(1) of the Bankruptcy Rules (Cap 20, R 1, 2006 Rev Ed)), rather than to companies dealing with threatened insolvency proceedings (see <span class="font-italic">BNP Paribas v Jurong Shipyard Pte Ltd</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 949 at [5] and [9]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Costs were ordered in favour of BWF. BWF asked for these to be ordered on an indemnity basis, on the footing that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tjong Very Sumito </span>decided that where a stay or injunction has been awarded as a remedy for a breach of an arbitration clause that had caused the innocent party reasonably to incur costs, those costs should ordinarily be awarded on an indemnity basis. The premise for the Court of Appeal’s position, explained by Colman J in <span class="font-italic">A v B (No 2)</span> [2007] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 358 at [15] (and referred to in <span class="font-italic">Tjong Very Sumito</span> at [19]), is that a defendant who deliberately ignores an arbitration clause so as to derive from its own breach of contract an unjustifiable procedural advantage misuses judicial facilities; and such behaviour merits judicial discouragement. This rationale did not apply on the facts of this particular application. In this specific winding-up context, parties transacted against a backdrop where there was a variance in High Court decisions on the effect of an arbitration clause. I therefore fixed costs on the standard basis on the basis that costs followed the event.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Coming then to the costs order made, a major component of the costs related to disbursements for Swaroop QC’s bill for an opinion on English law on the effect of a tripartite side agreement where an unsigned contract contained an entire agreement clause. Because the Contract was premised on English law, and BWG was relying on the entire agreement clause within the Contract in pressing on with its threat of liquidation, this was a reasonable disbursement. In addition, further submissions and an adjournment resulted from BWG raising for the first time an admission and estoppel argument premised on CWU 160/2018 at the first special date oral argument. Taking the various matters into consideration, costs for this application and Summons 5411/2018 (for which orders were obtained by consent), were fixed in the round, including disbursements, at $40,000.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left">Valerie Thean  <br/>Judge  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kendall Tan, Ting Yong Hong (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Nish Shetty, Keith Han (Cavenagh Law LLP) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
