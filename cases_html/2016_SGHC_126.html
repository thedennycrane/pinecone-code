</div> The plaintiff applied to set the award aside in 2014, arguing that there had been a breach of natural justice in the arbitration which had caused it prejudice. After hearing the parties’ submissions, and at the defendant’s invitation, I decided not to set the award aside but instead to suspend the setting aside proceedings and to remit the award to the tribunal. The purpose of the remission was for the tribunal to consider whether it was necessary or desirable, and if so to what extent, to receive further evidence or submissions on three specific issues (see [126] below) on which the plaintiff complained the tribunal had not afforded it a reasonable opportunity to be heard.

</div> The tribunal recorded its findings in an addendum to the award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Shortly after the tribunal issued the addendum, my suspension of these proceedings expired. The plaintiff’s application came back before me in 2015. The plaintiff argued that the tribunal’s addendum had failed to address the basis for its setting aside application and once again invited me to set aside the award. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 I have accepted the plaintiff’s submission and have set aside the award. I have done so because the tribunal dismissed the plaintiff’s claim on an issue which the defendant had never chosen to advance as part of its case. This issue was one which originated from the tribunal and which it put to the plaintiff’s counsel only in the course of his oral closing submissions. Despite having several opportunities thereafter to adopt the issue and to advance it as part of its own case, the defendant never did so. Indeed, it could be said that the defendant rejected this issue as part of its case by the forensic choices it made in pleading its case and presenting its submissions to the tribunal. Further, the tribunal did not direct the plaintiff to address this issue even though it formed no part of the defendant’s case. Finally, the plaintiff suffered prejudice because the tribunal’s decision on the ultimate issue before it – whether the defendant was liable in damages to the plaintiff for breach of contract – turned entirely on the tribunal’s finding against the plaintiff on this issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The defendant has appealed against my decision to set the tribunal’s award aside.

The purpose of the price-averaging arrangement was to allow JVL additional time to discharge its obligations to Agritrade under the High Price Contracts and also to average down the overall unit price at which it had bought and was to buy palm oil from Agritrade.

Each price-averaging exercise required the parties to discuss and agree two issues: (i) the quantity of palm oil which was to be shipped in that particular cargo; and (ii) the ratio in which the palm oil comprising that cargo was to be attributed to the palm oil deliverable under a selected High Price Contract and to the palm oil deliverable under a selected Market Price Contract. Once they had agreed these two issues, Agritrade would issue a revised contract for the total tonnage of palm oil comprised in that cargo. The unit price for the cargo would be equivalent to the average of the price per tonne of the palm oil under the selected High Price Contract and the selected Market Price Contract, weighted in accordance with the agreed ratio.

In this way, the overall unit price at which JVL purchased its supply of palm oil from Agritrade was to be averaged down over time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Over the ensuing months, as the parties carried out the price-averaging arrangement, some of the Market Price Contracts which they had entered into remained unperformed, even after their shipment dates had passed. These contracts have been called the “Unperformed Market Price Contracts”. The parties agreed to treat these Unperformed Market Price Contracts as though they were High Price Contracts and thereby to discharge them under the price-averaging arrangement.

First, the parties had to continue entering into fresh Market Price Contracts. This was essential. Without a queue of fresh Market Price Contracts – and in particular, without agreeing on the market prices to be reflected in those contracts – there could be no countervailing market price to average with the historical price reflected in the selected High Price Contract. Second, the parties had to negotiate and agree three commercial terms for each shipment of palm oil: (i) the tonnage to be shipped; (ii) the ratio in which that tonnage should be attributed to the selected High Price Contract and the selected Market Price Contract; and (iii) the shipment date.

If the parties failed or refused to cooperate, the price-averaging arrangement would necessarily break down. The breakdown of the price-averaging arrangement would give rise to a difficult question which the parties wholly failed to anticipate and address: what legal consequences were attached to the High Price Contracts and the Market Price Contracts which remained unperformed?

JVL had found itself in August 2008 committed to bad bargains under the High Price Contracts. Agritrade had agreed, at JVL’s request, not to hold JVL to those bargains and instead to allow JVL the opportunity to mitigate its overall price over time through the price-averaging arrangement. No doubt Agritrade derived a benefit for itself in doing so. But the fact remains that Agritrade was not obliged to do so at all. It could easily have given JVL an ultimatum either to perform each High Price Contract in accordance with its terms or to pay damages for its failure to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Over the next twenty-one months, JVL enjoyed the benefits of the price-averaging arrangement.

</div> This was possible only with Agritrade’s cooperation. Part of that cooperation included entering into the disputed contracts with JVL. On their face, the disputed contracts were unconditional, standalone contracts. But the parties’ commercial intention in entering into the disputed contracts was to perform them only subject to a price-averaging exercise. In the course of carrying out the price-averaging arrangement, and as a consequence of it, the parties deferred performance of the disputed contracts indefinitely.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 All five of the disputed contracts were entered into in 2009 for delivery in 2009. A year later, by mutual agreement, the disputed contracts remained to be performed. By then, however, the market price of palm oil had again moved significantly, but this time in JVL’s favour.

JVL’s case studiously ignored the price-averaging arrangement. It was, in effect, asking the tribunal to require Agritrade to sell palm oil to JVL in 2010 at the lower 2009 prices.

In its guise as a rule of evidence embodied in s 94 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (the “Evidence Act”), it has no application to arbitration. That is the express effect of s 2(1) of that Act. But in its guise as a doctrine which forms a part of Singapore’s substantive law of contract, the parol evidence rule applies to every contractual dispute which is resolved in accordance with Singapore law, whatever mode of dispute resolution is used. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Neither party had engaged with the parol evidence rule in its pleadings.

First, Agritrade could have characterised the price-averaging arrangement as a condition to which its performance obligation under the disputed contracts was subject. Alternatively, Agritrade could have characterised the price-averaging arrangement as a contract in its own right, running collateral to the disputed contracts and supported by consideration of its own. Both a condition precedent and a collateral contract are well established exceptions to the parol evidence rule, both at common law and under s 94 of the Evidence Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 This is not to say that either a conditional-contract defence or a collateral-contract defence would have been free of difficulty, let alone that it would have been bound to succeed. But both of these defences would have had the merit of being crafted to dovetail with the well-established exceptions to the parol evidence rule. To that extent, they were superior to the defences which Agritrade did deploy: the uncertainty defence and the mutual-termination defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Agritrade never advanced a case at any time – whether formally or informally – which characterised the price-averaging arrangement as a collateral contract.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Agritrade’s decision to abandon the mutual-termination defence was significant for four reasons. First, Agritrade was now running its uncertainty defence as an all-or-nothing defence. Its only defence now was that the disputed contracts were void for uncertainty. All of Agritrade’s eggs were now in the uncertainty basket. If the tribunal were to hold that these contracts were sufficiently certain to be binding, Agritrade could not, on its own case, escape being found liable to JVL.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Second, Agritrade’s entire case now was that the price-averaging arrangement governed only the <span class="font-italic">validity</span> of the disputed contracts: by depriving them of the certainty necessary for them to be contracts. It no longer alleged, through the abandoned mutual-termination defence, that the price-averaging arrangement governed in any way the <span class="font-italic">performance</span> of the disputed contracts: by giving rise to a mutual termination in lieu of performance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Third, Agritrade abandoned with the mutual-termination defence the only aspect of its case – pleaded or otherwise – which characterised the price-averaging arrangement as a <span class="font-italic">contract</span>. As an integral part of its mutual-termination defence, Agritrade expressly pleaded that the price-averaging arrangement was an “agreement” and that it comprised seven “express terms”.

</div> Once Agritrade abandoned its mutual-termination defence, it abandoned with it the assertion that the price-averaging arrangement was any sort of a contract, conditional, collateral, standalone or otherwise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Finally, a whole swathe of evidence ceased to be relevant in the arbitration. Agritrade’s decision to abandon the mutual-termination defence withdrew both of the following issues from the tribunal: (i) whether the price-averaging arrangement governed the <span class="font-italic">performance</span> of the disputed contracts as opposed to their <span class="font-italic">validity</span>; and (ii) whether the price-averaging arrangement was a contract in its own right of any sort whatsoever. Even before the tribunal received the evidence of the very first witness in the evidential phase, therefore, each party knew that it no longer needed to lead evidence in chief from its own witnesses or to cross-examine opposing witnesses on these two issues. Indeed, each party knew that any attempt to explore these two issues in the evidential phase would be met – quite correctly – by an objection either from the tribunal or from the opponent that the evidence to be elicited or the line of cross-examination was wholly irrelevant to the matters which remained in issue before the tribunal.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The parol evidence rule</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Even at this late stage, however, the elephant in the hearing room remained the parol evidence rule. Neither party had raised it, even at this late stage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 It ultimately fell to the tribunal itself to draw the parol evidence rule to the parties’ attention. It did so in an exchange with counsel on the third day of the evidential phase.

What I need to do, first, is to see if that rule will apply to my case. That is the first step which I need to take. The Evidence Act does not apply, but that does not necessarily mean the common law principles do not apply, so I need to deal with this straight on; and if they do apply, are there exceptions. That is what I need to achieve. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[SECOND ARBITRATOR]: As a matter of law, <span class="font-italic">you may invoke an exception, but you still have the evidentiary burden</span>, so that you must adduce evidence to show that your case comes within one of the exceptions. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">MR BAZUL: Sure. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I make three points about this exchange. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 First, by this exchange, the tribunal unequivocally and expressly put the parol evidence rule and its exceptions in play in the arbitration. The tribunal saw the parol evidence rule as a legal issue lying on the critical path to its ultimate decision. But the tribunal also realised neither party had pleaded reliance on the parol evidence rule or its exceptions. It therefore directed both parties, of its own motion and unequivocally, to consider the parol evidence rule and its exceptions and to address the tribunal in the course of the arbitration on both. It even ensured that Mr Bazul was aware that the evidential burden lay on him to adduce the evidence to establish whichever exception or exceptions he chose to rely on. Even after this exchange, it remained the case that reliance on the parol evidence rule was wholly unpleaded by JVL and that reliance on its exceptions was wholly unpleaded by Agritrade. But the rule was well and truly in play in the arbitration, by express direction of the tribunal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Second, although the tribunal’s exchange was directed at both parties, it is clear from the context that the tribunal initiated the exchange for Agritrade’s benefit. Thus, the first arbitrator begins the exchange by characterising his point as a question for Mr Bazul. Further, the presiding arbitrator concludes the exchange by asking Mr Bazul to confirm that he understands the tribunal’s point. It is obvious why that should be so. The parol evidence rule was not an impediment to JVL’s case. But the rule was fatal to Agritrade’s case, unless Agritrade was able to surmount it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Third, although the second arbitrator reminded Mr Bazul that he had the evidential burden of surmounting the parol evidence rule, that reminder cannot be read as the tribunal giving Agritrade <span class="font-italic">carte blanche</span> to adopt new and unpleaded defences in order to do so. The tribunal’s encouragement to Mr Bazul to grapple with the parol evidence rule must be read against the backdrop of Agritrade’s case at that time. By then, its case was confined to the uncertainty defence. If Agritrade wished to change tack and advance new defences in order to surmount the parol evidence rule, either instead of or in addition to its uncertainty defence, that was over and above the issues which had been put in play by this exchange. The tribunal would have to assess on separate criteria whether, and if so on what terms, that change of tack ought to be permitted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 It is true that the presiding arbitrator specifically raised the conditional contract exception to the parol evidence rule in this exchange with Mr Bazul. That exception posits a valid contract and is therefore fundamentally incompatible with Agritrade’s sole pleaded defence, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> uncertainty. But it is clear from the context that the presiding arbitrator raised the conditional contract exception by way of example to Mr Bazul rather than by way of suggestion or by way of invitation. In other words, the presiding arbitrator was not then permitting Mr Bazul to advance a defence which characterised the disputed contracts as conditional contracts subject to the price-averaging arrangement, or even suggesting to him that he should consider doing so. If Mr Bazul wished to do so, it was for him to adopt that as his case and to persuade the tribunal that he ought to be permitted to advance it at that late stage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In any event, it does not appear from this exchange that Mr Bazul foresaw any need to change tack.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The close of the evidential phase</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 When the evidential phase concluded, Mr Pillai expressly asked Mr Bazul to confirm on the record that Agritrade’s mutual-termination defence would not be revived. Mr Bazul gave the confirmation:

In particular, he did not qualify his confirmation by reserving his right to address the tribunal’s point by raising entirely new defences crafted specifically to surmount the parol evidence.

</div> It submitted that the disputed contracts were written agreements which contained all the essential terms for the sale and purchase of palm oil. Therefore a rebuttable presumption arose that the parties intended each document to contain all the terms of the parties’ agreement. The parol evidence rule precluded Agritrade from relying on evidence of the price-averaging arrangement to contradict, vary, add to or subtract from the terms of the disputed contracts. No exception to the parol evidence rule applied.

But in doing so, it went beyond the confines of its uncertainty defence. Instead, it advanced an entirely new and entirely unpleaded defence. Agritrade now submitted as an alternative to its uncertainty defence that Agritrade was not in breach of the disputed contracts because the price-averaging arrangement meant that Agritrade’s obligation to perform the disputed contracts was not yet due.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Assuming the Honourable tribunal finds that the [disputed contracts] were valid and binding contracts, [Agritrade’s] position is that it was not in breach of these agreements. This is because the performance of these [disputed contracts] had not become due yet. It had not become due yet as no price averaging exercise had been carried out. This was because the parties could not agree on an average price to ship out the palm oil. If the parties could eventually agree on a price, the palm oil for the [disputed contracts] would be supplied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Agritrade’s new defence amounted to an alternative assertion that the price-averaging arrangement governed the <span class="font-italic">performance</span> of the disputed contracts rather than their <span class="font-italic">validity</span>. Specifically, Agritrade was now advancing a case that, if the tribunal were to find the disputed contracts to be valid and binding, performance of its obligation under these contracts became due only after a price averaging exercise had been carried out. In other words, Agritrade’s new defence was that JVL’s assertion that a breach of contract had occurred was premature.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Agritrade’s prematurity defence was a significant departure from its case. It went beyond Agritrade’s uncertainty defence, the only defence which remained live on the pleadings. It even went beyond its mutual-termination defence, which it had abandoned at the outset of the evidential phase. According to the uncertainty defence, the disputed contracts were void from the outset. According to the mutual-termination defence, the disputed contracts were mutually terminated in 2009. The prematurity defence posited that the disputed contracts were valid when entered into and remained binding, up to the date of the arbitration and indeed beyond. Agritrade had never before advanced that proposition as part of its case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Agritrade also took the opportunity in its written submissions to deal with the argument that the parol evidence rule precluded it from relying on the price-averaging arrangement to establish either its uncertainty defence or its prematurity defence. It made two submissions on this issue: (i) the parol evidence rule did not apply; (ii) alternatively, if it did apply, an exception to the rule also applied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Agritrade’s primary submission on the parol evidence rule was that it was the parties’ intention, objectively ascertained, that the disputed contracts should not be complete contracts. Agritrade submitted that there is no rule of law excluding extrinsic evidence solely because a document is said to embody a contract and appears to be complete on its face. Whether that document in fact embodies a complete contract depends on the objectively-ascertained intention of the parties and not on any rule of law. Agritrade therefore invited the tribunal to look at the entire factual matrix, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> including the parties’ consensus on the price-averaging arrangement, in order to find objectively that they did not intend each disputed contract to embody a complete contract.

It did not take that opportunity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Indeed, it is possible to go further than that neutral statement and say that Agritrade took a considered decision not to advance the collateral contract exception as part of its case. I say that because Agritrade’s written submissions advanced only three exceptions to the parol evidence rule drawn from a list of six exceptions which included the collateral contract exception. Agritrade therefore chose to rely on those three exceptions, knowing that the collateral contract exception was also available. That is an implicit rejection of the collateral contract exception. In that sense, Agritrade’s rejection of the price-averaging arrangement as a collateral contract for the purposes of the exceptions to the parol evidence rule was entirely consistent with its rejection of the price-averaging arrangement as any sort of a contract when it abandoned its mutual-termination defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Agritrade thus allowed its first opportunity to advance the collateral contract exception as part of its case to pass it by.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Reply submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The parties exchanged written reply submissions in October 2012. JVL objected to Agritrade’s attempt to introduce the prematurity defence through its written submissions as a new and unpleaded defence, after the parties had presented their evidence and after they had made their submissions. JVL pointed out that the four-day evidential phase had proceeded on the basis that Agritrade’s sole defence was its sole <span class="font-italic">pleaded</span> defence, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> its uncertainty defence. For that reason, JVL had dealt with only the uncertainty defence in its written submissions. JVL urged the tribunal not to go beyond the parties’ pleadings and not to decide their dispute on a point on which the parties had adduced no evidence and made no submissions.

</div> In other words, it was Agritrade’s own case that the price-averaging arrangement had never been integrated into the parties’ bargain comprised in the Market Price Contracts, to be applied if the Market Price Contracts themselves – as opposed to the High Price Contracts – remained unperformed. The disputed contracts were, of course, all Market Price Contracts, not High Price Contracts. If the condition precedent at the heart of the prematurity defence was not integrated into the parties’ bargain, Agritrade’s recourse to the conditional contract exception was of no avail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 JVL dealt in its reply submissions only with the three exceptions to the parol evidence rule which Agritrade had relied upon. Thus, JVL made no submissions as to why the price-averaging arrangement could not be characterised as a collateral contract and thereby come within the collateral contract exception. But there was no reason for JVL to do so. JVL quite rightly dealt with only the three exceptions to the parol evidence rule on which Agritrade had chosen to rely; and quite rightly did not deal with any of the three exceptions on which Agritrade had chosen not to rely. As the tribunal had reminded Mr Bazul (see [52] above), Agritrade bore the burden of choosing and advancing the specific exceptions on which it wished to rely. It had chosen three specific exceptions to advance as part of its case. JVL quite naturally responded only to the case which Agritrade chose to advance under those three specific exceptions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Agritrade, in its written reply submissions, simply repeated its reliance on the same three exceptions to the parol evidence rule which it had dealt with in its written submissions (see [69] above):

The first arbitrator pointed out that this was neither party’s pleaded case “but might be a possible characterisation of what [had] happened”.

In these later exchanges, the tribunal simply put it to Mr Pillai that Mr Bazul “might” rely on the collateral contract exception or that JVL’s conduct “might” be characterised as raising an estoppel which had been terminated by reasonable notice. The conditional “might” used for both points is the language of a hypothetical being floated for discussion then and there, not of a direction being given for the future. In the earlier exchange, however, the tribunal expressly directed the parties to address it on the parol evidence rule and its exceptions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Mr Pillai concluded his oral submission very shortly after these exchanges.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Agritrade’s oral closing submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Mr Bazul then made his oral submissions. The bulk of his submissions either summarised his written submissions or dealt with a particular issue as to how the price-averaging agreement was to apply to a Market Price Contract which had become an Unperformed Market Price Contract, given that it would already have been the subject of a price-averaging exercise. Mr Bazul also dealt with questions from the tribunal on the scope of his prematurity defence. The tribunal was particularly troubled by the fact that this defence contemplated the parties waiting indefinitely for the Unperformed Market Price Contracts to be performed.

</div> Mr Bazul’s response was that it would be inequitable for JVL to rely on the strict terms of the disputed contracts even after giving reasonable notice of its intention to do so. This, he said, was because JVL had taken advantage of the price-averaging arrangement when the market turned against it in 2008 and would be behaving inequitably by attempting to disclaim the price-averaging arrangement when the market had turned in its favour in 2010. The terms in which this exchange commenced are important and I set them out:

Do you remember what I suggested to Mr Pillai: suppose a tribunal takes an alternative view of more or less the same scenario that you are describing, Mr Bazul, in factual terms, and the reason why is because there was an understanding between them that parties would not treat [the disputed contracts] as sacrosanct, and that the terms would be varied by the averaging process which would play itself out, as you say, over a certain period of time.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 This equitable estoppel point was the only point which the first arbitrator put to both Mr Pillai and Mr Bazul in the course of their oral submissions. Significantly, neither the first arbitrator nor the tribunal put the parol evidence rule or any aspect of it, including the collateral contract exception, to Mr Bazul during Mr Bazul’s oral submissions. Neither did Mr Bazul take the initiative during his oral submissions to pick up the first arbitrator’s point to Mr Pillai and to adopt the collateral contract exception as part of Agritrade’s case. Indeed, Mr Bazul did not address the parol evidence rule or any of its exceptions at all in his oral submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 This is surprising. The exchange between first arbitrator and Mr Pillai (see [80] above) indicated, at the very least, that one member of the tribunal considered that Mr Bazul “might” be able to rely on the collateral contract exception even though it was unpleaded and even though the tribunal had by then received all of the evidence and virtually all of the written and oral submissions. An observer might have expected Mr Bazul to grab the argument with both hands and inform the tribunal that he wished to adopt and advance it as his own. Yet he did not do that. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Agritrade thus allowed a third opportunity to advance the collateral contract exception as part of its case to pass it by.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">JVL’s oral reply submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In his oral reply submissions, Mr Pillai reiterated his position that Agritrade’s prematurity defence had not been pleaded, was brought up after the close of evidence and therefore ought to be disregarded by the tribunal. But he conceded that he had dealt with the prematurity defence in his reply written submissions.

Somewhat ironically, given what was to transpire, the tribunal said that it wanted to avoid a situation where a party was left with the impression that the tribunal had decided against it on an issue on which it was not given a chance to submit, or that the tribunal had precluded a party from arguing points it had never thought of.

In the penultimate sentence in this exchange, the first arbitrator did ask Mr Pillai and Mr Bazul to answer the question which he had posed to both parties. This is not a reference to the first arbitrator’s question about the collateral contract exception. The first arbitrator had posed that question only to Mr Pillai, and not to Mr Bazul (see [80] above). The first arbitrator is instead referring to his question about equitable estoppel (see [81] and [85] above). As I have pointed out (see [86] above), this is the only question which he put to both counsel at that hearing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In this exchange, the tribunal was expressing its concern that one or more of the points which it had raised in the course of both counsel’s oral submissions, and which were not the subject of the parties’ submissions, might be an issue on one of the critical paths to its ultimate decision.

</div>
</div>
</div> Both parties’ submissions dealt with the principle from <span class="font-italic">W</span><span class="font-italic">alford v Miles</span> in relation to the disputed contracts, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> whether the disputed contracts were (or were not) merely agreements to negotiate. Neither party made any submissions on whether the price-averaging arrangement was (or was not) a mere agreement to negotiate. This is not surprising: the issue of whether the price-averaging arrangement was a contract had ceased to be an issue before the tribunal when Agritrade withdrew its abandonment defence (see [49] above). It was therefore wholly immaterial to the issues before the tribunal whether the principle in <span class="font-italic">Walford</span><span class="font-italic"> v Miles</span> rendered the price-averaging arrangement a mere agreement to negotiate and therefore too uncertain to be a contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Agritrade could have taken the opportunity, in these submissions, to make an additional submission as to the effect in law of the principle in <span class="font-italic">Walford</span><span class="font-italic"> v Miles</span> on the price-averaging arrangement. JVL had, in response to the first arbitrator’s question on the collateral contract exception (see [80] above), rejected the collateral contract exception on the grounds that the price-averaging agreement was merely an agreement to agree. If Agritrade had now taken the opportunity to reject that rejection, so to speak, it could be said that Agritrade had raised the collateral contract exception as part of its case, albeit obliquely and at a very late stage. But it did not do that.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Agritrade thus allowed a fifth opportunity to advance the collateral contract exception as part of its case to pass it by.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The position before the tribunal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 After all the evidence and submissions were in, the position before the tribunal was as follows, if one were to leave aside the technicalities of pleading. The ultimate issue before the tribunal was whether Agritrade had breached one or more of the disputed contracts. That ultimate issue raised two subsidiary issues for the tribunal: (i) Agritrade’s uncertainty defence; and (ii) Agritrade’s prematurity defence. The uncertainty defence was pleaded; the prematurity defence was raised only in Agritrade’s written submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Each of Agritrade’s two defences relied on the price-averaging arrangement. They each therefore gave rise to a further subsidiary issue: whether the price-averaging arrangement was within the scope of the parol evidence rule. This issue, although it was neither formally pleaded nor informally advanced by either side as part of its case, was properly before the tribunal because the tribunal had directed both parties on the second day of the evidential phase to deal with this issue (see [52] above). The parties accordingly had every opportunity to make written and oral submissions on the applicability of the parol evidence rule and its exceptions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The tribunal’s direction to parties to grapple with the parol evidence rule, and its specific direction to Agritrade to grapple with the exceptions to the rule, gave rise to a final subsidiary issue: which, if any, exception to the parol evidence rule did the price-averaging arrangement fall within. On that, the burden of proof lay on Agritrade. That burden of proof required Agritrade to establish on the facts and the law how the price-averaging arrangement came within a given exception. But it also put an anterior burden on Agritrade: the burden to identify the exception on which it intended to rely. Agritrade discharged this burden by selecting three out of the six established exceptions to rely upon (see [69] above). At no time during the arbitration did Agritrade rely on the collateral contract exception. Only those three exceptions, therefore, were before the tribunal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 After the tribunal had floated the collateral contract exception in the course of Mr Pillai’s oral closing submissions (see [80] above), Agritrade had four clear opportunities to adopt and advance it as part of its case. Agritrade never did so. Whether the price-averaging arrangement was a collateral contract and therefore within that exception was not an issue which either party placed before the tribunal. It was also not an issue which the tribunal had specifically directed the parties to deal with, as it did in connection with the parol evidence rule itself (see [52] above) and the equitable estoppel point (see [90] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The final award</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The tribunal delivered its final award in October 2013. All three arbitrators agreed that the ultimate issue before them turned on whether the price-averaging arrangement was a collateral contract. The tribunal came to differing conclusions on this dispositive issue, and therefore split two to one on the ultimate issue of liability.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The majority, comprising the presiding arbitrator and the second arbitrator, dismissed JVL’s claim. They held that the price-averaging arrangement amounted to a collateral contract which was in law capable of varying the parties’ performance obligation under the disputed contracts notwithstanding the parol evidence rule. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The first arbitrator dissented. He would have awarded substantial damages to JVL. He held that the price-averaging arrangement was too uncertain to amount to a contract, and therefore could not be a collateral contract for the purposes of the collateral-contract exception to the parol evidence rule.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">List of issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 At the beginning of the award, the tribunal set out a list of eight issues which were before it for determination.

If the tribunal were to decide that the disputed contracts were sufficiently certain to be valid, it would inevitably have to go on and consider what the parties’ positions would be with respect to the performance of the contracts. In particular, the tribunal would have to decide: (i) whether performance of the contracts was subject to the price-averaging arrangement; and (ii) if so, whether Agritrade had breached the contracts.

These critical commercial terms were: (i) the ratio in which the two relevant prices were to be averaged to derive the unit price for a given cargo; (ii) the volume of each cargo; and (iii) the date for each cargo to be shipped. Further: (i) there was no agreement as to how far into the future the parties were to be obliged to continue applying the price-averaging arrangement to their dealings and (ii) there was no objective mechanism to break any deadlock if the parties failed to agree on these critical commercial terms while applying the price-averaging arrangement.

But instead of asking the tribunal for direction on how it wished to be addressed on whether to receive further evidence or submissions on the three issues (see [126] above), JVL somewhat peremptorily – and I must say, optimistically – asked the tribunal to enter a revised award in JVL’s favour. JVL gave the following four reasons: (i) the tribunal had unanimously rejected Agritrade’s uncertainty defence; (ii) that was the only defence which Agritrade had pleaded; (iii) Agritrade had never sought an opportunity to plead any other defence; and (iv) it was now far too late for Agritrade to seek that opportunity.

To succeed in its setting aside application, therefore, JVL has to establish that: (i) it did not have a fair hearing on either the collateral contract exception or the prematurity defence; (ii) that breach was connected to the making of the award; and (iii) that breach caused it prejudice. I will take each of the three elements in turn in respect of each of the two defences. I begin with the collateral contract exception. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Fair hearing and the opportunity to present one’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 Article 18 of the Model Law provides that each party “shall be given a <span class="font-italic">full</span> opportunity of presenting its case” (emphasis added). This confers no more and no less on a party than a right to have a <span class="font-italic">reasonable</span> opportunity to present its case (<span class="font-italic">ADG and another v ADI and another matter</span> [2014] 3 SLR 481 at [104]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 There are two aspects to a party’s reasonable opportunity to present its case: a positive aspect and a responsive aspect. The positive aspect encompasses the opportunity to present the evidence and advance the propositions of law on which it positively relies to establish its claim or defence, as the case may be. The responsive aspect encompasses the opportunity to present the evidence and advance the propositions of law necessary to respond to the case made against it. It is the responsive aspect of the opportunity to present its case which JVL alleges the tribunal denied it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 The responsive aspect of presenting a party’s case has itself two subsidiary aspects to it. The first is having notice of the case to which one is expected to respond. The other is being permitted actually to present the evidence and advance the propositions of law necessary to respond to it. A tribunal will therefore deny a party a reasonable opportunity to respond to the case against it if it either: (i) requires the party to respond to an element of the opposing party’s case which has been advanced without reasonable prior notice; or (ii) curtails unreasonably a party’s attempt to present the evidence and advance the propositions of law which are reasonably necessary to respond to an element of the opposing party’s case. But there is a third situation in which a tribunal will deny a party a reasonable opportunity to present its responsive case: when the tribunal adopts a chain of reasoning in its award which it has not given the complaining party a reasonable opportunity to address.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 It is the third aspect of the opportunity to present a responsive case which JVL alleges it was denied by a tribunal in connection with the collateral contract exception. It is the first aspect which JVL alleges it was denied by the tribunal in connection with the prematurity defence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The responsive aspect of an opportunity to present one’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 The dividing line between permissible robustness in arbitral reasoning and impermissibly denying a party a reasonable opportunity to present its responsive case is a fine one. It is true that the courts must guard against unmeritorious attempts by disappointed parties to set aside unimpeachable awards. But it is also true that, although the grounds on which a court may set aside an award are few in number and narrow in scope, they are fundamental in nature. The authorities show that whether a particular setting-aside application falls on one side of the dividing line or the other turns on whether there is a sufficient nexus between the chain of reasoning which the tribunal adopts and the case which the parties themselves have chosen to advance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 It goes without saying that a particular chain of reasoning will be open to a tribunal if it arises from the party’s express pleadings. Significantly, an issue raised in a party’s pleadings remains in play throughout the arbitration unless is expressly withdrawn, no matter how weakly the party may actually advance it. In <span class="font-italic">AUF v AUG</span><span class="font-italic"> and other matters </span>[2016] 1 SLR 859, a tribunal constituted under the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 1985 Rev Ed) awarded damages to an owner against a contractor by reference to the diminution in value caused by defects in the owner’s building rather than by reference to the cost of rectifying the defects. Although the owner had pleaded diminution in value as an alternative measure of its loss, the contractor alleged that the owner had effectively withdrawn that alternative measure from the tribunal by the manner in which it had presented its case. The contractor therefore submitted that the tribunal had denied the contractor natural justice by relying on diminution in value as the basis of its award (at [92]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 Belinda Ang J held that the claimant had never in fact unequivocally abandoned its case advancing the diminution in value measure (at [97]). Further, the tribunal had sought and received submissions from both parties on that alternative measure. As such, there was no basis established to set aside the award (at [100]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 A particular chain of reasoning will also be open to a tribunal if it is raised, not expressly, but by reasonable implication in a party’s pleadings. In <span class="font-italic">S</span><span class="font-italic">oh Beng Tee</span>, a tribunal decided that a five-day extension of time granted to a main contractor to complete a project was unreasonably short. But instead of going on to make a further finding as to the specific number of additional days necessary to make the extension reasonable, the tribunal decided that the employer’s acts of prevention had set the main contractor’s time entirely at large. The employer applied to set aside the award on the ground, among others, that the issue of whether time was at large as a result of the employer’s acts of prevention was not one which had been submitted to the tribunal or canvassed before it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 The Court of Appeal rejected the employer’s application for three principal reasons. First, the main contractors’ pleadings had, by reasonable implication, put the issue of whether time was at large as a result of the employer’s acts of prevention in play and alive in the arbitration (at [38]). The main contractor had asserted expressly in its pleadings that time had been set at large. Although this pleading arose in a different context (at [31]) and relied on acts other than those which the tribunal had relied upon for its decision (at [32]), the employer had in response pleaded expressly that time had not been set at large <span class="font-italic">on any grounds whatsoever</span> (at [34]). It was also the case that the factual bases for the tribunal’s finding that there were acts of prevention by the employer “were in play and fully alive throughout the proceedings”. The tribunal’s decision that time had been set at large was merely an inference from that factual finding and was well within its fact-finding powers (at [67]). Second, whether the consequence of the acts of prevention should be a finite or an indefinite extension of time were opposite sides of the same coin: they shaded into each other (at [68]). Finally, a finding that acts of prevention had set time at large was a foreseeable outcome in disputes of this nature, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> in disputes between an employer and a main contractor (at [69]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 Similarly, a particular chain of reasoning will be open to a tribunal even if it features nowhere in a party’s pleadings but it is in some other way brought to the opposing party’s actual notice. In <span class="font-italic">PT Prima International Development v </span><span class="font-italic">Kempinski Hotels SA and other appeals </span>[2012] 4 SLR 98 (“<span class="font-italic">Kempinski</span>”) a hotel manager commenced arbitration against a hotel owner asserting a breach of a hotel management contract and claiming either damages or specific performance as relief. Four years after arbitration had been commenced and three years after pleadings had closed, the owner discovered that the manager had entered into a new management contract with a third party. The owner now advanced the argument that the manager’s right to damages and specific performance was extinguished the moment it entered into the new management contract. The owner did so without amending its pleadings to rely on the new management contract and its legal effect on the manager’s claim as an issue in the arbitration. The tribunal accepted the owner’s unpleaded argument and issued a series of awards holding eventually that the manager’s claim wholly failed. The manager applied to the High Court to set aside the awards. The High Court judge set aside the tribunal’s award, holding that the tribunal had acted without jurisdiction because the owner had not amended its pleadings to rely on the new issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 The Court of Appeal allowed the owner’s appeal, holding that the manager had had sufficient actual notice of the issue despite the owner’s failure formally to plead it. In particular, the owner had advanced the issue as part of its case in correspondence with the tribunal. The tribunal had thereafter specifically directed both parties to address the issue in one procedural conference and in four emails. As the Court of Appeal said (at [50] – [51]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">50 … After [the owner] discovered that [the manager] had entered into the [n]ew [m]anagement [c]ontract, it raised the issue with the Arbitrator in a letter dated 28 March 2007 from its solicitors, and this resulted in an exchange of communications between the parties and the Arbitrator on: (a) 24 May 2007 (letter from [the manager’s] solicitors to the Arbitrator); (b) 2 July 2007 (letter from [the owner’s] then solicitors to the Arbitrator); and (c) 4 September 2007 (letter from [the manager’s] solicitors to the Arbitrator). The Arbitrator also informed the parties of the issues which he wanted them to address – in particular, the legal effect of the [n]ew [m]anagement [c]ontract – on the following occasions: (a) at the April 2007 Directions Conference (see [16] above); and (b) in his e-mails to the parties dated, respectively, 11 July 2007, 14 September 2007, 14 December 2007 and 20 February 2008. Finally, written submissions and expert opinions on the legal effect of the [n]ew [m]anagement [c]ontract were tendered by both parties. Vis-à-vis the written submissions, [the owner] and [the manager] filed their first round of written submissions on 26 October 2007; thereafter, [the manager] and the [owner] tendered their second round of submissions on 1 February 2008 and 5 February 2008 respectively.

In <span class="font-italic">TMM Division </span><span class="font-italic">Maritima SA de CV v Pacific Richfield Marine Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 4 SLR 972 (“<span class="font-italic">TMM</span>”), a ship purchaser commenced arbitration against a ship seller seeking the refund of the deposit it had paid under their contract. One of the issues in the arbitration was whether the seller’s breach of a particular term of their contract was a repudiatory breach entitling the purchaser to terminate the contract. The tribunal held that the term in question was not a condition, as submitted by the purchaser, but was instead a collateral warranty. The tribunal accordingly held that breach of the term did not entitle the purchaser to treat the seller as having repudiated the contract. The purchaser applied to set aside the award, submitting that neither party had argued before the arbitrator that the term in question was a collateral warranty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 Chan Seng Onn J upheld the award on the grounds that the seller had advanced in the arbitration the argument that the term in question was either a warranty or an innominate term which had the effect of a warranty (at [68]).  But even if that had not been the case, Chan Seng Onn J would have still upheld that award. He set out the applicable principle as follows (at [63]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… There is no uniformity in the authorities on the extent to which the arbitral tribunal may decide a pleaded issue using premises not argued by the parties but which were reasonably connected to the arguments canvassed by the parties. The interpretation of authorities is further compounded by the fact that natural justice cases almost inevitably turn on the individual facts of the case. Nevertheless, the foundational principle which courts should not lose sight of is that parties who choose arbitration as their preferred system of dispute resolution must live with the decision of the arbitrator, good or bad. Commercial parties appoint arbitrators for their expertise and experience, technical, legal, commercial or otherwise. These arbitrators cannot be so straitjacketed as to be permitted to <span class="font-italic">only </span>adopt in their conclusions the premises put forward by the parties. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">If an </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">unargued premise flows reasonably from an argued premise, I do not think it is necessarily incumbent on the arbitral tribunal to invite the parties to submit new arguments. The arbitral tribunal would be doing nothing more than inferring a related premise from one that has been placed before it.</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in the original in italics; emphasis added in bold and italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 He then applied this principle as an alternative basis for rejecting the purchaser’s submission (at [70]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The finding that [the term] was a collateral warranty was not only reasonably connected to the arguments raised by both parties; it was a reasonable follow-through from [the tribunal’s] finding that [the term] was not a condition. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 In summary, therefore, a tribunal denies a party a reasonable opportunity to present its responsive case if it follows a chain of reasoning which has no nexus to the case advanced by the parties, unless the parties have been put on notice in some other way that they are expected to address that chain. Thus, without attempting to be prescriptive, a particular chain of reasoning will be open to a tribunal in any one of the following circumstances: (i) if it arises from the party’s express pleadings; (ii) if it is raised by reasonable implication by a party’s pleadings; (iii) if it does not feature in a party’s pleadings but is in some other way brought to the opposing party’s actual notice; or (iv) if the links in the chain flow reasonably from the arguments actually advanced by either party or are related to those arguments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 An alternative way of looking at the question of a nexus between the tribunal’s chain of reasoning and the parties’ cases is to consider whether a reasonable party to the arbitration could objectively have foreseen the tribunal’s chain of reasoning. Whichever approach is taken, however, the overriding concern is not whether a tribunal has complied with arid technicality but whether it has achieved substantive fairness. As the Court of Appeal said in <span class="font-italic">Soh</span><span class="font-italic"> Beng Tee</span> (at [65]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) The delicate balance between ensuring the integrity of the arbitral process and ensuring that the rules of natural justice are complied with in the arbitral process is preserved by strictly adhering to only the narrow scope and basis for challenging an arbitral award that has been expressly acknowledged under the [Arbitration Act] and the [International Arbitration Act]. In so far as the right to be heard is concerned, the failure of an arbitrator to refer every point for decision to the parties for submissions is not invariably a valid ground for challenge. Only in instances such as where the impugned decision reveals a dramatic departure from the submissions, or involves an arbitrator receiving extraneous evidence, or adopts a view wholly at odds with the established evidence adduced by the parties, or arrives at a conclusion unequivocally rejected by the parties as being trivial or irrelevant, might it be appropriate for a court to intervene. In short, there must be a real basis for alleging that the arbitrator has conducted the arbitral process either irrationally or capriciously. To echo the language employed in <span class="font-italic">Rotoaira</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>…, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the overriding burden on the applicant is to show that a reasonable litigant in his shoes could not have foreseen the possibility of reasoning of the type revealed in the award.</span> It is only in these very limited circumstances that the arbitrator’s decision might be considered unfair. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e)  It is almost invariably the case that parties propose diametrically opposite solutions to resolve a dispute. They may expect the arbitrator to select one of these alternative positions. The arbitrator, however, is not bound to adopt an either/or approach. He is perfectly entitled to embrace a middle path (even without apprising the parties of his provisional thinking or analysis) so long as it is based on evidence that is before him. Similarly,<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> an arbitrator is entitled – indeed, it is his obligation – to come to his own conclusions or inferences from the primary facts placed before him. In this context, he is not expected to inexorably accept the conclusions being urged upon him by the parties. Neither is he expected to consult the parties on his thinking process before finalising his award unless it involves a dramatic departure from what has been presented to him.</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in italics in the original; emphasis in bold and italics added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 The Court of Appeal preceded this passage with a warning that a tribunal which exercises unreasonable initiative in its chain of reasoning is liable to have its award set aside (at [65]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) Parties to arbitration have, in general, a right to be heard effectively on every issue that may be relevant to the resolution of a dispute.

In other words, an arbitrator should not make bricks without straw.

First, Agritrade never advanced the collateral contract exception as part of its case, whether formally on the pleadings or even informally through its submissions. Second, the tribunal never directed JVL to address the collateral contract exception. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Agritrade never advanced the collateral contract exception</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 The tribunal was quite right that Agritrade had the burden of advancing the collateral contract exception. This is because persuading the tribunal to take the price-averaging arrangement into consideration was completely immaterial to JVL’s case. Its case was founded solely on the disputed contracts, on Agritrade’s unambiguous obligation to sell and deliver palm oil to JVL on the face of those contracts and on Agritrade’s undisputed failure to do so. Indeed, JVL never once mentioned the price-averaging arrangement in its statement of claim.

</div>
</div> It had no need to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 Agritrade was the only party that needed to rely on the price-averaging arrangement to establish its case. The price-averaging arrangement was crucial to both its uncertainty defence and to its prematurity defence. That is why, when the tribunal drew the parol evidence rule to both parties’ attention, it left Agritrade in no doubt that Agritrade bore the burden both of invoking an exception to the rule and of adducing the evidence necessary to come within that exception (see [52] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 Despite this, at no time did Agritrade invoke the collateral contract exception or seek to adduce any evidence to come within it. Agritrade did not invoke the collateral contract exception in its pleadings. That is not fatal to Agritrade’s case in itself. The parol evidence rule was itself in play not because of JVL’s pleadings but because of the tribunal’s express direction (see [52] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 What is fatal to Agritrade’s case, however, is that at no time did it even informally advance the collateral contract exception as part of its case, despite bearing the burden on this issue. I have recounted (at [72], [78], [88], [96] and [102] above) the five opportunities which Agritrade had to invoke the collateral contract exception even informally: in its written submissions, in its reply written submissions, during its oral closing submissions, in its final written submissions and in its further written submissions. It allowed all of these opportunities to pass it by.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 Not only did Agritrade not advance the collateral contract exception as part of its case, the case which it did advance implicitly rejected the collateral contract exception (see [71] above). For that reason, it is impossible to say that the collateral contract exception arose by reasonable implication from Agritrade’s uncertainty defence or its prematurity defence – the latter being the only case which Agritrade did advance on the parol evidence rule – or that it flowed naturally from either defence. The collateral contract exception was entirely inconsistent with Agritrade’s defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 Agritrade’s failure to advance the collateral contract exception as part of its case precludes the tribunal from adopting that as part of its chain of reasoning unless it directed JVL specifically to deal with it. This arises, not from arid technicality, but from the fundamental nature of arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Arbitration is fundamentally adversarial</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 The fundamental nature of arbitration is adversarial. It is true that s 12(3) of the Act specifically empowers a tribunal governed by that Act, unless the parties have agreed otherwise, to adopt inquisitorial processes. But the mere fact that the Act considers it necessary expressly to empower a tribunal to proceed inquisitorially shows that the starting point – at least in Singapore – is that arbitration is adversarial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170  In adversarial proceedings, it is the parties who select the issues which the adjudicator is to decide. The archetype of adversarial proceedings is litigation in a common law system such as ours. As Dyson LJ (as he then was) said in the English Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Al-</span><span class="font-italic">Medenni v Mars UK Limited</span> [2005] EWCA Civ 1041 (“<span class="font-italic">Al-</span><span class="font-italic">Medenni</span>”) at [21]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It is fundamental to our adversarial system of justice that the parties should clearly identify the issues that arise in the litigation, so that each has the opportunity of responding to the points made by the other. <span class="font-italic">The function of the judge is to adjudicate on those issues alone.</span> The parties may have their own reasons for limiting the issues or presenting them in a certain way. <span class="font-italic">The judge can invite, and even encourage, the parties to recast or modify the issues. But if they refuse to do so, the judge must respect that decision.</span> <span class="font-italic">One consequence of this may be that the judge is compelled to reject a claim on the </span><span class="font-italic">basis on which it is advanced, although he or she is of the opinion that it would have succeeded if it had been advanced on a different basis. Such an outcome may be unattractive, but any other approach leads to uncertainty and potentially real unfairness.</span> </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 This principle was reiterated very recently by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">V</span><span class="font-italic"> Nithia (co-administratrix of the estate of Ponnusamy Sivapakiam, deceased) v Buthmanaban s/o Vaithilingam and another</span> [2015] 5 SLR 1422:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">34 The hallmark of an adversarial system of civil litigation like ours is that plaintiffs and defendants alike are required by procedural rules to set the boundaries of their disputes and to fight their battles within these boundaries. In a civil trial, this is achieved primarily through the pleadings, which are written statements setting out the relevant facts, or allegations of fact, and the applicable points of law in support of their respective claims, counterclaims, defences and replies. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">37 Equally important to the principle of fairness, pleadings also serve to uphold the rules of natural justice (<span class="font-italic">Sheagar</span><span class="font-italic"> s/o TM Veloo v Belfield International (Hong Kong) Ltd </span>[2014] 3 SLR 524 (“<span class="font-italic">Sheagar</span>”) at [94]). <span class="font-italic">Parties are expected to keep to their pleadings because it is only </span>fair and just<span class="font-italic"> that they do so – to permit otherwise is to have a trial by ambush. Every litigant is entitled as a matter of procedural fairness to be informed of his opponent’s case in advance and to challenge his veracity in cross-examination at the trial.</span> As pithily stated by the Australian High Court in <span class="font-italic">Lee v The Queen</span> (1998) 195 CLR 594 at [32]: <span class="font-italic">“Confrontation and the opportunity for cross-examination is of central significance to the common law adversarial system of trial.”</span> … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">38 Thus, the general rule is that parties are bound by their pleadings and the court is precluded from deciding on a matter that the parties themselves have decided not to put into issue. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 In litigation, therefore, it is the parties’ prerogative to set the boundaries of their dispute and to select the issues which the court is to determine. That is so no matter how ineptly one party may have formulated its case, no matter how strongly a judge may be tempted to reformulate that party’s case for it and no matter how unattractive a judge may find the outcome of resisting that temptation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 This restriction exists as a fundamental aspect of achieving justice, not as a trap for the unwary. The restriction facilitates certainty, rectitude of decision and fairness in dispute resolution. Once a judge is permitted to go beyond the issues which the parties have selected for his decision, there can be no certainty as to how far beyond those issues he will go. A judge who selects an issue to decide on his own may deprive one of the parties – or even both – of the opportunity to adduce evidence or to make arguments on that issue. That undermines both fairness and rectitude of decision, not only on that specific issue but also on the ultimate issue. Further, a party who loses on an issue raised only by the judge – even if that party has been able to address that issue fully – will feel with some justification that he has been defeated by the judge rather than by his adversary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 Although arbitration differs from litigation in many fundamental respects, these arguments are equally applicable to arbitration. Indeed, there is an additional conceptual argument as to why the choice of issues for decision in arbitration must rest with the parties. Unlike litigation, which is founded on the state’s coercive power, arbitration is founded entirely upon the parties’ consent. A tribunal which decides an issue which neither party has consented for it to decide runs the risk not only of breaching the rules of natural justice, but also of acting without jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 An arbitral tribunal, like a judge, has a duty to confine itself to the issues selected by the parties for determination. The Court of Appeal confirmed this in <span class="font-italic">Kempinski</span>. As the Court of Appeal said at [36]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Although there is an important difference between arbitration and litigation in the sense that arbitration is consensual in nature whereas litigation is not, the basic principles applicable to determine the jurisdiction of the arbitrator or the court to decide a dispute raised by the parties are generally the same. In arbitration, the parties can determine the scope of the arbitration; so can the parties in litigation <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the issues to be tried … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 To support this principle, the Court of Appeal cited with approval Dyson LJ’s dictum from <span class="font-italic">Al-</span><span class="font-italic">Medenni </span>which I have set out (at [170] above). The Court of Appeal then continued (at [37] – [38]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">37. Thus, if A sues B for damages for breach of contract and B joins issue with A, the court cannot dismiss the claim on the ground that there is no contract unless that ground is raised by way of an amended defence (allowed by the court) at any time before the conclusion of the trial …. Even where a new issue is raised by the court of its own motion as a result of evidence adduced during the trial, the defence should, for the sake of good order, be amended so that the plaintiff may file an amended reply and, if necessary call rebuttal evidence on the new issue. This is an established process to ensure fairness to the party affected by the new issue. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">38 The established principles in this area of the law are clear. As Lord Normand succinctly stated in <span class="font-italic">Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Southport Corporation </span>[1956] AC 218 at 238-239:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The function of pleadings is <span class="font-italic">to give fair notice of the case which has to be met so that the opposing party may direct his evidence to the issue disclosed by them.</span> … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… To condemn a party on a ground of which no fair notice has been given may be as great a denial of justice as to condemn him on a ground on which his evidence has been improperly excluded. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Loveridge</span><span class="font-italic">, Loveridge v Healey </span>[2004] EWCA Civ 173, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR commented at [23]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is on the basis of the pleadings that the parties decide what evidence they will need to place before the court and what preparations are necessary before the trial. Where one party advances a case that is inconsistent with his pleadings, it often happens that the other party takes no point on this. Where the departure from the pleadings causes no prejudice, or where for some other reason it is obvious that the court, if asked, will give permission to amend the pleading, the other party may be sensible to take no pleading point. <span class="font-italic">Where, however, departure from a pleading will cause prejudice, it is in the interests of justice that the other party should be entitled to insist that this is not permitted unless the pleading is appropriately amended.</span> That then introduces, in its proper context, the issue of whether or not the party in question should be permitted to advance a case which has not hitherto been pleaded. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Although the Court of Appeal spoke in this passage only of litigation, it is clear from the context that its view was that the same principle applies – at least conceptually – in arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 I add the qualifier “conceptually” for two reasons. First, the cases which I have analysed (at [149] – [162] above) show that the approach in arbitration to the rules of procedure, and in particular to the rules of pleading, is a pragmatic approach which looks to substance over form and fairness over technicality. Although that is also true in litigation, there may be a perception that it is not true to the same extent. Second, and more importantly, a tribunal has the statutory power to adopt inquisitorial processes (see [169] above). That is a power wholly unavailable to the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 It is this statutory power which legitimises the tribunal’s decision in this case to raise the parol evidence rule of its own accord. To that extent, and on that issue, the tribunal proceeded inquisitorially. The important point, however, is that the tribunal at the same time expressly directed both parties to address the tribunal on the rule and on its exceptions. For that reason, if the tribunal had found Agritrade liable to JVL for breach of contract on the ground that the parol evidence rule precluded it from considering the price-averaging arrangement, Agritrade could not be heard to complain that it had been denied a fair hearing because JVL had never pleaded reliance on the parol evidence rule and had never, until the tribunal raised it, advanced the parol evidence rule as part of its case. Agritrade would have been on notice, by the tribunal’s express direction, that reliance on the parol evidence rule was a chain of reasoning which it had to address. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The tribunal did not direct JVL to address the collateral contract exception </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 In this case, however, not only did Agritrade never advance the collateral contract exception as part of its case, the tribunal never directed the parties to deal with the collateral contract exception.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 In the exchange reproduced (at [80] above), the first arbitrator informed Mr Pillai that Mr Bazul had set out all the exceptions to the parol evidence rule in his written submissions and that one exception to the parol evidence rule he might rely on was the collateral contract exception. As I have pointed out (at [82] above), this exchange was couched in the language of hypothesis for comment rather than that of thesis for proof (or disproof). Further, for the reasons I have set out above, the tribunal’s closing exchange directed the parties specifically to respond only to the equitable estoppel point (see [90] – [93] above). In any event, even if this exchange was intended as a direction to the parties to deal with the collateral contract exception, it was insufficiently clear. That is especially so, when one considers that Agritrade’s case was not merely silent on the collateral contract exception but had implicitly rejected it as part of its case and had failed to adopt it after the tribunal had floated it as a hypothetical towards the end of Mr Pillai’s submissions (see [80] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">AKN v ALC</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 The case of <span class="font-italic">AKN and another v ALC and others and other appeals </span>[2015] 3 SLR 488 (“<span class="font-italic">AKN</span>”) provides a useful analogy to the present case. In <span class="font-italic">AKN</span>, the purchasers of certain assets of an insolvent company under an asset purchase agreement commenced arbitration against the company’s liquidator, the company’s shareholders and its secured creditors. The purchasers claimed that the respondents in the arbitration breached the asset purchase agreement by failing to ensure that the assets sold were free from liens of any kind. As a result, the purchaser claimed damages for a loss of <span class="font-italic">actual</span> profits which it claimed to be able to prove. The arbitral tribunal agreed with the purchasers. However, it awarded the purchasers US$80m as damages, not for the loss of <span class="font-italic">actual</span> profits, but for the loss of an <span class="font-italic">opportunity</span> to earn profits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 The respondents in the arbitration applied to set aside the award. One ground of complaint was that the tribunal had breached the rules of natural justice in failing to give the liquidator and the secured creditors an opportunity to address the tribunal on whether the purchaser was entitled to damages for the loss of an <span class="font-italic">opportunity</span> to earn profits as opposed to damages for a loss of <span class="font-italic">actual</span> profits. It was the tribunal, and not the purchaser, who raised the possibility of characterising the purchaser’s claim as a claim for damages for the loss of an opportunity to earn profits. The tribunal raised this possibility only on the last day of the 20-day arbitral hearing. When it did so, the tribunal noted that the secured creditors’ expert had not addressed the issue. It also suggested that if it were to proceed on a loss of opportunity analysis, it would need the parties’ assistance to determine the magnitude of the opportunity lost. The parties made no written submissions on the issue. As the Court of Appeal noted (at [75]), the extent of the parties’ “submissions” on this point was a brief exchange between the tribunal and counsel for the purchasers. In that exchange, counsel stated that “it would be open to the tribunal to analyse [the issue] from a chance perspective” and accepted the tribunal’s suggestion that the loss of an opportunity analysis may be analogous to a doctrine of the applicable foreign law<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [69]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 In its award, the tribunal found as a fact that the purchasers had lost a 55% chance of making profits, “without <span class="font-italic">any </span>apparent analysis or consideration over and above its ‘slightly better than even’ approximation, and without any submissions having been sought or made on the quantum of the chance lost” [emphasis in original] (<span class="font-italic">AKN </span>at [76]). The Court of Appeal also observed that the tribunal never gave an opportunity to any of the respondents in the arbitration to adduce further evidence on the matter.

During the arbitration, the Secured Creditors and the Liquidator did not have ample notice of the “loss of opportunity” claim. It was raised at the eleventh hour. Not only was the tribunal apparently uncertain of and ill-equipped to deal with the quantum of the opportunity allegedly lost, it also did not request further arguments on the point. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">79. In the circumstances, not only did the Secured Creditors and the Liquidator lack ample notice of the “loss of opportunity” claim, the tribunal was also never furnished with extensive submissions or expert evidence on the “loss of opportunity” point. This was despite the fact that the tribunal, as it had indicated to the parties, was alive to the need for such submissions and evidence. The analogy with <span class="font-italic">Kempinski</span> therefore completely fails. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 In my view, the facts of <span class="font-italic">AKN </span>and the Court of Appeal’s findings provide a useful analogy for the present case. In both cases, the tribunal raised an issue of its own accord at the eleventh hour and in passing. In both cases, that issue turned out in the award to be dispositive. And in both cases, the tribunal did so without giving the parties the right to present evidence or submissions on that dispositive issue and without directing the parties to address the issue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The tribunal impermissibly relieved Agritrade of its entire burden</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 In my view, the majority’s decision unilaterally to find that the price-averaging arrangement was a collateral contract, and therefore within that exception to the parol evidence rule, not only relieved Agritrade of the burden of advancing the collateral contract exception as part of its case, but also discharged Agritrade’s legal and evidential burdens of proof on this dispositive issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 I adopt the Court of Appeal’s recent explanation of the concept of the burden of proof in <span class="font-italic">SCT Technologies Pte Ltd v Western Copper Co Ltd </span>[2016] 1 SLR 1471 (“<span class="font-italic">SCT Technologies</span>”) at [16] – [18]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16 The concept of burden of proof may be spoken of in two distinct senses which, to avoid any confusion in the analysis which follows, we would clarify from the outset. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">17 First, the concept may be used in the context of referring to <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the </span><span class="font-weight-bold">legal</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> burden of proof, which is “properly speaking, a burden of proof, for it describes the obligation to persuade the trier of fact that, in view of the evidence, the fact in dispute arises”</span> (see <span class="font-italic">Britestone</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Smith &amp; Associates Far East, Ltd </span>[2007] 4 SLR 855 (“<span class="font-italic">Britestone</span>”) at [58]). Central to determining where the burden lies in a civil suit is the state of the parties’ pleadings. It is in the pleadings that one finds the material facts that each party asserts to establish its claim or defence (as the case may be) and, as is trite law, he who asserts must prove – this is a rule which is consistent with the general principle underlying ss 103 and 105 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (see the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Cooperatieve</span><span class="font-italic"> Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA (trading as Rabobank International), Singapore Branch v Motorola Electronics Pte Ltd </span>[2011] 2 SLR 63 at [31]). Once it is established who bears the legal burden of proof, it will remain fixed on the party who bears it throughout the course of the trial, never shifting regardless of the evidence that is led. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">18 This leads us to the second sense in which the concept of burden of proof is commonly used, which is in the <span class="font-italic">evidential </span>sense. Essentially, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the evidential burden of proof refers to “the need of the party to adduce evidence to discharge his legal burden (or the need of the opposing party to adduce evidence to prevent the proving party from discharging his legal burden)”</span> (see Jeffrey Pinsler SC, <span class="font-italic">Evidence and the Litigation Process </span>(LexisNexis, 5th Ed, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Evidence and the Litigation Process</span>”) at para 12.007). From this description alone, it is clear that, unlike the legal burden of proof, the evidential burden can shift from one party to the other depending on the evidence which is adduced at trial by either side. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in the original in italics; emphasis added in bold and italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 The tribunal’s directions to Mr Bazul on the parol evidence rule (see [52] above) are entirely consistent with the Court of Appeal’s analysis in <span class="font-italic">SCT Technologies</span>. The burden was on Agritrade to (i) invoke an exception to the parol evidence rule; and (ii) adduce evidence to prove to the tribunal that the exception was applicable to the price-averaging arrangement. Agritrade pointed to the price-averaging arrangement as the factual basis for its defence but never pointed to the collateral contract exception as the legal basis on which the tribunal could take into consideration the price-averaging arrangement despite the parol evidence rule. By invoking the collateral contract exception itself, all three members of the tribunal relieved Agritrade of the burden of invoking an exception to the parol evidence rule. By going further to find sufficient evidence to establish that that exception applied, the majority relieved Agritrade of the burden of establishing an issue which ultimately proved dispositive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 For all the foregoing reasons, therefore, I find that there was a breach of natural justice in the making of the award.

</div> Further, although the tribunal accepted that Agritrade’s prematurity defence was properly before it, the majority made no finding that the price-averaging arrangement was a condition precedent to Agritrade’s obligation to perform the disputed contracts and therefore within the condition precedent exception to the parol evidence rule. Indeed, the tribunal could hardly have made such a finding, given that Agritrade’s own case was that the price-averaging arrangement was not integrated into the parties’ bargain comprised in the Market Price Contracts, to be applied in the event of non-performance of the Market Price Contracts themselves (see [75] above). But the tribunal did hold unanimously that the issue of whether the price-averaging arrangement was a collateral contract was properly before it and go on to decide that issue, albeit in different ways. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 The majority’s finding that the price-averaging arrangement was a collateral contract was dispositive of the arbitration. Once the majority had arrived at that finding, the parol evidence rule no longer prevented them from holding that the price-averaging arrangement governed the parties’ performance of the disputed contracts or from holding, further, that because no price-averaging exercise had been carried out in respect of the disputed contracts, Agritrade was not liable to JVL in damages. In this connection, the majority’s acceptance of Agritrade’s contention “that the performance of the [disputed contracts] was not due because no price averaging exercise had been carried out by the Parties for these contracts”

</div> is not a finding that Agritrade had established that the price-averaging arrangement came within the condition precedent exception to the parol evidence rule. It is the tribunal’s conclusion that, on the facts, Agritrade has established, on the facts, that its performance is not yet due, but only because, on the law, the tribunal has relied on the collateral contract exception to the parol evidence rule to take the price-averaging arrangement into account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 Section 24(b) of the Act requires an applicant to establish not only that a breach of natural justice connected to the making of the award took place but also that the breach caused it prejudice.

The Court of Appeal so held in <span class="font-italic">L W Infrastructure Pte Ltd v Lim Chin San Contractors Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2013] 1 SLR 125 (“<span class="font-italic">L W Infrastructure</span>”) at [54]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">54 … it is important to bear in mind that it is never in the interest of the court, much less its role, to assume the function of the arbitral tribunal. To say that the court must be satisfied that a different result would definitely ensue before prejudice can be said to have been demonstrated would be incorrect in principle because it would require the court to put itself in the position of the arbitrator and to consider the merits of the issue with the benefit of materials that had not in the event been placed before the arbitrator. Seen in this light, it becomes evident that <span class="font-italic">the real inquiry is whether the breach of natural justice was merely technical and inconsequential or whether as a result of the breach, the arbitrator was denied the benefit of arguments or evidence that had a real as opposed to a fanciful chance of making a difference to his deliberations.

</div>
</div> He came to this conclusion because it “did not have the necessary attributes to form a valid contract and was therefore incapable of being an enforceable collateral contract as envisaged by the Majority Decision”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 It is wholly unnecessary, and indeed inappropriate, for me to express a view on whether the price-averaging agreement does indeed satisfy the criteria for a collateral contract. It suffices to say that the analysis necessary to conclude that the price-averaging arrangement is a collateral contract is completely distinct from any analysis which the tribunal had to carry out to determine the issues which formed a part of Agritrade’s case expressly or by necessary implication. Put another way, whether a particular arrangement satisfies the criteria to be a collateral contract is a question which transcends a finding that that arrangement existed in point of fact. There is no doubt that, in point of fact, the parties arrived at a consensus to apply the price-averaging arrangement to their future dealings. But to make the finding that that particular arrangement constitutes a collateral contract requires submissions, evidence and analysis directed specifically towards ascertaining whether the criteria for a collateral contract are fulfilled. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 But, in the present case, Agritrade withdrew from the tribunal the issue of whether the price-averaging arrangement was any sort of a contract even before the evidential phase began. Further, Agritrade never advanced as part of its case the argument that the price-averaging arrangement was a collateral contract. Indeed, as I have noted, its case implicitly rejected that argument. The shape of Agritrade’s case from the moment the evidential phase started meant that JVL had no need, and therefore no reasonable opportunity, to adduce evidence on whether the price-averaging arrangement fulfilled the criteria to be a collateral contract, to test Agritrade’s evidence on that issue or to make submissions on that issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 I am therefore unable to say that there is no prospect whatsoever that this evidence and these submissions, if presented, would have made a difference to the tribunal. Indeed, the very fact that the first arbitrator came to the opposite conclusion on the limited evidence which was before the tribunal, and without the benefit of any real submissions, suggests very strongly that JVL suffered prejudice in the <span class="font-italic">LW Infrastructure</span> sense in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The addendum to the award</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 I now turn to consider the addendum to its award which the tribunal issued while JVL’s setting aside proceedings were suspended. I set out in full the portion of the addendum dealing with and dismissing JVL’s submissions:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">40. At [5] of the Claimant’s submissions, the Claimant gave a summary of what it submits as the bases for the Claimant’s application, and it is relevant to refer to the following paragraphs:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">(e) In the award, the Tribunal dismissed the Respondent’s Pleaded Case.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">(f)  However, despite it not having been pleaded, the Tribunal allowed the introduction of the Respondent’s alternative case and the Majority of the Tribunal found, inter alia, that the “price averaging arrangement” was an oral collateral contract between the parties that governed the performance of the [disputed contracts];</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">(g) Not only was the argument that the “price averaging arrangement” was an oral collateral contract never pleaded, it was never even raised by the Respondent at any time during the Arbitration, whether in evidence or submissions;</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">(h)  Further to the above, after unilaterally making the finding that the “price averaging arrangement” was a binding oral collateral agreement, the majority went on to hold that the [disputed contracts] were meant to be performed in accordance with the “price averaging arrangement” and because no price averaging exercise had been carried out, the Respondent was not in breach of the said contracts;”</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">41. These submissions of the Claimant merit the following observations. First, these submissions do not reflect accurately what actually transpired at the hearing before the Tribunal. Second, the Claimant appears somewhat confused by the term “collateral contract” which the Tribunal characterises or describes the price averaging arrangement. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">How the price averaging arrangement was characterised or described as a “collateral contract” arose in this way. In the course of the main hearing on 15 August 2012, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the Tribunal raised an issue which was not pleaded by both Parties in their respective pleadings; nor was it raised in the respective opening submissions of both Parties, namely: whether in the face of the [disputed contracts], which are written contracts, the price averaging arrangement, being an oral contract, falls foul of the rule against admission of parol evidence.</span> There was a somewhat long exchange between counsel and the Tribunal that took place: see N/E: 15.08.12: p 2 line 1 to p 4 line 21: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[extract from the Transcript of 15 August 2012 that I have set out at [52] above] </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">42. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Both Parties in their written closing submissions and the responsive written closing submissions dealt with this issue [concerning the applicability of the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">parol evidence rule].</span> Subsequently, at the Hearing of Oral Submissions (on 30 November 2012), the following relevant exchanges took place between a member of the Tribunal and counsel for the Claimant (see N/E: p 35 line 22 to p 36 line 19):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[extract from the Transcript of 30 November 2012 that I have set out at [80] above]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">43. So at the Hearing of Oral Submissions, the term “collateral contract” was raised by the Tribunal and it was even explained to the Claimant’s counsel as to what a collateral contract is, that is, it is a side agreement. Subsequently, both Parties submitted final written closing submissions and these were summarised at [13.2] to [13.11] of the Award. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">It is noted that the Claimant made no submissions on the point of collateral contract in its final written closing submission. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">44. This issue on the rule against the admission of parol evidence was dealt with by the Tribunal at [13.12] to [13.21] of the Award. At [13.20] the Tribunal by majority said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">“… In the opinion of the Tribunal, there is no issue with respect to the admissibility of such agreement in this case. The price averaging arrangement (though orally made) is what is known or described as a collateral contract. It does not add to or alter the terms of the High Price Contracts and the Market Price Contracts. At common law, admission of evidence of a collateral contract is an exception to the parol evidence rule.” </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Minority agrees with the majority that at common law admission of evidence of a collateral contract is an exception to the parol evidence rule: see footnote 2 at 13.12 of the Award. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">45. At [5(g)] of the Claimant’s submissions, the Claimant seems to suggest that the price averaging arrangement as a collateral contract is something new or esoteric and different from the price averaging arrangement, and has to be pleaded separately. With respect, the Claimant is confused. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The term “collateral contract” is a description or characterisation which </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the tribunal gave to the price averaging arrangement.</span> It is not a new contract different from the price averaging arrangement. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in the original in italics; emphasis added in bold and italics] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 With great diffidence, I find myself unable to agree with the tribunal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 First, I observe that the majority accepts (at [45] of the addendum) that it described or characterised the price-averaging arrangement as a collateral contract. But until the tribunal delivered its award, that description or characterisation had never been advocated by either party or, indeed, by the tribunal itself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 Second, the majority points out (at [43] of the addendum) that it raised the collateral contract exception during the oral closing submissions and that JVL made no arguments on the issue in its final written submissions. But as I have explained, the first arbitrator raised the collateral contract exception as a hypothetical and not as an issue for JVL to address. Further, as the tribunal itself informed Agritrade, the onus of invoking an exception to the parol evidence rule lay on Agritrade, not on JVL. So while it is true that JVL made no submissions on the collateral contract exception in its final written submission, it cannot be faulted for taking that position. The arbitration was adversarial. In the absence of a direction from the tribunal to deal with the point, JVL was entitled to make its submissions only on the case which Agritrade actually advanced against it. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Agritrade’s responses </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 Agritrade submits that JVL had ample opportunity to and did in fact make submissions on the collateral contract exception.

That sentence must be read in context. JVL made no submissions at all in its written submissions on any of the exceptions to the rule. That is because the burden rested on Agritrade to invoke the particular exception on which it intended to rely. At the time JVL made this submission, Agritrade had not yet identified the three specific exceptions which it would go on to invoke in its own written submission exchanged that day. JVL was not, by this one sentence, taking on the burden of proving that all six exceptions to the parol evidence rule were inapplicable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 Further, I do not think that too much weight should be placed on Mr Pillai’s exchange with the first arbitrator during oral closing submissions on 30 November 2012.

JVL had no reason to believe, at this juncture, that the collateral contract exception was in play, either by reason of the case which Agritrade was advancing or by reason of a direction from the tribunal.

</div> that “the agreement reached regarding the averaging of the High Price Contracts and the Low Market Price Contracts had no impact on the validity or performance of the [disputed contracts]” does not assist Agritrade.

</div> This submission was again directed to Agritrade’s uncertainty defence and the binding nature of the disputed contracts. It is not a submission that the price-averaging arrangement lacks the certainty necessary to constitute a contract and therefore a collateral contract. Agritrade quotes this submission out of context when it asserts that it constituted JVL’s case on the collateral contract exception. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 Agritrade further submits that “the fact that the Plaintiff chose to restrict its submissions and failed to consider a collateral contract as an exception to the parol evidence rule does not preclude the Tribunal from making a determination that, at common law, admission of evidence of a collateral contract is an exception to the parol evidence rule”.

</div> The tribunal made a similar remark in the Addendum. I have dealt with this at paragraphs [185] – [188] above. The burden was on Agritrade to invoke the collateral contract exception.

</div>
</div>
</div> JVL submits that the prematurity defence gave rise to “a completely new set of issues and disputes” which it was given no opportunity to address. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 The tribunal considered and rejected JVL’s complaint about the prematurity defence:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">47. In the opinion of the Tribunal, these submissions of the Claimant are clearly unsustainable. The Tribunal at [10.1] and [10.2] of the Award considered the [uncertainty defence] and the [prematurity defence], and at [10.5] accepted that the [prematurity defence] was not pleaded in the [defence]. That being the position, the Tribunal at [10.8] went on to consider whether the Claimant had been prejudiced by the absence of plea of the [prematurity defence]. On this point, the Tribunal found at [10.9] that the Parties had argued the [prematurity defence]. In particular, the Claimant argued and disputed the [prematurity defence] in (i) its responsive written submissions, (ii) the oral submissions before the Tribunal at the Hearing of Oral Submissions (on 30 November 2012), and (iii) its final written submissions where the Claimant had the last word. In the opinion of the Tribunal, the [prematurity defence] was extensively and fully argued before the Tribunal, although it was not pleaded. The Tribunal unanimously held that the Claimant had not been prejudiced by the absence of plea of the [prematurity defence]. Relying on the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">PT Prima International Development v </span><span class="font-italic">Kempinski Hotels SA and other appeals </span>[2012] 4 SLR 98 at [51], the Tribunal was disposed to allow the [prematurity defence] to stand and treat it as part of the case of the Respondent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">220 It is undoubtedly correct as a point of procedure that Agritrade should have amended its pleadings to include its prematurity defence. I also have difficulty with the tribunal’s finding that: (i) the prematurity defence was the same defence or a similar defence to its uncertainty defence; and (ii) that it was simply the consequence that flowed from rejecting Agritrade’s uncertainty defence. But upon consideration of the overall circumstances, JVL suffered no prejudice by reason of the tribunal’s decision to permit Agritrade to advance the prematurity defence. I say this for three reasons. First, JVL addressed the prematurity defence in its subsequent submissions, both written and oral. Indeed, Mr Pillai accepted in the oral submissions that JVL had responded to the prematurity defence in its reply submissions.

</div>
</div> Second, the prematurity defence rested on the same factual foundations as the uncertainty defence, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> the price-averaging arrangement. Unlike the collateral contract exception, dealing with the prematurity defence on the law did not involve new questions of fact which had never before been in issue. Third, the tribunal’s acceptance of the factual statement at the heart of the prematurity defence – that Agritrade’s performance obligation under the disputed contracts was not yet due because no price-averaging exercise had been carried out – was simply the consequence of its dispositive finding that the price-averaging arrangement was within the collateral contract exception to the parol evidence rule. It is not a finding that Agritrade has succeeded in its prematurity defence as a free-standing defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 I therefore reject JVL’s submission that the tribunal’s award should be set aside by reason of its decision to accept the prematurity defence as part of Agritrade’s case in the arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Jurisdiction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">222 JVL argues

</div> that the tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction when the majority found the price-averaging arrangement to be a collateral contract and then went on to make findings on the price-averaging arrangement, including a finding that JVL was in repudiatory breach of it. On the majority’s own premise, the price-averaging arrangement was not only a contract, but was a contract distinct from the disputed contracts. Yet, the price-averaging arrangement contained no arbitration agreement. The tribunal’s jurisdiction over the parties was founded only in the arbitration clauses in the disputed contracts. Accordingly, JVL submits, by finding that the price-averaging arrangement was a collateral contract, the tribunal dealt with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 I do not accept JVL’s submission. The majority made no finding on the price-averaging arrangement other than that it amounted to a collateral contract. The sole purpose of that finding was to give the majority a legal basis for taking the price-averaging arrangement into consideration in order to conclude that Agritrade’s performance obligations under the disputed contracts were not yet due. That finding did not, therefore, go beyond the scope of the parties’ dispute on the disputed contracts which JVL had referred to the arbitrators under the notice of arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">224 The point can be tested in this way. Assume that Agritrade had invoked the collateral contract exception to the parol evidence rule. Assume further that the tribunal had received additional evidence and submissions on whether the parties had an intention to create legal relations when they agreed to average prices, whether that agreement had been expressed in promissory language, whether that agreement had been supported by consideration and whether the terms of that agreement were sufficiently certain. If JVL’s submission were correct, none of that would have legitimised the majority’s finding that the price-averaging arrangement was a collateral contract. It would still be a finding made by the tribunal without jurisdiction. That cannot be correct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 In making its finding that the price-averaging arrangement was a collateral contract, the majority did not purport to resolve any dispute under the price-averaging arrangement as a collateral contract. Although it did hold that JVL was in repudiatory breach of the price-averaging arrangement, that finding was unnecessary for its decision on the ultimate issue before it, which was Agritrade’s liability to JVL for breach of the disputed contracts. It would have been different if, for example, the tribunal had purported to award damages to Agritrade for JVL’s breach of the price-averaging arrangement. But that is not what the tribunal did.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Apparent bias</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 JVL submits that the tribunal’s award should be set aside because the majority displayed apparent bias towards JVL. To support this submission, JVL points to what it described as the tribunal’s “uncritical acceptance” of the evidence of one of Agritrade’s witnesses
