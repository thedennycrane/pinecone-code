SCPL argued that because its underlying claim was based on SOPA, the court should give effect to the policy behind SOPA, which was to allow efficient resolution of disputes in the construction industry and consequently facilitate quick cash flow. Giving effect to this policy consideration meant that the court should not stay CWU 70; Suit 311 could run concurrently in parallel.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The court’s decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The overarching issue before the court was whether JHP’s stay application should be allowed.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In <span class="font-italic">Phang Choo Ong</span>, Chua Lee Ming JC (as he then was) held that the court would take into account three non-exhaustive factors in determining whether to exercise its discretion to grant a stay of winding-up proceedings (at [18]-[20]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The applicant must show that the state of affairs requiring the company to be wound up no longer exists. Where the winding up was on the ground of insolvency, the applicant must show credible evidence of solvency.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Nevertheless, a stay would be refused if granting the stay is detrimental to commercial morality and the interests of the public. Such detriment could take the form of the company being a grave commercial risk to potential investors and creditors, or the directors failing to comply with their statutory and common law obligations.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) A stay would also be refused if the interests of the creditors, the members, and the liquidator are not served by the stay. For instance, a stay is unlikely to be granted if there are no arrangements to pay the creditors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">SCPL relied on factor (a) and said that JHP needed to show credible evidence of solvency as a prerequisite to obtaining a stay.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 On the other hand, JHP relied on cases such as <span class="font-italic">Metalform Asia Pte Ltd v Holland Leedon Pte Ltd</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 268 (“<span class="font-italic">Metalform</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Denmark Skibstekniske Konsulenter A/S I Likvidation (formerly known as Knud E Hansen A/S) v Ultrapolis 3000 Investments Ltd (formerly known as Ultrapolis 3000 Theme Park Investments Ltd)</span> [2011] 4 SLR 997 (“<span class="font-italic">Ultrapolis</span>”) for the proposition that a stay application could be granted as long as JHP could show a genuine cross-claim that exceeded SCPL’s claim (an issue which I shall come to later). These cases did not reference any requirement that the stay applicant (in this case, JHP) must demonstrate that it was solvent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In my view, <span class="font-italic">Metalform</span> and <span class="font-italic">Ultrapolis</span> were more relevant to the present dispute. The reason for this was that, similar to the present proceedings, they concerned applications to stay winding-up proceedings where winding-up orders had not yet been made. <span class="font-italic">Metalform</span> was a case where the applicant sought an injunction restraining <span class="font-italic">potential</span> winding-up proceedings even though no such proceedings had yet been filed (<span class="font-italic">Metalform </span>at [4]). The Court of Appeal explained that at this stage, all that was needed to be shown was a likelihood that the winding-up proceedings may fail or that it is unlikely that a winding-up order would be made (at [77]). The court explained the policy rationale for this test as follows (at [82]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the policy consideration [is] that the <span class="font-italic">commercial viability of a company should not be put into jeopardy by the premature presentation of a winding-up petition against it where it has a serious cross-claim based on substantial grounds</span>. Such a petition may adversely affect the reputation and the business of the company and may also set in motion a process that may create cross-defaults or cut the company off from further sources of financing, thereby exacerbating its financial condition. So long as the court is satisfied that on the evidence there is a distinct possibility that the cross-claim may exceed the undisputed debt, it should give the company the opportunity to prove its claim rather than to allow a winding-up petition to be filed, with all the normal consequences attendant upon the filing of such a petition. <span class="font-italic">Businesses that have a chance of recovery should not be pushed into a state that makes it difficult for them to recover</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In other words, at this stage of the proceedings, because the applicant company was not yet declared insolvent by virtue of the winding-up order being made, it should not be “pushed into” handling the consequences that would come with being an insolvent company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The same test was adopted in <span class="font-italic">Ultrapolis</span>, which concerned winding-up proceedings which had already been filed but which had not yet culminated in the making of a winding-up order. Here, too, Quentin Loh J applied the standard set out <span class="font-italic">in</span> <span class="font-italic">Metalform</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the applicant had to show a likelihood that the winding-up proceedings may fail or that it is unlikely that a winding-up order would be made. Loh J observed that although <span class="font-italic">Metalform</span> concerned an injunction application made <span class="font-italic">before </span>the filing of a winding-up petition, the Court of Appeal had “implicitly affirmed” that the same test would apply <span class="font-italic">after </span>the winding-up petition had been filed, as the policy rationale was the same (<span class="font-italic">Ultrapolis </span>at [23]). Indeed, the same principles would apply since a company which was the subject of a winding-up application but which had not yet been made the subject of a winding-up <span class="font-italic">order</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>should also not be treated like a company that had already been wound up (at [22]–[23]). He went on to explain that the test at this stage was equivalent to that of the applicant having to show a triable issue in resisting a summary judgment application (at [24]–[26]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In contrast, <span class="font-italic">Phang Choo Ong</span> concerned an application for the stay of a winding-up order that had already been made but had not yet been executed (<span class="font-italic">Phang Choo Ong </span>at [8]). Indeed, Chua JC explained at [18] that the principle in such cases was that where “the winding up was on the ground of insolvency, the applicant [for a stay] has to show that the company is solvent”. The concerns at this stage are vastly different from the concerns <span class="font-italic">prior</span> to the making of a winding-up order, since at this stage the applicant company has already been declared insolvent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 This distinction is further buttressed by the fact that applications for a stay of winding-up proceedings before and after the winding-up order has been made are governed by two different provisions under the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed). Stays <span class="font-italic">prior</span> to the winding-up order are governed by s 258 of the Companies Act. Section 258 provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Power to stay or restrain proceedings against company</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">258. </span>At any time after the making of a winding up application and before a winding up order has been made, the company or any creditor or contributory may, where any action or proceeding against the company is pending, apply to the Court to stay or restrain further proceedings in the action or proceeding, and the Court may stay or restrain the proceedings accordingly on such terms as it thinks fit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In contrast, stays sought <span class="font-italic">after</span> the winding-up order has been made are governed by s 279(1) of the Companies Act (which was referred to in <span class="font-italic">Phang Choo Ong</span> at [13] as the governing provision), which provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Power to stay winding up</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">279.—</span>(1) At any time <span class="font-italic">after an order for winding up has been made</span>, the Court may, on the application of the liquidator or of any creditor or contributory and on proof to the satisfaction of the Court that all proceedings in relation to the winding up ought to be stayed, make an order staying the proceedings either altogether or for a limited time on such terms and conditions as the Court thinks fit.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This section clearly operates at “any time after an order for winding up has been made”. Hence, I found that the test laid down in <span class="font-italic">Phang Choo Ong</span>, namely, that the stay applicant must show that it is solvent, is not applicable as a prerequisite to granting a stay in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Were there sufficient grounds to grant a stay of CWU 70?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 JHP pleaded three grounds in support of its stay application: (a) it had a genuine cross-claim that exceeded SCPL’s main claim; (b) SCPL took out CWU 70 for a collateral purpose; and (c) refusing the stay would cause irreparable harm to JHP. SCPL disagreed with all three submissions and further submitted that it was JHP which had filed Suit 311 for a collateral purpose and therefore the court should not grant a stay of CWU 70. As I shall explain subsequently, SCPL’s argument that Suit 311 was filed for a collateral purpose is not a standalone argument but just one factor in determining whether JHP’s cross-claim was genuine. I shall therefore examine each of JHP’s three submissions in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Did JHP have a genuine cross-claim that exceeded SCPL’s claim?</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The law</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In the present case, JHP sought a stay of the winding-up proceedings (before a winding-up order was made) based on a cross-claim. In such cases, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Metalform</span> at [74] and [77], and the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Ultrapolis</span> at [28]–[29], have confirmed that the court would exercise its discretion to stay the proceedings if:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the applicant can show that there was a genuine cross-claim;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the applicant can show that the cross-claim was greater than the claim of the creditor seeking the winding up; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) there are no other special circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Apart from these three requirements, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Metalform</span> appeared to have implicitly approved in <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> a fourth requirement that the applicant must have been unable to litigate the cross-claim prior to the winding-up action (at [77]). In other words, if the applicant had a chance to litigate the claim in previous proceedings but chose not to do so, then it could not ask the court to stay the winding-up proceedings as that would be an abuse of the court’s process. In <span class="font-italic">Ultrapolis</span>, however, Loh J rejected this as a separate requirement. He explained that although the failure to litigate the claim was a weighty consideration, it should properly be considered as one factor in determining whether the cross-claim was genuine (<span class="font-italic">Ultrapolis</span> at [36]). If the applicant could have raised the claim in previous proceedings between the parties but chose not to do so, it would not be “genuine” for the applicant to now raise it in separate, subsequent proceedings. The stay in <span class="font-italic">Ultrapolis</span> was ultimately refused because the applicant could have raised the matter in arbitration as early as four years prior to the stay application but chose not to (at [41]–[46]). I agreed with <span class="font-italic">Ultrapolis</span> and found that this is not a separate requirement but one factor in determining whether the cross-claim was genuine. Hence, JHP must show that it had (a) a genuine cross-claim that (b) exceeded SCPL’s claim. The stay would then be granted unless SCPL could raise any special circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In relation to these two requirements, JHP only needed to show that there was a <span class="font-italic">triable issue</span>. As noted earlier, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Metalform</span> held that all the applicant needed to show was a likelihood that the winding-up proceedings may fail or that it was unlikely that a winding-up order would be made (<span class="font-italic">Metalform </span>at [77]). This was because the applicant company, at this stage, had not yet been found insolvent and therefore should be given a chance to prove at trial that its cross-claim exceeds the respondent’s claim without the attendant consequences of a winding-up order being made (at [82]). The Court of Appeal also considered and rejected the higher standard under New Zealand law that the applicant must show that the winding-up application is “bound to fail” (at [86]–[88]). <span class="font-italic">Ultrapolis</span> confirmed that the same standard of proof also applies where a winding-up application has already been made but a winding-up order has not been made. Loh J further explained that the applicant in cross-claim proceedings should not be “twice vexed by allowing the petitioning creditor to re-litigate the same issue at the hearing of the winding-up petition” (<span class="font-italic">Ultrapolis</span> at [25]). I adopted both these observations and found that JHP had shown that there was a triable issue. I now explain.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Must the cross-claim arise from the same contract as the statutory demand?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In dealing with the issue of whether JHP had a genuine cross-claim, I had to address SCPL’s argument that JHP’s cross-claim had to arise from the same contract as SCPL’s claim under the statutory demand. Although SCPL’s submissions on this point did not explicitly fall within any of the requirements that I have noted at [25] above, this issue was still relevant. In essence, the issue was whether a “genuine cross-claim” under requirement (a) would necessarily be restricted to only a cross-claim under the same contract or whether <span class="font-italic">any</span> genuine cross-claim would suffice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In this case, SCPL’s winding-up action was based on the Upper Jurong project while JHP’s cross-claim was based on unrectified defects found in a separate contract, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the sub-contract between the parties in respect of the Tuas project. Hence, SCPL argued that the cross-claim was not one that could be considered for the purposes of the stay application. In support of its position that the cross-claim needed to arise from the same contract, SCPL cited three cases: <span class="font-italic">Engineering Construction Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Sanchoon Builders Pte Ltd </span>[2011] 1 SLR 681, <span class="font-italic">Pacific Rim Investment Pte Ltd v Lam Seng Tiong</span><span class="font-italic"> and another </span>[1995] 2 SLR(R) 643, and<span class="font-italic"> The </span><span class="font-italic">Nanfri </span>[1978] QB 927.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I informed learned counsel for SCPL that while these cases set out the general principle that a cross-claim under a secondary contract must bear some nexus to the main contract in order for it to be set-off, these cases did not deal with how this principle applies in the context of winding-up proceedings. SCPL’s counsel did not disagree with my observation on these cases. Hence, the principles elucidated in these cases were not directly relevant to the present case. I had to consider what the position was where cross-claims were pleaded against the backdrop of winding-up proceedings. I also had to consider whether the principle would change in the context of a winding-up action founded on a SOPA claim, as none of the cases cited to me dealt with claims under SOPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I shall begin by looking at the position under SOPA. In <span class="font-italic">Hua Rong Engineering Pte Ltd v Civil Tech Pte Ltd</span> [2017] SGHC 179, after surveying the relevant local and foreign authorities and the relevant similar provisions of other jurisdictions, I held that cross-claims under the SOPA regime are limited to cross-claims within a <span class="font-italic">single</span> contract, and not to claims across contracts. Essentially, this was based both on the text of SOPA (which consistently used the phrases “<span class="font-italic">a</span> contract” or “<span class="font-italic">the</span> contract”, in the singular) (at [28]), and policy reasons (to limit the scope of what an adjudicator considers to give effect to the policy of quick and simple justice) (at [80]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 However, this winding-up action was not premised on SOPA. SCPL applied to wind up JHP under s 254(1)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the Companies Act and JHP applied to stay this winding-up action under s 279(1) of the Companies Act. Unlike SOPA, the Companies Act does not stipulate that the cross-claim must also originate from the main claim in order for it to be relevant under a stay application. Neither do the provisions of the Companies Act indicate that only same-contract cross-claims can be considered. The policy concerns of quick and simple justice that underlie SOPA are also not present in the insolvency regime. The common law on insolvency also does not have any such restriction. As long as there is a genuine cross-claim that exceeds the sum of the statutory demand, the cross-claim can be considered by the court in determining whether to grant a stay.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In my view, this is the correct approach. Unlike an adjudicator under the SOPA regime, the court dealing with insolvency issues is not confined to the policy of quick and simple justice. The court is also not bound by the practical limitations that an adjudicator faces under SOPA, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the need to issue the adjudication award within a limited period specified under SOPA. Furthermore, winding up a corporate entity is a serious matter as it is akin to ordering the demise of a legal entity. Hence, when dealing with the broader issue of whether a corporate entity should be wound up, a triable issue of <span class="font-italic">any</span> genuine cross-claim that exceeds the amount of the statutory demand should be sufficient reason to grant the stay application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Having established that JHP’s cross-claim under a separate contract can be considered, I now turn to the issue of whether the cross-claim was genuine.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Was there a genuine cross-claim?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 JHP had shown that there was a triable issue in the form of a genuine cross-claim for unrectified defects under the Tuas project.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The correspondence between the parties indicated that both JHP and SCPL proceeded on the assumption that SCPL admitted liability towards JHP in respect of the unrectified defects:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On 30 May 2016, SCPL’s lawyers sent a letter to JHP’s lawyers specifically noting for the record that “our client is willing to rectify all defects so long as these are defects and not items involving wear and tear”.

One of the suggested options was that SCPL would “[make] payment to [Teck Leong Industries] of a mutually acceptable and agreed amount as damages for diminution in value in lieu of rectifying the defects”. Alternatively, SCPL proposed to rectify the defects according to certain parameters. The letter envisioned that upon rectification or payment, both Teck Leong Industries and JHP would release the sums that each had retained under the relevant contracts.

The bases of JHP’s cross-claim appeared to be consistent: rectification costs and retention money (retained by Teck Leong Industries). Only the quantification was different, and JHP appeared to have good reasons for the variation. On the different rectification costs, Lee explains in his affidavit that the rectification costs were only estimates by various surveyors. The rectification costs were initially pegged at $600,000 but this estimate was subsequently reduced to $420,000, which was consistent with the amendments in JHP’s statement of claim in Suit 311. The reference to the other sums of $450,330 and $620,000 were also readily explicable. $450,330 was a quote from a <span class="font-italic">separate</span> surveyor, while $620,000 was the estimate which Teck Leong Industries said <span class="font-italic">their</span> surveyor had given for the rectification costs without reference to the findings of JHP’s surveyor.

</div> These fluctuations were also minor and SCPL did not appear to contest the retention money heavily. Hence, I found that there was a triable issue as JHP had a genuine cross-claim, notwithstanding that it had changed the quantum that it claimed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In addition to the inconsistencies in the sums claimed, SCPL also referred the court to the chronology of events and said that it was clear that the cross-claim had only been filed by JHP in order to “stall” the winding-up proceedings. SCPL’s point was that when it filed CWU 70 on 5 April 2017, the parties (including Teck Leong Industries) were still in the midst of negotiations. The parties continued their negotiations when JHP filed Suit 311 five days later, on 10 April 2017. Hence, SCPL argued that Suit 311 was filed in order to forestall CWU 70 and not for the genuine purpose of pursuing its rights under the contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I did not accept SCPL’s submissions. SCPL’s filing of CWU 70 would have demonstrated to JHP that SCPL was seeking to have JHP wound up. If JHP had been wound up, then it would no longer be able to pursue its claim against SCPL for the rectification works, even though in JHP’s view (whether rightly or wrongly), it still had a claim that remained against SCPL. This was also why JHP argued during these proceedings that SCPL had taken out CWU 70 for a collateral purpose (a point which I shall examine in due course). Hence, JHP was justified in pursuing its claim under Suit 311 before it became impossible to do so by virtue of it having been wound up.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In any event, it appeared that the negotiations between the parties had long ceased by this time. SCPL’s latest offer was contained in a letter to Teck Leong Industries dated 13 January 2017, which gave an offer of $50,000 for full and final settlement of the defects (see [36(e)] above). Teck Leong Industries replied rejecting the offer. SCPL’s response was that the parties should not meet and Teck Leong Industries should engage its own building surveyor to liaise with SCPL’s surveyor on the methods of rectification.

</div> JHP was not involved in this set of correspondences as it did not reply to SCPL’s latest offer. It therefore appeared that the parties were at an impasse in relation to the methods of rectification and JHP had good reason to pursue the claims in court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Accordingly, I found that on the evidence shown, JHP did at least show a triable issue in a genuine cross-claim against SCPL.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Did the cross-claim exceed SCPL’s main claim?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The next issue that I dealt with was whether the sums that JHP claimed in its cross-claim exceeded SCPL’s main claim. SCPL’s position was that JHP’s net cross-claim was only $141,000, which was less than SCPL’s claimed sum. It derived this sum by deducting $180,000 in retention sums from $321,000, which was the estimate of JHP’s rectification costs found in Kris Chew’s affidavit dated 22 April 2017.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I accepted that there was at least a serious triable issue as to whether JHP’s cross-claim, even after deducting $180,000 in retention costs, would still exceed SCPL’s claim. There were a number of estimated costs put forth by JHP (see [38] above). Which of these sums accurately represented the costs of the rectification works would be a triable issue and SCPL would have its chance to cross-examine JHP’s surveyors on that point. While I was cognisant that an applicant like JHP could not simply create a triable issue by making a bare assertion as to the sums that were due to it, this did not appear to be the case here. JHP’s claimed sum was based on its own surveyors’ estimates and SCPL did not challenge the <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> of these surveyors.

For the same reasons stated above, I found that this did not constitute special circumstances that demanded that a stay be refused.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Strictly speaking, there is no need to consider this argument since I have already found that JHP has a genuine cross-claim. That would be reason enough to stay CWU 70 pending resolution of Suit 311. However, I will address this argument for completeness. Just as I did not accept that Suit 311 was brought for a collateral purpose, I also did not accept that CWU 70 was brought for a collateral purpose. CWU 70 was filed on 5 April 2017. By that time, the parties had been in extensive negotiations in relation to the rectification of defects and had also attended several meetings to resolve the matter. In particular, SCPL had been exploring various options for the parties to agree on the method of rectification and had even proposed a settlement sum of $50,000. It would make no sense that SCPL would choose to file CWU 70 only <span class="font-italic">at this point</span> to get around its obligation to rectify the defects, when it was already willing to take on the task of rectifying the defects and was only negotiating <span class="font-italic">how</span> to do so. If SCPL had wanted to avoid such obligations entirely it would not have bothered negotiating with JHP and Teck Leong Industries at all, let alone for such a long period and over so many letters.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 It is true that in both <span class="font-italic">Metalform</span> and <span class="font-italic">Ultrapolis</span>, suggestions that the petitioning creditors were merely seeking to circumvent the defendants’ cross-claims were rejected because these cross-claims had only surfaced <span class="font-italic">after</span> the winding-up proceedings (<span class="font-italic">Metalform</span> at [58]; <span class="font-italic">Ultrapolis</span> at [65]). However, this does not mean winding-up proceedings would invariably be for a collateral purpose if they were brought after the cross-claim was discovered (as in this case). SCPL applied to have JHP wound up for the purpose of seeking repayment of its debt. I did not think that JHP had raised enough evidence to show that SCPL had done so for any ulterior reason.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Would refusing the stay cause irreparable harm to JHP?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 As with the argument on SCPL’s collateral purpose, there was also no need for me to address the submissions that JHP would suffer irreparable harm if a stay were refused. But if there was a need to address it, I would have found that such proceedings would bring harm to JHP’s reputation and business that could not be adequately remedied. However, as the Court of Appeal noted in <span class="font-italic">Metalform</span> at [59], this factor by itself would be insufficient to grant a stay. The irreparable harm suffered by JHP here was only significant when paired with the fact that JHP had a genuine cross-claim. It was only because JHP had such a cross-claim which remained unresolved that it was unfair for JHP to be the subject of a winding-up order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In coming to the above conclusion, I was cognisant that SCPL’s underlying claim was made under SOPA. Nevertheless, I held that although SCPL’s underlying claim was based on SOPA, the standard of proof to be met in an application to stay the winding up was no different.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Was it relevant that SCPL’s underlying claim arose under SOPA?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 SCPL’s position was that since its underlying claim was under SOPA, it should be entitled to “simply want [its] money” and that the parties could still carry on the negotiations or litigation (as the case may be) for the Tuas project.

</div> While SCPL conceded that it could not find any authority directly on point, it referred to <span class="font-italic">Lim Poh Yeoh</span><span class="font-italic"> (alias Aster Lim) v TS Ong Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2017] SGHC 11 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Poh Yeoh</span>”) where the plaintiff refused to pay a judgment debt arising from an adjudication determination but started separate proceedings against the defendant for defective works. The defendant successfully obtained a stay of the plaintiff’s new claim until the latter paid the judgment debt. Foo Chee Hock JC granted the stay on the basis that the plaintiff’s new claim was an abuse of the court’s process (<span class="font-italic">Lim Poh Yeoh </span>at [15]). SCPL submitted that in both <span class="font-italic">Lim Poh Yeoh</span> and the present case, the applicant for the stay was “obtaining an advantage that the SOPA regime does not even offer them”.

</div>
</div>
</div> Hence, SCPL asked the court to come to the same conclusion as was reached in <span class="font-italic">Lim Poh Yeoh</span> and compel JHP to pay the judgment debt (in this case, through CWU 70).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I disagreed with SCPL’s submissions. Before I examined <span class="font-italic">Lim Poh Yeoh</span> and its impact on this case, I noted that the answer to this question was already dealt with in the relevant parliamentary debates during the second reading of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Bill 2004 (Bill 54/2004) (“the SOP Bill”), which was later enacted as Act 57/2004. There, Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng, then-Minister of State for National Development, stated the following (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (16 November 2004) vol 78 (“<span class="font-italic">Singapore </span><span class="font-italic">Parliamentary Debates</span>”) at cols 1118–1119):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Payment disputes involving insolvency are not covered under the Bill. If any one of the parties involved is insolvent, the provisions allowing direct payment and lien on unfixed materials will not be applicable. This is to avoid upsetting creditor priorities under existing insolvency laws. For example, if a respondent is unable to pay the adjudicated amount because he is insolvent or under judicial management, the principal, in this case, cannot pay the claimant directly either. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In response to this application of the SOP Bill, Dr Amy Khor asked whether this would jeopardise sub-contractors’ legitimate interests to be paid (<span class="font-italic">Singapore </span><span class="font-italic">Parliamentary Debates</span> at col 1124):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Whilst direct payment from owners/developers to subcontractors would help to avoid suspension of work, I would like to ask the Minister, since the proposed Act would not over-ride the current law on insolvency, how then is the issue of the main contractor becoming insolvent resolved without jeopardising the legitimate interest of the subcontractors?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Mr Cedric Foo replied that while this might not give full effect to such sub-contractors’ rights, this was acceptable as the purpose of efficient cash flow under the SOPA regime had to be subordinated to the “higher justice” of ensuring priority payments to creditors under the insolvency regime (<span class="font-italic">Singapore </span><span class="font-italic">Parliamentary Debates</span> at col 1133):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… She [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Dr Amy Khor] also asked why insolvency is not dealt with here, although payment woes in the construction industry are indeed a form of injustice. But in the area of insolvency, there is a higher justice that must be served. There is an established priority of payments that have to be made to different parties who have suffered as a result of a party going insolvent. So this priority should not be upset just because of the payment woes in the construction industry. So we have therefore left insolvent cases alone so as not to disrupt a process which is working well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In other words, Parliament had already considered that a claim under SOPA might potentially conflict with a claim under the insolvency regime. It had expressly intended that the latter would prevail in such situations because the insolvency regime had far-reaching consequences, including that of preferring certain creditors over others due to their security over the company’s assets. Allowing SOPA claimants to intrude into this regime would unnecessarily tilt the balance in favour of the construction industry over other creditors. This was an intrusion that Parliament was unwilling to endorse. Accordingly, even though the policy underlying SOPA is expeditious dispute resolution for quick cash flow, it cannot override the scheme under the Companies Act, which gives a company that is the subject of winding-up proceedings a chance to prove its cross-claims before a winding-up order is made and the attendant consequences flow, if it can show that there is a triable issue as to the cross-claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I now turn to <span class="font-italic">Lim Poh Yeoh</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Lim Poh Yeoh</span>, the defendant had an adjudication determination in its favour and had taken several enforcement proceedings against the plaintiff to enforce its adjudication determination as a judgment debtor. Concurrently, the plaintiff claimed for damages in relation to defective construction works. The question before the court was whether the plaintiff’s suit should be stayed because the plaintiff did not pay the judgment debt. Foo Chee Hock JC found that such “unilateral action” by the plaintiff “drove a coach and horses through the scheme established under SOPA and cynically defeated its legislative intent” (at [21]). Foo JC stayed the plaintiff’s claim until it paid the judgment debt, since “parties should not be allowed to withhold payment of the adjudicated sum whilst seeking to effectively overturn the adjudication determination at the same time” (at [20]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I noted that <span class="font-italic">Lim Poh Yeoh</span> did not concern a winding-up application and was hence of no assistance to the court in determining what was the appropriate balance to strike between an underlying claim arising out of SOPA on the one hand, and the insolvency regime on the other. Indeed, given the situation in <span class="font-italic">Lim Poh Yeoh</span>, it made eminent sense that SOPA, as the more specific regime, should take precedence over a general litigation claim. The same cannot be said for the insolvency regime, where there are special and specific considerations unlike general litigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In any event, the “legislative intent” underlying SOPA that Foo JC elucidated in <span class="font-italic">Lim Poh Yeoh</span> did not apply in this case. In coming to his decision, Foo JC considered significant that the plaintiff was able but unwilling to pay the judgment debt (at [12] and [22]). This would circumvent SOPA because a respondent challenging an adjudication determination under SOPA would have to first pay into court the adjudicated sum before he is allowed to challenge the adjudication (at [19]). The plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Lim Poh Yeoh</span> could not get around this protection by filing a separate suit and using it as an excuse not to pay the judgment debt. But in this case, there was no circumvention of SOPA because JHP said that SCB was willing to pay the adjudicated amount into court for JHP.

</div> This would be what JHP would have had to do under SOPA anyway if it had wanted to challenge an adjudication determination in court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Accordingly, I found that both in principle and on the facts of this case, it would not make a difference that SCPL’s underlying claim arose out of SOPA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conditions of stay</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Given the potential policy concerns surrounding SOPA and the fact that JHP had indicated its willingness to pay the adjudicated sum into court as a condition for the stay of CWU 70, I ordered JHP to pay the amount that SCPL claimed in its statutory demand within seven days of the stay.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 SCPL asked for costs of $10,000 (inclusive of disbursements) to be awarded to it in view of the amount of work and the affidavits filed. SCPL argued that it had a right to seek winding up against JHP notwithstanding that CWU 70 was eventually stayed. Conversely, JHP asked for costs of $15,000 (inclusive of disbursements) on the basis that costs should follow the event. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 SCPL had instituted CWU 70 to wind up JHP. The latter took out SUM 1659 to stay the winding-up application. JHP had succeeded in its stay action and also offered to pay the amount of the statutory demand into court. In accordance with O 59 r 3(2), which prescribes the usual rule that costs follow the event, I ordered that SCPL was to pay costs of $5,000 to JHP (inclusive of disbursements) given that JHP had succeeded in its application to stay CWU 70.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 For the above reasons, I allowed JHP’s application for CWU 70 to be stayed pending the disposal of JHP’s action in Suit 311. However, as a condition of the stay, I ordered JHP to pay into court the amount that SCPL claimed in its statutory demand dated 13 March 2017. This payment had to be made within seven days of my order (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, within seven days of 31 July 2017). SCPL was to pay $5,000 in costs to JHP (inclusive of disbursements).</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Siong Thye<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Andy Chiok (Michael Khoo &amp; Partners) for the plaintiff in CWU No 70/2017 and for the respondent in Summons No 1659/2017;<br/>Kris Chew Yee Fong (Zenith Law Corporation) for the defendant in CWU No 70/2017 and for the applicant in Summons No 1659/2017.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
