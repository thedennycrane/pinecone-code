</div> As such, the project director is not <span class="font-italic">functus</span><span class="font-italic"> officio </span>with regard to his certifying function: <span class="font-italic">LW Infrastructure</span> at [51]–[53].

This distinction is material.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The authorities speak with one voice in showing that a contractor who has performed works under a construction contract can continue to claim for such works even <span class="font-italic">after</span> its employment under the contract has been terminated. This is because the contractor has an <span class="font-italic">accrued </span>statutory entitlement to payment, which necessarily survives the termination: <span class="font-italic">CHL Construction Pte Ltd v Yangguang Group Pte Ltd </span>[2019] 4 SLR 1382 at [21]–[22], <span class="font-italic">AU v AV </span>[2006] SGSOP 9 at [13] and <span class="font-italic">Tiong Seng Contractors (Pte) Ltd v Chuan Lim Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 364 at [17]–[18]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 That the contractor’s entitlement to payment survives termination accords with the legislative intent of the SOPA, which seeks to facilitate cash flow in the building and construction industry. As Woo Bih Li J observed in <span class="font-italic">Choi Peng Kum</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Tan Poh Eng Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2014] 1 SLR 1210 at [38]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Most contractors have more than one project. The money received under one project may be used for the same project and/or for other projects. The fact that a project is ended by termination and that the contractor is no longer carrying out works thereunder does not necessarily mean that his concern for cash flow ends. The fact that he is no longer carrying out works under that project does not mean that all his expenses come abruptly to a halt. Furthermore, he might also be under liabilities and/or have made payments to other subcontractors or suppliers for the same project for which he was seeking reimbursement, plus the profit element, from the owner before the project is terminated.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Hence, it cannot be right that the SOPA no longer applies to works done before the termination of the said contract. Such an interpretation would place subcontractors and suppliers at the mercy of the main contractor or employer, who can resist or delay payment for works done or goods supplied by terminating the underlying contract on tenuous grounds. Apart from contradicting the express wording under s 5 of the SOPA, this clearly militates against the underlying legislative intent of the SOPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 It is noteworthy that there has been a recent amendment to the SOPA. Instead of “a construction contract or a supply contract” (s 2 of the SOPA), a “contract” under the SOPA will soon be defined as “a construction contract or a supply contract, <span class="font-italic">and includes a construction contract or a supply contract that has been terminated</span>” [emphasis added]: clause 2(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment (Amendment) Bill (No 38 of 2018) (“SOP (Amendment) Bill of 2018”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 This amendment was explained during the second reading of the SOP (Amendment) Bill of 2018 (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(2 October 2018) vol 94 (Zaqy Mohamad, Minister of State for National Development) (“Parliamentary Debates”)):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Another amendment, also at clause 3, will make clear that claims for work done or goods supplied before termination are valid. This is to <span class="font-italic">address any ambiguity</span> on the point as to whether claimants can apply for adjudication upon contract termination… [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Although the SOP (Amendment) Bill of 2018 has not come into force, the Parliamentary Debates makes it clear that the SOP (Amendment) Bill of 2018 does not change the current position. It seeks only to “address any ambiguity”. Hence, it must be correct that, even at present, a contractor or supplier who is entitled to a progress payment may still serve such a payment claim <span class="font-italic">after </span>the termination of the contract, so long as the claim relates to works done or goods and services supplied <span class="font-italic">before </span>the termination of the contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 It is therefore clear that the adjudicator in AA 203 had wrongly decided the issue of whether the plaintiff was entitled to serve payment claims for works done prior to the termination of its employment under the Sub-Contract. This error went towards the jurisdiction of both adjudicators in AA 203 and AA 245 (where the latter held that the plaintiff remained bound by the prior adjudicator’s erroneous findings in this regard). Hence, I am satisfied that there are just grounds to set aside both ADs: see <span class="font-italic">Citiwall Safety Glass Pte Ltd v Mansource Interior Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 1 SLR 797 at [48].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 However, the adjudicator’s primary ground for the rejection of the plaintiff’s claim in AA 203 was the improper service of PC 12 on the defendant. The plaintiff has not contested this issue in the hearing before me. For this reason, I find that this aspect of the adjudicator’s determination in AA 203 ought not to be set aside. The court has the power to set aside a severable part of an AD for jurisdictional error if it is both textually and substantially severable from the remainder of the determination: <span class="font-italic">Rong Shun Engineering &amp; Construction Pte Ltd v CP Ong Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2017] 4 SLR 359 at [141] and [155]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I accordingly exercise my discretion to sever only those parts of the AD of AA 203 which dealt with the issue of whether the plaintiff could issue a payment claim post-termination of the Sub-Contract.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold">Engineering Construction </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">and</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> LW Infrastructure</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">are inapplicable to the SOPA regime</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 From the foregoing, it can be seen that under the SOPA regime, a contractor’s entitlement to progress payment is premised on work done, or goods and services supplied, under a contract. Such an accrued entitlement to payment survives termination of the contract. In this regard, the SOPA and the relevant cases relating to the SOPA above do not distinguish between cases where the <span class="font-italic">entire </span>contract is terminated, and cases where only the <span class="font-italic">employment </span>under the contract is terminated. Instead, the fundamental concern is whether the right to payment accrued under the SOPA. This is consistent with the Parliamentary Debates, which simply makes clear that, under the SOPA, “claims for work done or goods supplied before termination are valid”, with no distinction between the types of termination (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>of the entire contract or the employment only). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Hence, for claims under the SOPA, any distinction between the termination of a contractor’s <span class="font-italic">employment </span>and of the <span class="font-italic">entire contract </span>are immaterial. This is not at odds with both<span class="font-italic"> Engineering Construction </span>and <span class="font-italic">LW Infrastructure</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>as they<span class="font-italic"> </span>were both cases which did not involve the SOPA. While <span class="font-italic">Engineering Construction </span>pre-dated the SOPA, <span class="font-italic">LW Infrastructure </span>was concerned with an appeal against an arbitrator’s award under s 49(1) of the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Nonetheless, my decision does not turn on this issue as the fact remains that the adjudicator in AA 203 committed the error in finding that the project director was <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span> in relation to his certifying functions. This was against the authority of <span class="font-italic">LW Infrastructure</span> (see [15] above).<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic"> </span> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Declaratory order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 As for the declaratory order sought, I am satisfied that the three requirements as summarised in <span class="font-italic">DNKH Logistics Pte Ltd v Liberty Insurance Pte Ltd </span>[2019] 4 SLR 1063 at [23] have been satisfied. They are: (a) that the plaintiff has a real interest in bringing the action; (b) that there is a real controversy between the parties; and (c) that the declaration relates to a right which is personal to the plaintiff and which is enforceable against the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In the main, since both adjudicators dismissed the plaintiff’s claims for work done prior to the termination of its employment under the Sub-Contract, there remains a real controversy to be resolved by way of adjudication under the SOPA. This is clearly the plaintiff’s personal right, and it has a real interest, in the form of monetary satisfaction (if successful), in having its claims against the defendant adjudicated under the SOPA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 For the above reasons, I allow the plaintiff’s application and grant the following orders:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) That the AD made in AA 203 be set aside in part.
