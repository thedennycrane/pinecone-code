These complaints were referred to an Inquiry Committee (“the IC”). The IC recommended, in relation to one head of complaint that Mr Koh had acted against the Applicant’s instructions, that a penalty of $2,500 be imposed with no need for a formal investigation. Other heads of complaint were dismissed. Council of the Law Society (“the Council”) adopted the IC’s recommendations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Dissatisfied with the Council’s decision, the Applicant filed an application under s 96 of the LPA for the High Court to direct the Law Society to apply to the Chief Justice for the appointment of a Disciplinary Tribunal (“DT”) in respect of his complaints. Before me, the Applicant proceeded on three of the seven heads of complaint raised in his original letter of complaint to the Law Society. On the evidence, I find that the Applicant has established sufficient grounds to show that two of the three heads of complaint warrant further investigation and consideration by a DT.

He apologised to AR Tay, explaining that he thought that the hearing was fixed at 2.30 pm later in the afternoon.

Paragraph 44 alleged that Mr Koh had withheld from the Applicant the fact that the Consent Order had been entered into, and had failed to advise the Applicant on the viability of an appeal against a consent order when the Applicant instructed him to file an appeal against the Striking Out Order. Accordingly, the substance of the Applicant’s complaint here more appropriately related to his third head of complaint, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “[a]cting against instructions and his deception on Consent Orders” (see above at [25(a)(iii)]).

In relation to these two heads of complaint, which concern respectively the Consent Order and Mr Koh’s conduct in misleading the Court during the hearing of the Divorce Applications, the evidence evinces a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of ethical breach which is of sufficient gravity as to warrant formal investigation and consideration by a DT. In this regard, the IC misdirected its mind and misunderstood the material objective evidence on record. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In relation to the third head of complaint regarding Mr Koh’s purported conflict of interests, the allegation does not meet the <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>threshold and is therefore dismissed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 As for the Applicant’s allegations against the IC and the Council, given my decision to refer part of the Applicant’s present complaints to the DT, it is not necessary to come to a conclusion on these matters.

That raises a preliminary question as to the relevance of the introduction in 2015 of the new LPA and the LPPCR 2015.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In relation to the LPA, the new LPA came into force on 1 January 2015 and introduced significant amendments in two aspects: (a) it extended the then-existing disciplinary framework for Singapore-qualified lawyers to foreign-qualified lawyers who are registered in Singapore, and (b) it sought to ensure that both categories of lawyers fall under the Supreme Court’s ultimate supervisory oversight (see Legal Profession (Amendment) Act 2014 (No 40 of 2014); <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(4 November 2014), vol 92 (K Shanmugam, Minister for Law)). As Mr Koh is a Singapore-qualified lawyer, the 2015 amendments to the LPA do not materially change the disciplinary framework to which he is subject even if I were to take the Applicant’s case that the solicitor-client relationship arose in August 2014 and ended in August 2015. Similarly, other subsequent amendments to the LPA introduced do not affect the applicable disciplinary framework. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 For completeness, I note that in relation to the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules, the LPPCR 2015 only came into effect on 18 November 2015 (see r 1 of the LPPCR 2015).

Consistent with such a role, the investigative burden borne by the Inquiry Committee is not an onerous one: it only needs to determine if there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of ethical breach or other misconduct by a lawyer that warrants formal investigation and consideration by a DT. As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Whit</span><span class="font-italic">ehouse Holdings Pte Ltd v Law Society of Singapore </span>[1994] 2 SLR(R) 485 (“<span class="font-italic">Whitehouse Holdings</span>”) (at [38]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The role of the Inquiry Committee is merely to investigate the complaint.

In <span class="font-italic">Subbiah</span><span class="font-italic"> Pillai v Wong Meng Meng</span> [2000] 3 SLR(R) 404 (“<span class="font-italic">Subbiah</span><span class="font-italic"> Pillai (HC)</span>”), Choo Han Teck JC (as he then was) stated as follows (at [16]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [The Inquiry Committee’s] primary role is that of the investigator, a role that is sometimes not fully appreciated because of the slightly misleading description attached to the function of the Disciplinary Committee (the conduct of a ‘formal investigation’) when, in fact, by that stage the bulk of the investigative work ought to have been completed by the Inquiry Committee although the prosecuting counsel for the Law Society may still wish to verify or augment various aspects of the Law Society’s case before the Disciplinary Committee. <span class="font-italic">The Inquiry Committee’s role is not merely to uncover only such evidence as is sufficient to pass on to the Disciplinary Committee for further investigation. The Inquiry Committee is expected to investigate as fully as it can before presenting its report to the Council. It can scarcely justify making any of the </span><span class="font-italic">recommendations which the Act empowers it to make unless it had conducted a thorough inquiry into the facts</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 However, with respect, the expectation that the Inquiry Committee should conduct investigations “as fully as it can” appears to go against the preponderance of authorities which suggest that the Inquiry Committee is not a thorough investigator of complaints but rather the organ to determine merely whether there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case warranting formal investigation by a DT. Indeed, on appeal from <span class="font-italic">Subbiah</span><span class="font-italic"> Pillai (HC)</span>, the Court of Appeal appears to have adopted a different philosophy even though it did not expressly disagree with the High Court. Citing <span class="font-italic">Whitehouse </span><span class="font-italic">Holdings</span>, Chao Hick Tin JA stated as follows (<span class="font-italic">Subbiah</span><span class="font-italic"> Pillai v Wong Meng Meng and others </span>[2001] 2 SLR(R) 556 (“<span class="font-italic">Subbiah</span><span class="font-italic"> Pillai (CA)</span>”) at [32]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Under the Act, the function of the [Inquiry Committee] is only to inquire into complaints, to eliminate frivolous complaints and to ensure that only complaints which have been <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> established will proceed to be heard formally and determined by the [DT].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In support of this proposition, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Subbiah</span><span class="font-italic"> Pillai (CA)</span> explained that the assessment conducted by the Inquiry Committee is “essentially a screening exercise” and therefore “should not be an elaborate process like a trial… [but] should be informal. Otherwise, it would unduly burden a process which would not be warranted. It would be a waste of human and financial resources to have two full-blown hearings. It is a question of proportionality and practicality” (at [58]–[59]). Furthermore, the fact that the Inquiry Committee has broad powers to call and question witnesses on oath, and to make important decisions in respect of the complaints, did not render it more than a mere inquisitorial organ (<span class="font-italic">Subbiah</span><span class="font-italic"> Pillai (CA) </span>at [62]–[63]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">62 … In our judgment… the Legislature felt that if the infraction on the part of the solicitor is minor, not warranting a formal investigation, it would be expedient to deal with it in a summary manner [by the Inquiry Committee in exercising its power to recommend alternative sanctions other than dismissal and formal investigation].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">63 True, in this eventuality, <span class="font-italic">the </span>[<span class="font-italic">Inquiry Committee</span>]<span class="font-italic"> seems to be making some sort of definitive decision here, but this can in no way alter the fundamental character of the </span>[<span class="font-italic">Inquiry Committee</span>]<span class="font-italic">, which is only to inquire.</span> … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Accordingly, <span class="font-italic">Subbiah</span><span class="font-italic"> Pillai (CA) </span>stands for and affirms the propositions that (a) the Inquiry Committee’s role is informal and inquisitorial, and (b) the principal question to be addressed by the Inquiry Committee is whether the complaint raises a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of ethical breach or other misconduct as to warrant formal investigation and consideration by a DT. It is worth noting that these propositions were stated in <span class="font-italic">Subbiah</span><span class="font-italic"> Pillai (CA)</span>, as well as in <span class="font-italic">Seet</span><span class="font-italic"> Melvin </span>and <span class="font-italic">Chan Chow Wang</span>, in the context of the courts there addressing the issue of what natural justice required in proceedings before the Inquiry Committee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 It should further be noted that <span class="font-italic">Subbiah</span><span class="font-italic"> Pillai (CA) </span>also supports the proposition that the Inquiry Committee may sieve out and decline to refer to the DT any complaint that, even if taken at face value, would not raise sufficiently grave concerns as to warrant formal investigation. This would be consistent with ss 86(7)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) and (ii) of the LPA, which permit the Inquiry Committee to order a penalty to be paid by the lawyer concerned, reprimand him, or give him a warning, if the Inquiry Committee takes the view that formal investigation by a DT is not required (see above at [56]). As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Subbiah</span><span class="font-italic"> Pillai (CA) </span>(at [62]), these provisions reflect the legislative sentiment that it would be expedient to deal with minor infractions in a summary manner instead of subjecting it to a formal investigation (see quotation above at [66]). A threshold test of gravity would also allow the Inquiry Committee to better give effect to the concerns of proportionality and practicality within the disciplinary framework, as highlighted in <span class="font-italic">Subbiah</span><span class="font-italic"> Pillai (CA)</span> (at [59]) (see above at [66]). Therefore, in addition to the <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>evidential threshold, there is a threshold of gravity which the Inquiry Committee should address.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In the circumstances, in evaluating a complaint, the Inquiry Committee should address its mind as to whether the complaint and the evidence evince a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of ethical breach or other misconduct that is of sufficient gravity as to warrant a formal investigation and consideration by the DT. If the evidential basis for the complaint cannot even meet the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> threshold, or if the breach or misconduct alleged is relatively minor even if taken at face value, the Inquiry Committee may decline to recommend a formal investigation of the complaint, and accordingly dismiss the complaint or recommend alternative sanctions to be imposed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Relevance of the Review Committee</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 A final issue regarding the introduction of the machinery of the Review Committee in late 2001 should be addressed. As mentioned (see above at [55]), under the new disciplinary regime, the Review Committee is the first body to examine a complaint lodged with the Law Society, and its involvement in the disciplinary process chronologically precedes even the Inquiry Committee. Under s 85(8) of the LPA, the Review Committee may on completion of its review of a complaint do one of two things: (a) direct the Council to dismiss the matter if the Review Committee members are unanimously of the view that the complaint is “frivolous, vexatious, misconceived or lacking in substance”, or (b) refer the matter back to the Chairman of the Inquiry Panel who is obliged under s 85(10) of the LPA to constitute an Inquiry Committee to inquire into the complaint. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In my view, although the Review Committee may to some extent serve a similar sifting function as the Inquiry Committee by virtue of its power to direct the Council to dismiss frivolous or groundless complaints, the introduction of the Review Committee did not substantively change the role of or procedure before the Inquiry Committee as established by prior case law. Rather, both the Review Committee and the Inquiry Committee were intended to serve sifting functions in the disciplinary process, albeit at different stages and with differing focuses and intensities. This position is supported by the speech of the then Minister for Law, Professor S Jayakumar at the Second Reading of the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill 2001 (No 39 of 2001), where he explained the context of the introduction of the Review Committee in Parliament as follows (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (5 October 2001) vol 73 col 2195–2196): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Prior to 1986, the Council could only refer to the Chairman of the Inquiry Panel those complaints relating to the conduct of a lawyer in his professional capacity. The Council therefore weeded out those complaints which did not relate to a lawyer’s professional conduct. In 1986, the Act was amended to allow any complaints relating to any conduct of a lawyer, not just conduct in his professional capacity. This was because, sometimes, misconduct by a lawyer, even in his private capacity, may be sufficient to render him unfit to continue being a member of the honourable profession. The Council thereafter acted on the assumption that they should continue to play a sifting role in the post-1986 regime. However, the Court of Appeal ruled earlier this year that the Council should not be performing such a sifting function, but should simply forward all complaints to be dealt with by the Inquiry Committees.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Sir, this is not practical and has resulted in some difficulties. The Law Society receives more than 100 complaints a year. More than half of them are without substance and are sifted out by the Council, while the remainder goes to an Inquiry Committee for a full inquiry. If the Council is not to sift, the caseload on the Inquiry Committees will more than double… doubling the caseload of the Inquiry Committees will create a serious strain on scarce resources and slow down the disciplinary process. Therefore a new machinery known as the Review Committee will be set up to act as a sifting mechanism. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 It is clear from the foregoing that the Council and the Inquiry Committee had, prior to the introduction of the Review Committee in 2001, performed concurrent sifting functions, and that the Review Committee was designed to take over the Council’s aspect of that function but not to pre-empt or affect the Inquiry Committee’s role or function which remains the same. In other words, if the Review Committee does not direct the Council to dismiss a complaint and consequently an Inquiry Committee is constituted, the Inquiry Committee still performs an informal sifting function. The difference is that the Review Committee is intended to direct the dismissal of a complaint where it is quite obvious that this should be done. Furthermore, even though s 85(7) of the LPA confers upon the Review Committee some investigative powers insofar as it may require the complainant or the lawyer concerned to answer any inquiry or to furnish any record that it considers relevant for its review, that does not mean that the Review Committee has the same role and function as the Inquiry Committee. As the then Minister for Law explained, the Review Committee is intended to serve as a first sieve <span class="font-italic">before an Inquiry </span><span class="font-italic">Committee is constituted</span> so as not to unduly tax the resources of the Law Society (see quotation above at [71]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In 2008, further amendments were introduced in the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill 2008 (No 16 of 2008) to streamline the disciplinary process, including the imposition of a time limit on the period the Review Committee has to review a complaint and make its recommendations. Similarly, however, nothing indicated a legislative intent to alter the relative and substantive roles of the Review Committee and the Inquiry Committee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Accordingly, the legislative amendments introducing the machinery of the Review Committee were not intended to and did not affect the role and function of, or the procedural requirements before, the Inquiry Committee. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Council of the Law Society</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 I now turn to the role and function of the Council, whose decision is the subject of challenge by the Applicant. Section 87(1) of the LPA provides for the decisions that the Council may come to upon consideration of the Inquiry Committee’s report: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Council’s consideration of report</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">87.—(1)  The Council shall consider the report of the Inquiry Committee and according to the circumstances of the case shall, within one month of the receipt of the report, determine —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) that a formal investigation is not necessary;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) that no cause of sufficient gravity exists for a formal investigation but that the regulated legal practitioner should be given a warning, reprimanded or ordered to pay a penalty under section 88;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) that there should be a formal investigation by a Disciplinary Tribunal; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) that the matter be referred back to the Inquiry Committee for reconsideration or a further report.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In relation to the Council, the issue that usually arises relates to its duty to furnish independent reasons for its decisions under s 87(1) of the LPA. Section 87(4) states that, if the Council determines that a formal investigation is unnecessary, the Council shall on request of the complainant furnish him with its “reasons in writing”. In <span class="font-italic">Yusuf </span><span class="font-italic">Jumabhoy v Law Society of Singapore </span>[1988] 1 SLR(R) 63, Chan Sek Keong JC (as he then was) explained the content of this duty to furnish reasons in the context of s 88(2) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 217, 1982 Reprint), which is <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia</span> with s 87(4) of the current LPA (at [15]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Under s 88(2) of the Act, the Council is under an obligation to give reasons for its decision. In this context, the expression “reasons” means the grounds of explanation for the decision of the Council. The reasons should be such as are readily comprehensible to the complainant so that he could decide whether he should invoke his right of appeal and, if there is such an appeal, to enable the court to review the decision. The Council must give reasons not only to inform but to explain; they must be full and sufficiently intelligible and deal with the substantial points at issue…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 At first blush, the position taken in <span class="font-italic">Yusuf </span><span class="font-italic">Jumabhoy </span>may appear inconsistent with the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Whitehouse Holdings</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Whitehouse Holdings Pte Ltd v Law Society of Singapore </span>[1993] 3 SLR(R) 484, the High Court held (at [5]) that there was no relevant determination by the Council when it merely accepted and adopted the Inquiry Committee’s report without stating its determination as to certain matters set out in s 87(1) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 1990 Rev Ed), which is <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia </span>with s 87(1) of the present LPA. The Court of Appeal disagreed and held that there is no strict need for the Council to supplement the reasons given in the Inquiry Committee’s report if it agrees with the Inquiry Committee’s findings and recommendation (<span class="font-italic">Whitehouse Holdings</span> at [28]; see also <span class="font-italic">Anthony Wee</span><span class="font-italic"> 2001</span> at [44]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… However, with respect to the learned judicial commissioner, we are unable to agree that the Council by merely accepting and adopting the report had not made a determination. <span class="font-italic">We cannot see any</span><span class="font-italic"> objection to this practice. The Council need not supplement the reasons given by the Inquiry Committee in its report, when the Council in effect is in agreement with and accepts the findings of the Inquiry Committee and makes a determination consistent with that in the report.</span> The Council had clearly determined that no formal investigation was necessary and that there was therefore no ambiguity at all. The precise words in ss 87(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to 87(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) need not be used as long as the meaning of the Council’s determination was clear…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 It should be noted that although <span class="font-italic">Whitehouse Holdings </span>was a decision of the Court of Appeal whereas <span class="font-italic">Yusuf </span><span class="font-italic">Jumabhoy </span>was that of the High Court, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Whitehouse Holdings </span>expressly prefaced its dictum above with a qualification that counsel for the Law Society had not addressed the Court on the point of the Council’s duty to furnish reasons (<span class="font-italic">Whitehouse Holdings </span>at [28]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In my view, the two cases are not irreconcilable. Since s 96(1) of the LPA permits one who is “dissatisfied with the determination<span class="font-italic"> of the </span><span class="font-italic">Council</span>” to apply to Court, <span class="font-italic">Yusuf </span><span class="font-italic">Jumabhoy </span>was correct to hold that the Council bears <span class="font-italic">in principle</span> a responsibility to provide reasons for its determination. Indeed, these reasons are necessary to allow the complainant to consider whether and how such an application under s 96 should be made, and for the Court to determine if the grounds of the application have been made out. However, <span class="font-italic">as a matter of </span><span class="font-italic">practice</span>, the Council may generally discharge its duty to give reasons by adopting the reasons given by the Inquiry Committee. That would be consistent with the Court of Appeal’s language in <span class="font-italic">Whitehouse Holdings</span>: “We cannot see any objection <span class="font-italic">to this practice</span>” [emphasis added] (at [28]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Court in a proceeding under s 96 of the LPA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In relation to the Court, its jurisdiction and power in the context of an application under s 96 of the LPA will be examined in turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Nature of jurisdiction </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Section 96 of the LPA does not expressly state the nature of the jurisdiction exercised by the High Court over the Council’s decision. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal has established that in such proceedings, the Court “sits in the exercise of [its] appellate and supervisory jurisdiction” (<span class="font-italic">Seet</span><span class="font-italic"> Melvin</span> at [7]; <span class="font-italic">Whitehouse Holdings</span> at [44]). The Court may therefore play two roles in examining the Council’s determination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 First, the Court may sit in exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction, which refers to the “inherent power of the superior courts to review the proceedings and decisions of inferior courts and tribunals or other public bodies discharging public functions” (<span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Chye Huey and another v Public Prosecutor</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 106 at [48]). In this regard, “the function of the High Court is to ensure that inferior tribunals stay with their allotted jurisdiction and observe the law. That is, the High Court looks only at the legality of the decision-making process rather than its merits; in applying the grounds of illegality, irrationality, and procedural impropriety, the court cannot substitute its own views for that of the decision-maker” (Thio Li-ann, <span class="font-italic">A </span><span class="font-italic">Treatise on Singapore Constitutional Law</span> (Academy Publishing, 2012) at para 10.045). In the context of s 96 applications, one of the primary concerns would be with the Inquiry Committee’s satisfaction of the requirements of natural justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Second, in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, the Court will examine the substantive merits of the Council’s and/or the Inquiry Committee’s decision. Nevertheless, in relation to the standard of review on appeal, Lai Siu Chiu JC (as she then was) clarified in <span class="font-italic">Wong Juan Swee v Law Society of Singapore</span> [1993] 1 SLR(R) 429 that the Court should be slow to disturb or interfere with the Council’s findings of fact (at [14]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The court here is exercising its appellate jurisdiction over the defendants as an administrative tribunal (see the decision of Chan Sek Keong JC (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Wee Soon Kim Anthony v Law Society of Singapore</span> [1988] 1 SLR(R) 455). Therefore, the court should be slow to disturb or interfere with the findings of fact by the Inquiry Committee unless it can be shown that supporting evidence was lacking or there was some misunderstanding of the evidence or there are other exceptional circumstances justifying the court to do so. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 As the ensuing analysis of the complaints against Mr Koh would show, the Court may generally be faced with one of three situations when exercising its appellate jurisdiction over the Council’s decision not to refer a complaint to a DT for formal investigation: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the Council was correct (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the evidence does not meet the <span class="font-italic">prima </span><span class="font-italic">facie </span>threshold and/or the test of gravity and thus formal investigation was not necessary), </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Council was in error (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the evidence evinced a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of ethical breach that was of sufficient gravity as to warrant formal investigation); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) it is not clear whether the Council was correct or in error (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, where inadequate investigation had been conducted by the Inquiry Committee such that there was insufficient evidence for a proper assessment of the case). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Where situations (a) and (b) are in play, the Court’s options are relatively clear: it would usually either grant or dismiss the application (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Whitehouse Holdings</span>). It bears noting that if the Court grants the application directing the Law Society to apply for the appointment of a DT, it should consider refraining from making determinative findings of fact that would bind the DT prematurely given the tentative state of the affairs at this stage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Situation (c) is more nuanced. It should first be noted that the Inquiry Committee’s role in examining a complaint, while informal, inquisitorial, and only demands assessment on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>basis, is nevertheless not without its checks and balances. As mentioned, the cases that stress the informality and inquisitorial nature of the Inquiry Committee mostly dealt with the procedural issue of natural justice, rather than the substantive issues that arise where the Court’s appellate jurisdiction is concerned (see above at [67]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 However, when it comes to the substantive role of the Inquiry Committee in investigating and evaluating complaints, I see some force in the sentiment expressed by Choo J in <span class="font-italic">Subbiah</span><span class="font-italic"> Pillai (HC) </span>that some rigour should be required (see above at [64]). While I appreciate that an Inquiry Committee may face some difficulties in determining the appropriate extent to which it should investigate a complaint, and that deference should be given to its determinations in light of the principle of peer judgment, adequate investigations must nevertheless be conducted. This is because the Inquiry Committee must, if it takes the view that formal investigation is warranted, know enough about the factual issues to recommend the charges to be preferred against the solicitor concerned. Even if the Inquiry Committee takes the position that formal investigation is not necessary, s 86(7) of the LPA empowers the Inquiry Committee to recommend alternative sanctions to be imposed on the lawyer concerned. Such a power conferred upon the Inquiry Committee suggests a legislative intent to impose at least some standard on the extent to which an Inquiry Committee would have to investigate into a complaint. Furthermore, the statutory regime also appears to contemplate adequate investigations being completed by the time the Council makes its decision based on the Inquiry Committee’s recommendations, in order that the complainant can have a meaningful right of review under s 96 of the LPA and the Court can effectively exercise its appellate jurisdiction over the Council’s decision. Parliament could not have intended that the rights and processes under s 96 be hollowed out by making the Council and the Inquiry Committee immune from criticism as to the adequacy of their investigation processes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 If there are any concerns that the Inquiry Committee’s process would become overly burdened, the threshold test of gravity would to my mind serve as an adequate safeguard in permitting the Inquiry Committee to take the complaints at face value and sieve out those relating to less egregious conduct which would, in any event, not warrant formal investigation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 For these reasons, despite the Court’s general reluctance to interfere with the decisions of the Council and the Inquiry Committee, it should nevertheless intervene where the investigation was not adequate and there is insufficient evidence on the record for an assessment of the complaint on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>standard.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Powers of the Court </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Having discussed the nature of the Court’s jurisdiction in an application under s 96, the next issue relates to the Court’s powers after hearing such an application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Section 96(4) of the LPA provides that the Judge – which refers to “a Judge of the High Court sitting in chambers” under s 2(1) of the LPA – may in hearing the application of the dissatisfied complainant (a) affirm the Council’s determination, or (b) direct the Law Society to apply to the Chief Justice for the appointment of a DT. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 However, the Court is not bound to make one of the two stipulated orders. As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Whitehouse Holdings</span>, s 96(4) states that “the judge may make an order” but does not use the word “shall”. Thus, this “implies that there is no mandatory obligation to make either of the two stipulated orders” in s 96(4) (<span class="font-italic">Whitehouse Holdings</span> at [33]). For instance, the Court would have the power to make no order at all in relation to a s 96 appeal, which may be necessary if the Court finds that the Council’s determination was wrong but yet cannot itself review the complaints as it does not have original jurisdiction and the complaints have theretofore not been considered by the Inquiry Committee (<span class="font-italic">Whitehouse Holdings</span> at [33]–[34]; <span class="font-italic">Anthony Wee 1988</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [16]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 In addition to the statutorily conferred powers, the Court also appears to have the power to make prerogative orders (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, mandatory, prohibiting, quashing or declaratory orders) which are remedies that are traditionally available in administrative law. This flows from the Court’s supervisory jurisdiction over the Council and the Inquiry Committee. However, since s 96 “was enacted as a specific appeal procedure for dissatisfied complainants [it] should be the procedure of first resort” (<span class="font-italic">Whitehouse Holdings</span> at [41]). As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Whitehouse Holdings</span>, in most situations the statutory apparatus of s 96 would suffice to meet the complainant’s objectives such that prerogative orders need not be resorted to (at [37] and [40]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">37 … A remedy in judicial review would, of course, be clearly appropriate where there was some form of procedural impropriety, bias or irrationality (see <span class="font-italic">Re Singh </span><span class="font-italic">Kalpanath</span> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 595). We do not disagree that <span class="font-italic">mandamus</span> is also available to the appellants but we would also think that the statutory apparatus under the LPA, namely, s 96 already encompasses this situation here.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">40 [Counsel for the complainant] also submitted before us that the appropriate remedy for a dissatisfied complainant was to proceed under s 96 and that there was no necessity to incur additional expense by resorting to other remedies. We agree. Prerogative orders are, of course, concurrently available here. However, its scope of application would also extend to areas outside the ambit of s 96 and s 97 (for complainants dissatisfied with a Disciplinary Committee’s decision).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Finally, it should be noted that because the LPA prescribes a statutory scheme of peer judgment, “a judge has no jurisdiction to inquire into any complaint which has not been inquired into by the Inquiry Committee or where the Council has not made a determination on the basis of such an inquiry” (<span class="font-italic">Anthony Wee 1988 </span>at [17]; <span class="font-italic">Whitehouse Holdings</span> at [21]). Accordingly, where a complaint has not been inquired into by the Inquiry Committee or was not the subject of the Council’s determination, “it is not open for the court, in an application under s 96(1), to grant an order under s 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) in respect of that complaint” (<span class="font-italic">Tan Yeow </span><span class="font-italic">Khoon</span> at [31]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Allegations against Mr Koh</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In the exercise of my appellate jurisdiction, I first examine the Applicant’s third, first, and fifth heads of complaints against Mr Koh, in accordance with the order in which the Applicant orally approached the issues before me (see above at [39]–[41]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Consent Order</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The Applicant’s submissions</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The Applicant’s first oral submission (see above at [39]) related to the Consent Order and contained two main aspects: (a) Mr Koh had acted contrary to his instructions in entering into the Consent Order,

He also took the view that the SOP was unnecessarily prolix and contained opinions. He advised the Applicant to seek closure on the divorce as soon as possible. He claimed to have “ended the meeting with the distinct impression that the Complainant did not disagree with my advice… that the pleadings would suffer striking out” on grounds stated above. He then studied the pleadings and “decided that the best course of action was to concede where I had to at the hearings and where there was an opportunity, to argue against the striking out of certain particulars”.

</div>
</div> Thus, the allegation of deliberate concealment was not made out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) The Court’s decision</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In my view, the IC was correct to find that Mr Koh had acted against the Applicant’s instructions in making concessions on the Co-Defendant’s application to strike out parts of the SOP that eventually led to the Consent Order. The Applicant’s e-mails made it unequivocally clear that, while he was receptive to Mr Koh’s contrary advice prior to the hearings, his instructions were to strenuously defend the vast majority of the particulars under challenge. It was not disputed that the Applicant’s e-mail to Mr Koh dated 14 July 2015 was the only correspondence containing specific instructions given by the Applicant to Mr Koh in relation to the striking out application (see above at [29]). Furthermore, as the IC noted, the Applicant’s reason for insisting on his version of the SOP was to portray the Defendant, who is his ex-wife, in a better light for the sake of their children. If Mr Koh’s professional opinion had been otherwise, it would have been imperative for him to offer his advice to the Applicant and not to unilaterally disregard the instructions, however correct he may have thought his views to be and whatever his overall litigation strategy may be (see above at [30(c)]). A lawyer is bound to carry out his client’s lawful, proper and reasonable instructions, and this proposition is now enshrined in r 5(2)(<span class="font-italic">i</span>) of the LPPCR 2015. If the lawyer believes that he cannot in good conscience carry out certain instructions, for example because they would cause him to commit or perpetrate an illegal or unethical act or because they are unreasonable, he may decline to act for the client.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 However, notwithstanding my agreement with the IC on this point, this head of complaint should still be directed for further investigation by the DT. There was at least a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case that Mr Koh’s failure to comply with the instructions was not inadvertent but deliberate. It may further be that Mr Koh then deliberately suppressed from the Applicant the fact that he had made concessions contrary to the Applicant’s instructions. In my view, the IC failed to give due weight to the following two factors in determining whether the complaint met the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> threshold warranting formal investigation: (a) Mr Koh’s silence after the hearing as regards the uninstructed concessions and their implications on the Applicant’s intended appeal against the Striking Out Order, and (b) Mr Koh’s attempts to dissuade the Applicant from appealing against the Striking Out Order and his delay in the filing of that appeal until the eleventh hour (see [20(d)] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 On the first point of silence, to my mind, the critical question is why Mr Koh had not, in any of his correspondence with the Applicant subsequent to the hearing, made any reference to the fact that part of the Striking Out Order had been made “by consent”, or advised that there might be difficulties appealing against a consent order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 These omissions must be assessed against two contextual observations. First, Mr Koh knew that the Applicant took a keen interest and hands-on approach in the Divorce Applications. He also knew that the Applicant had given very specific instructions regarding the striking out application. Indeed, the Applicant continued to make unequivocal protestations against the Striking Out Order after the hearing. Nevertheless, Mr Koh did not explain to the Applicant what had happened at the hearing and why that happened. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Second, and importantly, Mr Koh had seen fit to offer advice as to the lack of merits or the disadvantage of an appeal in at least two instances. In the first, he sent an e-mail dated 31 July 2015 to the Applicant stating: “No need to appeal striking out as this incurs costs”.

In any event I am not confident that you will succeed in the Appeal given that submissions and opinions and evidence are not allowed to stand as pleadings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 It was not the case, as Mr Koh claimed, that he did not advise the Applicant on the merits of an appeal against the Striking Out Order because the Applicant did not ask (see above at [30(b)]). Nor was it the case that Mr Koh had no opportunity to advise the Applicant because he had been “discharged by then” (see above at [30(a)]). Indeed, in total, Mr Koh offered three reasons why the appeal should not be filed: (a) costs, (b) redundancy given the amendments to the SOP, and (c) low chance of succeeding because opinions and evidence are not allowed to stand as pleadings. Yet, he did not raise the most obvious point and also the strongest point most likely to be taken in opposition on appeal: that a consent judgment or order is binding save in the most exceptional of circumstances. Even if the judge hearing the appeal did not eventually hold the Applicant to the consent previously given by Mr Koh, that would not justify Mr Koh’s omission to advise the Applicant on the viability of an appeal against a consent order. To my mind, if Mr Koh had indeed been forthcoming with the Applicant, this is the point that he should have highlighted to the Applicant at the first instance. At present, no reason has been offered for this silence which appears to be selective. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 In this regard, I cannot comprehend Mr Koh’s response to the IC’s query as to whether it was his duty as counsel to explain to the Applicant the effect of the consent, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “I exercised my discretion on what was a legal issue, so I don’t understand what was there to explain about”.

</div> In the absence of any minutes or records of what had been said during these conversations, this does not aid Mr Koh’s case.

</div> and that this draft was sent by Mr Koh’s paralegal to the Applicant by e-mail on 31 July 2015.

</div> However, it was not Mr Koh’s explanation that he had not informed the Applicant about the uninstructed concessions or the effect of such consent because he thought the Applicant had already read the draft order. Rather, Mr Koh’s explanation was that he did not give such advice because he saw no need to. Given this context, the time at which the Applicant came to know about the uninstructed concessions is immaterial <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the question of whether Mr Koh had intended to suppress that fact and its effect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 On the second point of delay and dissuasion in filing the appeal against the Striking Out Order, Mr Koh’s repeated attempts to dissuade an appeal against the Striking Out Order, and his delay in filing a Notice of Appeal against the same despite the Applicant’s repeated and unequivocal instructions to do so (see above at [20]) also raise a question about his true motivations. I accept that Mr Koh may have held strong views against the Applicant’s chosen course of action. However, that may not justify his conduct. Indeed, in respect of the Non-Disclosure Order, a Notice of Appeal was filed on 6 August 2015 on the Applicant’s instructions,

</div> There was clearly greater hesitancy in respect of the appeal against the Striking Out Order that could not be explained solely on the basis of a professional disagreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 In my view, Mr Koh’s apparently selective silence after the hearing on 27 July 2015 as to the uninstructed concessions and the effect of those on the viability of the Applicant’s appeal against the Striking Out Order, as well as his unusual attempts to dissuade the Applicant from appealing, were potentially indicative of an attempt to suppress these concessions from the Applicant and should be investigated further. The IC, by focusing on the consistency of certain e-mails sent by Mr Koh’s paralegal to the Applicant, failed to properly evaluate the evidence and overlooked the two contextual factors identified above (see above at [104]).

The IC accepted Mr Koh’s explanation that there were no prior settlement negotiations, but that Mr Koh had asked the Co-Defendant’s counsel prior to the recommencement of the hearing on 27 July 2015 whether they could agree on how to dispose of the matter.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mr Koh informed the Court that he had hoped that his client would agree with his proposed course of action. This was “not incorrect” because this was “an admission that he knew the [Applicant] had differed from his advice”. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) There was a “failure to answer the Court” when Mr Koh was asked about the latest instructions from his client, but that did not show that Mr Koh had misled the Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 It appears that the IC did not make any recommendation or comment in relation to the first untrue statement raised by the Applicant, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether Mr Koh had discussed the possibility of a settlement on the pleadings with the Co-Defendant’s counsel prior to the recommencement of the hearing before AR Tay. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) The Court’s decision</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 With respect, the IC appeared to have misunderstood some of the Applicant’s complaints and incorrectly accepted Mr Koh’s explanations even though they were unsubstantiated and did not address the concerns raised. I agree with the Applicant that some of Mr Koh’s statements to AR Tay in court appear to be inexplicable untruths. Taken together, the misstatements may evince a pattern of disregard for the truth that raises concerns about Mr Koh’s integrity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The starting premise of the analysis is that a lawyer owes a fundamental and paramount duty to be honest and truthful to the Court.

The provision of incomplete information may also in some circumstances amount to an ethical violation. In <span class="font-italic">Public Trustee v </span><span class="font-italic">By Products Traders Pte Ltd </span>[2005] 3 SLR(R) 449, VK Rajah J (as he then was) explained as follows (at [35]; see also <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Nor-ain </span><span class="font-italic">bte Abu Bakar </span>[2009] 1 SLR(R) 753 at [89]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">All solicitors <span class="font-italic">qua</span> officers of the court have an absolute and overriding duty first and foremost to the court to serve public interest by ensuring that there is proper and efficient administration of justice. They should never mislead the court either actively or passively. Nor should they consciously furnish to the court erroneous or incomplete information or for that matter incorrect advice that may subvert the true facts. This is a sacred duty which every court is entitled to expect every solicitor appearing before it to unfailingly discharge. So overwhelming is the public interest in maintaining the dignity and honour of the legal profession through the preservation of the highest ethical and moral standards amongst solicitors that the courts cannot risk allowing it to be compromised by even a few recalcitrant individuals within the profession. If and when any such breaches come to light, they must be dealt with swiftly and severely.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 On the facts, it appears that Mr Koh may have stated several untruths to the Court during the hearing on 27 July 2015. Of the four purported untruths raised by the Applicant (see above at [115]), at least three warranted further investigation and consideration by a DT.

However, there is reasonable ground to suspect that Mr Koh’s claim that he was unable to get his client’s confirmation was untrue. By Mr Koh’s own account, it appeared that the settlement negotiations occurred only at the doorstep of the courtroom on 27 July 2015. Yet, no evidence was shown of any attempt by Mr Koh to obtain instructions from the Applicant on the day of the hearing. Indeed, the Applicant in his affidavit averred that he had received no calls from Mr Koh on that day. Even if Mr Koh was referring to settlement negotiations before the date of the hearing, the Applicant still had not been informed of such negotiations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 In this regard, the IC did not address the point as to whether it was true that Mr Koh had been unable to get the Applicant’s instructions on the day of the hearing.

</div> The e-mail stated that the concessions were a “first cut” and that the Applicant would “defer to [Mr Koh’s] counsel on the final list”, but Mr Koh did not get back to the Applicant to propose any changes. The e-mail dated 14 July therefore stood as the latest and only set of instructions from the Applicant. Yet, Mr Koh unequivocally informed the Court that “everything” was being contested. This was plainly contrary to his instructions as they stood. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 Before the IC, Mr Koh did not appear to have provided any explanation as to why he had made the statement. The IC went on to characterise Mr Koh’s statement as a “failure to answer the Court” which did not show that Mr Koh had misled the Court.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Notes of Evidence at p 2. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In Mr Koh’s letter to the IC, he alluded to certain advice that he had provided to the Applicant. It is trite, however, that in the absence of credible contemporaneous records, the court may come to the view that an adverse inference should be drawn against the lawyer (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v </span><span class="font-italic">Leong Pek Gan</span> [2016] SGHC 165 at [48]). There is also a question of how the series of e-mails sent by the Applicant to Mr Koh prior to the hearing should be construed: they suggest that the Applicant did not have in mind any alternative proposal. But whether that was because none had been put forward by Mr Koh, or whether the Applicant had by then rejected Mr Koh’s proposal, is a matter that requires further investigation. On the evidence, the IC’s reading of Mr Koh’s statement to mean “an admission that he knew the [Applicant] had differed from his advice” appears to be too charitable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 For the foregoing reasons, there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of ethical breach that is of sufficient gravity to warrant a formal investigation and consideration by the DT in relation to the three untrue statements that I have mentioned. Accordingly, I allow the application in relation to part of the Applicant’s first head of complaint. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Two further points may be noted. First, while it may be that the occasional misstatement in Court could be explained away as a genuine slip of the tongue, miscommunication, anxiety, forgetfulness or otherwise, it is the series of “errors” here, seen together, that raises the spectre that these were not inadvertent slips by Mr Koh and that Mr Koh may have knowingly or recklessly misled the Court. Second, it bears noting that, if established, the untruths relating to the Applicant’s instructions are particularly worrying. A client’s positions and instructions for his lawyer are usually matters exclusively within the knowledge of the client and the lawyer; no one else would know or be able to verify these instructions, and all parties including the Court have to rely on the lawyer to communicate them. In the context, a lawyer who is not truthful about his instructions poses a serious threat to the profession and the public trust in the administration of justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 The Applicant pointed to other purported untruths in Mr Koh’s reply to the IC. Various allegations of perjury were therefore laid against Mr Koh.

</div> For instance, Mr Koh maintained that the Court’s direction for parties to file skeletal submissions had been given to the Applicant “before I had taken over the matter”. But the Applicant claimed that this was not correct. Indeed, based on the evidence before me, it was Mr Koh’s paralegal who had first informed the Applicant, carbon-copying Mr Koh, that the Court had directed the parties to file skeletal submissions.

It was difficult and time-consuming to ascertain what exactly the Applicant was alleging that Mr Koh had done wrong. In this regard, it appears that the Applicant has put forth these allegations in his letter of complaint:  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mr Koh was in a position of conflict because, according to what Mr Koh told the Applicant on 7 July 2015, Mr Koh had “an antecedent relationship” with the Co-Defendant as Mr Koh had given “general advice” to the Co-Defendant’s counsel, Nicholas Narayanan of Nicholas &amp; Tan Partnership. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mr Koh was in a position of conflict because Mr Koh might have been working in cahoots with one Jeffrey Ong of JLC Advisors LLP, who was solicitor for the Defendant.

He argued that an implied retainer had arisen between him and Mr Koh on 25 August 2014, when they first met, even though he had not at that time formally appointed Mr Koh to act for him. This was because they had, among other things, discussed the Divorce Suit in detail and he had given the particulars of the counterparties and their counsel to Mr Koh.

In this context, the Applicant’s affidavit and written submissions on the issue of conflict are distracting. It is the Applicant’s original letter of complaint that determines the scope of my present inquiry. This must logically be the case. The IC had sight of, and had the opportunity to consider, only the letter of complaint and not the other allegations contained in the subsequent affidavits and submissions in this application. The Council’s decision to adopt the Inquiry Committee’s recommendations was also based on what was before the Council. In such circumstances, since the Court is exercising its appellate jurisdiction, it should, in the usual course, limit itself to the allegations and evidence that were before the IC and the Council. This would be congruent with the principle of peer judgment and s 96 of the LPA under which the Court has no original jurisdiction to consider complaints (see above at [94]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 For this reason, I consider only the four main allegations that could be gleaned from the Applicant’s original letter of complaint, which are stated above at [138]. I examine these allegations in turn.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 The Applicant’s first allegation was that Mr Koh had “an antecedent relationship” with the Co-Defendant as Mr Koh had given “general advice” to the Co-Defendant’s counsel.

</div> there was presumably a conversation that took place between Mr Koh and the Co-Defendant’s counsel before July 2015 (which was when the warrant for Mr Koh to act for the Applicant was entered into), during which Mr Koh gave the Co-Defendant’s counsel “general advice”. Apparently, that conversation gave rise to an “antecedent relationship” between Mr Koh and the Co-Defendant which amounted to a conflict of interest when Mr Koh subsequently acted for the Applicant. It is not clear what precisely “general advice” and “antecedent relationship” meant and whether they related to the Divorce Suit. Furthermore, given the context of the paragraph in which this allegation was mentioned,

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> it appears that the Applicant’s main grievance was not with the fact that “general advice” had been given, but rather with the relationships that he claimed to have existed between Mr Koh, the Defendant’s solicitor, and Desmond Ong (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the managing partner of JLC Advisors LLP). The latter issue of relationships will be dealt with below (at [149]-[153]). In my view, the first allegation as it stood in the letter of complaint is simply too vague and unsubstantiated to ground a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of conflict of interest warranting further investigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 After the present application was filed in Court, the Applicant brought fresh evidence and made new allegations against Mr Koh. In particular, the Applicant argued that certain events occurring between August 2014 and July 2015 gave rise to various implied retainers between Mr Koh, the Applicant, and the Co-Defendant. The Applicant also gave evidence regarding a text message that he had sent to a third party dated 7 July 2015 which suggested that Mr Koh had in fact discussed the Divorce Suit with the Co-Defendant’s counsel sometime between August 2014 and July 2015. It is not clear if these new evidence and allegations relate to the purported “antecedent relationship” between Mr Koh and the Co-Defendant mentioned in the Applicant’s first allegation in his original letter of complaint. In any event, the evidence and allegations were not in the original letter of complaint. Therefore, they should not be considered by this Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction under s 96 of the LPA (see above at [145]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 The Applicant’s second allegation was that Mr Koh acted in cahoots with the Defendant’s solicitor. Apart from a general cloud of suspicion that the Applicant attempted to raise, the precise factual basis of this allegation is not clear. Based on what can be gleaned, the Applicant appears to rely on two points: (a) that Mr Koh and Desmond Ong had known each other “very well”, and (b) that Mr Koh and the Defendant’s solicitor may have been “in communication” with each other. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 In respect of point (a), this could not itself sustain a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>claim of conflict. Desmond Ong did not himself act for any of the parties in the Divorce Suit; he was merely the managing partner of the Defendant’s solicitor’s firm. Even if I were to examine the issue from the perspective of the law firm and not the lawyers personally, I am not aware of any authority which suggests that two law firms whose lawyers are well acquainted with each other cannot act for separate clients in respect of the same case. Indeed, such a sweeping rule is too broad and will potentially render in perpetual conflict the vast majority of lawyers and law firms in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 In respect of point (b), the mere potentiality of informal communication between Mr Koh and the Defendant’s solicitor cannot without more form the basis for a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>claim of conflict. Even assuming that these communications had occurred, there is no evidence that they relate to the Divorce Suit. Furthermore, by the time the Applicant signed the warrant for Mr Koh to act for him in August 2015, the Defendant had already withdrawn her defence to the Applicant’s Divorce Suit and neither she nor her solicitor participated in the Divorce Applications (see above at [4] and [8]).

</div> In the circumstances, nothing between Mr Koh and the Defendant’s solicitor warrants further investigation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 The third allegation raised by the Applicant in his letter of complaint was also based on Mr Koh’s allegedly improper relationship with the Defendant’s solicitor. The Applicant pointed to an email from Mr Koh to the Applicant dated 24 February 2016, in which Mr Koh expressed “regret that our relationship has deteriorated to this point even though I only came into the picture over the matter of an application for striking out by [the Defendant’s] solicitors.”

I do not consider that there is anything untoward that could be inferred from the mistake.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 In relation to the above analysis on the second and third allegations, I should add that the Applicant raised several other allegations in his letter of complaint, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the Defendant’s solicitor purportedly attending the Co-Defendant’s birthday drinks on 14 March 2014.

</div> It appears in certain parts of this letter that the Applicant’s grievances related more to the Defendant’s choice of solicitor <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, rather than on his complaint that Mr Koh had acted in conflict of interest in relation to the Applicant himself. It is apparent that even before the Applicant signed the warrant for Mr Koh to act for him, the Applicant had harboured suspicions as to the loyalties of the Defendant’s solicitor, whom the Applicant considered “not the best person to represent the Defendant as he is likely to continue to serve the best interests of the Co-Defendant first before the interests of the Defendant and her children.”

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In my view, none of these, whether taken alone or together, suffices to raise a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of conflict warranting formal investigation. First, the Applicant stated that Mr Koh had mismanaged the conflict issue by giving advice to two opposite parties in the same divorce suit. This appears to overlap with his first allegation, which I have considered above (at [147]-[148]). Second, the Applicant referred to clandestine communications between Mr Koh and the Co-Defendant’s counsel of which Mr Koh did not inform the Applicant even when he was asked to do so. The Applicant’s characterisation of the facts appears exaggerated. Mr Koh may not have kept the Applicant promptly updated on the case, and Mr Koh may perhaps have wanted to conceal the fact that uninstructed concessions had been made. Whether or not that may amount to misconduct which I have addressed above, it is not evidence of conflict. The Applicant’s third and fourth points were respectively that Mr Koh had made an untrue statement to AR Tay, and that Mr Koh had surreptitiously entered into the Consent Orders with the Co-Defendant. Again, the possibility that Mr Koh might have committed some other ethical breach does not mean that he must have done so because he was in a conflict of interest. Fifth, the Applicant alleged that Mr Koh had falsified the heading of the Consent Order. If the Applicant was referring to falsification of the Court Order itself, there is no evidence of that. If the Applicant was referring to inaccurate representations in certain e-mails sent by Mr Koh to the Applicant (see above at [19]), the Applicant has stretched the facts too far. Finally, the Applicant complained that Mr Koh had “knowingly contradicted” himself by appealing against the Consent Orders that he undertook. It should be recalled that the Notice of Appeal in respect of the Striking Out Order was filed pursuant to persistent and express instructions of the Applicant (see above at [20]). It is unfair for the Applicant now to turn around and claim that Mr Koh had contradicted himself. In any event, even if Mr Koh had contradicted himself by filing the appeal, that does not amount to a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of conflict. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 For the foregoing reasons, I agree with the Council’s determination in relation to the fifth head of the Applicant’s original complaint, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “acting in conflict of interest” (see above at [25(a)(v)]).

Therefore, even if the Applicant had legitimate grievances against the IC and the Council, he should have directed his mind to the kind of relief that he is seeking, and the nature of the arguments that he had to make to obtain that relief, in order to better focus and streamline his case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 Secondly, in response to the Applicant’s request for the identities and voting records of the Council members in relation to his case, the Law Society submitted that it was not obliged to disclose these as the information was protected under s 66(1) of the LPA by a cloak of confidentiality. If the Applicant wanted these documents, the Law Society’s position was that he is obliged to take a separate and formal application to request for them.

Indeed, arguably, such a case would not fall within the rationale of s 66, which appears to be for the protection of lawyers against the impact of frivolous complaints (Report of the Select Committee on the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill (Parl 7 of 1986, 16 October 1986) at pp B4 and B209; see generally, Palakrishnan and Malathi Das, “Winds of Change: Disciplinary Proceedings under the Legal Profession (Amendment) Act 1993” (1995) 7 SAcLJ 175 at 185; Tan Yock Lin, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Advocates and Solicitors in Singapore and West Malaysia</span> (Butterworths Asia, 2nd Ed, 1998) at p 850). Nevertheless, as this is no longer an issue in these proceedings, I need not say more. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 Thirdly and relatedly, while I have found on the facts that an inquiry into the issues of bias and apparent bias is not necessary, I would mention for the future that it would be prudent for members of the Council (and other relevant bodies) to be cautious with the manner in which they sit and decide on disciplinary matters. In particular, Council members should be alert to the question of conflict of interest when evaluating and making decisions in respect of complaints made against lawyers. Where several disciplinary cases are dealt with in a single sitting of the Council, the risk of Council members overlooking this question may be greater. In these situations, members should direct their minds at the earliest opportunity to the question of who should sit in relation to each of the cases and adapt the composition of their quorum accordingly. In the end, there should be measures to ensure the integrity of Council proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Post-script: Correspondences with Prof Pinsler </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 In the course of writing this decision, the Applicant sent a letter to the Registrar of the Supreme Court dated 29 August 2017 appending his e-mail correspondences with Professor Jeffrey Pinsler SC (“Professor Pinsler”) regarding (a) the ethical obligations of a lawyer in relation to consent orders and (b) the procedures that would apply if the court were to find in the Applicant’s favour. Mr Koh was not named in any of the correspondence with Professor Pinsler, and there was no indication that Professor Pinsler had known the identity of the lawyer concerned. Rather, the Applicant’s queries were expressly stated to be for “purely academic interest” and based on a “hypothetical scenario”. Nevertheless, the e-mail correspondences between the Applicant and Professor Pinsler between 25 July and 22 August 2017 were sent to the Supreme Court. In his cover letter, the Applicant stated that because the Law Society was “clearly conflicted to protect and assist [him] in [his] case”, he was “left with no choice but to turn to Professor Pinsler for his help because [the Applicant was] also aware that lawyers can write in to the Singapore Law Society to seek their opinion and guidance for matters of court”. Counsel for the Law Society was carbon-copied in the letter, but no response was received from him as of the date of release of this decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 In my view, this letter and the annexed correspondences are irrelevant, unnecessary, and improperly adduced. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 First, insofar as the Applicant is putting forth the contents of the letter and the correspondences as his submissions, these are far too late in the day and tendered without leave of Court or prior request for further arguments. The fact that the Applicant is a litigant-in-person does not absolve him of compliance with procedural rules. It will not serve the interests of fairness or finality if the court were to consider these submissions at this stage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 Secondly, Professor Pinsler’s views were clearly and expressly qualified by his cautious use of the terms such as “may”, “could apply”, “[i]n my personal view”, “on an informal basis”, and the explicit disclaimer “[<span class="font-underline">p</span>]<span class="font-underline">lease </span><span class="font-underline">don’t take this as legal advice</span>” [underline in original]. Indeed, Professor Pinsler, not being apprised of the facts of the case, could only have discussed the matter at a broad and theoretical level. In that context, there is no need to refer to the correspondences for general propositions that could be derived elsewhere. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 Third, and importantly, several of the possible ethical breaches discussed in the annexed correspondences are not properly the subject of the Applicant’s complaints before me. For instance, there is a reference to the lawyer’s liability for incompetence, but that appears to fall within the scope of the Applicant’s complaint under s 75B of the LPA, which will only be referred to the Council for deliberation upon completion of the inquiry into the Applicant’s complaints under s 85(1) of the LPA (see above at [26]).

In any event, by virtue of the LPA’s prescribed statutory scheme of peer judgment, this court has no jurisdiction to examine complaints which have not been inquired into by an Inquiry Committee or subject of a determination by the Council (see above at [94]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 For these reasons, I did not take into consideration the contents of this letter or the annexed correspondences between the Applicant and Professor Pinsler in coming to my decision. In fairness to Professor Pinsler, there is no indication that he had agreed to the Applicant tendering their correspondences to the Court in support of an ongoing disciplinary matter, or that he was even aware that the Applicant would do the same. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 The Applicant’s five prayers have been set out above (at [42]). For the foregoing reasons, I grant an order under s 96 of the LPA directing the Law Society to apply to the Chief Justice for the appointment of a DT to investigate and consider the following heads of complaint stated in the Applicant’s letter of complaint dated 12 May 2016 (see above at [25]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic">First head of complaint</span>: that Mr Koh had knowingly misled the Court and/or failed to discharge his duty to be honest and truthful to the Court by stating three untrue statements to AR Tay at the hearing on 27 July 2015 (see above at [125]–[136]); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-italic">Third head of complaint</span>: that Mr Koh had acted against the Applicant’s instructions by conceding to the Consent Order, and that Mr Koh had subsequently sought to deliberately suppress from the Applicant the fact that the Consent Order had been made and the effect of the concession on the viability of the Applicant’s appeal against the Striking Out Order (see above at [103]–[113]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 I dismiss the application in relation to the fifth head of complaint, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Mr Koh had placed himself in a position of conflict <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the Applicant, as stated in the Applicant’s letter of complaint dated 12 May 2016 (see above at [145]–[155]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 Pursuant to s 96(5) of the LPA, the Applicant is to have conduct of the proceedings before the DT and any subsequent proceedings before the Court under s 98 of the LPA. The proceedings are also to be brought under the Applicant’s name. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 It appears that upon my order under s 96(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the LPA directing the Law Society to apply to the Chief Justice for the appointment of a DT, the procedural rules and timelines prescribed by the Legal Profession (Disciplinary Tribunal) Rules (Cap 161, R 2, 2010 Rev Ed) will apply to both the Applicant and the Law Society. It may be that some of these rules would cause difficulties for the Applicant and may warrant a review at a later date. In respect of the present proceedings, if the Applicant decides to pursue all the matters stated above (at [170]) then he may find that he has stretched himself thin. However, it remains for the Applicant to decide to what extent he wishes to continue to pursue his complaints. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 For the avoidance of doubt, the DT is not bound by my assessment of the evidence here, and may consider any issue of fact <span class="font-italic">de novo </span>(see <span class="font-italic">Subbiah</span><span class="font-italic"> Pillai (CA) </span>at [46]). The heads of complaint summarised above (at [170]) may also be reframed as is appropriate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 In relation to the other prayers, I make no orders as to the Applicant’s request for this Court to request the Chief Justice to order the Law Society to make disclosure of how members of the IC and the Council had voted in relation to the complaint. It is not clear if s 66 of the LPA shields such information from disclosure on the grounds of confidentiality (see above at [161]–[162]). Even if it does not, it is doubtful that it is within the power of this Court to make such a request to the Chief Justice. In any event, such an order – which is needed only to buttress the Applicant’s allegations against the IC, the Council, and/or the Law Society – is no longer necessary in light of my orders in relation to the merits of the Applicant’s complaints against Mr Koh (see above at [170]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 In addition, the Applicant prayed for:

In the circumstances, I order the Law Society to pay the Applicant’s disbursements, the quantum of which is to be agreed or fixed by the Court.  </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Woo Bih Li <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The applicant in person;<br/>Prabhakaran Narayanan Nair (Derrick Wong &amp; Lim BC LLP) for the respondent.<br/></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
