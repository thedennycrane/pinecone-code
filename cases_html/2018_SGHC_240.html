Consequently, this led to various applications and appeals which I shall elaborate on below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The latest appeals were Registrar’s Appeal No 146 of 2018 (“RA 146/2018”) and Registrar’s Appeal No 147 of 2018 (“RA 147/2018”) filed by the plaintiff and defendant respectively.

However, in her notice of appeal (“CA 157/2018 NOA”), she asked for orders on matters that were outside the scope of the appeal in RA 146/2018 and hence, outside the scope of my decision in that appeal. Except for para 8(d) of DC Am3, the other parts of the pleading in DC Am3 mentioned in CA 157/2018 NOA were outside the scope of RA 146/2018. These were, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, paras 22(C)(a)(iii) and 28A.2, and all other parts of DC Am3 which refer to para 28A.2.

</div> On 2 June 2017, the plaintiff filed SOC Am1. On 29 June 2017, the defendant filed DC Am2. As there were typographical errors, the defendant’s counsel attended before the Duty Registrar on 11 July 2017 and the defendant was granted leave, by consent, from the court to amend DC Am2 to correct those errors. She accordingly filed DC Am3 on 12 July 2017. Following which, on 14 July 2017, the plaintiff filed Reply and Defence to Counterclaim (Amendment No 2) (“RDC Am2”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 On 28 September 2017, the plaintiff filed Summons No 4488 of 2017 (“SUM 4488/2017”) to strike out parts of the defendant’s pleading in DC Am2, which became DC Am3, on the basis that they did not arise from SOC Am1. On 27 October 2017, Assistant Registrar Yeo Rong Wei Justin (“AR Yeo”) allowed some of the amendments in DC Am3, and struck out those which were not consequential to SOC Am1. He made no order as to costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 On 8 November 2017, the plaintiff filed Registrar’s Appeal No 328 of 2017 (“RA 328/2017”) against that part of AR Yeo’s decision which refused to strike out some of the amendments in DC Am3 (see [18] below). One set of these amendments not struck out pertained to paras 22C(a)(i) to 22C(a)(iii) of DC Am3.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">SUM 5415/2017</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Thereafter on 24 November 2017, the defendant filed Summons No 5415 of 2017 (“SUM 5415/2017”) for leave to make amendments to DC Am3, pursuant to O 20 r 5(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed), to include the amendments which had been struck out by AR Yeo in SUM 4488/2017 (“the proposed amendments”). One of the proposed amendments pertained to para 8(d) of DC Am3. The defendant made the application in SUM 5415/2017 on the basis that the proposed amendments were relevant to the matters in the suit and were required to place the real issues before the court even though they were not consequential to SOC Am1.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 On 20 April 2018, the hearing of SUM 5415/2017 before Assistant Registrar Lee Yuxian Jay (“AR Lee”) was adjourned partly because the plaintiff was unwell. The hearing before him continued on 3 May 2018 and 7 May 2018. On 7 May 2018, because the proposed amendment to para 8(d) of DC Am3 was lacking in specificity, AR Lee gave the defendant an opportunity to reframe that proposed amendment for the plaintiff to know the case she had to meet. The matter was adjourned to 11 May 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 On 11 May 2018, the defendant’s counsel tendered to the court a reframed proposed amendment to para 8(d) (“the Disputed Amendment”), in a document titled “Appendix 1”. Thereafter, on the same day, AR Lee granted the defendant leave to make the proposed amendments to DC Am3 inclusive of the Disputed Amendment. AR Lee held that the plaintiff had not shown that the proposed amendments would prejudice her in a manner that could not be compensated by costs occasioned by the proposed amendments. AR Lee also found that the proposed amendments were intended to enable the court to decide the issues in dispute between the parties. He also noted that the plaintiff was free to plead any reliance on a time bar defence in respect of matters concerning the Disputed Amendment.

</div> (It is not necessary in the grounds of my decision to explain this category of loss claimed.) At the hearing for RA 328/2017, the defendant submitted that the plaintiff was then claiming in SOC Am1, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, for amounts allegedly due before July 2009.

</div>
</div> I was of the view that the inclusion of these paragraphs in DC Am3 was consequential to SOC Am1. The plaintiff did not appeal against any aspect of my decision in RA 328/2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Therefore, I did not grant the further orders that the plaintiff had sought from this court to strike out paras 22(C)(a)(iii) and 28A.2 of DC Am3 and all parts of the pleading relating to para 28A.2.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Disputed Amendment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I now turn to the Disputed Amendment, which has been set out at [22] above. The original proposed amendment to para 8(d) of DC Am3 (before it was reframed to the Disputed Amendment) had not been found to be consequential to SOC Am1 in SUM 4488/2017 (see [9] and [11] above). However, the defendant’s basis for filing SUM 5415/2017 for leave to amend para 8(d) was that the original proposed amendment/the Disputed Amendment was relevant to the matters in the suit and was required to place the real issues before the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The Disputed Amendment related to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) payments made to the plaintiff by the defendant from August 2008 to June 2009 which did not include “the Defendant’s portion of the 20% discounts given by the Plaintiff to her customers”; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the plaintiff’s acceptance of this method of computation for the payments when the defendant made payment to her by way of five cheques from 10 December 2008 to 15 June 2009.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The matters raised in the Disputed Amendment were similar to those already raised in paras 22C(a)(i) to 22C(a)(iii) of DC Am3 (as set out at [35] above). By way of summary, paras 22C(a)(i) to 22C(a)(iii) related to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the defendant’s non-liability for “any discounts given by the Plaintiff to her customers” during the period from August 2008 to June 2009 (see para 22C(a)(iii)); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the plaintiff’s acceptance of the defendant’s payments to the plaintiff by way of five cheques from 10 December 2008 to 15 June 2009 (see paras 22C(a)(i) and 22C(a)(iii)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I was satisfied that the Disputed Amendment served to clarify what was already pleaded in para 8(d). The Disputed Amendment was an insertion of around two sentences into para 8(d) itself, to clarify how the defendant made payments to the plaintiff from August 2008 to June 2009. I make no comment on the defendant’s argument that the Disputed Amendment also served to clarify the defendant’s pleading on the “Defendant’s portion of 20% discount for clients” at paras 22C(b)(iii) and 22C(b)(v)(2) of DC Am3 (see [24] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 For these reasons, the Disputed Amendment did not give rise to a new cause of action. Further, the defendant agreed to insert an additional sentence in DC Am3 to state that the allegations in para 8(d), which included the Disputed Amendment, were not to maintain her counterclaim against the plaintiff (see [25] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Order 20 rules 5(1), 5(2) and 5(5) of the Rules of Court state:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Amendment of writ or pleading with leave (O. 20, r. 5)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">5.</span>—(1) Subject to Order 15, Rules 6, 6A, 7 and 8 and this Rule, the Court may at any stage of the proceedings allow the plaintiff to amend his writ, or any party to amend his pleading, on such terms as to costs or otherwise as may be just and in such manner (if any) as it may direct.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Where an application to the Court for leave to make the amendment mentioned in paragraph (3), (4) or (5) is made after any relevant period of limitation current at the date of issue of the writ has expired, the Court may nevertheless grant such leave in the circumstances mentioned in that paragraph if it thinks it just to do so.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5) An amendment may be allowed under paragraph (2) notwithstanding that the effect of the amendment will be to add or substitute a new cause of action if the new cause of action arises out of the same facts or substantially the same facts as a cause of action in respect of which relief has already been claimed in the action by the party applying for leave to make the amendment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Since the effect of the Disputed Amendment was not to add or substitute a new cause of action, O 20 rr 5(2) and 5(5) did not apply.

However, the Disputed Amendment did not have the effect of adding or substituting a new cause of action (see [42] above). Further, the defendant agreed to insert an additional sentence in DC Am3 to state that the allegations in para 8(d), which included the Disputed Amendment, were not to maintain her counterclaim against the plaintiff. The Disputed Amendment was also not one to correct the name of a party or to alter the capacity in which a party sued. Therefore, pursuant to s 34(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and para (<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the Fourth Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, it appears that the plaintiff cannot bring an appeal to the Court of Appeal against my decision in RA 146/2018 to grant the defendant leave to make the Disputed Amendment to DC Am3.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In relation to paras 2, 3 and 4 and the other parts of para 6 of CA 157/2018 NOA (see [48] above), it appears that the plaintiff cannot bring an appeal on matters that were outside the scope of the appeal in RA 146/2018. Further, in relation to para 2 of CA 157/2018 NOA, the plaintiff did not previously appeal against my decision in RA 328/2017 which allowed the amendment to include para 22(C)(a)(iii) in DC Am3 (see [36] above). In relation to para 3 of CA 157/2018 NOA, the plaintiff had never filed any summons in this suit to strike out para 28A.2 and all other parts of DC Am3 which refer to it (see [29] above). Therefore, it appears that there is no basis for the plaintiff to request that paras 22(C)(a)(iii) and 28A.2 and all other parts of DC Am3 which refer to para 28A.2 be struck out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I will leave the parties to address the appropriate court on whether the plaintiff may appeal to the Court of Appeal in respect of the matters which are the subject of CA 157/2018.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Concluding remarks</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 One of the reasons for the multiple applications and appeals is that DC Am2 (and consequently DC Am3) included amendments which were not consequential to SOC Am1 (see [18] above). The defendant was not granted leave in RA 130/2017 to make such amendments and her solicitors should have known better than to attempt to slip in those amendments in the first place without agreement from the plaintiff. Notwithstanding this, if the non-consequential amendments would have been allowed if a formal application for leave had been made to include them, then the plaintiff should not have insisted that a formal application be made by the defendant as that would generate unnecessary costs all round. I note that the plaintiff’s previous solicitors had attempted to reach an agreement with the defendant’s solicitors on the basis that the plaintiff would not object to such amendments if the defendant paid a certain amount as costs to the plaintiff,
