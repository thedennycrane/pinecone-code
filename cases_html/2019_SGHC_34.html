After Ozaki confirmed that there was no such notice, Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP (“R&amp;T”) requested that PRP Law LLC withdraw from acting for the Company, by way of a letter dated 14 December 2018.

</div> In the case of <span class="font-italic">Lee Seng Eder v Wee Kim Chwee and others </span>[2014] 2 SLR 56, at [13], the leave application was dismissed solely on the ground that the applicant had failed to provide notice.

In this letter, Tan had sought Ozak’s and Ozaki’s agreement for PRP Law LLC to be appointed to represent the Company. Paragraph 4 of the 29 August 2018 Letter stated expressly that Tan would “apply to Court for an order authorising the legal representation of the Company” if Ozak’s and Ozaki’s consent was not forthcoming.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Tan’s Second Affidavit dated 21 January 2019 at p 70.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 I first observe that the 29 August 2018 Letter and all the other correspondence referred to by Tan’s counsel did not make, expressly or impliedly, any reference to the notice requirement in s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CA. Hence, this is a serious procedural defect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Be that as it may, I am prepared to accept that the 29 August 2018 Letter might constitute valid notice if it complies with s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CA in substance. However, it is clear that the 29 August 2018 Letter is substantively defective as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The 29 August 2018 Letter did not state that Tan intended to apply to court for leave to defend OS 1027/2018 in the name and on behalf of the Company, if the directors did not defend the action themselves. This is the fundamental message that must be conveyed to the directors (and specifically Ozaki), for the purpose of the notice requirement under s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CA. The substance of the notice is stated unambiguously in s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CA itself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Further, Tan did not provide the requisite 14 days’ notice under s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CA. Ozak was only given one day to respond to the 29 August 2018 Letter. In any event, if the 29 August 2018 Letter was to constitute a valid notice, it should have been addressed to Ozaki, who is the Company’s only other director.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Since Tan has failed to provide proper notice in accordance with s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CA, this alone is a sufficient ground for me to dismiss OS 100/2019. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Other requirements of s 216A(3) of the CA</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Good faith</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In any event, even if Tan had provided proper notice, I also found that Tan did not satisfy the other requirements under s 216A(3) of the CA for leave to be granted. Tan is not acting in good faith in OS 100/2019, as required under s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CA, as he now uses the Company to engage solicitors to essentially further support his case. This can be seen from Tan’s affidavit in support of this application. I also notice that OS 100/2019 was filed belatedly after Ozak took out SUM 187/2019. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic">Prima facie<span class="font-italic"> in the interests of the Company</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Further, it is also not <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> in the interests of the Company for OS 100/2019 to be granted. Tan asserts that the Company requires separate legal representation and that the Company will not diligently defend OS 1027/2018. However, Tan, having been joined to OS 1027/2018 as the second defendant, is already able to oppose Ozak’s leave application in his personal capacity as a director and shareholder of the Company, and has indeed done so. Tan has not satisfied the court that it is necessary also to grant him leave to defend OS 1027/2018 in the name and on behalf of the Company and in the process to appoint solicitors to represent the Company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Ozak drew my attention to the case of <span class="font-italic">Tam </span><span class="font-italic">Tak Chuen v Eden Aesthetics Pte Ltd and another (Khairul bin Abdul Rahman and another, non-parties) </span>[2010] 2 SLR 667 (“<span class="font-italic">Tam </span><span class="font-italic">Tak Chuen</span>”) at [8]. To be clear, <span class="font-italic">Tam </span><span class="font-italic">Tak Chuen </span>did not expressly consider the issue of whether a company must be legally represented in a leave application under s 216A of the CA. However, <span class="font-italic">Tam </span><span class="font-italic">Tak Chuen </span>is relevant given the factual similarities with this case. In <span class="font-italic">Tam </span><span class="font-italic">Tak Chuen</span>, Dr Tam Tak Chuen (“Dr Tam”) and Dr Khairul Bin Abdul Rahman (“Dr Khairul”) were equal shareholders and the only two directors of Eden Aesthetics Private Limited (“EA”) and Eden Healthcare Pte Ltd (“EH”). EA and EH were deadlocked. Dr Tam applied for leave to commence a derivative action against Dr Khairul for breach of his director’s duties. There were no allegations made against EA and EH, just as there are no allegations made against the Company in this case. In deciding the leave application, Judith Prakash J (as she then was) observed at [8] that “[i]n respect of this application, the nominal defendants, EA and EH, were not represented and took no part in this argument”. Like Tan, Dr Khairul had filed an affidavit to oppose the leave application initiated by the only other director (although for completeness, it should be noted that Dr Khairul appeared as a non-party, whereas Tan is joined as the second defendant in OS 1027/2018). The Company is in the exact same position as EA and EH were in <span class="font-italic">Tam </span><span class="font-italic">Tak Chuen</span>. Thus, there is no reason why it needs to be legally represented, when Tan is already resisting the leave application in his personal capacity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 On the above facts, Tan has failed to satisfy the requirements under s 216A(3) of the CA and I dismiss OS 100/2019.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">OS 1027/2018</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 OS 1027/2018 is Ozak’s application for leave to bring an action in the name and on behalf of the Company against Tan for breach of his director’s duties. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Notice under s 216A(3)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold">a</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">) of the CA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In OS 100/2019, which was Tan’s application under s 216A of the CA for leave to defend the Company and thereby appoint PRP Law LLC, Ozak argues that Tan had failed to comply with the requirements under s 216A(3) of the CA. Ozak had emphasised the need for strict compliance with the notice requirement under s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CA. This must apply with equal force in OS 1027/2018 and what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 For the notice requirement, Ozak has relied on R&amp;T’s letter of demand dated 27 June 2017.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Ozaki’s First Affidavit dated 6 August 2018 at p 55.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This letter of demand was from Ozak to the Company, Tan and Ozaki. It makes no reference to s 216A of the CA. It is a letter of demand that enumerated Tan’s acts of wrongdoing when he was an employee with the Company as well as when Tan was the Company’s director. Furthermore, the letter of demand also made an allegation against the Company for “dealing with” Ozak’s trade mark without its permission. This is a cause of action that belongs to Ozak, and not the Company. The action for infringement of trade mark against the Company cannot be the basis for an action under s 216A of the CA. Therefore, R&amp;T’s letter of demand contains matters other than those relevant to a derivative action on the Company’s behalf under s 216A of the CA. Thus, Ozak has not satisfied the requirements of s 216A of the CA and its notice is procedurally defective.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 As I have indicated in OS 100/2019, I am prepared to accept R&amp;T’s letter of demand as constituting a valid notice if it is in substance a notice that is in compliance with the spirit and purposes of s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CA. However, it is clear that R&amp;T’s letter of demand is substantively defective as well:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Nowhere in the letter of demand is it stated that Ozak intended to apply for leave to bring an action in the name and on behalf of the Company, if the directors did not bring the action themselves. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Furthermore, Ozak had not provided 14 days’ notice to the directors of the Company. R&amp;T’s letter of demand was dated 27 June 2017. The directors were only given until 4 July 2017 to respond. This is only 7 days’ notice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Accordingly, the said letter of demand fails to fulfil the notice requirement under s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CA. As with OS 100/2019, this ground alone is sufficient for me to dismiss OS 1027/2018. Nevertheless, I shall proceed to discuss the other two requirements.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Other requirements of s 216A(3) of the CA</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Good faith</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I shall begin with the good faith requirement under s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CA. Ozak bears the burden of satisfying the court that it is acting in good faith. There is no presumption that an applicant under s 216A of the CA is acting in good faith, even if the action is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> in the interests of the company. On the facts, I am not satisfied that Ozak is acting in good faith.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 First, Ozak has not provided a satisfactory explanation with regard to the delay in commencing these proceedings. Ozak alleges that Tan had breached his director’s duties. These alleged breaches arose out of the same facts which Ozak would have been aware of, at the latest, between December 2013, when Ozaki discovered the brochure in Kuala Lumpur, and 18 November 2014, when Ozaki confronted Tan with the “Acquisition Proposal”, also known as the “Correction Document”. OS 1027/2018 was only commenced on 20 August 2018. This is a delay of about four to five years and is a much longer delay compared to Tan’s delay in filing OS 100/2019. Tan’s delay in commencing OS 100/2019, as pointed out by Ozak, was around half a year.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Second, even though Ozak claims to have discovered the alleged wrongful acts of conflict of interest between December 2013 and 18 November 2014, it still agreed to appoint Tan as a director on 31 December 2014. If Ozak was genuinely concerned by Tan’s wrongful acts of conflict of interest, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Tan’s involvement in Shafttech, a business competitor of the Company, then it should have acted expediently to correct or remedy the situation and should not have waited until 2018. At the very least, it should not have allowed Tan to be appointed as a director of the Company, especially when Ozak had allegedly caused the Company to suffer significant losses of over $2.7m. Further, shortly after Tan was appointed as a director, Ozak then decided in or around January 2015 to unilaterally appoint WM Automation as a distributor of Ozak’s products. As a result, the Company, for all intents and purposes, became a dormant company since February 2015. The motivations of Ozak in commencing these proceedings are, therefore, questionable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Third, Ozak first claimed to only have knowledge of Tan’s beneficial interest in Shafttech in November 2014. Later, when confronted with objective evidence, it then changed its position by stating that it had discovered this information through a Shafttech brochure in Malaysia in December 2013.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Ozak’s Skeletal Submissions for OS 1027/2018 at para 76.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This change in position regarding this crucial fact occurred after Ozak was presented with documentary evidence which contradicted its initial position. This indicates the lack of candour on the part of Ozak.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic">Prima facie<span class="font-italic"> in the interests of the C</span><span class="font-italic">ompany</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The final requirement under s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the CA is that the application must appear to be <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> in the interests of the Company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 OS 1027/2018 is focused only on Tan’s breach of his director’s duties and not Tan’s wrongdoing as an employee of the Company. Therefore, even if Tan had caused the Company to suffer losses from 2002 to 2014, these losses cannot be recovered through this action as Tan was only an employee then. The court is only able to deal with the matters raised in the prayers in OS 1027/2018. The prayers do not refer to a breach of an employee’s duties and in fact expressly refer only to Tan’s breach of his director’s duties. This is clearly stated in Appendix 1 of OS 1027/2018. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Furthermore, I am not satisfied that it is in the practical and commercial interests of the Company to pursue this action, as borne out by the timeline of events.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 It must be emphasised that Ozak knew about the alleged wrongful acts between December 2013 and 18 November 2014, at the latest. If Ozak had sought leave to bring an action against Tan at that time for breach of a senior<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>employee’s fiduciary duties, it would have had a much stronger case that the action was <span class="font-italic">prima</span><span class="font-italic"> facie</span> in the interests of the Company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 However, notwithstanding this knowledge, Tan was appointed a director on 31 December 2014. In or around January 2015, Ozak appointed WM Automation as a distributor of Ozak’s products in Singapore, thereby replacing the Company. In February 2015, the Company became dormant and inactive very shortly thereafter. In the circumstances, it is difficult to identify precisely what losses, if any, have been caused to the Company, after Tan became the director of the Company which soon became dormant. This period is very short and thus the purported losses sustained, if any, would not be large. Even if there had been losses suffered by the Company because of Tan’s failure to disclose his alleged wrongful acts, I emphasise again that Ozak had full knowledge of the breaches that would give rise to these losses and chose not to pursue an action when it had the opportunity to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Finally, the relationship between Ozaki and Tan is acrimonious. This has resulted in the Company becoming dormant and there is no viable prospect of the two parties working together again. Both Ozaki and Tan are using the Company to advance their personal objectives and on the pretext that what they are doing is for the best interests of the Company. Hence, I am not satisfied that it is in the best interests of the Company to be embroiled in costly and drawn-out litigation, which will only serve to vindicate one side’s position against the other. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 On the above facts, Ozak has failed to satisfy all three requirements under s 216A(3) of the CA. OS 1027/2018 is thereby dismissed. I shall now hear the parties on costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Siong Thye J<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Yuen Djia Chiang Jonathan and Francis Chan Wei Wen <br/>(Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the plaintiff in OS 1027/2018 <br/>and SUM 187/2019 and for the first respondent in OS 100/2019;<br/>Pillai Pradeep G and Lin Shuling Joycelyn (PRP Law LLC) for the first defendant in OS 1027/2018 and SUM 187/2019 and for <br/>the second respondent in OS 100/2019;<br/>Nair Suresh Sukumaran, Tan Tse Hsien, Bryan (Chen Shixian) <br/>and Bhatt Chantik Jayesh (Nair &amp; Co LLC) for the <br/>second defendant in OS 1027/2018 and SUM 187/2019 <br/>and for the applicant in OS 100/2019.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
