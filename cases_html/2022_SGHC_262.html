On their part, all the victims gave consistent evidence that they had performed fellatio on the accused. The accused himself confessed to this in his three statements, which were partly corroborated by what he had told Dr Yeo. I found that there was clear and credible evidence that established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had penetrated the victims’ mouths with his penis. My reasons are set out below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The victims’ accounts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Each of the victims was able to provide a textured, coherent and internally consistent account of the material events that had occurred between them and the accused. Fundamentally, the victims’ accounts were also externally consistent and mutually corroborative. No doubt there were some inconsistencies in their narration of certain details, but I found that these were inconsequential as they related to minor or peripheral aspects. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The accused did not dispute the sequence in which the respective victims went to meet him at the top of the slide at the playground. The victims also gave consistent evidence in this regard. [V3] was the first to see the accused, but when asked by the accused whether he would choose to suck the accused’s penis or to walk away, he could not decide which course to take. The accused threatened that “tables and chairs would fly” the next time he saw the victims at the coffeeshop if the matter was not settled. As [V3] remained undecided, the accused told him to call [V2] to see him (at [16]–[17] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 [V2] was similarly given two “options” of settling the problem, to either follow the accused’s “way” or to walk away. If he chose the latter, the accused would give him “problems … in public”. [V2] recalled that the accused had uttered the “<span class="font-italic">takde</span><span class="font-italic"> kau hisap</span> …” phrase to him. [V2] was told to suck the accused’s penis and although he felt disgusted, he did so for two to three seconds. He gave clear evidence that the accused’s penis penetrated his mouth (at [18]–[20] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 [V1] was next to be summoned to see the accused, and he was told by the accused in an angry tone that if he wanted to “settle the problem”, he would have to suck the accused’s penis. [V1] proceeded to suck the accused’s penis. He covered the accused’s penis with his mouth for a few seconds until the accused told him to stop (at [21]–[22] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Finally, when [V3] was asked to see the accused the second time, the accused again used the “<span class="font-italic">takde</span><span class="font-italic"> kau hisap</span> …” phrase, asking him whether he wanted to “settle” the problem. [V3] agreed to do so and he was also clear in his testimony that the accused’s penis penetrated his mouth (at [24]–[25] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In terms of external consistency, the evidence of the victims that the accused had penetrated their mouths with his penis bore important common threads. There were no material gaps or discrepancies. Their evidence was consistent when measured against the accused’s statements. He acknowledged using the “<span class="font-italic">takde</span><span class="font-italic"> kau hisap</span> …” phrase, unzipping his pants and exposing his penis to the victims.

There was even less of a need for him to call on them repeatedly to suck his penis.

Mr [AB] and Mr [CD]’s careful enquiries and sensitive handling of the issue were instrumental in ensuring that the sexual acts were ultimately disclosed.

[V2] and [V3] had apparently not intended to surface the matter but instead intended to keep it to themselves.

It was also not a defence for the accused in the present case to maintain that the victims did not actually engage in any “sucking” of his penis, but had merely “covered” his penis with their mouths.

I saw no basis whatsoever for his criticisms of Dr Yeo. The IMH report was objective and was based on Dr Yeo’s contemporaneous notes of his interviews with the accused, where he had been assisted by a Malay interpreter. There was no conceivable reason for Dr Yeo to have lied to implicate the accused, to have conducted himself improperly or to have been anything less than objective and impartial in his assessment of the accused.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the acts of penetration were for the accused’s sexual gratification</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I shall briefly address this issue for completeness, since the accused’s position appeared to be that even if he had penetrated the victims’ mouths with his penis, he did not and could not have derived any sexual gratification from doing so. The Prosecution’s case was pitched somewhat differently in any case. The Prosecution submitted that the accused had been angry due to the victims’ alleged circulation of the rumour, and had been motivated by revenge to commit the offences.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> It was not the Prosecution’s case that the accused had done so for the sake of sexual gratification.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Notably, this argument appeared to find some support in [V2]’s indication that the accused was not actually asking for oral sex when he said the “<span class="font-italic">takde</span><span class="font-italic"> kau hisap</span> …” phrase, but was “pissed off” (see [18] above). From this, it could be seen that [V2]’s perception was that the accused was not seeking sexual gratification but was displaying his irascibility over the victims having allegedly spread rumours about him and [M2]. I accepted that this was a fair and reasonable characterisation of the accused’s animus. He was seeking primarily to vent his anger and to chastise the victims for their impertinence. It was consistent with the undisputed fact that each incident of sexual penetration was brief, lasting only a few seconds at most. In addition, the accused’s penis was not erect and he did not ejaculate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Nevertheless, in my view, an offender’s motive in committing the offence under s 376(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code is irrelevant. Specifically, obtaining sexual gratification is plainly not an element of the offence. Lust or libido are not ingredients of the offence. An offender may commit the offence for one or more reasons which are best known only to himself, whether for sexual gratification, as a perverse display of ego-boosting bravado, or to intimidate, humiliate, degrade and/or assert authority over his victim(s). There may well be other possible reasons. Whatever the accused’s actual motivation(s) might have been in the present case, this had no bearing on the material elements of the offence. The offence was still a sexual offence once the requisite elements of the offence had been proved. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 To reiterate, the crucial elements to be proved beyond reasonable doubt were that there were acts of penetration, and that the victims had not consented to the acts. I have explained above why I found that the accused had penetrated the victims’ mouths with his penis. In connection with the latter requirement, it also had to be shown that the victims did not consent to the sexual acts in the circumstances of the case and that the accused had known or had reason to believe that the victims had engaged in the acts out of fear of injury.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the victims consented to the sexual acts with the accused</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 A key plank of the defence was that the victims had been given a choice as to whether to fellate the accused. Further, the accused claimed to be surprised that the victims had taken the “<span class="font-italic">takde</span><span class="font-italic"> kau hisap</span> …” phrase, which he claimed was a “slang”, literally and had agreed to suck his penis. The victims, however, all testified that they had been fearful that the accused would cause injury to them or their families and had only acquiesced to his demands to fellate him as a result (see [16], [19], [21] and [24] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 It was crucial to appreciate the full context in which the victims had agreed to “settle” the problem with the accused by sucking his penis. The uncontroverted evidence was that the accused was angry that the victims had purportedly spread rumours about him making [M2] suck his penis and were avoiding him. He wanted to know who had been responsible for the rumours. He confronted the victims and spared no effort to demonstrate his capacity to carry out his threats of violence; in fact, he had no qualms resorting to various displays of violence on the victims to strike fear in them and punish them, such as by kicking or slapping them. In my assessment, the victims had no reason to doubt that the accused was serious about his threats of violence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Beginning with the accused’s conversation over the phone with [V1] at around midnight on 17 October 2018, the accused had systematically threatened and browbeaten the victims. [V1] was the first to meet the accused at the fitness corner near the hut, after he was told that the accused would “<span class="font-italic">potong</span>” him if he did not meet him immediately (see [7] above). [V1] was then assaulted and recalled feeling pain from the accused having squeezed his jawline and slapped him (see [8] above). [V1] felt “very scared” at that time and shouted for the accused to stop.

</div> The accused confronted the victims over the rumour and brought up his past involvement in gang fights, while threatening to go to their homes, causing them to fear that he would harass their families. The victims all testified that they were fearful of the accused as he behaved violently and aggressively. They also believed that the accused was capable of carrying out the violent acts he threatened, as the accused had previously told them about his involvement in a gang.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The victims were subsequently told to meet the accused one-on-one at the top of the slide at the playground. None of them dared to decline. Eventually, each of the victims was presented with the accused’s ultimatum: either to “settle” the problem with him by sucking his penis, or walk away (and be prepared for the consequences). The accused attempted to characterise this as a choice that he gave the victims. In the circumstances, I found that the obvious truth of the matter was that the accused had presented them with a Hobson’s choice. The victims complied by accepting the ignominious “option” of sucking the accused’s penis. To them, this was the lesser of two evils. What was manifestly clear was that they had only complied out of fear after they had been threatened and assaulted by the accused. They were also in fear of further harm or harassment that the accused might inflict on them or their families if they chose to walk away instead. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Plainly, the victims did not consent, but did so, in [V3]’s words, “for the sake of settling” the conflict.

</div> It was very clear that these were not empty threats or mere idle talk. The accused used actual violence on the victims to demonstrate that he meant what he said and was fully capable of carrying out his threats.

</div> The victims knew he had friends in the neighbourhood as well. It did not matter whether the accused’s purported “gangster past” and gang exploits were fictional, embellished or factual. As far as the victims were concerned, there was no reason to disbelieve the accused’s accounts. At the time of the incident, the victims were teenagers, and were young and impressionable. They were suitably impressed by the fact that the accused had managed to assist in extricating [V2] and [V3] from their gang involvement by apparently negotiating successfully with their headman (see [5] above). The accused had also deliberately referred again to his past involvement in gang fights when confronting the victims (see [13] above). This was intended to instil fear in them and ensure their obeisance and submission. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 I found that the accused had bullied and cowed the victims into submission. There was no room in the circumstances for the accused to claim that he might have mistakenly believed that the victims had chosen, let alone acted of their own free will, to fellate him. He could not rely in good faith on the statutory defence of mistake provided in s 79 of the Penal Code.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Credibility of the accused and impeachment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I have set out my reasons above for rejecting the two key planks of the accused’s defence, namely, that the victims did not in fact fellate him as he had pushed them away before any contact was made with his penis, and that the victims had consented to performing the act of fellatio. I turn next to elaborate on a critical aspect of the accused’s evidence which I found to be materially inconsistent and demonstrative of why he was not a credible witness. As a result, I found that his credit had been impeached.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 During the trial, the accused did not deny having unzipped his pants and exposing his penis to the victims. He also did not deny telling them to “settle” the problem or uttering the “<span class="font-italic">takde</span><span class="font-italic"> kau hisap </span>…” phrase specifically to [V2] and [V3]. However, he claimed that he had managed to push all the victims away in time before their mouths could make contact with his penis. I rejected this defence as it was completely at odds with three previous accounts he had given before the trial. I summarise the relevant accounts below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 First, in the accused’s statements which were recorded from 30 to 31 October 2018, he admitted that all three victims had put their mouths onto his penis (at [70] above).

</div> As I have explained at [82]–[83] above, obtaining sexual gratification was not an element of the offence. The key element of the offence was that the accused intended<span class="font-italic"> </span>to penetrate the victims’ mouths with his penis, regardless of whether his penis was erect. Despite the accused’s apparent misunderstanding of the word “penetration”, the accused had clearly offered inconsistent evidence of whether there was oral contact made with his penis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 I have also elaborated (at [76] above) that I found the accused’s claim of having been under severe mental stress at the time of his statement-recording, because of persistent harassment from unlicensed moneylenders, to be an afterthought. In addition, the accused liberally levelled accusations against the victims of colluding to falsely implicate him. I found these accusations to be wholly unsubstantiated. The accused went even further to make a sweeping allegation that other Prosecution witnesses such as SI Nithiya, IO Regina, Ms Maria, Dr Yeo, Mr [AB] and Mr [CD] had all somehow chosen to believe the victims’ claims wholesale and to roundly reject his claims of innocence in a concerted effort to malign him. All these allegations were patently baseless and vexatious. They reinforced my view that the accused was not a credible witness. He did not raise any reasonable doubt in his defence. As such, I found him guilty of all three charges and convicted him accordingly. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision on sentencing</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 I now turn to the issue of sentencing. Apart from the first, second and third charges for which the accused was convicted after trial, the accused pleaded guilty to a sixth charge in relation to [M1] for the offence of sexual penetration of a minor under 16 years of age under s 376A(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), punishable under s 376A(2) of the Penal Code. There were also five other charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. Two of the charges that were taken into consideration related to a fifth victim, [M2].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">First, second and third charges </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 In relation to the first, second and third charges, I found that there were three offence-specific aggravating factors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 First, the accused was in a position of trust and authority over the victims. The victims looked up to him as a “big brother” and respected him. Second, the victims were teenagers who were between 16 and 17 years old at the time of the offences. They were young, impressionable and vulnerable. Third, the accused verbally intimidated the victims and inflicted physical violence on them, which resulted in the victims agreeing to fellate him out of fear of injury to themselves or their families. This began with his text messages to the victims in the early morning of 17 October 2018 threatening injury to the victims and their families and continued with the actual violence that he inflicted on the victims by kicking, slapping and/or pulling their hair shortly before the offences took place. The victims also testified that they only acquiesced to his demands to fellate him due to fear of injury to themselves or their families.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The sentencing framework for sexual assault by penetration under s 376 of the Penal Code was established by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span>. Though <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>was a case concerning digital-vaginal penetration, in the subsequent case of <span class="font-italic">BPH v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2019] 2 SLR 764 (“<span class="font-italic">BPH</span>”) at [55], the Court of Appeal clarified that the sentencing framework was applicable to all forms of sexual assault by penetration under s 376 of the Penal Code. The framework requires the court to consider the offence-specific aggravating factors to identify the appropriate sentencing band in which the offence should fall (<span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>at [159]). The sentencing bands are as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-underline">Band 1</span> (cases with no or limited offence-specific aggravating factors): seven to ten years’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-underline">Band 2</span> (cases that involve two or more offence-specific aggravating factors): ten to 15 years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-underline">Band 3</span> (the most serious cases by reason of the number and intensity of aggravating factors): 15 to 20 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 As I identified three offence-specific aggravating factors (see [110] above), the first, second and third charges minimally fell within the lower end of Band 2 of the sentencing framework set out in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>(at [122]). Having considered the various offence-specific factors, I found that the indicative starting point for the sentence for each of the first to third charges should be an imprisonment term of ten years. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 In relation to offender-specific factors, I found that the conduct of the accused at trial was an aggravating factor that warranted a further uplift from the indicative starting point. At trial, the accused made sweeping personal attacks on the character and credibility of the victims and several of the Prosecution witnesses, alleging that they had colluded to falsely implicate him. These spurious claims were wholly without merit, indicating an absence of remorse on the accused’s part. Even after conviction, the accused’s mitigation plea, in which he reiterated that the “penetration did not happen and [could] never [have occurred] with unerected [sic] penis”,

</div> In my view, these were in no way mitigating. First, although the accused only had unrelated antecedents for drug offences, he could not be said to be a first-time offender, considering that he had several other charges for related sexual offences committed over the span of 2017 and 2018 that were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. Second, while the accused may have been the sole breadwinner and the main caretaker of his elderly mother, it is trite that the impact on livelihood and hardship to the family caused by the imposition of a sentence should be given little weight unless there are exceptional circumstances (<span class="font-italic">CCG v Public Prosecutor</span> [2022] SGCA 19 at [6]; <span class="font-italic">Lai </span><span class="font-italic">Oei Mui Jenny v Public Prosecutor </span>[1993] 2 SLR(R) 406 at [11]). In the present case, there were no exceptional or extreme circumstances to justify affording leniency for any hardship caused to his family. Lastly, the accused had cast baseless aspersions on the victims and Prosecution witnesses, showing that he had no genuine remorse for his actions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 The present factual matrix was relatively atypical of an offence of sexual assault by penetration. The accused was not seeking sexual gratification; the duration of each offending act lasted mere seconds and his penis was not erect. I noted above at [82] that the accused’s motive in committing the offence was irrelevant for the purpose of establishing the elements of the offence. To be clear, the accused’s motive was also irrelevant for the purpose of sentencing. Even if the accused did not commit the offences for sexual gratification, this was in no way mitigating. As considered by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BPH </span>at [60], there is “no unanimity of views” as to whether one form of sexual penetration is more serious or detestable than another, bearing in mind that “some permutations of the offence may not even be for sexual gratification but could be motivated by a thirst for sadistic humiliation and pain”<span class="font-italic">. </span>The accused’s desire to humiliate the victims in the circumstances was thus at least as reprehensible as a desire to obtain sexual gratification, and had no mitigating effect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 I was conscious, however, that for the first to third charges, each instance of sexual assault by penetration was brief, lasting mere seconds. I was also not persuaded that the evidence clearly demonstrated that the offences were premeditated. All considered, I applied an uplift of six months’ imprisonment for each of the sentences for the first to third charges.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sixth charge </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The accused pleaded guilty to a sixth charge in relation to [M1], who was a minor (15 years old) at the time of the offence. Given that the accused had befriended [M1] in a manner similar to how he came to befriend the other victims, I found that there was also an element of abuse of trust. The starting point was therefore a term of imprisonment of three years (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v BAB </span>[2017] 1 SLR 292 at [65(a)]). Considering that there were five other charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing, and that the period of offending spanned several months, I found that an uplift of six months’ imprisonment was justified.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The global sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Section 307(1) of the CPC provides that where a person is sentenced to imprisonment for at least three distinct offences, the court must order the sentences for at least two offences to run consecutively. As such, I ordered two of the sentences for the offences for which he was convicted after trial, namely the first and second charges, to run consecutively. I agreed with the Prosecution that the sentence for the sixth charge should also run consecutively. The sixth charge (in relation to [M1] in a separate incident) concerned different legally protected interests and therefore should also run consecutively (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Raveen Balakrishnan </span>[2018] 5 SLR 799 (“<span class="font-italic">Raveen</span>”) at [44]). If I were to impose a concurrent sentence for the sixth charge, this would result in the accused not having to bear any real consequence from his further offending (see <span class="font-italic">Raveen</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [46]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 I pause to note that ordering more than two sentences to run consecutively is only done in “exceptional cases”, such as where the accused is shown to be a “persistent or habitual offender” (see <span class="font-italic">Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor </span>[2014] 2 SLR 998 (“<span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span>”) at [81(j)]). The present case involved numerous offences with a total of five young and impressionable victims. The offences were committed over a one-year period. I thus agreed with the Prosecution that the three sentences ought to run consecutively to reflect the accused’s overall criminality.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Adopting the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> framework, the indicative sentences for the first to third charges would also include eight strokes of the cane per charge, resulting in a total of 24 strokes. As the accused was above the age of 50 years, as per s 325 of the CPC, no caning could be imposed on him. I was therefore of the view that an additional imprisonment term of 12 months was necessary to compensate for the deterrent effect of caning that was lost (see <span class="font-italic">Amin </span><span class="font-italic">bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 5 SLR 904 at [59] and [90]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 I further considered whether the cumulative sentence was proportionate to the overall criminality of the offences having regard to the totality principle (see <span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span> at [58]–[59]). Before any moderation, the indicative global sentence would have been 25 years and 6 months’ imprisonment, which is a very substantial sentence that arises on account of three sentences running consecutively, including an additional 12 months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning. In my view, this was a disproportionate and crushing aggregate sentence which would offend the totality principle. Hence, I moderated the sentences in the first to third charges to ten years’ imprisonment per charge, and the sentence in the sixth charge to three years’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 For the above reasons, I sentenced the accused as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First charge of sexual assault by penetration under s 376(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) punishable under s 376(3) of the Penal Code – ten years’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second charge of sexual assault by penetration under s 376(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) punishable under s 376(3) of the Penal Code – ten years’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third charge of sexual assault by penetration under s 376(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) punishable under s 376(3) of the Penal Code – ten years’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Sixth charge of sexual penetration of a minor under 16 years of age under s 376A(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) punishable under s 376A(2) of the Penal Code – three years’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) An additional imprisonment term of 12 months in lieu of 24 strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 I ordered the sentences for the first, second and sixth charges to run consecutively.
