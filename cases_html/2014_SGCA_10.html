<p class="Judg-Author">
        Andrew Ang J (delivering the judgment
of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This
is an appeal under s 81(5) of the Income Tax Act (Cap 134, 2008 Rev
Ed) (“the ITA”) against the decision of the High Court judge (“the Judge”)
dismissing the appeal of the appellant Comptroller (“the Appellant”)
against the decision of the Income Tax Board of Review (“the Board”)
in Income Tax Appeal Nos 3 and 4 of 2010. The Board had allowed the
appeal of the respondent insurance company (“the Respondent”) against
revised assessments raised on it by the Appellant seeking to tax
the gains made by the Respondent on the disposal of certain shares
(“the Shares”) that had been held by the Respondent in its related
companies [C], [D] and [E].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The
significance of this case lies to some degree in the fact that it
is the first local case dealing with the income tax treatment of
investment gains accruing to insurance companies. At its core it
revolves around the single issue of whether the gains arising from
the Respondent’s disposal of the Shares were revenue or capital
in nature (and hence whether they were liable to be taxed as income).
The Appellant submits that the Shares were held as assets of the
Respondent’s insurance business in its insurance funds at the time
of disposal and that the gains therefrom were therefore in the nature
of income. The Appellant’s arguments (at least on appeal) are based, in
large part, on the fact that the Shares were held by the Respondent
in statutorily mandated insurance funds and were used to meet the Respondent’s
solvency margins as prescribed by legislation. In rebuttal, the Respondent
argues that insurance companies, like all other companies, are not
precluded from holding shares as capital assets, the disposal of
which would give rise to <em>capital</em> gains.
In particular, the Respondent submits that the Shares were held
by it as part of a corporate preservation strategy rather than for
the purposes of trade.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       This
appeal raises, <em>inter alia</em>, interesting
questions as to the singular nature of insurance companies as enterprises
to which investment activities are central (if not crucial), the
impact of this on their consequent tax treatment and the relevance
of the overarching regulatory regime to the entire enquiry.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The
Respondent is a company registered in Singapore and is part of the
[C] Group of companies. It carried on the business of a general
insurer in Singapore and was registered under the Insurance Act
(Cap 142, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the Insurance Act”) until December 2009.
Under the provisions of the Insurance Act, an insurer is required
to establish separate insurance funds for each class of insurance
business and to ensure that all assets, receipts, liabilities and
expenses are properly attributed to the relevant fund. Pursuant
to s 17(1) of the Insurance Act, the Respondent therefore established
the Singapore Insurance Fund (“SIF”) and the Offshore Insurance
Fund (“OIF”) in respect of its Singapore and overseas policies respectively.
The Respondent used the SIF to invest in [C] shares, and used the
OIF to invest in [C], [D] and [E] shares. In the years of assessment (“YA”)
1973, 1976, 1980–1981, 1984–1986, 1988 and 1995, the Respondent sold
some of the Shares and reported the gains as taxable income.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On
29 June 2001, a hitherto unrelated company, [F], made a general offer
for the shares of [C] at a consideration of $4.02 in cash and 0.52
[F] share for each [C] share held (“the Takeover Offer”), which
offer received the requisite acceptances of [C’s] shareholders to
become unconditional. In response to the Takeover Offer, the Respondent
sold to [F] its entire holding of [C] shares amounting to 13,459,214
shares in exchange for $54,106,040 in cash and 6,998,791 [F] shares.
The Respondent also sold, in 2002, its portfolio of [D] and [E]
shares in the OIF, amounting to 3,308,000 and 6,000 shares respectively,
in exchange for $16,669,280 in cash. The Respondent thereby made
gains of $89,246,800 from the sale of [C] shares, $7,934,100 from
the sale of [D] shares, and $1,452,480 from the sale of [E] shares.
All in all, the Shares amounted to some 36% of the total value of
the SIF and the OIF.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The
Appellant took the view that the gains made by the Respondent were
taxable and issued revised assessments for YA 2002 and YA 2003 to the
Respondent. On 15 April 2010, in response to the Respondent’s request for
amendment, the Appellant issued to the Respondent a Notice of Refusal to
Amend the Assessments for YA 2002 and YA 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On
19 April 2010, the Respondent filed Notices of Appeal against the Appellant’s
revised assessments for both YA 2002 and YA 2003. By way of a decision
dated 20 June 2012 (“the Board Decision”), the Board allowed the appeals.
The Appellant then appealed against the Board Decision to the High
Court under s 81(2) of the ITA by way of Originating Summons No 681
of 2012 (“OS 681/2012”), which appeal was dismissed by the Judge
in a decision dated 8 April 2013 (“the Judgment”). On 7 May 2013,
the Appellant filed a Notice of Appeal against the decision of the
Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary of Pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In
OS 681/2012, the Appellant appealed on the grounds that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
Board erred in law when it did not take into account the extensive
case law indicating that the gains or profits of an insurance company
from the sale of its investments are revenue in nature and hence
taxable;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
Board erred in law in that it did not treat the gains or profits from
the sale of share investments by the Respondent as being taxable under
s 26 of the ITA;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
Board erred in fact and law in that it did not recognise that the
Shares were the trading stock (rather than the capital) of the Respondent,
taking into account:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_8-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       The manner in which the Shares were previously held for the
purposes of the insurance business of the Respondent; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_8-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       The fact that the Respondent had previously, of its own accord,
brought to tax the gains from the sale of the same counters of share
investments.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
Board erred in fact and law when it held that the gains or profits
derived by the Respondent from the sale of the Shares were capital
in nature and not taxable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Before
the Board and the Judge, the Appellant advanced two separate arguments:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     That
the profits made were profits falling with s 10(1)(<em>a</em>)
of the ITA as “income … in respect of gains or profits from any
trade [or] business”; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     That
the profits were, in any event or inferentially, to be brought to
assessment by the terms of ss 26(3) and 26(4) of the ITA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The
separate argument referred to above at [9(b)] is no longer being pursued.
The sole issue on appeal is therefore whether the gains derived from
the disposal of the Shares were “income … in respect of gains or profits
from any trade [or] business”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The
Board held, <em>inter alia</em>, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     Profits
from the sale of investments by insurance companies (other than
life insurance companies) were not automatically liable to tax under
ss 26(3) and (4) of the ITA;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
real question was whether the Respondent’s gains from the sale of
the Shares amounted to trading or business profits, which would
then be taxable under s 10(1)(<em>a</em>),
or whether they were in the nature of capital gains and hence not
exigible to tax;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
Respondent had not engaged in any trade or business in the transaction
of the Shares and the profits from the sale of the Shares ought
to be treated as capital gains. Specifically:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_11-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       The Shares were held for the long-term strategic purpose of
preserving the corporate structure of the [C] Group;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_11-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       The Shares were held for a long time and this supported the
argument that the Shares were acquired for a long-term strategic
purpose;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_11-p2_c-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       The Shares were not previously sold by the Respondent to meet
its offshore claim liabilities;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_11-p2_c-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       Those of the Shares which the Respondent sold were sold to
other companies within the [C] Group, which further reinforced the
corporate preservation policy; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_11-p2_c-p3_v"></a>(v)       As [E] was not a listed company, the case in relation to the gains
and profits derived by the Respondent from the sale of the [E] shares
being capital gains was even stronger.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Board came to its conclusion after examining the facts
and evidence available, including the oral testimonies of the Respondent’s
two witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The
Judge affirmed the Board’s findings of fact. In particular, the Judge
examined the present facts with reference to the so-called “badges
of trade” in order to determine if the gains from the sale of the
Shares were income in respect of gains or profits from the Respondent’s
trade or business:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     In
relation to the <em>motive of the taxpayer</em>,
the Judge found that the Respondent’s intention in holding the Shares
was to promote the long-term strategic interests of itself and the
[C] Group. This was manifested in various ways:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_12-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       There were cross-holdings of shares and cross-directorships
between the companies within the [C] Group;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_12-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       The corporate preservation strategy of the [C] Group also involved
the holding of shares of companies in the group by [QR], a company
controlled by the founder of [C] and his family;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_12-p2_a-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       The regular reports and updates on the status of cross-holdings
of various companies in the [C] Group and [QR] were generated to
enable the Senior Management of [C] to monitor and ensure that the
shareholding of the companies in the [C] Group was not diluted and
that effective control was maintained to minimise the possibility
of a hostile takeover;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_12-p2_a-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       Any decision to sell any shares or rights in the companies within
the [C] Group was closely scrutinised and reviewed. Specifically,
the Respondent was not allowed to sell any of its shares or rights
in the companies within the [C] Group without the requisite approval
from [C];</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_12-p2_a-p3_v"></a>(v)       The Shares were passively held by the Respondent and were
not managed by the Respondent’s fund manager; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_12-p2_a-p3_vi"></a>(vi)       The Shares of [E], a non-listed company, were not readily realisable.
Therefore, the Board was correct in finding that there was a strong
case for the view that the gains arising from the disposal of at
least the [E] shares were of a capital nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     In
relation to the <em>duration of ownership</em>,
the Judge found that, consistent with the [C] Group’s corporate
preservation strategy, the Respondent acquired the Shares and held
onto them for a long period of up to thirty years. The intention
to hold the Shares for a long period of time was an indication that
the investment was of a capital nature;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     In
relation to the <em>frequency or number of similar
transactions</em>, the Judge found that, consistent with the
corporate preservation strategy of the [C] Group, there were few
disposals of the Shares by the Respondent throughout the long period
of holding. (No [D] and [E] shares were disposed of during the entire
period before 2002, and there were only nine disposals of the [C]
shares over a span of 30 years); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_d"></a>(d)     In
relation to the <em>circumstances surrounding the
realisation</em>, the Judge found that there was no necessity
for the Respondent to liquidate the Shares to meet claims and liabilities
of its insurance business as it had sufficient cash reserves.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">For the above reasons, the Judge found that the Shares were
capital assets and not revenue assets, and that the gains from their
sale were therefore not taxable as income. The Judge rejected the
Appellant’s arguments in relation to the fact that the Shares were
held in statutorily mandated insurance funds and the fact that they
were taken into consideration when calculating the solvency margin
of the said insurance funds. The Judge also rejected the Appellant’s
arguments in relation to ss 26(3) and 26(4) of the ITA, which the
Appellant has since abandoned on appeal to this court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Appellant’s Case/Respondent’s
Case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The
Appellant’s core argument in the present appeal relates largely
to s 17 of the Insurance Act which requires an insurance company
to maintain an insurance fund or funds relevant to its particular
liabilities. It runs as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
requirement in s 17 of the Insurance Act is a recognition of the
nature of the insurance business, <em>viz</em>,
that of obtaining present receipts in the form of premiums by underwriting
future risks and using the premiums so obtained to defray the cost
of those future liabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     Section
17 contains a requirement that the moneys obtained by means of premiums
must be retained in a fund to meet liabilities underwritten by the
contracts obtaining those premiums so that the assets of the particular
business and its parts are identified. Those assets could only arguably
cease to be part of the insurance business if they were determined
to be surplus to such requirements with the consequence that, upon
satisfying the regulatory requirements, such surplus might be transferred
out of the insurance fund into the shareholders’ fund. Absent any
such transfer, any realisation of assets which had been purchased
with the premiums obtained would give rise to a profit or loss over
cost which is part of the taxable insurance business. Since the
Shares were never taken out of the insurance funds, they remained
a part (and a substantial part) of the assets of the insurance business.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     Many
of the cases relied on by the Judge and the Board in their respective
decisions were decided at a time prior to the application of the
more detailed regulations or in circumstances where the relevant law
did not require the assets of the insurance fund to be identified and
separately held.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">For the above reasons, the Appellant submits that the gains
arising from the realisation of the Shares are profits of the Respondent’s
business and therefore liable to be taxed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The
Respondent argues that the Appellant’s contention is unsustainable,
for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
Insurance Act is irrelevant to the present appeal because:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       Assets which are acquired with the receipts of income would
not necessarily be of a revenue nature;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       The purpose of the Insurance Act is not to govern the taxation
of insurance companies but to regulate the insurance business;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_a-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       The insurance fund is merely part of the regulatory framework
for insurance companies and cannot determine the income tax treatment
of insurance companies. The purpose of the regulatory framework
is to protect policyholders and to this end, the regulatory framework
requires assets to be held in the name of the respective insurance
funds. The classification of assets, receipts, liabilities and expenses
is common to all companies, not just insurance companies. The regulatory framework
does not prevent an insurance company from holding capital assets
in the same way as any other company. In addition, the capital assets
of a company do not become revenue assets just because they could
potentially be applied to meet the company’s liabilities, in a situation
of liquidation or otherwise;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_a-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       The Appellant has failed to provide any legal basis to substantiate
the supposed relationship between the Insurance Act and the ITA;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_a-p3_v"></a>(v)       The irrelevance of the insurance fund is particularly evident
when considering the fact that the ITA actually pre-dated the Insurance
Act;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_a-p3_vi"></a>(vi)       The Appellant’s allusion to a distinction between the insurance
fund and shareholders’ fund is misleading when there may be no material
difference in tax treatment by the Appellant since gains arising
from the shareholders’ fund could be taxed as well. The insurance
fund can and should only be taxed according to the ordinary concepts
of income and capital; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_a-p3_vii"></a>(vii)       The Appellant’s reliance on the solvency requirements prescribed
by the Insurance Act is misplaced. The solvency requirement is merely
another regulatory measure to ensure that the interests of policyholders
are adequately protected. The taxability of companies cannot be
determined by regulatory measures which are prescribed for the protection
of their customers.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     It
is well established in common law that insurance companies, like
any other companies, can hold shares as capital assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
totality of the evidence indicates that the Shares were capital
assets. The “badges of trade” approach adopted by the Judge provided
a useful and structured framework for reviewing all the facts and
evidence in totality and in coming to this conclusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     We
shall address each of these arguments in turn, following a close examination
of the applicable law. In our view, whilst the approaches taken in
other jurisdictions are of considerable assistance, the question
must ultimately be resolved on the basis of first principles and
the established rules of revenue law as applied to the specific
facts of the instant appeal.</p>

the concept of “income” is not defined anywhere in the ITA, it is
clear that “gains or profits” in ss 10(1)(<em>a</em>)
and 10(1)(<em>b</em>) refer only to gains or
profits of an income nature. This is also reflected in the wording
of s 10(1)(<em>g</em>), which taxes “gains
or profits of an income nature” not included in the preceding paragraphs
of s 10(1). There is no capital gains tax in Singapore; capital
gains are not taxable <em>even if</em> the
capital gains arise from the carrying on of a trade, business, profession
or vocation (<em>The Law and Practice of Singapore
Income Tax</em>, vol I (Pok Soy Yoong, Ng Keat Seng &amp; Steven
Timms eds) (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2013) (“<em>The
Law and Practice of Singapore Income Tax</em>”) at para 6.15).
By way of an example, capital gains from the sale of machinery or
equipment used in a trade or business are not taxable although a
balancing charge is applied to recoup depreciation allowances previously
given.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In
determining the scope of income tax, it is therefore necessary to draw
a distinction between taxable income and non-taxable capital gains. However,
this distinction is often ambiguous in marginal cases such as those
where investment activities are central to the enterprise concerned. The
appropriate approach in such situations was considered by the Lord Justice
Clerk in the seminal case of <em>Californian Copper
Syndicate (Limited and Reduced) v Harris (Surveyor of Taxes)</em> (1904)
5 TC 159 (“<em>Californian Copper Syndicate</em>”)
at 165 to 166:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is quite a well settled principle in
dealing with questions of assessment of Income Tax, that where the
owner of an ordinary investment chooses to realise it, and obtains
a greater price for it than he originally acquired it at, the enhanced
price is not profit … assessable to Income Tax. But it is equally
well established that enhanced values obtained from realisation
or conversion of securities may be so assessable, where what is
done is not merely a realisation or change of investment, but an
act done in what is truly the carrying on, or carrying out, of a
business. The simplest case is that of a person or association of
persons buying and selling lands or securities speculatively, in
order to make gain, dealing in such investments as a business, and
thereby seeking to make profits. There are many companies which
in their very inception are formed for such a purpose, and in these
cases it is not doubtful that, where they make a gain by a realisation,
the gain they make is liable to be assessed for Income Tax.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The
Lord Justice Clerk then went on to articulate the time-honoured test
to be applied in such cases (at 166):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">What is the line which separates the two
classes of cases may be difficult to define, and each case must
be considered according to its facts; the question to be determined
being—<em>Is the sum of gain that has been made
a mere enhancement of value by realising a security, or is it a
gain </em><b><em>made in an operation of business
in carrying out a scheme for profit-making</em></b><em>?</em> [emphasis added in italics and bold
italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Appellant submits, and we agree, that the relevant question
to be asked in such cases is simple, <em>viz</em>,
whether the gain in question is a mere enhancement of value by realising
a security or whether it was made in an operation of business in
carrying out a scheme for profit-making. On our reading of the case,
it is not enough that the gain arose in the operation of business;
it must also have arisen pursuant to the carrying out of a scheme for <em>profit-making</em>. Put another way, the distinction
is between the profit that arises when property has been committed
to a business as part of its stock in trade and is then realised
in the course of trading operations and the gain that arises from
a realisation of property not so committed. The former is taxable
income, the latter not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In
the context of the insurance industry, it is trite that an integral
part of the insurance business is to channel its premium receipts
and capital into productive activities such as investments in equities,
securities and properties which would generate investment income
to meet its liabilities arising from claims by policy holders. As
the investment of an insurer’s funds is generally part of the business
of the insurer, any investment <em>income</em> (<em>eg</em>, in the form of interest or dividends)
derived from within or without Singapore constitutes its taxable
business income. Likewise, the gains or profits derived from the <em>disposal of investments</em> by the insurer
in the course of its business activities are generally subject to
income tax. This general (and, indeed, pragmatic) proposition has
been recognised by courts in various jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     One
of the earliest authorities for this general proposition is a Scottish case, <em>Northern Assurance Co v Russell</em> (1889)
2 TC 551, where the surpluses derived by an insurance company from
realising investments in the course of its business were held to
be part of its profits. There, it was stated in broad terms (at
578) that “[w]here the gain is made by the Company … by realising
an investment at a larger price than was paid for it, the difference is
to be reckoned among the profits and gains of the Company”. Unfortunately,
in our view, this sweeping and unqualified statement is of somewhat
limited assistance due to the brevity of the aforementioned judgment
and its lack of reasoned analysis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     A
more detailed examination of the nature of the insurance business and
its general consequential treatment for taxation purposes is found
in the judgment of Hamilton J in <em>The Liverpool
and London and Globe Insurance Company v Bennett (Surveyor of Taxes)</em> (1913)
6 TC 327 (“<em>The Liverpool and London and Globe
Insurance</em>”), where it was stated (at 357) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The private individual may have property
entirely independent of his trade, although part of his assets,
no doubt, in case of his insolvency, and it is intelligible to say
that his trade does not extend to or touch his private property.
I do not think that that is true of the Insurance Companies. The private
individual may save to provide for his old age or for his family,
he has leisure to enjoy, he has ambitions to gratify, and his existence,
in fact, can be separated into his trading and his private life.
Nothing of the kind can be done with an Insurance Company. Subject
to the scope of the Memorandum and Articles … they are a trading
company and a trading company only. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is another point with regard to the
Insurance Company. It embarks its funds in its business simply by
having money ready to pay its debts with. We are not here concerned
with manufactories or the maintenance of a stock which is to be
sold. <em>The business of insurance consists in
making promises to pay, by way of indemnity</em>, in futuro <em>and contingent sums in consideration of present payments
of money, and the whole business therefore, apart from the wisdom
and prudence with which it is conducted, consists in being ready
to meet the liabilities if they accrue, and to the extent to which
they accrue, out of one class of funds or another. Consequently
the money is embarked in the business as soon as it is money which
belongs to and is available to the Insurance Company.</em> If
they have paid it away in the shape of dividends, it is no longer
available, but all of their assets substantially are only possessed
for the purpose of meeting the contingencies of losses on the policies
if they should fall in. I am speaking of fire insurance only as
an illustration, but I do not think that either indemnity business
or, for this purpose, life business differs, although of course
the calculation of risks and the mode of carrying out the transaction
are enormously different.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was decided then that where an English company carrying
on insurance business both locally and abroad invested sums of money
abroad, and the interest on those sums was not remitted (it being
then the law that foreign income was charged only to the extent
that the foreign income was remitted back to England), such interest
nevertheless formed part of the taxable income of the company assessable
under the Income Tax Act 1842, s 100, Schedule D, Case 1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The
decision was affirmed on appeal to the English Court of Appeal and
the House of Lords. In the words of Lord Mersey (at 379 and 380):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… It is well known that in the course of
carrying on an insurance business large sums of money derived from
premiums collected and from other sources accumulate in the hands
of the insurers, and that one of the most important parts of the
profits of the business is derived from the temporary investment
of these moneys. These temporary investments are also required for
the formation of the reserve fund, a fund created to attract customers
and to serve as a standby in the event of sudden claims being made
upon the insurers in respect of losses. It is, according to my view,
impossible to say that such investments do not form part of this
Company’s insurance business, or that the returns flowing from them
do not form part of its profits. In a commercial sense the directors
of the Company owe a duty to their shareholders and to their customers
to make such investments, and to receive and distribute in the ordinary
course of business, whether in the form of dividends, or in payment
of losses, or in the formation of reserves, the moneys collected
from them. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Similar
sentiments were expressed by the High Court of Australia in <em>Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Limited v
Federal Commissioner of Taxation</em> (1946) 73 CLR 604 (“<em>Colonial Mutual Life Assurance</em>”) at 619–620:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But an insurance company, whether a mutual
insurance company or not, is undoubtedly carrying on an insurance
business and the investment of its funds is as much a part of that
business as the collection of the premiums<em>.</em> The
purpose of investing the funds of the appellant is to obtain the
most effective yield of income. The diminution or increase in the
capital value of the investment between the date of purchase and
that of maturity, and the apportionment and deduction or addition
over the intervening period of that diminution from or increase
to the interest actually payable on the investment is a material
ingredient in the ascertainment of this yield. In <em>Konstam,
Law of Income Tax</em>, 8th ed. (1940), p. 126, it is stated
that “the buying and selling of investments is a necessity of insurance
business; and <em>where an insurance company in
the course of its trade realizes an investment at a larger price
than what was paid for it, the difference is to be reckoned among its
profits</em>; conversely, any loss is to be deducted.” … [emphasis
added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Likewise, in the Hong Kong case of <em>Commissioner
of Inland Revenue v Sincere Insurance and Investment Co Ltd</em> [1973]
HKCU 47 (“<em>Sincere Insurance</em>”), it
was observed that “where the person making the gain is an insurance
company that fact alone makes it the <em>more likely</em> that
the gain arises in the carrying on, or carrying out of business”
[emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In
our judgment, whilst the above articulations of general principle provide
a practical and even compelling approach in relation to the majority
of such cases, these statements cannot be read to stand for any absolute
or immutable principle of <em>law</em>. On
the contrary, the question whether certain investment gains are
properly attributable to the revenue or capital account is ultimately
a question of <em>fact</em>. Courts have
frequently cautioned that the word “income” in the context of the
income-capital dichotomy is not a term of art and that, in the absence
of statutory provision to the contrary, whether a receipt is “income”
must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and
usages of mankind: <em>Scott v Commissioner of
Taxation (New South Wales)</em> (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 at
219. In a similar vein, the court in <em>Colonial
Mutual Life Assurance</em> observed that (at 615):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The crucial question is whether the net
profit … <em>is a profit arising from the carrying
on or carrying out of a profit-making scheme</em>, and if
it is not whether this net profit is income <em>according
to ordinary usages and concepts</em>. As Lord Parker said
in <em>Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance
Co v Bennett</em>, (1913) AC 610 at p 622, “This question
ought, in my opinion, to be determined on ordinary business principles, <em>having regard to the circumstances under which, and
the purposes for which, the investments were made and are held by
the appellant company.”</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Indeed,
the language of most of the decisions indicate that the aforementioned
proposition (<em>viz</em>, that gains or
profits derived from the disposal of investments by insurers are
generally taxable as revenue) is more in the way of a <em>general </em><em>rule</em> or <em>presumption of fact</em> drawn from circumstantial
evidence. In <em>GRE Insurance Ltd v FC of T</em> 92
ATC 4089 (“<em>GRE Insurance</em>”), for
example, the Full Federal Court of Australia made it clear (at 4093)
that “profits from the realisation of investments of an insurance
company … are <em>not invariably</em> taken
into account” [emphasis added]. In <em>Colonial
Mutual Life Assurance</em> (at 618), the court was of the view
that “profits and losses on the realization of investments of the
funds of an insurance company should <em>usually</em> be
taken into account in the determination of the profits and gains
of the business” [emphasis added]. The relevant tribunal is therefore
not discharged from its role as fact-finder solely by virtue of
the fact that the taxpayer is engaged in the business of insurance
or something similar. However, the particular features of the insurance
business would generally give rise to the <em>factual</em> inference
that the gains concerned arose in an “operation of business in carrying
out a scheme for profit-making” (see [19] above) unless there is
cogent evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In
particular, we would emphasise that the statements expressed in the
above cases should not be read in isolation and must be examined
in the context of their specific facts. In <em>Californian
Copper Syndicate</em> (at 166 and 167), <em>Employers’
Mutual Indemnity Association Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation</em> 91
ATC 4850 (at 4854, 4856 and 4857) and <em>GRE Insurance</em> (at 4094
and 4095), the courts consistently stated that the facts of each
case must be closely examined and, indeed, reached their decisions
based on their findings of fact. It is also apposite to note that
none of the above cases bears any factual similarity to the appeal
at hand, where it was accepted (by both the Board and the Judge
below) that the Shares were acquired, held and disposed of for long-term
strategic reasons. In the circumstances, caution must be exercised
not to extend any broad and generalised statements in the above
cases beyond the actual <em>ratio decidendi</em> of
those cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     For
instance, the facts of <em>Liverpool and London
and Globe Insurance</em> (cited above at [22]) did <em>not</em> in fact involve the taxation of gains
from the sale of investments, but instead concerned interest and
dividend receipts from investments abroad (<em>ie</em>,
investment <em>income</em>). There was no
question but that the interest and dividend receipts were income.
What was in issue was whether they were exigible to tax notwithstanding
that they had not been remitted back to England. In the result,
they were held to form part of taxable income of the company in
the carrying on of its insurance business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In <em>Colonial Mutual Life Assurance</em> (conveniently
summarised by the court in <em>Sincere Insurance</em>),
the appellant, a mutual life assurance company, was guided in its
investments by actuarial estimations which indicated that, to meet
its liabilities under insurance policies, it had to obtain a certain effective
yield on its investments. The interest yield was the governing factor
influencing the company’s policy and it held its securities as investments
rather than for the purpose of constantly seeking profits from realising
them. In the relevant tax year the amount realised by it in the
sale of securities exceeded the cost to it of those securities and
the amount of the excess was regarded as assessable income. It was
in this context that the court stated that (at 619–620):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But an insurance company, whether a mutual
insurance company or not, is undoubtedly carrying on an insurance
business and the investment of its funds is as much a part of that
business as the collection of the premiums. <em>The purpose
of investing the funds of the appellant is to obtain the most effective yield
of income. The diminution or increase in the capital value of the investment
between the date of purchase and that of maturity, and the apportionment
and deduction or addition over the intervening period of that diminution
from or increase to the interest actually payable on the investment is
a material ingredient in the ascertainment of this yield.</em> …
The acquisition of an investment with a view to producing the most
effective interest yield is an acquisition with a view to producing
a yield of a composite character, the effective yield comprising
the actual interest less any diminution or plus any increase in
the capital value of the securities. Such an acquisition and subsequent
realization is a normal step in carrying on the insurance business, or
in other words <em>an act done in what is truly
the carrying on of the business of the [company]</em>. [emphasis
added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is clear that the decision in <em>Colonial
Mutual Life Assurance</em> took place squarely within the
framework of a <em>profit-making</em> scheme
(whether through the optimisation of interest yields or the fortuitous
“switching” of securities).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Similarly,
in <em>London Australia Investment Co Ltd v The
Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia</em> (1977)
138 CLR 106, the High Court of Australia found that an <em>investment</em> company that had systematically
sold shares at a profit in order to increase its dividend yield was
earning taxable income from the sale of shares. The court stated
(at 116–117) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the present case the taxpayer naturally
placed considerable reliance on the finding that the shares were
not bought for the purpose of selling them at a profit. That is
indeed an important circumstance. It was then submitted that the
shares were acquired on the capital account of the company, for
the purpose of adding to its profit-making structure, as the means
of producing dividend income, rather than as part of the profit-earning
activities within that structure … If that submission were correct,
the fact that the shares were realized in a methodical and enterprising
way, so as to secure the best results for the taxpayer, would not
convert the proceeds of realization into income. But the question
whether the shares were acquired on the capital account of the taxpayer
can only be answered by applying the tests indicated by [<em>Californian Copper Syndicate</em>]. Helsham J.
found that during the three years in question it was an integral
part of the taxpayer’s business to deal in shares, in the sense
that switching of investments was desirable to produce the best dividend
returns and was indeed necessary if the taxpayer’s policy of investing
in shares with growth potential was to be adhered to. In my opinion it
is impossible to controvert that finding; it was clearly right. <em>Although the company’s business was to invest in
shares with the primary purpose of obtaining income by way of dividends,
the conduct of the investment business required that the share portfolio
should be given regular consideration, and that shares should frequently
be sold when the dividend yield dropped, which for practical purposes
usually meant when the shares went up in value. The taxpayer systematically
sold its shares at a profit for the purpose of increasing the dividend
yield of its investments. The sale of the shares was a normal operation
in the course of carrying on the business of investing for profit.</em> It
was not a mere realization or change of investment. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     This
is largely consonant with the general approach taken in respect of
banks and similar financial institutions. In <em>Punjab
Co-operative Bank Limited, Amritsar v Commissioner of Income-Tax,
Lahore</em> [1940] AC 1055, the Privy Council observed as
follows (at 1072–1073):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the ordinary case of a bank, the business
consists in its essence of dealing with money and credit. Numerous
depositors place their money with the bank, often receiving a small
rate of interest on it. A number of borrowers receive loans of a
large part of these deposited funds, at somewhat higher rates of
interest. But the banker has always to keep enough cash or easily realizable
securities to meet any probable demand by the depositors. No doubt
there will generally be loans to persons of undoubted solvency which can
quickly be called in, but it may be very undesirable to use this
second line of defence. <em>If, as in the present
case, some of the securities are realized in order to meet withdrawals
by depositors, it seems to their Lordships to be quite clear that
this is a normal step in carrying on the banking business or, in
other words, that it is an act done in “what is truly the carrying
on” of the banking business.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Notwithstanding this, however, the Privy Council in <em>Waylee Investment Ltd v The Commissioner of Inland
Revenue</em> [1991] 1 HKLR 237 (“<em>Waylee Investment</em>”)
took pains to emphasise that a bank, like any other trader, <em>could</em> in certain circumstances hold investments
as capital assets. The taxpayer bank subscribed for shares in one
of its customers at a time when the customer was facing financial
difficulties. The bank subscribed for more than 20% of the issued
capital of the customer which was a very large trading concern.
Being anxious to ensure that the general public did not misconstrue
the investment as indicating that the bank itself intended to enter
into the field of general trading, it publicly announced that its acquisition
was “a sizable investment of venture capital” and the chairman of
the bank affirmed that its intention was to “substantially reduce
its shareholding as soon as conditions permit”. The shares were
realised over a period of some six years. The initial sales were
in response to an unsolicited offer. The taxpayer was assessed to
tax on the profits from those sales on the basis that it was trading
in shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The
Board of Review allowed the bank’s appeal against the assessment on
the ground that it was not trading. The High Court upheld the Board
of Review’s decision. On Revenue’s appeal however, the Court of
Appeal reversed the High Court’s decision. It did so in reliance, <em>inter alia</em>, on the bank’s earlier public
statement that it intended to reduce its holding in the customer
as soon as conditions permitted. In the opinion of the Court of Appeal,
the acquisition of the shares was an adventure in the nature of trade.
Allowing the bank’s appeal, the Privy Council held (at 242–243):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… <em>The stock in trade
of a bank is money and securities readily convertible to money.</em> But
it is equally clear that <em>a bank, like any other
trader, may hold investments as capital assets.</em> The clearest
indication that an investment was acquired as a capital asset would
be an indication that the bank intended to hold the investment as
such for an indefinite period. The clearest indication that an investment
was acquired as trading stock would be an indication that it was
held by the bank as available to meet the demands of depositors whenever
necessary. But the indications to show which category a particular investment
belongs may be uncertain, inconclusive or even conflicting. [emphasis
added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It then held that since it was clear that the bank never intended
that the relevant shares acquired by the bank should be held as
part of the bank’s circulating assets, the Court of Appeal was not
entitled to reverse the finding by the Board of Review that those
shares were acquired as capital assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Two
New Zealand authorities, <em>Commissioner of Inland
Revenue v National Insurance Company of New Zealand Ltd</em> (1999)
19 NZTC 15,135 (“National Insurance Company”) and <em>State
Insurance Office v Commissioner of Inland Revenue</em> [1990]
2 NZLR 444 (“<em>State Insurance Office</em>”),
both relating to insurance companies, were extensively relied on
by the Judge below for the proposition that, notwithstanding the
general presumption with regards insurance companies, the gains
or losses arising from the disposal of investments by an insurer
may <em>in some instances</em> be capital
in nature and therefore not subject to income tax. This was not disputed
by the Appellant below, who instead argued that the present case could
not be characterised as exceptional in the above sense.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Nevertheless,
on appeal, the Appellant now contends that the decisions of the
New Zealand courts have very little relevance to the present enquiry
or should not apply at all. First, the Appellant alleges that due
to differences between our legislation and the New Zealand legislation,
the New Zealand cases are not necessarily applicable to the interpretation
of the words of s 10(1) of the ITA. It is not clear how the differences
in the legislation assist the Appellant’s case. In our view, the
New Zealand legislation, if anything, is broader than our local
tax legislation. Section 65(2)(<em>a</em>)
of the New Zealand Income Tax Act 1976 (“the New Zealand Act”) taxed
“all profits or gains derived from any business”, which is very
similar to s 10(1)(<em>a</em>) of the ITA
which taxes “gains or profits from any trade [or] business”. Section
65(2)(<em>e</em>) of the New Zealand Act <em>additionally</em> taxed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>All profits or gains
derived from the sale or other disposition of any personal property</em> or
any interest therein … if the business of the taxpayer comprises dealing
in such property, or <em>if the property was acquired
for the purpose of selling or otherwise disposing of it</em>,
and all profits or gains derived from the carrying on or carrying
out of any undertaking or scheme entered into or devised for the
purpose of making a profit: [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In our view, the New Zealand cases, which are based on similar
(if not broader) charging provisions, are therefore directly relevant
to the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The
Appellant’s second contention is that the two New Zealand authorities
were determined at a time when New Zealand did not require the maintenance
of insurance funds for insurance companies as has been required
in Singapore since 1966. The relevance of the insurance fund (or lack
thereof) will be discussed later in this judgment (at [41]–[49]). Notwithstanding
the legislatively mandated insurance funds, it is clear that the
revenue or capital nature of investments gains is an issue to be determined
in accordance with ordinary principles on the basis of all the facts
and evidence in each case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In <em>National Insurance Company</em>, the taxpayer
was an insurance company with a 30% shareholding in a private merchant
bank. The remaining 70% of shares were held by the National Bank
of New Zealand (“the National Bank”). As a significant minority
shareholder, the taxpayer had two directors representing it on the
board of the merchant bank. The taxpayer sold its shares to the
National Bank and realised a profit of $67m on the sale. The Court
of Appeal of New Zealand gave judgment for the taxpayer, holding
that the shares were capital assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The
court found in that case that there was a weak nexus between the realisation
of the shares and the carrying on of the insurance business. In particular,
the taxpayer had sufficient cash reserves such that the sale of
its strategic investments was never in contemplation as a means
of meeting claims or maintaining profitability. Moreover, the taxpayer
did not acquire the shares for the purposes of trading, but with
the aim of diversifying its investment. The shares were acquired
with an intention to be held long-term, evidenced in part by the
fact that the shares were treated differently from the taxpayer’s
portfolio shares which were traded. Finally, the court also considered
the fact that the shares were eventually sold only because of extenuating
circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The
court concluded that the shares were part of the capital structure of
the taxpayer’s business and, as such, their disposal gave rise to
capital gains (at 15,146):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… <em>In the end, this
was the making of a value judgment based on the totality of the
evidence</em>. There were features of the … transaction distinguishing
it from the general run of investments inherent in the nature of
the company’s insurance business which we think allowed a conclusion
that it was, albeit an investment, a move into another area of business
which then, for supervening reasons, it became commercially desirable
to terminate. By the time of disposition the shareholding could
be seen as part of the capital structure of a company’s business.
[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     A
similar issue arose in <em>State Insurance Office</em>,
where the issue before the New Zealand High Court was whether gains
arising from the sale of shares by the taxpayer (which was a fire
and general insurer) pursuant to a takeover or merger were properly
characterised as capital gains or revenue. In deciding that the
gains were of a capital nature, the court placed great emphasis
on the fact that claims submitted to the taxpayer could easily be met
from its cash flow and cash reserves without the need to liquidate
any of its shares to meet the claims and liabilities. The court
took into consideration the lack of intention on the shareholders’
part to trade in the shares and the fact that the shares were sold
pursuant to a compulsory acquisition. Pertinently, the New Zealand
High Court held (at 476):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Whilst there is a nexus between the income
generated by the shares and the operation of the business … <em>there is no nexus between the realisations which
occurred here and the method of operation of the business</em>.
[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The shares therefore were “not in their character revenue
assets in the sense that their realisation is inherent in or incidental
to the carrying on of the business”. They had become “structural
assets”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In
our view, the relevant enquiry to be undertaken in cases involving the
taxation of investment gains by insurance (or similar) companies
may be summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
crucial question is whether the gain in question is a mere enhancement
of value by realising a security or whether it was made in an operation
of business in carrying out a scheme for profit-making.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_b"></a>(b)     This
is ultimately a question of <em>fact</em> to
be determined according to ordinary concepts having regard particularly
to the circumstances under which, and the purposes for which, the
investments were acquired and held by the taxpayer.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_c"></a>(c)     However,
as a matter of practicality, the nature of insurance (or similar)
businesses would ordinarily give rise to an inference that the gains
concerned arose in the course of trade or in the operation of business
in carrying out a scheme for profit-making (unless, of course, there
is cogent evidence that the investments were acquired and held as
capital assets).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is on this basis that we now go on to examine the Appellant’s
central argument on appeal <em>vide</em> the
regulatory regime established by the Insurance Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Relevance of the Insurance Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The
Appellant’s argument on appeal largely relies on s 17 of the Insurance
Act. Section 17(1) of the Insurance Act provides for the establishment
by an insurer of separate insurance funds for each class of its insurance
business, whilst s 17(4) stipulates what must be paid into an insurance
fund and the restrictions on what an insurance fund may be used for:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Establishment
of insurance funds and allocation of surplus</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>17.</b>—(1) Every licensed insurer
shall establish and maintain a separate insurance fund —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    for each class of insurance
business carried on by the insurer that relates to Singapore policies;
and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    for
each class of insurance business carried on by the insurer that relates
to offshore policies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)    There
shall be paid into an insurance fund all receipts of the insurer properly
attributable to the business to which the fund relates (including
the income of the fund), and the assets comprised in the fund shall
be applicable only to meet such part of the insurer’s liabilities
and expenses as is properly so attributable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The
Appellant’s primary argument on appeal is that the Shares were attributable
to the Respondent’s insurance business as the shares were acquired,
by applying the proceeds of premiums received, in the course of the
insurance business and were at all times in its insurance funds.
As such, the Appellant alleges that the gains realised in the disposal
of the Shares were taxable as income.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     At
the outset, it is to be noted that the Appellant’s position on the appeal,
elevating the Insurance Act as the cornerstone of its case, diverges greatly
from the case it advanced before the High Court, where the Insurance
Act was acknowledged not to be the “main thrust” of the Appellant’s
arguments. Before the Board and the High Court, the Appellant had
accepted that notwithstanding the general presumption with regard
to investment gains by insurers, there might be exceptional instances
where disposals of investments by insurance companies would give
rise to capital gains (although the Appellant submitted that this
case was not exceptional on the facts). However, the main contention
of the Appellant on appeal now appears to be that gains arising
from <em>all</em> assets (even fixed assets)
held in insurance funds would invariably be assessable income. On
such an argument, it would presumably be inappropriate for the relevant
tribunal to consider all the other circumstances of the case (such
as the circumstances of the acquisition and the realisation of the
asset) in coming to its determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The
Appellant’s argument is clearly flawed. The regulatory requirement
for the establishment and maintenance of insurance funds cannot
without more restrict an insurance company from holding capital assets
in its insurance funds. Assets which are acquired with the receipts
of income would not invariably be of a revenue nature, and the relevant enquiry
(set out above at [40]) must be applied at each stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The
Respondent rightly notes that the purpose of the Insurance Act is for
the regulation and not the taxation of the insurance industry. The insurance
fund is merely part of the regulatory framework for insurance companies
and cannot be determinative of their tax treatment. The imposition
of tax is solely within the purview of Parliament through the enactment
of clear tax legislation which is to be interpreted by the court
or relevant tribunal using principles developed incrementally by
case law. The fact that certain gains are attributable to investments
held in statutorily mandated insurance funds cannot <em>automatically</em> divest
the relevant tribunal of its proper role in deciding whether, in
all the circumstances of the case, the gains are properly attributable
to the revenue or capital account. Otherwise, any regulatory body
would theoretically be able to determine the taxation of companies.
This runs counter to the fact that regulatory frameworks are often
shaped by intricate policy considerations which may have little
or nothing to do with tax.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Moreover,
the distinction between the insurance fund and the shareholders’
fund, whilst relevant, cannot be <em>determinative</em> of
the tax treatment of particular assets or investments. Clearly,
gains arising from the shareholders’ fund could be taxed as income
as well. In our judgment, insurance companies (whether holding assets
in the insurance fund or shareholders’ fund) should only be taxed
according to the ordinary principles of revenue law, albeit the
holding of an asset in a particular fund may be a relevant <em>factor</em> in ascertaining whether the investment
was intended to be held as a capital asset.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     It
is trite that capital assets do not become revenue assets just because they
could <em>potentially</em> be applied to
meet the company’s liabilities, in a situation of liquidation or
otherwise. In <em>State Insurance Office</em> (at
451), the New Zealand High Court held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [The Company] is in the business of insurance,
and it is something of a contradiction on the other hand to advocate
that it will never have its reserves called upon, and therefore
they assume the character of capital detached from the business
of insurance, and on the other say that it is necessary for a company
to obtain commercial credibility to have such reserves in the event that
a calamity does occur. But I think between the two positions the
true situation is that normal requirements are met without recourse
to investments including shares, and they are truly categorised
as fixed capital as opposed to circulating capital. As with all
undertakings, fixed capital is not beyond the reach of creditors
…</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It <em>cannot</em> be said that merely
because the Shares were held in state-mandated insurance funds and
could, in exceptional circumstances, be realised to meet the company’s
liabilities, the gains attributable to them are invariably revenue
as opposed to capital gains.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The
Appellant has also sought to rely on the solvency requirements prescribed
by the Insurance Act to argue that the Shares, which were used to
meet the aforesaid solvency requirements, formed part of the Respondent’s
insurance business. In our view, such arguments are unpersuasive
and run the risk of being unduly technical. These solvency requirements
are merely regulatory measures introduced to ensure that the interests
of policy holders are adequately protected. As mentioned above (at [45]),
the taxation of financially regulated companies such as insurance companies,
banks and finance companies cannot be determined solely by regulatory
measures which are prescribed for a whole gamut of policy reasons
which may have little or nothing at all to do with taxation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     For
the abovementioned reasons, we are of the view that the Insurance
Act is <em>not</em> determinative of the
central issue in the present appeal, <em>viz</em>,
whether, in light of the totality of the evidence, the gains attributable
to the Shares arose in the operation of the Respondent’s insurance
business in carrying out a scheme for profit-making.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Application of the relevant
legal principles to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Taking
into account the totality of the evidence before the Board and the
Judge, which is largely undisputed by the Appellant, we are of the
view that the Shares were capital assets and the gains attributable
to them were therefore not liable to tax. In coming to the same
conclusion, the Judge considered the following factors (which included
the “badges of trade”) and weighed them in balance:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_a"></a>(a)     Motive
of the taxpayer;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_b"></a>(b)     Duration
of ownership;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_c"></a>(c)     Multiplicity
of disposal of the Shares;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_d"></a>(d)     Finances;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_e"></a>(e)     Findings
by an earlier Board;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_f"></a>(f)     Earlier
tax treatment;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_g"></a>(g)     Placement
of the Shares in insurance funds; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_h"></a>(h)     The
consideration of the Shares in calculating the solvency margin of
the Respondent’s insurance funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     It
is pertinent that, on appeal, the Appellant does not contest the <em>primary findings of fact</em> reached by the
Judge (and indeed, the Board) in relation to the above factors.
The Appellant only disputes the <em>inference of fact</em> reached
by the Judge in concluding that, in light of the above factors, the
Shares were capital assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Motive of the taxpayer</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     As
noted above (at [12(a)]), the Respondent did not acquire the Shares
with an intention to trade in them. Instead, the Respondent’s intention
in holding the Shares was to promote the long-term strategic interests
of itself and the [C] Group. This was evidenced by the numerous cross-holdings
of shares and cross-directorships between companies within the [C]
Group. Regular updates on the status of cross-holdings of companies
in the [C] Group and [QR] were generated to the senior management
of [C]. Any decision to sell any shares or rights in the companies
within the [C] Group was closely scrutinised and reviewed by the
Investment Committee of the [C] Group to ensure that the appropriate level
of shareholding and effective control was maintained. The Respondent was
not allowed to sell any of its shares and rights in relation to
companies within the [C] Group without the requisite approval from
[C]. The Shares were also treated differently and segregated from
shares that were readily traded by the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The
above facts were uncontested by the Appellant who, indeed,
appears to concede that the Shares were held as part of a corporate preservation
strategy as opposed to for the purposes of trade. For example, at
[11] of its Skeletal Arguments, the Appellant states that “it is
tempting to be seduced by the fact that the Shares were held for
a long period of time … and were held as part of the ‘corporate
preservation strategy of the [C] Group’”. Instead, the Appellant
appears to argue that the Shares were part of the Respondent’s insurance
operations <em>notwithstanding</em> the particular motive
for the acquisition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     We
have difficulty accepting this submission. The motive of the Respondent
in acquiring and holding the Shares is relevant (indeed, highly relevant)
to the enquiry. As observed by Lord Parker in <em>Liverpool
and London and Globe</em> (at 380), the central question in
such cases ought to be determined on ordinary business principles
“having regard to the circumstances under which, and the purposes
for which, the investments were made and are held by the … company”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     It
is clear to us that the presumption of fact in relation to the taxation of
investment gains of insurance companies (<em>ie</em>,
that they are usually taxable) is predicated on what was viewed
to be the intention and purpose behind the acquisition and holding
of such investments by most insurance companies, <em>viz</em>,
for the purposes of trade and profit generation. However, the natural
and logical corollary of this is that where there is convincing evidence
that the predominant motivation of acquiring the investment is different
(<em>eg</em>, strategic) this would also
be relevant in evaluating whether the gains were in fact capital
gains as opposed to income.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In
these circumstances, the factual finding that the Shares were acquired
and held as part of a group corporate preservation strategy (which finding
went unchallenged by the Appellant on appeal) gives rise to a very strong
inference that they were capital assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Duration of ownership</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     As
noted above (at [12(b)], the Shares were held for a long period
of time. The [C] shares, [D] shares and [E] shares were accumulated
over a period of 30 years, 20 years and 27 years respectively. This
is in line with the Respondent’s stated intention of holding the
Shares for an indefinite period pursuant to its corporate preservation
strategy and weighs heavily in the balance of the Shares being found
to be capital assets of the Respondent. As noted in <em>Waylee
Investment</em> (cited above at [31]) in the context of banks and
financial institutions, “the clearest indication that an investment
was acquired as a capital asset would be an indication that the
[company] intended to hold the investment as such for an indefinite
period.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Multiplicity of similar transactions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Consistent
with the stated corporate preservation strategy, there were few
disposals of the Shares by the Respondent throughout its relatively
long period of holding. Evidence was adduced by the Respondent that
no [D] shares and [E] shares were disposed before the Takeover by
[F] in 2002. There were only nine disposals of [C] shares over a
span of 30 years, and these were mostly to other companies within
the [C] Group. Moreover, during the period from YA 1983 to YA 1991
(during which there were disposals of [C] shares), the percentage
of [C] shares held by the [C] Group remained relatively constant
and ranged between 21.28% and 22.78%. Again, the Appellant did not
seriously attempt to challenge these primary findings on appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Finances</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Evidence
was adduced by the Respondent to show that the Respondent did not
need to and did not in fact liquidate the Shares to meet its liabilities
in the insurance business. From YA 1973 to YA 2003, the Respondent’s
net cash flow was positive from a year-to-year basis. For certain
years of assessment, such as YA 1985 and YA 1986, where the offshore
claims were higher than the premiums collected, the Respondent would
draw upon cash reserves in its offshore fund as well as upon dividend and
interest income to meet the cash outflow requirements arising from
the offshore claims. Alternatively, the Respondent would transfer
moneys from the accumulated profits of its onshore fund to its shareholders’
fund, and then transfer moneys from the shareholders’ fund to the
offshore fund to pay the offshore claims. As the Judge and the Board
noted, there was no necessity for the Respondent to sell the [C]
shares to meet its offshore claims and the Respondent did not in
fact do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     As
such, the Judge rightly found that, similar to the situation in <em>National Insurance Company</em> and <em>State Insurance Office</em>, there was a weak nexus
between the sale of the Shares and the carrying on of the Respondent’s
insurance business. To borrow the words of Heron J in <em>State Insurance Office</em>, the Judge found
that the Shares were not in their character revenue assets in the
sense of their realisation being inherent in or incidental to the
carrying on of the Respondent’s insurance business. Instead, the
Shares were “structural” or capital assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Other factors</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The
Judge also considered certain findings made by an earlier Board and
the earlier tax treatment of certain shares sold by the Respondent
of the same counters. These factors were rightly found to be unpersuasive
or at most neutral by the Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The insurance fund</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     For
the reasons set out above (at [43]–[49]), the statutorily mandated insurance
funds and solvency requirements are not determinative of whether
an investment is a capital asset for the purposes of income tax. Insurance
companies (whether holding assets in the insurance fund or shareholders’
fund) can and should only be taxed according to the ordinary principles
of revenue law. Whilst the holding of an asset in a particular fund can
be a relevant factor in ascertaining whether the investment is <em>intended</em> to be held as a capital asset,
the Judge (and the Board) had found (and the Appellant does not
dispute) that the Shares were held pursuant to the Respondent’s
corporate preservation strategy. In these premises, the relevant
regulatory framework is insufficient to offset the very strong inference
that the Shares were intended to be (and were in fact) held as capital
assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In
conclusion, all factors indicated that the Shares were acquired
and held to safeguard the long-term strategic interests of the [C]
Group and, indeed, the Shares were eventually realised pursuant
to the takeover of [C]. At that point, there was no longer any reason
for the Respondent to retain the Shares. For the above reasons,
we were satisfied on the totality of the evidence that the Board
was well entitled to find that the Shares were in fact capital assets,
the gains attributable to which were not taxable under the ITA.
It follows that the Judge did not err in affirming the determination
of the Board. We therefore dismiss the appeal with costs and the
usual consequential orders.</p>
