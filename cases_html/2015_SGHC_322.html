<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The three applicant companies applied for and
                    were granted interim stay of proceedings under s 210(10) of the Companies Act
                    (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Companies Act”) for 10 weeks or until
                    earlier discharged, ahead of any application for the calling of a
                    creditors’ meeting under s 210(1). A Malaysian decision, <em>Re Kuala Lumpur Industries Bhd</em> [1990] 2 MLJ 180
                        (“<em>Re KL Industries</em>”) is
                    authority that this can be done. Apparently, although similar orders have been
                    made in Singapore (see for instance the commentary in <em>Woon’s Corporations Law</em> (LexisNexis, Looseleaf Ed, 2005,
                    July 2012 Release) (“<em>Woon’s Corporations
                        Law</em>”) at para L [152]), the matter has not been addressed
                    in written grounds. As the commercial discussions were still being pursued, the
                    commercially sensitive details have been omitted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Brief Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The three applicant companies, Shefford
                    Investments Holding Limited, UVM Investment Corporation, and Conchubar Aromatics
                    Limited, were shareholders in Jurong Aromatics Corporation Pte Ltd
                    (‘JAC”). These shareholdings, as well as shareholdings in SK
                    E&amp;C Jurong Investment Pte Ltd, were the primary assets of the
                    applicants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       JAC ran into difficulties, eventually being put
                    into receivership in September 2015. The Applicants themselves were similarly in
                    some difficulty. While JAC and the Applicants faced difficulties, the Applicants
                    hoped that a restructuring proposal would rehabilitate their
                position.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       As matters were still being negotiated and
                    discussed among various parties, a moratorium was necessary to protect the
                    Applicants’ ability to continue their efforts at restructuring. The
                    Applicants argued that a restraint order under s 210(10) of the Companies Act
                    could be granted independent of the calling of a meeting under 210(1), citing
                        <em>Re KL Industries</em>. It is authority for the
                    proposition that a restraint order may be issued if there is a proposal which
                    gives more than a general layout of the scheme and the applicant was acting
                        <em>bona fide</em>. The fact that the applicants were
                    foreign companies would not obstruct the granting of a moratorium, as there was
                    sufficient nexus to Singapore such that these companies were liable to be wound
                    up under the Act: Re <em>TPC Korea Co Ltd</em> [2010] 2 SLR
                    617 (“<em>Re TPC</em>”) at
                [12].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In the present case the restructuring proposal
                    put forward to the Court was sufficiently particularised to merit due
                    consideration by the creditors. The restructuring would confer some benefit to
                    the Applicants' creditors, who would otherwise obtain nothing. <em>Bona fides</em> was shown by the fact that the restraint was
                    to be operative for as short a period as possible to allow discussions to be
                    finalised as to the proposal and the s 210(1) application to be filed and heard.
                    No prejudice would occur to the Applicants' creditors if the order was
                    granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       A creditor, SK Engineering &amp; Construction
                    Co, Ltd appeared, but did not contest the application for the moratorium at this
                    time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       I granted a restraint order in respect of each
                    of the three applications, operative for 10 weeks, unless discharged earlier,
                    with a status conference fixed for an update on the situation. Further status
                    conferences will be ordered as needed. I was satisfied that a restraint order
                    could be granted under s 210(10) even if no application had yet been made
                    under s 210(1), provided that there was a proposal sufficiently detailed as to
                    indicate there was something definitive that could be put to the creditors
                    shortly, and the application was made <em>bona
                    fides</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The ambit of s 210(10)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Section 210(10) of the Companies Act
                    reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Power of Court to restrain
                        proceedings</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(10) Where no order has been made or resolution passed for the winding up
                        of a company and any such compromise or arrangement has been proposed
                        between the company and its creditors or any class of such creditors, the
                        Court may, in addition to any of its powers, on the application in a summary
                        way of the company or of any member or creditor of the company restrain
                        further proceedings in any action or proceeding against the company except
                        by leave of the Court and subject to such terms as the Court imposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The provision, in so far as the present circumstances apply,
                        thus permits, the Court to order the restraining of further proceedings,
                        if:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_i"></a>(i)     There has
                        been no order or resolution for the winding up of the company;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     An arrangement
                        has been proposed between the company and its creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Section 210(10) does not expressly require that there be any
                        application under s 210(1) – it only refers to the proposal of an
                        arrangement, not its actual presentation at a meeting of creditors or
                        approval by that meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Section 210(1) itself distinguishes the proposal
                    of a compromise or arrangement from the convening of a meeting:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where a compromise or arrangement is proposed between a company and its
                        creditors or any class of them or between the company and its members or any
                        class of them, the Court may, on the application in a summary way of the
                        company or of any creditor or member of the company, or, in the case of a
                        company being wound up, of the liquidator, order a meeting of the creditors
                        or class of creditors or of the members of the company or class of members
                        to be summoned in such manner as the Court directs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>There is nothing in the language of s 210(1) and s 210(10)
                        which indicates that s 210(10) is to be dependent or contingent on
                        s 210(1). What each does require is that there be a proposal of a
                        compromise or arrangement only.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Therefore, while there does not appear to be
                    anything in our Parliamentary Debates or committee reports that would shed light
                    on how the provisions are to be interpreted, the plain words of the provision
                    contemplate an application for a restraint order being made independent of an
                    application under s 210(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The conclusion reached here is thus the same
                    as that in <em>Re KL Industries</em>, which interpreted ss
                    176(1) and 176(10) of the Companies Act 1965 (No 79 of 1965) (M’sia),
                    provisions <em>in pari materia</em> with ss 210(1) and
                    210(10) of the Companies Act respectively. In that case, it was argued by a
                    creditor of a group of companies that had obtained a s 176(10) order that
                    the court had no jurisdiction to do unless a s 176(1) application had been
                    made. VC George J concluded that applications under the two subsections could be
                    made independent of each other. What was required, following <em>Re GAE Pty Ltd</em> [1962] VR 252 (“<em>Re
                        GAE</em>”), was that the particulars of the scheme gave more
                    than a general layout, so that the court would be able to determine if the
                    scheme was feasible, and that the intention to invoke the section was <em>bona fide</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Particularity of the proposal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     It is only necessary that the proposal is
                    detailed enough to allow the Court to consider its feasibility. As noted in
                        <em>Re GAE</em>, completeness is not required. It is to
                    be expected that refinements and modifications will be needed before any meeting
                    is sought. Further, I did not think that feasibility had to be decided
                    conclusively: close scrutiny of the merits of the proposal or its viability and
                    likely acceptance by the creditors should not be carried out at this stage. The
                    Court would otherwise need to place itself in the shoes of different creditors
                    with different exposures, commercial motivations and appetites for risks.
                    Instead, what the Court needed to assess was whether on the face of the proposal
                    the Court could conclude that there was a reasonable prospect of the scheme
                    working and being acceptable to the general run of creditors. So long as the
                    court could make this broad brush assessment, sufficient particularity would
                    have been given.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     I was satisfied that the proposal put forward
                    by the Applicants was sufficiently detailed and particularised, showing how
                    greater benefit could potentially be derived by the creditors than if the
                    Applicants were to be wound up. On the surface of things, the proposal appeared
                    viable. For these reasons, it would seem that the proposal had a reasonable
                    prospect of working and benefiting the creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Bona fide proposal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The court should be careful to ensure that
                    there is no attempt to game the system by companies seeking the benefit of s
                    210(10) restraint orders without putting forward a serious proposal. The need to
                    ensure <em>bona fides</em> was clearly laid out in
                        <em>Re KL Industries</em>. <em>Bona
                        fides</em> is not mentioned in s 210(10), but ensuring it is an
                    integral part of the court’s inherent jurisdiction to prevent abuses of
                    its processes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     It should also be clear that an application
                    under s 210(1) should be made shortly thereafter and if not, a sufficient
                    explanation and proposed timelines should be given. Here, the Applicants
                    committed to a 10 week timeline, and volunteered to appear in court on a regular
                    basis to provide updates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In the present case, there was nothing that
                    would indicate that the proposal was not <em>bona
                    fide</em>. The particularisation has been examined above. Sufficient
                    particularisation is relevant to the assessment of <em>bona
                        fides</em>, as it shows that there is serious intent and thought.
                    There was nothing either that indicated that the proposal was so bad that it
                    would likely be rejected outright.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application to foreign companies</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     I accepted the arguments by the Applicants
                    that the protection of s 210(10) of the Companies Act and indeed, the whole
                    of s 210, could be obtained by companies incorporated overseas. Section 210(11)
                    defines the term ‘company’ in s 210 to mean ‘any corporation
                    or society liable to be wound up under this Act’. In <em>Re
                        TPC</em>, Philip Pillai JC accepted that a s 210(10) restraining
                    order is available to foreign companies, as a foreign company could be wound up
                    in Singapore if its assets are in Singapore or there is sufficient connection. I
                    agree with that analysis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Miscellaneous issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     While this was not raised specifically in the
                    present case, I note that there is commentary in <em>Woon’s
                        Corporations Law</em> referring to <em>Re Reid Murray
                        Acceptance Ltd</em> [1964] VR 82 that an application should not be
                    made <em>ex parte</em> but <em>inter
                        partes</em> in a pending action. It would seem that this is premised
                    on fairness to persons affected by a restraint order, as they would otherwise
                    need to take the initiative and expense to set aside an <em>ex
                        parte</em> restraint order. With respect, there is no requirement of
                    that nature specified by the statute. It may be that the best forum to hear a
                    restraint order may be the one hearing an on-going proceeding, but in other
                    situations, especially when there are many creditors and proceedings or
                    potential creditors and potential proceedings, an <em>ex
                        parte</em> application followed by appropriate setting aside hearings
                    before a single judge also exercising case management functions may be the best
                    way to deal with a complex situation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The need for proper case management would also
                    be a matter that would influence the Court’s determination of whether
                    there are terms that should be further imposed. The issue did not arise in the
                    present case as the Applicants volunteered a specified timeline and to appear in
                    court for status updates. In appropriate situations the Court may possibly take
                    proactive measures for better case management and coordination, either under
                    s 210(10) or any of the other possible orders under s 210(1) or
                    s 210(3) read with s 210(4).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Orders made</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In the circumstances of this case, the
                    restraint order was granted for 10 weeks, unless discharged earlier. By the end
                    of the 10 weeks, an application under s 210(1) for a meeting of creditors should
                    have been made. A status conference has been ordered, which may be followed by
                    other status conferences as necessary.</p>
