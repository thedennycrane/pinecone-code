The respective vessel owners commenced and engaged in proceedings in the Qingdao Maritime Court (“QMC”) in relation to the Collision. Among others, the owner of the “Sea Justice” constituted a limitation fund for maritime claims and the owner of the “A Symphony” registered claims against that limitation fund. Both parties also commenced liability actions against each other.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Separately, the owner of the “A Symphony” commenced (<span class="font-italic">qua </span>plaintiff) HC/ADM 61/2021 (“ADM 61”) in Singapore as an admiralty action <span class="font-italic">in rem </span>against the “Sea Justice”. More than a year after the Collision, the “Sea Justice” sailed into Singapore waters and was arrested on the plaintiff’s application. The (by now former) owner of the “Sea Justice” entered an appearance (<span class="font-italic">qua </span>defendant) in ADM 61 and provided security for the release of the “Sea Justice”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The plaintiff’s claim against the defendant in ADM 61 is for damages and indemnification from loss arising from the Collision. The defendant applied by HC/SUM 4434/2022 (“SUM 4434”) for, among others: (a) ADM 61 to be stayed in favour of the court proceedings in the PRC on the grounds of <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span>; (b) the security it had provided in the Singapore action to be returned; and (c) the arrest of the “Sea Justice” to be set aside. The learned Assistant Registrar (“AR”) who heard SUM 4434 ordered the <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> stay and return of security but declined to set aside the arrest. The AR’s grounds of decision are set out in <span class="font-italic">The “Sea Justice”</span> [2023] SGHCR 24. Parties filed cross-appeals against the AR’s decision. These are now before me.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 HC/RA 246/2023 (“RA 246”) is the plaintiff’s appeal against the AR’s order that the security provided by the defendant for the release of the “Sea Justice” be returned. The plaintiff <span class="font-italic">accepts </span>and has <span class="font-italic">not </span>appealed the AR’s decision that the Singapore proceedings should be stayed in favour of the QMC as the more appropriate forum for the plaintiff’s claims to be tried. The plaintiff has also made a considered decision <span class="font-italic">not</span> to ask that the <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens </span>stay be imposed on the condition that the defendant provides alternative / equivalent security for the plaintiff’s QMC action. Instead, the plaintiff wants to retain the security provided for ADM 61. The issue arising is thus whether the plaintiff should be permitted to retain the security provided for ADM 61 notwithstanding the <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> stay of the Singapore action, the defendant’s constitution of a limitation fund in the PRC, and the plaintiff’s participation in ongoing limitation and liability proceedings in the PRC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In RA 246, the plaintiff also appeals against the AR’s order that the plaintiff pay the defendant disbursements of S$88,786.53 towards the fees of the defendant’s Chinese law expert in SUM 4434. The plaintiff contends that this figure should be further discounted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 HC/RA 247/2023 (“RA 247”) is the defendant’s appeal against the AR’s decision not to set aside the arrest of the “Sea Justice”. The defendant maintains that the arrest should be set aside because the plaintiff failed to make full and frank disclosure of material facts in its application for a warrant of arrest.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The plaintiff is Symphony Shipholding SA, a company incorporated in Liberia (“Plaintiff”). The Plaintiff was at all material times the registered owner of the “A Symphony”. The defendant is Sea Justice Ltd, a company incorporated in the Marshall Islands (“Defendant”). The Defendant was at all material times the registered owner of the “Sea Justice”.

</div> He held that whether the Plaintiff had reserved its rights when it registered its claim against the SJ Limitation Fund was relevant. A reservation of rights signalled that the Plaintiff was intent to proceed with the Singapore and not QMC action. The fact that the Plaintiff had participated in the Chinese proceedings without any express reservation or objection to the QMC’s jurisdiction was inconsistent with what the Plaintiff told the Duty Registrar in the Arrest Application. However, the AR noted the opinion of the Plaintiff’s Chinese law expert, Prof Chu Beiping (“Prof Chu”), that the Plaintiff could still challenge the QMC’s jurisdiction by making a “procedural defence”. The AR found that the lack of the Additional Words (see [30(b)] above) in the actual Chinese reservation of rights clause was thus not material to the grant of the Warrant of Arrest.

The parties had adduced Chinese law expert evidence for the <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens </span>stay application, on which the Defendant succeeded. Prof Zhao’s bill was for S$110,983.17. The AR went through the entries in his bill and found his fees to be reasonable and reasonably incurred. However, a reduction of Prof Zhao’s fees was in order. Prof Zhao had rendered five reports. His first report and part of his second report related to the issue of submission to jurisdiction of the Chinese courts. They accounted for the bulk of his costs. His third, fourth and fifth reports were on other issues. The AR found Prof Zhao’s opinion on the issue of submission to jurisdiction difficult to follow as it was diametrically opposite to the opinion Prof Zhao had rendered in another case. The first and second reports were thus of limited value. This did not mean that all of Prof Zhao’s work in rendering his opinion on the issue of submission to jurisdiction should be negated. However, his fees should be reduced on account of the limited value derived from his opinion on this issue. A 20% reduction on his fees, to S$88,786.53, was appropriate.

</div> To recapitulate, the Plaintiff has made oil pollution indemnity claims against the Defendant in the Plaintiff’s Inter-Ship Claim before the QMC. The Plaintiff says it is “unclear” under Chinese law whether its oil pollution indemnity claims would be compensated out of the SJ Limitation Fund (see [54] above). In other words, and consistent with how the Plaintiff’s counsel candidly put it, the Plaintiff wants to retain the SG Security to satisfy any judgment it might obtain from the QMC on its oil pollution indemnity claims. In truth, this intention extends to the Plaintiff seeking to retain the SG Security to satisfy <span class="font-italic">any</span> judgment the Plaintiff might obtain on <span class="font-italic">a</span><span class="font-italic">ll </span>of its claims in the Chinese proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 However, in an admiralty action <span class="font-italic">in rem</span>, the Singapore court should not order the arrest of a vessel, retention of that arrested vessel, or retention of security furnished for the release of that vessel, for the purpose of securing a foreign judgment or award: <span class="font-italic">The “ICL Raja Mahendra” </span>[1998] 2 SLR(R) 922 at [22]; <span class="font-italic">Eurohope</span> at [25] and [28]–[29]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In <span class="font-italic">Eurohope</span>, the plaintiff had already commenced an admiralty action in London for the defendant’s wrongful termination of a charterparty, when the plaintiff arrested the defendant’s vessel “Eurohope” in Singapore. The defendant furnished security for the release of the “Eurohope”. The plaintiff admitted that it had no intention of proceeding with the Singapore action and that the sole purpose of applying for the warrant of arrest was to obtain security in aid of the London proceedings. The plaintiff applied to stay the Singapore proceedings and for the security furnished by the defendant to remain in force pending final determination of the London proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The court held that the power of arrest in an action <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> should not be exercised in aid of legal proceedings in a foreign court. The purpose of the arrest in an action <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> is to provide security in respect of the action <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> (at [25]). Section 7(1) of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”), which empowered the Singapore courts on ordering a stay of proceedings in favour of arbitration to also order that property arrested be retained as security for the satisfaction of any arbitration award, was the product of legislative intervention (at [27]). In contrast, there is no statutory provision that empowers the Singapore courts to order that property arrested be retained for the satisfaction of a judgment given in foreign court proceedings. This differs from the position in the UK, where the court has the power to do so under s 26(1) of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 (c 27) (UK) (“CJJA”) (at [28]). Section 26(1) of the CJJA provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">26.–(1) Where in England and Wales or Northern Ireland a court stays or dismisses Admiralty proceedings on the ground that the dispute in question should be submitted to the determination of the courts of another part of the United Kingdom or of an overseas country, the court may, if in those proceedings property has been arrested or bail or other security has been given to prevent or obtain release from arrest – </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) order that the property arrested be retained as security for the satisfaction of any award or judgment which – </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) is given in respect of the dispute in the legal proceedings in favour of which those proceedings are stayed or dismissed; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) is enforceable in England and Wales or, as the case may be, in Northern Ireland; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) order that the stay or dismissal of those proceedings be conditional on the provision of equivalent security for the satisfaction of any such award or judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The court concluded that legislative intervention in Singapore would be required if the courts were to be given powers to order that property arrested in an action <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> in Singapore be retained as security for the satisfaction of a judgment given in legal proceedings in a foreign court (at [29]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Applying the above legal principles, the Plaintiff should not be permitted to retain the SG Security for the purpose of satisfying any judgment it might obtain in the Chinese proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Contrary to international comity to retain the SG Security</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The Plaintiff obviously recognised that the SG Security should only be applied to secure a Singapore judgment in the Singapore action. In a veiled attempt to skirt the restriction in <span class="font-italic">Eurohope</span>, the Plaintiff thus argued for a Limited Stay of the Singapore action with attendant retention of the SG Security. In my judgment, however, it would be contrary to international comity to allow the Limited Stay with retention of the SG Security.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 When considering whether to stay a Singapore action in favour of a more appropriate jurisdiction, the Singapore courts’ approach is not to treat any higher limit of liability available under Singapore’s limitation regime (as compared to that in the other jurisdiction in question) as a juridical advantage to the plaintiff in having his claim tried in Singapore. Comity in not regarding Singapore’s limitation laws as superior to those of another jurisdiction underlies this approach (see <span class="font-italic">Reecon Wolf</span> at [37] and [54]–[55]). The Plaintiff strenuously argued that while these considerations apply in the <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> analysis, they are no longer relevant and should not be “conflated” with the issue of whether security should be retained after the stay has been granted.

</div> I agree with the Defendant that in these circumstances, retaining the SG Security would be tantamount to an implicit finding that the Chinese limitation regime is less adequate than that of Singapore.

</div> The Plaintiff’s reliance on this <span class="font-italic">dicta</span>, which is misplaced, exposes that the Limited Stay sought by the Plaintiff is, in fact, premised (impermissibly under Singapore legal principles) on treating the higher limit in Singapore as a juridical advantage to the Plaintiff in having its claims tried here. I elaborate. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) <span class="font-italic">Chou Shan</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 <span class="font-italic">Chou Shan </span>is the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia (“Full Court”) concerning an appeal against the primary judge’s decision to stay an <span class="font-italic">in rem </span>proceeding. A collision occurred between the ships “Chou Shan” and “CMA CGM Florida” off the coast of China. The owners of the “Chou Shan” successfully applied to the Ningbo Maritime Court to set up a limitation fund. The owner and operator of the “CMA CGM Florida”, having filed a writ <span class="font-italic">in rem </span>against the “Chou Shan” in the Federal Court of Australia (“FCA”), caused the “Chou Shan” to be arrested in Australia. The “Chou Shan” was released on her owners’ provision of security for the plaintiffs’ claims. The “Chou Shan” and her owners then applied to stay the Australian proceedings on the grounds, among others, that Australia was a clearly inappropriate forum for the hearing and determination of the plaintiffs’ claims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The primary judge granted the stay sought. He took into account the fact that the plaintiffs had the benefit of increased security in the proceeding <span class="font-italic">in rem </span>in the FCA. This benefit arose because the limitation amounts in Australia, a signatory to both the 1976 Convention and the 1996 Protocol, were higher than those in China, where the limitation regime was in substance based on the 1976 Convention (at [9]). However, the primary judge did not consider the benefit of increased security sufficient to undermine his conclusion that the FCA was a clearly inappropriate forum, having regard to other factors such as that the natural and obvious forum for all disputes relating to the collision was China (at [35], citing from the primary judge’s judgment at [158]–[160]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The Full Court dismissed the plaintiffs’ appeal against the primary judge’s decision. The Full Court agreed that the Australian limitation regime would be considered a legitimate advantage of a plaintiff in an Australian action. It found that the primary judge did not unduly discount the weight of this juridical advantage to the plaintiffs and thus upheld his decision to stay the Australian proceedings (at [82]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 However, the Full Court appeared to suggest, in <span class="font-italic">dicta </span>(at [36]), that the plaintiffs could have argued before the primary judge for the Australian claim to proceed “and be finalised, by access to the Australian security or limitation fund” after the Ningbo Maritime Court had made its findings:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Before turning to the substance of the application, it is important to recognise that the argument placed before the primary judge involved the proposition that the plaintiffs proposed to run the claims in this Court. That involved, necessarily, the spectre of parallel proceedings, in this Court and in the Ningbo Maritime Court. Hence, the primary judge placed some importance on the potentiality of inconsistent findings. No argument was run before him, and the position was not taken below, by the plaintiffs, that two parallel and competing proceedings should be avoided by <span class="font-italic">managing the Federal Court action to await the findings by the Ningbo Maritime Court, and when those issues litigated between the parties were resolved, the Federal Court claim could proceed, and be finalised, by access to the Australian security or limitation fund</span>. In other words, the case was not put to the primary judge that sought to avoid or ameliorate the vexation of two factual hearings and the potential for inconsistent findings, but to emphasise the retention of the significant juridical advantage given to the plaintiffs by the security put up by the P&amp;I club for the maritime lien or the value of a limitation fund, if set up, in an amount under the 1976 Convention and the 1996 Protocol under Australian law. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Later in the judgment, the Full Court again commented that a possible approach could have been to manage and stage the proceedings “to vindicate rights under Australian law” without the risk of inconsistent findings, but whether or not that approach was still open (in view of the <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> stay granted by the primary judge) need not be discussed (at [83]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In a legal environment governed by <span class="font-italic">Voth</span> where a plaintiff had a legitimate advantage in an Australian limitation of liability regime in the enforcement of a maritime lien, in circumstances where the risk of inconsistent findings in parallel proceedings could be eliminated, or at least significantly ameliorated, it might be difficult to conclude that the Federal Court was a clearly inappropriate forum.<span class="font-italic"> In this context, the managed and staged approach in the Caltex case may well be a mechanism to vindicate rights under Australian law</span> without engaging the risk of the vexation of inconsistent finding that may be unnecessary. <span class="font-italic">Whether or not that approach is still open in this matter need not be discussed</span>.

I discuss this judgment in greater detail at [82]–[83] below. At this juncture, it suffices to note that the Full Court suggested the approach taken in <span class="font-italic">Caltex</span> in <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> (at [83]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The Plaintiff submitted that such an approach is similar to and embraces the Limited Stay and retention of the SG Security sought by the Plaintiff.

</div> What the Plaintiff ignored, however, is that a decision by the Australian courts to decline a stay, or grant a limited stay, of a local action because of the higher limit in Australia does not undermine international comity. This is because Australia’s formulation of the test for <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> is different from that of Singapore. Thus, what may legitimately be considered under Australian law is not necessarily an approach the Singapore courts would take.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The test for <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens </span>in Australia is whether the Australian court is a clearly inappropriate forum (<span class="font-italic">Chou Shan </span>at [46]). When the Australian court declines a stay, or grants a limited stay, of the local action because of the higher limit of liability available to the plaintiff in Australia, the conclusion made by the court is that <span class="font-italic">Australia</span><span class="font-italic"> is not a clearly inappropriate forum</span>. The Full Court in <span class="font-italic">Chou Shan </span>specifically acknowledged that the Australian <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens </span>test is not focused on whether justice can be achieved in a foreign court (at [58]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">One other consequence of the clearly inappropriate forum test’s focus upon the local court is the avoidance of what might be the difficulty or inappropriateness of deciding whether a plaintiff will obtain justice in a foreign court…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Because the Australian court is only pronouncing on the appropriateness of its local forum, there is no concern that international comity will be undermined by recognising the higher limit in Australia as a legitimate juridical advantage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In contrast, the Singapore and English test for <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens </span>is the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>test, which concerns the staying of proceedings on the basis of the existence of a more appropriate forum (<span class="font-italic">Chou Shan </span>at [48]). Where there is a foreign forum that is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore under the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>test, the inquiry at the second stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>test is whether the plaintiff can show that it will not obtain substantial justice in the foreign forum. Consequently, when the Singapore court declines a stay, or grants a limited stay, of the local action because of the higher limit of liability available to the plaintiff in Singapore, the conclusion made by the court is that <span class="font-italic">the plaintiff will be denied substantial justice in the foreign forum with </span><span class="font-italic">a lower limit</span>. Recognising the higher limit in Singapore as a legitimate juridical advantage is thus at odds with international comity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In fact, the Full Court in <span class="font-italic">Chou Shan</span> explained that the difference between the Australian and English <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens </span>tests is “of critical importance to the place of the juridical advantage to the plaintiffs in the local proceeding” (at [47]). The requirement in the Australian test to focus on the local chosen forum and its asserted inappropriateness means that juridical advantage in the local forum must play a greater part in the analysis than it does under the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test (at [77]). The plaintiff’s juridical advantage is assessed with other factors to determine whether the local forum is a clearly inappropriate forum, and the juridical advantage is not to be “compared in terms of abstract justices with the laws of the foreign forum” (at [81]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The Plaintiff’s reliance on the <span class="font-italic">dicta </span>in <span class="font-italic">Chou Shan </span>as support for the Limited Stay is thus misplaced. The <span class="font-italic">dicta </span>of the Full Court must be viewed in light of the Australian <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens </span>test and the corollary that international comity is not undermined when the Australian courts decline a stay, or grant a limited stay, of a local action on the basis that the higher limit in Australia is a legitimate juridical advantage.       </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) <span class="font-italic">Caltex</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 I turn next to the approach in the English decision of <span class="font-italic">Caltex</span>, which was cited by the Full Court in <span class="font-italic">Chou Shan</span>. <span class="font-italic">Caltex</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>concerned an allision in Singapore between BP Shipping Ltd.’s (“BP”) vessel and a jetty owned, used and administered by Caltex companies. BP set up a limitation fund in Singapore that was based on the 1957 Convention then applied in Singapore. The Caltex companies sued in England where the 1976 Convention (with higher limits) applied. BP sought to stay the actions by the Caltex companies in England. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Clarke J (as he then was) accepted that Singapore was the natural and appropriate forum for the trial of the action. However, he was of the view that English public policy favoured applying the 1976 Convention and that depriving Caltex of the higher limit would be depriving them of a “legitimate juridical advantage” (at 299). He concluded that the most appropriate solution (if either party were to seek it and it were possible in Singapore) would be to stay the English action temporarily in order to enable the issues of quantum to be determined in Singapore, leaving the question whether there should be a final stay in England to be determined thereafter (at 300). Clarke J’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Caltex</span> was, however, overruled by the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">“Herceg Novi” and “Ming Galaxy” </span>[1998] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 454<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Herceg Novi (CA)</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) <span class="font-italic">Herceg Novi (QBD)</span> and <span class="font-italic">Herceg Novi (CA)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 <span class="font-italic">Herceg Novi (CA) </span>was an appeal from Clarke J’s decision in <span class="font-italic">The “Herceg Novi” and “Ming Galaxy”</span> [1998] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 167 (“<span class="font-italic">Herceg Novi (QBD)</span>”).<span class="font-italic"> </span>The case concerned a collision between the ships “Herceg Novi” and “Ming Galaxy” in the Straits of Singapore. In Singapore, the owners of the “Ming Galaxy” began admiralty actions <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> and <span class="font-italic">in personam</span> against the “Herceg Novi” and her owners. In England, the owners of the “Herceg Novi” issued a writ in an admiralty action <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> against the “Ming Galaxy” and served the writ on a sister ship, the “Ming South”. The owners of the “Ming Galaxy” applied to stay the English action on the grounds of <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Clarke J, hearing the application in the first instance, reached a similar landing as he had in <span class="font-italic">Caltex</span>. He considered that Singapore was the more appropriate forum under the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>test but that a relevant consideration under the second stage was that the owners of the “Herceg Novi” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the plaintiffs in the English action) would be deprived of the benefit of the provisions of the 1976 Convention. This led him to hold that the English action should be “temporarily” stayed (<span class="font-italic">Herceg Novi (QBD)</span> at 180 and 181). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 On appeal, however, the English Court of Appeal allowed the appeal against Clarke J’s decision. The English Court of Appeal held that it was impossible to say that Singapore’s application of the 1957 Convention instead of the 1976 Convention meant that substantial justice was not available in Singapore. The English Court of Appeal thus ordered an <span class="font-italic">unconditional </span>stay of the English action (<span class="font-italic">Herceg Novi</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> at 460): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In our view it is quite impossible to say that substantial justice is not available in Singapore, seeing that there is a significant body of agreement among civilized nations with the law as it is there administered.

The limited stays contemplated in <span class="font-italic">Caltex </span>and <span class="font-italic">Herceg Novi (QBD)</span> were rejected.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The foregoing review of cases shows that the limited stay approach referenced in <span class="font-italic">Chou Shan</span>, <span class="font-italic">Caltex</span> and <span class="font-italic">Herceg Novi (QBD)</span> was premised on treating the availability of a higher limit of liability in the local forum as the plaintiff’s juridical advantage to be preserved. In <span class="font-italic">Chou Shan</span>, the Full Court considered that there was room for this perspective under the Australian<span class="font-italic"> </span>“clearly inappropriate forum” test for <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span>, but this is not the test that applies in Singapore. This perspective in <span class="font-italic">Caltex </span>and <span class="font-italic">Herceg Novi (QBD)</span> was rejected in <span class="font-italic">Herceg Novi (CA)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>on the ground of international comity. There is no basis for the Plaintiff to argue for a Limited Stay and attendant retention of the SG Security when the Singapore courts share the view in <span class="font-italic">Herceg Novi (CA)</span> that the availability of a higher limit of liability in a particular jurisdiction is not a legitimate consideration in determining where an action should proceed. This is evident from the Singapore decisions of <span class="font-italic">Reecon Wolf </span>and <span class="font-italic">Evergreen</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) <span class="font-italic">Reecon Wolf</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In <span class="font-italic">Reecon Wolf</span>, the plaintiff’s vessel and the defendant’s vessel “Reecon Wolf” collided in the Straits of Malacca. The defendant commenced an <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> action in Malaysia and the plaintiff commenced an <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> action in Singapore. The defendant applied for an order that the Singapore action be stayed in favour of Malaysia on <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> grounds. At that time, Singapore applied the 1976 Convention and Malaysia the 1957 Convention. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The court considered that the plaintiff’s suggestion that Singapore was the more appropriate forum was really based entirely on its desire to choose a forum with higher limits under the 1976 Convention (at [35]). Having regard to comity, the court roundly rejected the notion that the higher limit in Singapore was a legitimate consideration, holding (at [37], [54] and [55]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">37 With <span class="font-italic">judicial chauvinism firmly replaced by judicial comity</span>, the dichotomy of the limitation regimes that used to be fought out as a loss of juridical advantage is now gone.

In other words, the plaintiff’s claim would be subject to the lower 1957 limits of liability. <span class="font-italic">This line of argument would invariably draw this court to make comparisons between the merit of the statutory limits in Singapore and [Malaysia].

The plaintiff-owners of the “Ever Glory” commenced a limitation action in Singapore against all persons having potential claims arising out of the collision, including the defendants, who were the owners or insurers of the cargo carried on the “Hual Trinita”. The 1957 Convention applied in Singapore at the time. The limitation decree was granted and the plaintiffs paid the limitation fund sum into court. The defendants did not participate in the limitation proceedings. Instead, they arrested the “Ever Reach”, a sister ship of the “Ever Glory”, in Belgium and commenced an action in tort against the plaintiffs in Belgium as the Belgian courts would apply a higher limit based on the 1976 Convention. The plaintiffs furnished security for the release of the “Ever Reach” from arrest. The plaintiffs then applied in Singapore for an anti-suit injunction to restrain the defendants from continuing their action in Belgium. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The court granted the application and further ordered that the security provided for the release of the “Ever Reach” be returned to the plaintiffs (at [66]–[67]). The court accepted that admiralty jurisdiction in Belgium was properly founded and that the defendants had arrested the “Ever Reach” as of right (at [45] and [64]). Nevertheless, the Belgian proceedings were vexatious and oppressive to the plaintiffs because they constituted an unlawful challenge to the plaintiffs’ right to choose the limitation forum and an attack on the plaintiffs’ legal rights conferred by the Singapore limitation decree and limitation fund (at [46]–[47]). The court held that the advantage of a higher limit under the 1976 Convention, as contended for by the defendants, was not a legitimate consideration in the overall question of where the ends of justice lie (at [49]). The court rejected the defendants’ argument that they would suffer a legitimate juridical disadvantage if they had to make their claims in Singapore where the lower limit applied, citing with approval <span class="font-italic">Herceg Novi (CA)</span> among other decisions (at [58]–[63]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(6) Conclusion </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In view of international comity, the Singapore courts will not be drawn into any implicit pronouncement that the limitation of liability regime in Singapore is superior to that of another jurisdiction. This is regardless of whether that other jurisdiction applies a limitation regime based on an international limitation of liability convention or its own domestic system of limitation. As G Lam JA observed in <span class="font-italic">Pusan Newport Co Ltd v The Owners and/or Demise Charterers of the Ships or Vessels “Milano Bridge” and “CMA CGM Musca” and “CMA CGM Hydra” </span>[2022] HKCA 157 at [53], there is great diversity in the limitation regimes implemented across the world: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Whatever may be the merits of the international unification of limitation regimes, the fact is that there is a complex patchwork around the world consisting of, inter alia, 1976 Convention countries (with variations in terms of reservations), 1996 Protocol countries (of which some have denounced the 1976 Convention and some have not), and countries who have ratified neither, such as China (except for Hong Kong), United States, and, … Korea and Panama, and who may or may not have their own domestic systems of limitation. …  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It is not for the Singapore courts to adjudicate on the relative merits of different limitation regimes, be they domestic systems or based on international conventions, in comparison to Singapore’s limitation regime. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 In the context of determining whether to grant a <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> stay, comity manifests in the Singapore courts <span class="font-italic">not</span> treating the availability of a higher limit in Singapore as a legitimate juridical advantage to the plaintiff in having his claim tried in Singapore. By logical extension, comity mandates that the Singapore courts <span class="font-italic">not</span> grant a limited stay that expressly allows the plaintiff to later resume the Singapore action to avail of the higher limit (and any security provided up to that higher limit) here. Otherwise, the Singapore courts would be allowing through the back door what they have closed off at the front. Indeed, the limited stay approach in <span class="font-italic">Chou Shan</span>, <span class="font-italic">Caltex</span> and <span class="font-italic">Herceg Novi (QBD)</span> was predicated on precisely the converse consideration that the availability of a higher limit in the local forum is a legitimate juridical advantage to be preserved for the plaintiff. That is not the principle applied in Singapore. The (a) <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens </span>analysis; (b) assessment of the nature and extent of stay to impose; and (c) determination of whether to retain security provided for the local action upon the grant of a stay, are part of the same continuum of decision-making in a <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> stay application, to which the same considerations of comity apply. Allowing the Limited Stay and attendant retention of the SG Security sought by the Plaintiff would be contrary to comity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The Plaintiff argued that it is not against comity to order retention of the SG Security, and more startlingly, that it would be <span class="font-italic">contrary</span> to comity <span class="font-italic">not</span> to order retention of the SG Security, because Chinese laws and the QMC’s ASI Dismissal Ruling do not prohibit the Plaintiff from commencing proceedings outside of the PRC to obtain security for its claim in respect of the Collision.

</div>
</div> I am not persuaded by this argument. Comity concerns the posture of the Singapore courts. That <span class="font-italic">the Plaintiff</span> may not be constrained from suing outside the PRC (which the Defendant does not dispute) does not impact, much less negate, <span class="font-italic">the </span><span class="font-italic">Singapore courts’</span> considerations of comity set out in [92]–[93] above. Further, taken to its logical conclusion, the Plaintiff’s argument would mean that the court breached comity when the AR ordered the <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> stay of the Singapore action (since, on the Plaintiff’s logic, it was not prohibited under Chinese laws or the QMC’s ASI Dismissal Ruling from commencing ADM 61). This would be an absurd position for the Plaintiff to take, and it is telling that the Plaintiff has not challenged the grant of the <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> stay on this ground (or at all). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 I also take the view that the Plaintiff placed undue weight on the QMC’s ASI Dismissal Ruling. I share the AR’s observations that the QMC had only ruled that (a) the Plaintiff’s claim in the Marshall Islands did not violate Chinese laws; and (b) there was no evidence that the Plaintiff’s behaviour, at the time when the Defendant’s Chinese ASI Application was made, made it difficult to enforce a judgment of the Chinese court. The QMC gave no reasons for rejecting the Defendant’s Chinese ASI Application in respect of proceedings in other countries

A <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> stay and a “case management stay” (as the Plaintiff terms the Limited Stay sought) are not the same thing. A <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> stay is granted in recognition that there is a more appropriate jurisdiction than Singapore for the trial of the same<span class="font-italic"> </span>claims; barring exceptional circumstances, it is envisaged that the Singapore action stayed on <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens </span>grounds will not continue. A case management stay, as its name indicates, involves the court staying proceedings for case management purposes; such a stay may be imposed on a temporary basis in view of other proceedings that are not entirely the same as those before the court imposing the stay (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Chan Chin Cheung v Chan Fatt Cheung and others </span>[2010] 1 SLR 1192 at [41]–[47]). In <span class="font-italic">Chou Shan</span>, having upheld the <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens </span>stay granted by the primary judge, the Full Court indicated that whether or not the limited stay approach was “still open” “need not be discussed” (at [83]). In the present case, the Plaintiff did not explain how it can seek a Limited Stay without appealing the <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> stay order and I remain to be convinced that it can do so. Even assuming, however, that it is procedurally open to the Plaintiff to seek the Limited Stay, I would not grant such a stay for the above-mentioned reasons. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Incongruent to retain the SG Security under a forum non conveniens stay</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Perhaps recognising that it is bound by the <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens </span>stay, the Plaintiff then raised a new argument in its latest written submissions that the “<span class="font-italic">Rena K </span>principle” applied to permit retention of the SG Security notwithstanding the <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens </span>stay.

Putting it shortly,<span class="font-italic"> if there is a stay, there must, as a necessary consequence, be a release</span>. … [emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 He observed that in cases where the grant of a stay is discretionary, the court can subject the grant of the stay to a condition that alternative security be provided (<span class="font-italic">Golden Trader </span>at 26G–H):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In cases where the grant of a stay is discretionary, the court can refuse a stay unless alternative security is provided. The defendant then has to choose between having a stay subject to a term for the provision of such security and not having a stay at all. If he chooses the former, then, subject to his complying with the term, he gets both a stay and release; if he chooses the latter, he gets neither. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 He held, however, that in the case at hand involving the grant of a mandatory stay of the <span class="font-italic">in rem </span>action in favour of arbitration, to which no conditions could be attached under the applicable English arbitration legislation at the time, the order for the stay and the consequent order for the release of the arrested vessel or security must be unconditional (<span class="font-italic">Golden Trader</span> at 26H).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 In the subsequent case of <span class="font-italic">Rena K</span>, Brandon J was again confronted by a mandatory stay of the <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> action in favour of arbitration and it was in this case that the “<span class="font-italic">Rena K</span> principle” was developed. In <span class="font-italic">Rena K</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>cargo owners commenced an action <span class="font-italic">in rem </span>against the vessel “Rena K” and <span class="font-italic">in personam </span>against her owners, claiming for cargo damage during the shipment voyage. The plaintiffs subsequently arrested the “Rena K” in Liverpool. The vessel was released on the defendants’ provision of security. The defendants then applied for a stay of proceedings in favour of arbitration. The dispute fell within a non-domestic arbitration agreement, and under the applicable English arbitration legislation at the time, the court had to grant a mandatory stay of court proceedings and the stay could not be made conditional on the provision of security (at 400). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 This being prior to the enactment of s 26(1) of the CJJA (see [66] above), Brandon J observed (as he similarly had in <span class="font-italic">Golden Trader</span>) that, as a general principle, “without some statutory authority which does not unfortunately at present exist … the court has no jurisdiction to use the retention method, that is to say to retain security not for the purpose of satisfying a judgment or settlement in the action in which the security has been given, but to satisfy the judgment or award of another tribunal” (at 402).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 He noted, however, that in cases where the grant of a stay was discretionary (for example, cases where the parties had agreed to submit the dispute to the jurisdiction of a foreign court), the English courts had gotten round the unavailability of the retention method by releasing the security subject to a term that the defendant provide alternative security outside the court to satisfy the judgment or award of the other tribunal (at 398 and 401). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Addressing the mandatory stay situation, he drew a distinction between (a) the attachment of a condition to the release of the vessel, which was permitted (at 404); and (b) the attachment of a condition to the order for a stay of the action, which was not permitted for mandatory stays (at 400). He further considered the principle that a cause of action <span class="font-italic">in rem </span>does not merge in a judgment <span class="font-italic">in personam </span>but remains available to the person who has it so long as, and to the extent that, such judgment remains unsatisfied (at 405). On that basis, if an arbitration award were made against the defendants and they were unable to satisfy it, the plaintiffs could have the stay of the action removed and proceed to a judgment <span class="font-italic">in rem </span>in the action (at 406). In a situation where it could be shown that the defendants would be unable to satisfy the award and the stay might well not be final, the court could exercise its discretion to retain the arrested vessel or to release her subject to a term for the provision of alternative security (at 406). This holding came to be referred to as the “<span class="font-italic">Rena K </span>principle”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In my judgment, it is not appropriate to apply the “<span class="font-italic">Rena K</span> principle” in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 First, the Plaintiff’s argument that any Chinese judgment it obtains will not be fully satisfied and the <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens </span>stay will thus be lifted for the Plaintiff to pursue a Singapore judgment to be satisfied against the SG Security, is, in substance, no different from the Plaintiff’s argument that a Limited Stay should be ordered for the Plaintiff to pursue the exact same course for the exact same purported reason. The Plaintiff runs up against the same difficulty that it is contrary to comity to entertain the premises of the Plaintiff’s arguments. <span class="font-italic">Rena K</span> was a case concerning a stay of court proceedings in favour of arbitration where, unlike the present case, no issue of different limitation regimes in competing fora presented. <span class="font-italic">Rena K</span> does not address the approach to be taken when a plaintiff’s argument is, in essence, that it should be allowed to pursue the stayed action because of a higher limit of liability in the local forum. In contrast, the Singapore courts’ position is to reject such an argument (see [69] and [88]–[93] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Second, the “<span class="font-italic">Rena K</span> principle” was developed to meet the needs of cases concerning mandatory stays in favour of arbitration where no conditions could be attached to the stay. In contrast, a <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> stay is discretionary and the court may impose as a condition of the stay an <span class="font-italic">in personam</span> requirement for the defendant to provide alternative / equivalent security for the foreign proceedings (<span class="font-italic">Reecon Wolf</span> at [20] and [59(a)]; <span class="font-italic">Golden Trader </span>at 26G–H). This option obviates the need to resort to the “<span class="font-italic">Rena K</span> principle” and respects the restriction in <span class="font-italic">Eurohope </span>against retaining security in a Singapore action for the satisfaction of a foreign judgment. Even in the context of stays in favour of arbitration, there is no longer any need to resort to the “<span class="font-italic">Rena K </span>principle”. The court in <span class="font-italic">Front Carriers Ltd v Atlantic &amp; Orient Shipping Corp</span> [2006] 3 SLR(R) 854 held that in Singapore, the enactment of s 7(1) of the IAA (which empowered the courts on ordering a stay of proceedings in favour of arbitration to also order that property arrested be retained as security, or alternative security be provided, for the satisfaction of any arbitration award) effectively did away with the <span class="font-italic">Rena K</span> test (at [28]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 In the present case, the Plaintiff does not want the provision of alternative security for the Chinese proceedings and has not sought such a requirement as a condition of the <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> stay. This is because, as both parties’ Chinese law experts agree, provision of alternative or equivalent security in the Chinese proceedings is unlikely to be well-received by the Chinese courts not least given the existence of the SJ Limitation Fund.

</div> It does not follow, however, that the SG Security should then be retained instead, despite the <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens </span>stay of the Singapore action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Third, another difficulty arising from the “<span class="font-italic">Rena K</span> principle” being developed outside the context of a <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> stay is that the “<span class="font-italic">Rena K</span> principle” applies a different test to determine whether the stay on an action may be lifted. The test under the “<span class="font-italic">Rena K</span> principle” is whether the defendant would be unable to satisfy an award made against it (<span class="font-italic">Rena K </span>at 406). In contrast, where a <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> stay is concerned, the stay would be lifted only in the exceptional circumstance where a premise on which the stay was granted turns out to have been mistaken: <span class="font-italic">Rotary Engineering Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Kioumji &amp; Eslim Law Firm and another and another appeal </span>[2017] 1 SLR 907 (“<span class="font-italic">Rotary Engineering</span>”) at [24]–[25]. In <span class="font-italic">Rotary Engineering</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Court of Appeal gave as an example of such exceptional circumstance a situation where the Singapore court had assumed that another jurisdiction was available, but it later turned out that that other jurisdiction was not willing to take jurisdiction for some reason. In such a case, it would be open to the plaintiff to come back to Singapore and seek the lifting of the <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> stay (at [24]). However, the Court of Appeal stressed that the court’s discretion to lift the stay would only be exercised in exceptional circumstances which struck at the very basis on which the stay was granted (at [25]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… We emphasise, however, that the discretion to lift the stay would only be exercised in <span class="font-italic">exceptional circumstances which strike at the very basis on which the stay was granted</span>. Put bluntly, the court’s persisting discretion to lift the stay should not be misconstrued as a standing invitation to litigants to re-agitate settled issues in the event that they later encounter mere setbacks or inconveniences in prosecuting their claims. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 The Plaintiff sought to apply the “<span class="font-italic">Rena K</span> principle” without being sensitive to the above difference in tests for the lifting of a stay. As a result, the Plaintiff’s arguments for the lifting of the <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens </span>stay do not cohere with the principles in <span class="font-italic">Rotary Engineering</span>. It is not the Plaintiff’s position that the QMC will decline to hear the Plaintiff’s claims in the PRC. Instead, the Plaintiff argued that it should be permitted to lift the <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens </span>stay to satisfy out of the retained SG Security any Chinese judgment which the Defendant does not satisfy. However, the <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens </span>stay was <span class="font-italic">not </span>granted based on any premise concerning whether the SJ Limitation Fund or the Defendant would be able to satisfy any Chinese judgment. That any Chinese judgment obtained by the Plaintiff might not be satisfied does not strike at the very basis on which the <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> stay was granted.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Fourth, further and in any event, the Plaintiff has not established the factual premise for its purported application of the “<span class="font-italic">Rena K </span>principle”, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, that the Defendant would be unlikely to satisfy a judgment obtained by the Plaintiff in the Chinese proceedings. The Plaintiff alleged that any Chinese judgment will not be satisfied in full or at all because:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the QMC’s Administrative Ruling will “wipe out” the SJ Limitation Fund (see [55] above); and </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) “the Defendant was a self-admitted one-ship company which has since sold its only asset being the [‘Sea Justice’]”.

In support of SUM 3559, the Plaintiff filed a solicitor’s affidavit (6th Affidavit of Liao Yanting) on 11 December 2023 enclosing in draft the 5th Affidavit of Eleftherios Tsouris (which has not been filed to-date).

</div> This must be so since the assertion in the Draft 5th ET Affidavit that the SJ Limitation Fund will be “wipe[d] out” purports to be made on Chinese law advice. However, no Chinese law expert evidence was adduced to substantiate this assertion. The bare assertion in para 15 of the Draft 5th ET Affidavit was made by a lay representative of the Plaintiff. Accordingly, I do not accept the Plaintiff’s argument that the QMC’s Administrative Ruling will “wipe out” the SJ Limitation Fund as the argument was made without proper evidential basis. In fact, the Plaintiff’s counsel conceded at the hearing of RA 246 that this was based on his instructing solicitors’ advice but he was not sure where it was expressly stated that the Qingdao Maritime Safety Administration’s penalty would be settled out of the SJ Limitation Fund.

If the Plaintiff purports to rely on the “<span class="font-italic">Rena K </span>principle”, the Plaintiff must show the former. However, the Plaintiff’s true grouse is that it will recover less under the lower limit in the PRC, and it thus wishes to avail of the higher limit in Singapore by resorting to the SG Security.

</div> I disagree that these cases support the proposition advanced by the Plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> at 483D–E, Lord Goff stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">But the underlying principle requires that regard must be had to the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice … For example, it would not, I think, normally be wrong to allow a plaintiff to keep the benefit of security obtained by commencing proceedings here, while at the same time granting a stay of proceedings in this country to enable the action to proceed in the appropriate forum. Such a conclusion is, I understand, consistent with the manner in which the process of saisie conservatoire is applied in civil law countries; and cf. section 26 of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982, now happily in force. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The phrase “keep the benefit of security obtained” is broad and could refer to (a) retention of security provided in the local proceedings; or (b) provision of alternative security for the foreign proceedings. Where retention of security is concerned, Lord Goff’s comment must be viewed in light of what is permitted under s 26 of the CJJA to which Lord Goff expressly referred. In the absence of a provision mirroring s 26(1) of the CJJA in Singapore (see [66] above), there is no basis to conclude from Lord Goff’s comment that the default position under Singapore law is to retain security provided for the release of an arrested vessel even after the Singapore action has been stayed in favour of foreign proceedings. Where provision of alternative security is concerned, it<span class="font-italic"> </span>is uncontroversial that the courts can require a defendant to provide alternative security for foreign proceedings as a condition of making a <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> stay, as was done in <span class="font-italic">Reecon Wolf</span> (at [59(a)]); however, the Plaintiff decidedly does not seek this. <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> and <span class="font-italic">Reecon Wolf</span> therefore do not support the Plaintiff’s proposition that the default position under Singapore law is for security to be retained in <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> stay cases. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> also did not concern different limitation regimes in the local and foreign fora and/or the defendant’s establishment of a limitation fund in the foreign forum. Lord Goff’s <span class="font-italic">dicta </span>in <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>thus does not address the present case where these factors are present. These factors engage considerations of comity (which I have addressed), as well as the Defendant’s right to claim limitation in a forum of his choice. On this last note, there was also no mention in <span class="font-italic">Reecon Wolf</span> that the defendant had already constituted a limitation fund in Malaysia or that the plaintiff was already otherwise secured in Malaysia. The order in <span class="font-italic">Reecon Wolf</span> for the defendant to provide equivalent security to satisfy any judgment the plaintiff may obtain in the Malaysian proceedings thus did not result in the plaintiff being doubly secured. This is in contrast to the present case where the Defendant has constituted the SJ Limitation Fund. I turn to address the considerations of fairness presented by the Defendant’s commencement of (and the Plaintiff’s participation in) limitation proceedings in the PRC. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Unjust to the Defendant for the Plaintiff to retain the SG Security</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 It is established law that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A shipowner has the right to claim limitation by action or defence and/or counterclaim: <span class="font-italic">The “Volvox Hollandia”</span> [1988] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 361 (“<span class="font-italic">Volvox Hollandia</span>”) at 370. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Where the shipowner commences limitation proceedings, the purpose is for him to obtain a decree <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> against all claimants for a single sum limited to the amount of the limitation fund:<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Volvox Hollandia</span> at 366. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The shipowner’s right in a limitation action is to have all claims scaled down to their proportionate share of the limited fund: <span class="font-italic">The “Happy Fellow”</span> [1997] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 130 at 134. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Crucially, the right to claim limitation in any particular forum is a right that belongs to the shipowner alone and that choice is not to be pre-empted by a claimant; a claimant cannot dictate where the limitation fund is to be constituted: <span class="font-italic">Evergreen </span>at [47]; <span class="font-italic">Volvox Hollandia</span> at 370. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 With these principles in mind, I take the view that allowing the Plaintiff to retain the SG Security for the purpose of satisfying any judgment against that security would effectively be compelling the Defendant to constitute a limitation fund in Singapore, despite the Defendant having chosen (as was its right) to claim limitation in the PRC. I agree with the AR that this would undermine the Defendant’s choice of forum for its limitation action.

The Plaintiff’s counsel argued, however, that the shipowner had to take all the consequences of his choice of forum. This meant that, having chosen to limit in the PRC, where the Chinese limitation regime did not prohibit the Plaintiff from bringing claims and arresting the “Sea Justice” to obtain security outside the PRC, the Defendant had to live with those consequences.

</div> I do not accept this argument. In <span class="font-italic">Evergreen</span>, Singapore and Belgium were party to different international limitation of liability conventions. Strictly speaking, there was no law prohibiting the defendants in that case from pursuing their action in Belgium despite the plaintiffs’ commencement of their limitation action in Singapore. Notwithstanding that, the court in <span class="font-italic">Evergreen</span> took the view that by litigating in Belgium, the defendants effectively frustrated or subverted the plaintiffs’ choice of forum (Singapore) for pursuing a limitation action (at [47]). While the Plaintiff in the present case may not have been constrained by Chinese laws or the QMC from commencing the Singapore action or arresting the “Sea Justice”, this does not change the reality that by retaining the SG Security, the Plaintiff would effectively be compelling the Defendant to constitute a limitation fund in Singapore and undermining the Defendant’s choice to pursue limitation in the PRC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Further, allowing the Plaintiff to retain the SG Security when the SJ Limitation Fund has already been constituted would result in the Plaintiff being doubly secured. While <span class="font-italic">Putbus</span> concerned the application of English legislation to a specific set of facts and thus is not directly relevant to the present case, there is Singapore authority indicating that it is, in general, unjust for a party to have to provide double security. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 In <span class="font-italic">Evergreen</span>, after ordering the anti-suit injunction, the court further ordered the security provided for the release of the “Ever Reach” to be returned to the plaintiffs, stating (at [67]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As for the application to return the security provided in Belgium, <span class="font-italic">the bank guarantee was provided before the limitation fund was constituted</span>. The arrest and security provided to secure the release of the Ever Reach was therefore consistent with the principle in <span class="font-italic">The Wladyslaw Lokietek</span> [1978] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 520. However, <span class="font-italic">in view of my decision to grant injunctive relief, the security is to be returned to the plaintiffs</span>. [emphasis added]     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In other words, after the constitution of the limitation fund in Singapore and given that the Belgian proceedings would not continue, the security that the defendants had obtained in Belgium (through the arrest of the “Ever Reach” there) was to be returned to the plaintiffs. The defendants were not permitted to be doubly secured. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 In <span class="font-italic">The “Blue Fruit”</span> [1979–1980] SLR(R) 238, the respondent commenced an action <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> against the owner of the vessel “Blue Fruit”. The respondent had earlier commenced an action against the owner in the Yokohama District Court where it caused a sister ship owned by that owner, “Universal Princess”, to be arrested. Security was furnished and the “Universal Princess” was released. The current owner of the “Blue Fruit” furnished security to obtain the release of the ship from arrest and applied for all further proceedings to be set aside or stayed on grounds that they were vexatious and an abuse of process given that the respondent had commenced an action and obtained security in Yokohama. The High Court refused the application. On appeal, the Court of Appeal found that Singapore was the <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens</span> for the action and dismissed the appeal but subject to the respondent’s undertaking to discontinue the Japanese action and to discharge the Japanese security (at [14]). While this case did not concern limitation, it demonstrates more generally that it is not considered just for a party to be doubly secured. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 In <span class="font-italic">Reecon Wolf</span>, where a condition of the <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens </span>stay of the Singapore action was that the defendant would provide equivalent security for the Malaysian action, there was no indication that the defendant had already constituted a limitation fund or otherwise provided security in Malaysia such that the plaintiff would be doubly secured by the condition of the stay.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 In circumstances where (a) the PRC is the natural and more appropriate forum for the Plaintiff’s claims arising from the Collision to be tried; (b) the Defendant has the right to choose where to claim limitation and has chosen to do so in the PRC; and (c) the Defendant has constituted a limitation fund in the QMC (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the SJ Limitation Fund) and the Plaintiff has registered its claims against the SJ Limitation Fund, I find that justice does not<span class="font-italic"> </span>warrant allowing the Plaintiff to retain the SG Security following the <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> stay of ADM 61.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Whether the arrest of the “Sea Justice” should be set aside </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Defendant’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 At the hearing of RA 247, the Defendant’s counsel confirmed that the Defendant was proceeding only on:

The test for materiality is objective: <span class="font-italic">Vasiliy</span> at [87]. At the stage of an application for a warrant of arrest, the court is concerned with disclosure of material facts which (a) are germane to considerations of jurisdiction <span class="font-italic">in rem</span>; and (b) show that the application does not constitute an abuse of the arrest process: <span class="font-italic">The “Eagle Prestige” </span>[2010] 3 SLR 294 (“<span class="font-italic">Eagle Prestige</span>”) at [74], [81] and [84].

This requires a measured assessment of the material facts as well as the circumstances in which the application for arrest was made: <span class="font-italic">Vasiliy</span> at [84].

</div>
</div> Notwithstanding that, these matters would be material if they had a bearing on whether the application for arrest was an abuse of process (<span class="font-italic">Eagle Prestige </span>at [74], [81] and [84]), such as by reason of the arrest being sought for the purpose of securing a foreign judgment (<span class="font-italic">Eurohope</span> at [25] and [28]–[30]). In this connection, facts showing that Singapore is obviously not the <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens </span>for the trial of the Plaintiff’s action may be relevant to the propriety of the purpose for which the arrest was being sought, and in turn, whether the Arrest Application was an abuse of process. In my judgment, however, the three matters were not material, and even if they were, their impact does not warrant setting aside the arrest of the “Sea Justice”. I elaborate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Misstatement </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 The Misstatement, by way of the Additional Words, was to the effect that the Plaintiff had expressly reserved the right not to accept the jurisdiction of the QMC in respect of the Chinese limitation proceedings commenced by the Defendant. The true position was that the Plaintiff’s express reservation of rights clause did not mention the QMC’s jurisdiction. The Duty Registrar was not apprised of this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 In a paradigm non-disclosure case, a fact is not disclosed, and the court considers the counterfactual, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>what impact disclosure of that fact would have made. In my view, where a misstatement is made, the court should take a similar approach of considering the counterfactual, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, what impact disclosure of the true position would have made. This approach finds support in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">“Nordglimt”</span> [1987] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 470. In that case, the receivers of cargo carried on a vessel commenced an action <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> and arrested a sister ship, the “Nordglimt”. The plaintiffs’ claim was in respect of damage to and shortfall of the cargo. The shipowners applied, among others, to set aside the warrant of arrest on the ground that the plaintiffs had failed to disclose material facts in their application for the issue of an arrest warrant. Two bills of lading had been issued, one genuine and one false. In their application, the plaintiffs had referred to and produced the false bill of lading that incorrectly set out when the cargo was shipped and the quantity of the cargo shipped. The court commented that this was more accurately described as a case of misstatement than non-disclosure (at 473). Parties accepted that the misstatement was due to an oversight and was not deliberate (at 473). Parties also accepted that “if the true facts had been relied upon, that is to say if the genuine bill of lading had been referred to … there would be nothing wrong with the affidavit and … no reason for the Court to refuse to issue the warrant of arrest” (at 473). The court considered what the impact on the arrest proceedings would have been had the true / accurate position been stated instead of the misstatement and concluded that the inaccuracy was immaterial (at 474): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The inaccurate facts did not enable the plaintiffs to obtain any relief which they would not have obtained if they had stated the correct facts. The inaccuracy was central to the description of the plaintiffs’ cause of action but was immaterial in that with the substitution of the correct date and the correct quantity of cargo loaded the position would have been precisely the same as that they stated. The plaintiffs have not obtained any advantage by misleading the court. It follows therefore that I will not set aside the warrant of arrest on this ground and that any consequences are adequately dealt with by an appropriate order for costs.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 In the present case, the true position is that the reservation of rights clause in the Plaintiff’s Application for Registration of Claim against SJ Limitation Fund did not mention the QMC’s jurisdiction. I reproduce the reservation of rights clause with the Additional Words stricken out to demonstrate how the clause should have read on an accurate translation:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This Application for Registration of Claim is a procedural application made in response to the application from Sea Justice Ltd for the constitution of a limitation fund for maritime claims. The Applicant hereby declares that all the matters described herein or referred hereto shall not be construed as the Applicant’s acknowledgement of any facts or liabilities, <span class="font-linethrough">or acceptance of jurisdiction of your court or application of law,</span> or waiver of any substantial or procedural defenses. The Applicant also reserves the right to object to the right of the Respondent to limit its liabilities and the limitation amounts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As can be seen, the clause without the Additional Words is <span class="font-italic">silent</span> as regards jurisdiction. It does not convey that the Plaintiff had in fact submitted to, or would not be objecting to, the jurisdiction of the QMC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 I find that the true position in respect of the reservation of rights clause is not a material fact as it is not relevant to the Duty Registrar’s decision whether or not to issue the Warrant of Arrest. First, while the AR took the view that an express reservation of rights not to accept the QMC’s jurisdiction signalled an intent to proceed with the Singapore action,

</div> Some confusion may have arisen in the hearing below because the term “Inter-Ship Claim” was not used in the Plaintiff’s Arrest Affidavit although the actions themselves were disclosed. In my view, the key fact relevant to the Duty Registrar’s decision whether or not to issue the Warrant of Arrest was the existence of the ongoing Inter-Ship Claims and this fact was disclosed to him. The 19 April 2022 QMC Hearing and the 27 May 2022 QMC Joint Confirmation related to certain submissions made and evidence tendered for the Inter-Ship Claims (see [26] and [27] above). These events did not indicate that the Inter-Ship Claims had progressed to an advanced stage. In fact, it is not disputed that the Inter-Ship Claims were at the “pre-litigation mediation” stage at the time.

</div> I therefore find that these two particular steps in the Inter-Ship Claims are not material facts as they are not relevant to the Duty Registrar’s decision whether or not to issue the Warrant of Arrest.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Non-disclosure of NEPIA’s constitution of the AS CLC Limitation Fund</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 The AS CLC Limitation Fund was established to address oil pollution claims that third parties might have against the Plaintiff (see [14] and [18] above). It does not pertain to the Plaintiff’s claims against the Defendant. In so far as the Plaintiff claims an indemnity from the Defendant in respect of oil pollution claims brought by third parties against the Plaintiff, these oil pollution indemnity claims are part of the claims brought in the Plaintiff’s Inter-Ship Claim and are registered by the Plaintiff against the SJ Limitation Fund.

</div> I therefore find that the constitution of the AS CLC Limitation Fund is not a material fact as it is not relevant to the Duty Registrar’s decision whether or not to issue the Warrant of Arrest. In this respect, I diverge from the AR’s view that every proceeding in the QMC preceding the hearing of the Arrest Application should have been disclosed.

Even if I am wrong on the relevance or materiality of any of the three matters, I consider that the impact of their non-disclosure is marginal. As the key matters of the Defendant’s Chinese limitation proceedings and the Inter-Ship Claims were disclosed, disclosure of these three subsidiary matters would not have moved the needle on the Duty Registrar’s decision. Were it necessary to decide, I would not, applying the principle of proportionality in assessing the sin of omission against the impact of default, exercise my discretion to set aside the Warrant of Arrest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 In light of my decision, there is no need for me to determine whether the Misstatement and the other two non-disclosures were deliberate.

</div> I make the following observations. The Plaintiff’s explanation is that its PRC lawyers had an <span class="font-italic">outdated</span> in-house English translation of the Plaintiff’s Application for Registration of Claim against SJ Limitation Fund, and this version was inadvertently provided to the Plaintiff’s Singapore lawyers (see [136] above). The relevant inquiry would thus be whether the <span class="font-italic">outdated </span>translation was deliberately provided, and not whether a mistranslation was deliberately made, for the purposes of the Arrest Application. The Plaintiff’s bare assertion that its PRC lawyers had inadvertently provided the outdated translation to its Singapore lawyers, without further explanation of how the asserted inadvertent error came to be made, is not ideal. In general, any litigant claiming inadvertence to excuse a particular action should, minimally, explain how and why the purported inadvertence came to pass. Having said that, and returning to the present case, if the outdated translation was deliberately provided by the Plaintiff’s PRC lawyers for the purposes of the Arrest Application, that would be tantamount to lawyers setting out to deceive the court. Were a determination necessary, I would, on balance, hesitate to make such a finding lightly, without more evidence of such improper conduct.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Whether the disbursements allowed for the Defendant’s expert’s fees should be further reduced </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Plaintiff’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 The Plaintiff submitted that the AR erred in finding that only “a small reduction of 20%” of Prof Zhao’s fees was warranted despite finding that Prof Zhao’s evidence on the issue of submission to jurisdiction of the Chinese courts could not be relied on as he gave a diametrically opposing view in another case and provided no explanation for his change in opinion.

In <span class="font-italic">Kiri</span>, the SICC drew a distinction between the situation where the costs associated with expert evidence were unreasonably incurred, and a situation where the expert evidence was reasonably sought (and the associated fees were reasonably incurred) but was eventually not accepted by the court.

However, the AR also found that the issue was not completely addressed by the Plaintiff’s Chinese law expert and ultimately made no finding on whether the Plaintiff had submitted to the jurisdiction of the QMC.
