Hence, s 10(1) SOPA will be breached if, for example, the payment claim is <span class="font-italic">not </span>in respect of a progress payment. Herein, a person is entitled to submit a progress payment if<span class="font-italic"> </span>he has “carried out any construction work, or supplied any goods or services, under a contract” (s 5 SOPA), but not otherwise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Furthermore, s 10(1) SOPA limits the persons on whom the payment claim may be served to (a) persons who may be liable to make the payment under the construction contract, or (b) any other persons identified in the construction contract. Payment claims against any other persons would breach s 10(1) SOPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Section 10(1) SOPA therefore ensures that only <span class="font-italic">valid </span>payment claims are made, and claimants who submit frivolous payment claims beyond the scope allowed under s 10(1) SOPA ought to have their claims dismissed entirely. This is consistent with the goal of the SOPA adjudication framework, which “facilitates cash flow by establishing a <span class="font-italic">fast and low cost adjudication system </span>to resolve payment disputes” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, </span><span class="font-italic">Official Report</span> (16 November 2004) vol 78 (“the Debates”) at col 1113 (Cedric Foo Chee Keng, Minister of State for National Development)).  By weeding out invalid payment claims which are not premised on work done or goods or services supplied under a contract (see s 5 SOPA), s 10(1) SOPA ensures that the SOPA adjudication framework will not be abused to resolve construction disputes outside the ambit of SOPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The importance of ensuring that payment claims remain within the scope of s 10(1) SOPA cannot be understated.

Accordingly, I have no doubt that s 10(1) SOPA, which prescribes the scope of a valid payment claim, is a mandatory provision, breach of which mandates the setting aside of the adjudication determination arising therefrom.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The second issue: Whether PC36 is a valid payment claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Having determined that s 10(1) SOPA is a mandatory provision, the query then turns to whether PC36, being a claim for performance bond proceeds only, is a valid payment claim within the parameters of s 10(1) SOPA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The main contractor’s argument: PC36 was not a claim for construction work</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In this regard, the main contractor argues that PC36 is an invalid payment claim as it is not a claim for “construction work”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">SH Design</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 To support the contention, the sub-contractor relies in the main on the case of <span class="font-italic">SH Design</span>. In that case, the plaintiff engaged the defendant as its sub-contractor. Pursuant to the requirements of the subcontract between the parties, the defendant procured an on-demand performance bond for the sum of $1,293,600 in favour of the plaintiff. The plaintiff later assigned all of its rights under the subcontract, including the performance bond, to a third party (“the Owner”). The Owner subsequently called on the bond in full.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 On 23 May 2016, the defendant served a payment claim on the plaintiff for the sum of $4,250,683.08 for work that it had done from January 2015 to December 2015. On 7 June 2016, the plaintiff served its payment response for a negative sum of $15,063,770.47. In its payment response, the plaintiff expressly accounted for bond proceeds which had been received by the Owner.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 On 11 August 2016, the adjudicator issued his determination, holding that an amount of $1,127,088.40 was owed to the defendant. In arriving at the final adjudicated amount, the adjudicator had taken into account the bond proceeds ($1,293,600) which had been received by the Owner by adding it as an amount due to the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The plaintiff applied to set aside the AD. One basis for setting aside was that the adjudicator ought not to have accounted for the bond proceeds. Instead, the plaintiff submitted, the bond proceeds ought to have been accounted for only at the arbitration between the parties, rather than at the adjudication, which was not a full and final settlement of the matter (<span class="font-italic">SH Design </span>at [51]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Tan J dismissed the plaintiff’s application to set aside the AD. In relation to the adjudicator’s decision to account for the bond proceeds, Tan J observed as follows (<span class="font-italic">SH Design </span>at [53]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> … the Adjudicator’s duty was to comprehensively determine the rights and obligations of the parties under the Subcontract, having regard to the Payment Claim and the Payment Response. Having assessed that the defendant was already liable to the plaintiff for the works done, … the Adjudicator was obligated to give credit for the Bond Proceeds …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 This was necessary to “finalise the accounts between the parties” as the subcontract had been terminated on the same day as the call on the performance bond by the Owner (<span class="font-italic">SH Design </span>at [54]). Accordingly, Tan J found that the adjudicator had not exceeded his jurisdiction by accounting for the bond proceeds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The sub-contractor asserts, on the basis of <span class="font-italic">SH Design</span>, that it is “clear that an adjudication under the SOP Act is the proper forum to account for such ‘performance bond’ proceeds.”

</div>
</div> I do not agree.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In <span class="font-italic">SH Design</span>, there was no doubt that the payment claim related to progress payment for construction works that had been carried out by the defendant. Indeed, in arriving at the adjudicated sum, the adjudicator had considered that $1,050,344.52 was owed to the defendant for work done (<span class="font-italic">SH</span><span class="font-italic"> Design </span>at [18]). The bond proceeds were raised by the plaintiff in its payment response, and only featured in the accounting stage when the adjudicator was determining the final adjudicated amount. As the payment claim was for work done, it was clearly valid, and the issue of breaching s 10(1) SOPA did not even arise before the adjudicator or Tan J. Therefore, the portion of <span class="font-italic">SH Design </span>relied on by the sub-contractor only relates to the correctness of accounting for performance bond proceeds <span class="font-italic">after </span>a valid payment claim has been filed. <span class="font-italic">SH Design </span>does not conclusively determine that any payment claim exclusively for the proceeds of the performance bond will be a valid payment claim that is within the confines of s 10(1) SOPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In the present case, PC36 relates <span class="font-italic">entirely </span>to the performance bond proceeds, and it is not disputed that it is not a claim for any construction work done by the sub-contractor which remains unpaid. In fact, the Statement of Claim attached by the sub-contractor to PC36 clearly stipulates that the claimed sum therein was for “(disputed) backcharges by [the main contractor] amounting to $281,441.95, … made via their letter dated 20 December 2018 to UOB demanding payment of the Guaranteed Sum of $281,441.95 under UOB’s Performance Bond…”.

</div>
</div> Hence, rather than being a claim for construction works or the supply of goods or services, PC36 is indubitably a claim to recover the proceeds of the performance bond.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The appropriate query is therefore whether a payment claim purely for the performance bond proceeds is a valid one under s 10(1) SOPA. In this regard, for the reasons given at [36] above, <span class="font-italic">SH Design </span>does not assist the sub-contractor. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">A payment claim must relate to construction work, or goods or services supplied</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 As alluded to at [22] above, a payment claim must be “in respect of a progress payment” (s 10(1) SOPA). Section 5 SOPA then prescribes that “[a]ny person who has carried out any construction work, or supplied any goods or services, under a contract is entitled to a progress payment.” Hence, a contractor’s entitlement to progress payment is contingent on it having carried out construction work, or supplied any goods or services. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The focus on work done and the supply of goods and services is aligned with the words of the Minister of State for National Development, who observed during the Second Reading of the Bill that SOPA would seek to “preserve the rights to payment for <span class="font-italic">work done</span> and <span class="font-italic">goods supplied</span> of all parties in the construction industry” [emphasis added] (the Debates at col 1112). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 That payment claims are premised on work done, or goods and services having been supplied is also clear from how repeated payment claims are treated: while a contractor may repeat a previous payment claim, this is only permissible when the repeated claim relates to “work done or goods supplied” and the “previous payment claim for the same work or goods was not in fact adjudicated on the merits” (<span class="font-italic">Grouteam</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v UES Holdings Pte Ltd </span>[2016] 5 SLR 1011<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [57])</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Hence, the sub-contractor’s argument that it is entitled to make a payment claim for performance bond proceeds flies in the face of clear statutory wording, which stipulates that entitlement to progress payment (from which a payment claim results) is premised on work done or goods or services being supplied. While the performance bond relates to the construction works, a call on the performance bond resulting in the main contractor receiving the bond proceeds cannot be considered as works done by the sub-contractor, which is a fundamental requirement under s 5 SOPA. On the contrary, the performance bond is usually called as a result of some alleged breach of the contract and it includes an alleged failure by the sub-contractor to carry out construction works, or supply goods or services, in accordance with the terms of the construction contract. It is therefore an allegation on the main contractor’s part that construction works have <span class="font-italic">not </span>been done satisfactorily, or that goods or services have <span class="font-italic">not </span>been supplied in accordance with the contract. Allowing the sub-contractor to issue a payment claim for such <span class="font-italic">negative </span>work thus verges on the nonsensical.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Allowing the payment claim defeats the bargain struck</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Furthermore, allowing PC36 will negate the efficacy of the performance bond entirely, thus defeating the bargain struck between the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 To elaborate, the parties had agreed to a performance bond in favour of the main contractor for the sum of $281,441.95. The performance bond was issued as a “deposit or security for the due performance and observance by the Sub-Contractor” of the contract.

This contravenes ss 36(1) and 36(4) SOPA, which, when read collectively, stipulate that “except where a contract provision excludes, modifies, restricts or in any way prejudices the operation of the regime, the [SOPA] does not seek to reconfigure, alter or amend the effect of the terms of the underlying contract” (<span class="font-italic">Security of Payments and Construction Adjudication </span>(LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2013) at para 4.24). The performance bond in this case operates independently from the construction contract between the parties, and serves simply as valuable security or deposit for the main contractor. It is the result of a bargain struck between the parties, and does nothing to exclude, modify, restrict or prejudice the operation of the SOPA regime.
