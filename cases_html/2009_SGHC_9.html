<p class="Judg-author" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Kan Ting Chiu J:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Background</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">1     The defendant, Lam Cheng Yee, the owner of a property at 32H Nassim Road, Singapore (“the property”), was sued by the plaintiff, Areco International Pte Ltd, her agent for the sale of the property for refusing to pay the agreed agent’s commission. Although the sale of the property was completed, the defendant had revoked her irrevocable authority to her solicitors to pay the commission to the plaintiff out of the sale proceeds.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">2     In response to the plaintiff’s claim, the defendant filed a defence and counterclaim and issued two third party notices. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment on its claim and for the striking out of the two third party notices. The Assistant Registrar who heard the matter granted the plaintiff’s applications. The defendant appealed against the order for summary judgment and the striking out of one of the third party notices.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">3     The defendant’s defence was that she was entitled to rescind the authority to pay the commission because of the wrongful conduct of Cindy Wong Mau Lan (“CW”), the housing agent from the plaintiff company who had worked to secure the sale of the property. She counterclaimed for the interest she paid to the purchaser for late completion of the sale, and the loss of opportunity to obtain a higher price for the property.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">4     In her defence and counterclaim, the defendant alleged that CW had represented that the purchaser was interested in the property because of its “feng shui”</font><a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 1]</font></span></span></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">, that the purchaser’s address was “c/o 9 Temasek Boulevard, #16-02A Suntec Tower 2, S(038989)”</font><a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 2]</font></span></span></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">, and that the selling price of $25,500,000 was a very good price</font><a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 3]</font></span></span></a><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">5     She made an issue of the address because the purchaser, Chew Hua Seng (“CHS”), is the owner of the property at 32K Nassim Road Singapore, which adjoins her property. Her husband, Thio Keng Thay (“TKT”), who had dealt with CW on her behalf, deposed in his affidavit filed in these proceedings that:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[I]f the prospective purchaser wished to buy a property adjacent to his existing property such as this, he had only two he could buy. Therefore I believe, subject to expert advice, that an adjacent property would command a substantial premium over the market value. Certainly I would not have agreed to sell the property at $25.5 million if Cindy Wong had informed me when I enquired as to the prospective purchaser’s interest in the property that he also had an interest in the adjacent property.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">6     The defendant claimed that the representations were false and misleading in that:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">32.1.1. the address of the Purchaser was at all material times 32K Nassim Road, Singapore, namely the plot adjoining the Property; and</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">32.1.2. the real reason for the Purchaser’s interest in the property was his ownership of the adjoining land;</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">32.1.3. the Purchaser was not a market buyer but a special purchaser: the price was not a ‘good price’ for a special purchaser in the position of the Purchaser.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">and that</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The above misrepresentations were made by Ms Wong deliberately and with knowledge of their falsity and with the expectation that they would be relied upon by the Defendant in considering whether and at what price to sell the Property to the Purchaser and whether and at what rate to pay commission to the Plaintiff. …</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">All these allegations were denied by the plaintiff and CW.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">7     In addition to filing the defence and counterclaim, the defendant instituted third party proceedings against two persons. The first person was CW. She is a shareholder of the plaintiff and was the person from the plaintiff who liaised with TKT to secure the sale. In these third party proceedings, the defendant sought an indemnity from CW against the plaintiff’s claim, and she also claimed against CW reliefs similar to those she claimed against the plaintiff in the counterclaim.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">8     The second third party was CHS, the purchaser of the property. The defendant did appeal against the Assistant Registrar’s order to strike out the third party notice against him.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">9     A reference to parts of the parties’ pleadings is helpful to understand the basis and merits of the third party notice against CW. In the defence and counterclaim, the defendant pleaded:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">7.      The Plaintiff at all times acted by its agent Ms Cindy Wong (“Ms Wong”) for whose actions and defaults they are vicariously liable.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">8.      At all material times in her dealings with the Plaintiff the Defendant acted by her agent Mr Thio Keng Thay, the Defendant’s husband (“Mr Thio”). The knowledge of Mr Thio is to be treated as the knowledge of the Defendant.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">and the plaintiff responded in its reply and defence to counterclaim:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">2.      Paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Defence &amp; Counterclaim and the agency alleged therein are admitted (in particular that at all material time, Thio Keng Thay, (“Thio”), the husband of the Defendant, acted as agent for the Defendant).</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">10    On those pleadings, it was common ground that CW was an agent of the plaintiff and the plaintiff was vicariously liable for her actions and omissions. Against this background, the defendant was by her counterclaim against the principal and her third party notice against the agent, seeking the same reliefs.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">11    This raises a question whether the third party proceedings against CW were an abuse of process of court. As this issue was not fully dealt with before me, I will not come to any concluded position and will leave it to be examined by the Court of Appeal, if it is thought appropriate.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The events leading to the sale</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">12    The events as recounted in the affidavits of CW and TKT are:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-list-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(i)    in November/December 2006, CW called TKT and enquired if the property was for sale. Initially, TKT had no interest in selling, but after a time, he informed CW that he would sell at $18m, and they agreed on a commission of 1.5%;</font></p>
<p class="Judg-list-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(ii)   on 11 December 2006, CW informed TKT that there was a buyer for the property at $18m, and she forwarded an option and a commission agreement;</font></p>
<p class="Judg-list-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(iii)   on 16 December 2006 TKT withdrew his offer to sell at $18m because he felt that the property may be under-priced;</font></p>
<p class="Judg-list-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(iv)  on 1 February 2007, TKT informed CW that he was prepared to sell the property at $25m, and received counter-offers of $20m and $22m (CW and TKT’s accounts varied over whether TKT accepted the $22m offer, but no option to purchase was issued);</font></p>
<p class="Judg-list-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(v)   on 15 May 2007, TKT again informed CW that the price was $25m and an option prepared by his solicitors was forwarded to her;</font></p>
<p class="Judg-list-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(vi)  in June 2007, TKT asked CW for prices of properties transacted in Districts 10 and 11, and on 7 June, a list of the prices was forwarded to him;</font></p>
<p class="Judg-list-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(vii)  on 12 September 2007, TKT sent to CW a new option prepared by his solicitors at the price of $25.5m;</font></p>
<p class="Judg-list-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(viii) on 18 September 2007, TKT’s price was accepted, and an option for that price was issued with the name and address of the buyer left blank.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Feng shui</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">13    TKT deposed in his affidavit that when he asked CW for the purchaser’s reason for buying the property, she said that the reason was “feng shui”.</font><a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 4]</font></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">CW’s account was that she told TKT that “one of the reasons could be “feng shui”.</font><a href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 5]</font></span></span></a></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The purchaser’s address</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">14    TKT did not know that CHS was the purchaser up to the time the option was issued on 18 September 2007. CW’s evidence was that CHS did not want his identity revealed during the negotiations and this was confirmed by CHS. CW stated that she informed TKT of that, but TKT maintained that he was not aware that the purchaser wanted to remain anonymous.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">15    The situation was that TKT did not ask for and was not informed of the identity of the purchaser till 18 September 2007. On that day when CW tendered the option money and received the option, it did not bear the purchaser’s name. CW wanted CHS’s name to be inserted with the words “and/or nominee”. As TKT was not agreeable to those words, CHS’s name and NRIC number were inserted together with his address which was stated as c/o 9 Temasek Boulevard, #16-02A, Suntec Tower 2 Singapore (038989).</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The price of $25.5m</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">16    By his evidence, the price was set by TKT.</font><a href="#_ftn6" id="_ftnref6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 6]</font></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">CW would have said that it was a very good price after TKT informed her of it.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The alleged misrepresentations</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><strong><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(i) Feng shui</font></em></strong></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">17    The first misrepresentation pleaded is the ‘feng shui’ reason for the purchaser. There is an uncertainty over whether CW had stated that to be the reason, or that it could be a reason for the purchase. Even if it was the former, it could not assist the defendant.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">18    Nothing turned on this because this representation did not induce TKT to agree to sell the property for $25.5m on 18 September 2007. He did not, and could not, without appearing irrational, say that he would not have agreed to sell but for that representation.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><strong><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(ii) The purchaser’s address</font></em></strong></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">19    CHS’s address was stated in the option as “c/o 9 Temasek Boulevard, #16-02A, Suntec Tower 2, S(038989)”. It was not disclosed who had decided to use that address. It could have been CHS himself, his solicitors, or CW. The defendant had no basis to attribute that to CW.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">20    It was plain on its face that the address stated was not CHS’s residential address. TKT did not object to it, and it was not a false or misleading address as it was the address of the solicitors acting for CHS in the purchase.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">21    It is noteworthy that TKT did not say that he had required, as a condition to issuing the option that the purchaser’s residential address be inserted or disclosed, or that he was told or believed that the address given was CHS’s residential address.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2" xmlns=""><strong><em><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">(iii) That $25.5m was a very good price</font></em></strong></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">22    In the course of the drawn-out negotiations, each of the increasing asking prices for the property, i.e. $18m, $25m and $25.5m, was set by TKT without consultation with CW. The negotiations were conducted in a seller’s market. TKT must have considered $25.5m to be a good selling price when he fixed it and issued the option on 18 September 2007.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Deceit</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">23    The defendant’s assertion of deceit was founded on the three alleged misrepresentations and the non-disclosure of CHS’s residential address. For the reasons I have given, these complaints did not give the defendant a basis to allege deceit.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">24    As for the non-disclosure of CHS’s residential address, the defendant had to show that CW or the plaintiff was under a duty as an estate agent to inform her or TKT of that address. There was no evidence or authority produced to support the existence of such a duty.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">25    The situation may have been different if TKT had asked CW if the asking price of $25.5m was appropriate, or if he had asked her if there were particular factors that he should have taken into consideration in fixing the price at $25.5m.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">26    Even if he had asked the first question, CW would have honestly replied in the affirmative, on the basis that $25.5m was a good price even when the purchaser was the owner of an adjoining property.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">27    If he had asked the second question, he may have a stronger case for complaint, but that would depend on whether an estate agent in Singapore is expected to know that a property can command a higher price from the owner of an adjoining property. An estate agent is not a valuer. He may hold himself out to be knowledgeable in property valuation. If he does, then he probably would be under a duty to advise his vendor-client that an intending purchaser is the owner of an adjoining property. If the agent does not hold himself out to be knowledgeable in property valuation, then it becomes a question of fact whether he is under a duty to advise his vendor-client of that phenomenon. CW was not a valuer and was not engaged as a valuer, and she did not hold herself out to be knowledgeable in property valuation. Was she under a duty to inform the defendant or TKT that CHS owned the adjoining property? To establish such a duty, the defendant would have to show that a competent estate agent practicing the profession in Singapore is expected to know that a property can fetch a higher price from the owner of an adjoining property. The defendant did not lead any evidence on this effect.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">28    In any event, it must be remembered that both questions were not asked. In the circumstances, CW and the plaintiff cannot be liable to the defendant for not disclosing CHS’s ownership of the adjoining property.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">29    For the foregoing reasons, I found that the Assistant Registrar was right to grant the plaintiff’s application for summary judgment, and to set aside the third party notice against CW.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">Revocation of the irrevocable instructions to pay the commission</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">30    While this issue has no direct bearing on the matters before the Assistant Registrar and me, the defendant’s revocation of the authority to pay the commission and her solicitors’ response invited consideration and comment.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">31    In the option granted to CHS, there was a specific provision that:</font></p>
<p class="Judg-quote-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">The Vendor agrees to pay Areco International Pte Ltd (hereinafter called “the Agent”) a commission of Dollars Three Hundred Eighty-Two Thousand and Five Hundred ($382,500.00) which is inclusive of the Goods and Services Tax Act upon the completion of the sale and purchase of the Property and the Vendor’s solicitors are hereby irrevocably authorised to deduct and retain the said commission from the sale proceeds and to pay the same to the Agent upon completion. It is hereby expressly provided that the Vendor shall only be obliged to pay the Agent the said commission upon the successful completion of the sale and purchase of the Property but not otherwise.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">32    The ‘Vendor’ referred to the defendant, and the ‘Vendor’s solicitors’ were Donaldson &amp; Burkinshaw. When the defendant discovered that CHS was the owner of 32 K Nassim Road at the scheduled time of completion, she initially refused to complete the sale (but did so later, on payment of interest for late completion) and revoked the solicitors’ authority to pay the commission to the plaintiff,</font><a href="#_ftn7" id="_ftnref7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">[note: 7]</font></span></span></a> <font face1="Times New Roman, Times">and Donaldson &amp; Burkinshaw accepted the revocation without demurral.</font></p>
<p class="Judg-1" xmlns=""><font face1="Times New Roman, Times">33    What should the solicitors acting for a vendor have done in such a situation? They were aware that their client, the vendor, had represented to the agent that the solicitors will pay the agent its commission out of the proceeds of the sale and had issued an irrevocable authorisation for that to be done. When the authorisation was accepted to be revoked, there was no basis for the solicitors to deduct and retain the commission and the full sale proceeds would be released to the vendor. In such an event, the agent may be placed in jeopardy. The vendor may be outside the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts, or may be unable to pay the commission by the time a court ruled that the commission was payable. Prudent solicitors in such a situation have taken out interpleader proceedings and retained the commission pending the determination of the proceedings. Banks often do that when there are competing claims to funds held by them. That appears to me to be a better course of action for Donaldson &amp; Burkinshaw to take rather than to accept the defendant’s instructions without notice to the plaintiff.</font></p>
