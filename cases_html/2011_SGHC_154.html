<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an application for pre-action discovery
                    pursuant to Order 24 Rule 6(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322,
                    R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”) by the plaintiff, a
                    private banking customer, against the defendant bank. The items sought for
                    discovery were “[a]ll tape recordings of telephone conversations between
                    the [p]laintiff and any officer(s)/representative(s) of the [d]efendant”
                    pertaining to certain transactions and trades in equity-linked notes
                    (“Transactions”) allegedly entered into by the defendant on behalf
                    of the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The facts are simple. Between June 2010 and
                    December 2010, the Transactions were allegedly entered into by the defendant on
                    the plaintiff’s behalf. Subsequently, the plaintiff asserted that the
                    Transactions were never authorised by him. The defendant responded to this
                    assertion by saying that apart from documentary records that confirmed the
                    plaintiff’s cognizance and approval of the Transactions, they also had in
                    their possession tape recordings (“Tape Recordings”) of telephone
                    conversations between the defendant’s employees and the plaintiff where
                    the plaintiff could be heard to be authorizing or agreeing to the
                    Transactions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In the event, the plaintiff was granted an
                    opportunity by the defendant to listen to one of the Tape Recordings,
                    specifically a conversation he had had with his relationship manager, one Mavis
                    Koh (“the Mavis recording”) on 8 November 2010. According to
                    the defendant, the Mavis recording contained the plaintiff’s confirmation
                    and acknowledgment of one of the Transactions. However, the plaintiff eventually
                    refused to sign the requisite request form to listen to the Mavis recording,
                    asserting that “[w]hat I had requested to listen to … had been the
                    earlier pre-trade telephone conversation with Dennis Ng, not the 8 November
                    telephone conversation with Mavis Koh”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Subsequently, by a lawyer’s letter dated
                    23 March 2011, the plaintiff informed the defendant that he had commenced
                    the present application for pre-action discovery of the Tape
                Recordings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Pre-action discovery exists for the plaintiff
                    who is unable to plead a case as he does not know whether he has a viable claim
                    and requires the discovery to ascertain the gaps in his case. Where the
                    plaintiff has evidence sufficient to commence a claim, he is generally not
                    entitled to discovery <em>before</em> action: see generally
                        <em>Kuah Kok Kim and others v Ernst &amp; Young</em>
                    [1996] 3 SLR(R) 485 (“<em>Kuah Kok

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The relevant provisions relating to pre-action
                    discovery are found under Order 24 Rule 6 of the Rules of
                    Court:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.  Discovery against other person (O. 24, r. 6)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) An application for an order for the discovery of documents before the
                        commencement of proceedings shall be made by originating summons and the
                        person against whom the order is sought shall be made defendant to the
                        originating summons.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) An originating summons under paragraph (1) or a summons
                        under paragraph (2) shall be supported by an affidavit which must
                        —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) in the case of an originating summons under paragraph (1), state

                            intended proceedings and whether the person against whom the order is
                            sought is likely to be party to subsequent proceedings in Court;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) in any case, specify or describe the documents in respect of which
                            the order is sought and show, if practicable by reference to any
                            pleading served or intended to be served in the proceedings, that the
                            documents are relevant to an issue arising or likely to arise out of the
                            claim made or likely to be made in the proceedings or the identity of
                            the likely parties to the proceedings, or both, and that the person

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(9) Unless the Court orders otherwise, where an application is made in

                        sought shall be entitled to his costs of the application, and of complying
                        with any order made thereon on an indemnity basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In <em>Kuah Kok Kim</em>,
                    Lai Kew Chai J described the nature of pre-action discovery under
                    Order 24 Rule 6 as follows (at [31] and [56]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31    It can be seen from the tenor of the cases that
                            where pre-action discovery is sought, the plaintiff has a duty to set
                            out the substance of his claim to enable a potential defendant to know
                            what the essence of the complaint against him is. <b><em>This is because in the nature of pre-action discovery, the
                                plaintiff does not yet know whether he has a viable claim against
                                the defendant, and the rule is there to assist him in his search for
                                the answer</em></b>. Thus the safeguards specified in the rules
                            are to ensure that the plaintiff is not allowed to take advantage of the
                            rules merely to enable him to go on a fishing expedition.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">56    In deciding whether to order discovery of [the
                            relevant] documents, we were … concerned with … the
                                <em>purpose of the discovery</em>, namely,
                                <b><em>that the appellants wanted to find out if they
                                had a good cause of action in tort or contract against the
                                respondents</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Subsequently in <em>Asia Pacific
                        Breweries</em>, Belinda Ang J acknowledged and expounded on the
                    authority of <em>Kuah Kok Kim</em> at [4]-[5]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4    The requirements of O 24 r 6(3) as guided
                            by the decision of Kuah Kok Kim are that the application for
                            pre-discovery be supported by an affidavit setting out the grounds for
                            the application, the material facts pertaining to the intended action
                            and whether the person against whom the order is sought is likely to be
                            a party to subsequent proceedings. The tests of “possession,
                            custody or power” and “relevance” remain applicable
                            for the purposes of pre-action discovery. <em>The
                                criterion of the rule is intended to ensure that the application for
                                pre-action discovery is not brought frivolously or without
                                justification. Lai Kew Chai J, in delivering the judgment of the
                                Court of Appeal in Kuah Kok Kim</em>, … said that the
                            court’s duty is to ensure that the application is not frivolous or
                            speculative and that the applicant is not on a fishing expedition. That
                            duty was adopted and applied by Choo Han Teck JC (as he then was) in
                                <em>Ng Giok Oh v Sajjad Akhtar</em> [2003]
                            1 SLR(R) 375.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5    
              <em>Once the court is
                                satisfied</em>, based on an assessment of the formal evidence
                            before the court, that the criteria of the rule are met, <em>the next consideration</em> is whether discovery is
                            necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for
                            saving costs. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       But what, exactly, is a “viable”
                    or “good” cause of action, as alluded to in <em>Kuah Kok Kim</em>? A “cause of action” is a legal term
                    of art; one makes out a cause of action simply by fulfilling and articulating
                    certain legal criteria based upon a set of facts. Would therefore a
                    “viable” or “good” cause of action refer to a cause
                    of action that possesses a healthy likelihood of success? Counsel for the
                    plaintiff submitted that the affixation of these adjectives, prevalent in the
                    case law, indicated that the inquiry was one that necessarily segued into the
                    merits. This interpretation appeared to be a reasonable one, given the specific
                    insertion of “good” and “viable” over and above the
                    basic phrase “cause of action”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     To properly address the issue, I found it
                    instructive to refer to Jeffrey Pinsler SC, <em>Supreme Court
                        Practice 2009</em> (LexisNexis, 2009) at p 632:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The High Court [in <em>Asia Pacific</em> Breweries]
                        ruled that pre-action discovery should only be permitted if the potential
                        plaintiff is unable to initiate a case without the desired information.
                        …
                        <em>As the banks had indicated the causes of action that lay
                            against the defendant, pre-action discovery was inappropriate.
                            …</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Ng Giok Oh</em> and [<em>Asia
                            Pacific Breweries</em>] stand for the proposition that if the
                        claimant has sufficient evidence to mount a claim, he is not entitled to
                        discovery before proceedings in order to complete his ‘entire
                        picture’ of the case. He does not have the right to all the evidence
                        before he sues simply because this is not necessary. <em>If
                            it were otherwise, the ordinary processes of general and particular
                            discovery pursuant to O 24 r 1 and r 5 respectively would be rendered
                            otiose. Therefore, he is not allowed to
                        ‘snoop’</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">From the extract above it is clear that pre-action discovery is for
                    the plaintiff to come to a <em>determination of its cause(s) of
                        action</em>. It is not an opportunity for the plaintiff to come to an
                    early assessment of <em>the merits or strengths of its
                        case</em>. The plaintiff banks in <em>Asia Pacific
                        Breweries</em> had sufficient information and evidence to begin their
                    lawsuit against the defendant; indeed, no mention was made in Belinda Ang
                    J’s decision about the strength or weakness of the banks’ case.
                    Additionally, given that no plaintiff is “entitled to discovery before
                    proceedings in order to complete his ‘entire picture’ of the
                    case”, any talk about merits at that juncture would be both moot and
                    misguided; a half-formed impression of any case would be an unfaithful mirror to
                    that case’s true nature on the merits. The question posed at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above, therefore, has to be answered in the
                    negative – a “viable” or “good” cause of
                    action means no more than a cause of action that is made out in law. The two
                    adjectives do not express a degree, but rather indicate a binary
                inquiry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Support for this view may also be found in Kan
                    Ting Chiu J’s recent decision in <em>EC-Asia International
                        Ltd (in liquidation) v PricewaterhouseCoopers</em> [2011]
                    2 SLR 607 (“<em>EC-Asia</em>”), a
                    case in fact cited to me by counsel for the plaintiff. In this case, the
                    plaintiff had applied for pre-action discovery for the audit and working papers
                    of the defendant auditor, with the plaintiff’s liquidator taking the view
                    that the defendant’s audit procedures needed to be scrutinised carefully.
                    In reversing the assistant registrar’s decision disallowing pre-action
                    discovery, Kan J stated at [24]-[25]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The [l]iquidator had deposed in the affidavit in support of the
                        application that “the [d]efendants’ audit procedures need to be
                        scrutinized carefully” and, “although I have not come to a
                        firm conclusion on this, the [d]efendants are likely to be a party to future
                        proceedings”. <em>On a fair and careful reading of the
                            [l]iquidator’s affidavit, it was clear that the plaintiff was not
                            ready or able to plead a cause of action without reviewing the requested
                            papers … The [l]iquidator had explained in his affidavit that he
                            needed the audit papers and working papers to come to an informed
                            decision whether the plaintiff had a viable cause of action</em>.
                        Unless he was dishonest or wrong in his affidavit, his professional
                        conclusion should be accorded due weight, and there was nothing to suggest
                        that he was being disingenuous or was mistaken.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In granting pre-action discovery in <em>EC-Asia</em>, Kan J was concerned only with the binary question
                    of whether said discovery, if granted, would assist the plaintiff in making out
                    its cause of action. Indeed, in the extract above he uses the phrase
                    “cause of action” without prefixing it with “viable”
                    or “good”: a clear indication of the either-or nature of the test
                    for pre-action discovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Kan J therefore was interested only in
                    the <em>necessity</em> of such a grant: see Order 24
                    Rule 7 of the Rules of Court (“the Court may, if satisfied that
                    discovery is not necessary, or not necessary at that stage of the cause or
                    matter, dismiss or … adjourn the application”). He was not
                    interested, and it is readily apparent from the italicized portions above, in
                    whether the case against the defendant auditor was a strong or weak
                one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Counsel for the plaintiff nonetheless further
                    cited to me the following passage from <em>Atkin’s Court
                        Forms – Singapore</em> (LexisNexis, 2010) in support of her
                    proposition that in deciding whether or not to grant pre-action discovery, a
                    court should look to see if such discovery would strengthen the
                    plaintiff’s case (as opposed to merely furnishing a cause of action) (at
                    para XVII [803]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[803]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It has been suggested that one of the objects of pre-action discovery is
                        to enable the plaintiff to find out, before he starts proceedings, whether
                        he has a good cause of action against the defendant. This object would be
                        defeated if he has to show in advance that he has already got a good cause
                        of action before he saw the documents. <em>Hence, it has been
                            held that it is immaterial that the likelihood of the claim being made
                            against the defendant is dependent on the outcome of the
                            discovery</em>. The court is not precluded from making an order if
                        the only basis for saying that a claim was not likely was the absence of the
                        documents of which discovery was sought.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     This passage, to my mind, is a puzzling one.
                    There is a sizeable – and unexplained – logical leap between the
                    italicized sentence and the sentences that precede it. If the “likelihood
                    of the claim being made” (interpreting the phrase broadly to mean either
                    “likelihood of the cause of action being determined” or
                    “likelihood of success of the cause of action”) is <em>not</em> dependent on the outcome of the pre-action
                    discovery, why should any court grant pre-action discovery in the first place?
                    What would be the point of pre-action discovery, regardless of whichever test
                    for pre-action discovery employed, if its prospective result is discounted even
                    before its grant? Indeed, the remainder of the passage appears to indicate
                    otherwise: (to paraphrase) the court may grant pre-action discovery if the only
                    reason for saying that a claim is not likely is the absence of the selfsame
                    undiscovered documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Accordingly I am of the opinion that, at best,
                    the passage is of neutral value; it does not prefer either definition of
                    “good” or “viable”, as set out at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>-<a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above.
                    It merely employs the prefix “good” without defining it further.
                    At worst, the passage is internally inconsistent and somewhat incomprehensible.
                    In either case, the passage can be of no assistance to the position adopted by
                    counsel for the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     From the foregoing, we can see that pre-action
                    discovery occupies a very thin space in the civil procedure real estate. It
                    cannot be held to the same standards or be used for the same purposes as regular
                    discovery, as that would render the latter procedure redundant. It <em>must</em> be circumscribed by the one singular feature of its
                    existence, <em>viz</em>, its invocation <em>prior</em> to an action being brought. Accordingly, as has already
                    been stressed before, pre-action discovery should only be granted where a
                    plaintiff is unable to plead its case legally due to certain voids or gaps in
                    his or her knowledge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     That scenario is patently not the scenario
                    here. The plaintiff here knows his case: he did not authorise the defendant bank
                    to carry out the Transactions, whether over the telephone or otherwise. He
                    therefore has a cause of action against the defendant for entering into the same
                    purportedly on his behalf. Indeed, the plaintiff said as much in his initial
                    affidavit in support of this application, at para 16:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My causes of action against the [d]efendant in subsequent proceedings
                        would be for breach of contract or mandate, negligence, breach of fiduciary
                        duty and/or fraud, which has caused me loss and damage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Counsel for the plaintiff submitted the
                    English case of <em>Shaw v Vauxhall Motors Ltd</em> [1974]
                    1 WLR 1035 (“<em>Shaw</em>”) in an
                    attempt to draw an analogy between the circumstances in that case with those
                    here. In <em>Shaw</em>, the plaintiff was injured driving a
                    fork lift truck at the defendant’s factory. He subsequently sought
                    pre-action discovery of the fork lift truck’s maintenance records,
                    suspecting that the fork lift truck was defective. Lord Denning MR, in granting
                    the application for pre-action discovery, stated at pp 1039-1040:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">One of the objects of the section is to enable the plaintiff to find out
                        before he starts proceedings whether he has a good cause of action or not.
                        That object would be defeated if he had to show in advance that he already
                        had a good cause of action before he saw the documents. The reasoning
                        applies to the present case. <em>If the reports did show a
                            want of proper maintenance or repair of this truck, an action would no
                            doubt be brought. Whereas if they show that there was proper maintenance
                            and repair, an action would not be brought</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Counsel for the [plaintiff] has told us that [he] has only one cause of
                        complaint, namely, that this machine was defective; and furthermore, that if
                        the reports show that the machine was in good condition and that it was
                        properly maintained, the legal advisers would not feel able to recommend to
                        the legal aid fund a continuance of the proceedings. The claim would no
                        longer be proceeded with. That would be a great saving in costs. … I
                        would allow the appeal accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was argued by plaintiff’s counsel that <em>Shaw</em> was directly analogous to the facts at hand. In both cases,
                    the discovery of one category of items would resolve all dispute; in both cases,
                    pre-action discovery would lead to great savings in costs; in both cases, the
                    binary inquiry (see italicized portion above) countenanced would justify the
                    court’s employment of its discretion to allow pre-action
                discovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     To my mind, however, the present facts are
                    readily distinguishable from those in <em>Shaw</em>. To
                    begin with, the plaintiff here <em>is in possession of the
                        information that he seeks from the defendant bank</em>. The
                    Transactions involved significant sums of money. They were hardly likely to be
                    entered into carelessly or forgetfully by the plaintiff. Indeed, in his initial
                    affidavit the plaintiff was very certain that he “did not give any
                    instructions over the telephone or via any means verbally for the [Transactions]
                    to be entered into on [his] behalf”. Why should the presence or absence
                    of the Tape Recordings make any difference to this position? Unlike in <em>Shaw</em>, where the plaintiff genuinely had no idea about
                    the maintenance records of the fork lift truck, the plaintiff here <em>must have known</em> if he had authorised the Transactions.
                    It beggars belief that the plaintiff would contemplate filing a suit when he was
                    not even aware of what it was that he had or had not done. Indeed, his
                    affidavits were all filed based on his memory, a memory that was good enough for
                    him to specify causes of action (see <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>
                    above). Taken at face value, the plaintiff appears to be delegating the decision
                    of suing to the defendant; and, upon scrutiny, fishing around for evidence to
                    bolster causes of action already known.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Second, regardless of whether the Tape
                    Recordings are produced or even exist, <em>the plaintiff already
                        has his cause of action</em> (see above at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> again). The point about a “good” cause of
                    action, terminology employed in <em>Shaw</em> as well, has
                    already been discussed above at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>-<a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>. Suffice it to say that unlike here, the
                    plaintiff in <em>Shaw</em> could not have known his cause
                    of action without the maintenance records of the fork lift truck.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Third, the issue of costs savings is <em>logically subsequent</em> to the issue of whether or not a
                    cause of action may be made out without pre-action discovery. <em>Shaw</em> was a legal aid fund case, so costs were a primary concern;
                    but nonetheless it was not a case that disregarded principle in favour of
                    “practicalities” (to employ a phrase utilised by the
                    plaintiff’s counsel). It was first determined in <em>Shaw</em> that pre-action discovery was required in order that the
                    plaintiff could properly frame a cause of action (at p 1039); only thereafter
                    did considerations about costs arise (at p 1040). This mirrors the approach
                    taken in the extract from <em>Asia Pacific Breweries</em>
                    at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above, where Belinda Ang J, in
                    outlining the theoretical approach to pre-action discovery, first considered
                    issues of relevance, justifiability and necessity <em>before</em> segueing into any assessment of cost savings
                    (“Once the court is satisfied … that the criteria of the rule are
                    met, the next consideration is whether discovery is necessary … for
                    saving costs”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Counsel for the plaintiff separately submitted
                    that the plaintiff did not know whether to believe that the defendant actually
                    possessed the Tape Recordings in question, and that since a simple disclosure by
                    the defendant would allow the dispute to be cleanly resolved in one fell swoop,
                    pre-action discovery ought to be ordered. (The lack of belief was necessarily
                    so, for if he had believed the defendant this application would never have been
                    brought.) To my mind this argument was clearly flawed. In <em>Lian Teck</em>, Lai Siu Chiu J stated the following concerning
                    belief as a justification at [32] of her decision:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">32    … The basis put forward by the plaintiffs
                            for seeking pre-action discovery was their disbelief that A[sia]
                            P[acific] B[reweries] had no knowledge of the unauthorised accounts and
                            the unauthorised loans taken by Chia. However, disbelief of APB’s
                            position itself could not be a sufficient reason for seeking pre-action
                            discovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Asia Pacific Breweries</em>, Belinda
                    Ang J was of a similar view (at [25]-[26]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    It seems to me that the banks are not constrained
                            from starting proceedings without pre-action discovery. From their
                            contentions, it is obvious that the banks have taken a view as to
                            whether they have a case that [Asia Pacific Breweries] is responsible
                            for the loans and whether to plead a case. It has not been said anywhere
                            in the affidavits or in submissions by counsel that without pre-action
                            discovery the banks are unable to plead a case. This is unlike the case
                            of an applicant who is unable to plead a case as he does not yet know
                            whether he has a viable claim against the opponents, and needs
                            pre-action discovery to fill the void or gaps in his knowledge. That is
                            the nature (and I should add, function) of pre-action discovery, and the
                            rule is there to assist him to search for the answer
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    It is plain that the banks simply do not believe
                            anything that [Asia Pacific Breweries] has said. <em>In
                                my judgment, a disbelief of [Asia Pacific Breweries’] position
                                itself cannot be a sufficient reason for seeking pre-action
                                discovery. Otherwise, it will result in pre-action disclosure being
                                applied for as a matter of course. That is not what the procedure is
                                intended for. Invariably, cases that make their way to court are
                                founded on a mutual disbelief of each other’s perception of
                                things, and a face-off situation is common in any dispute before the
                                commencement of proceedings</em>. I have already pointed out
                            in [4] that the criterion of O 24 r 6(3) is intended to ensure that the
                            application for pre-action discovery is not brought frivolously or
                            without justification.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The positions taken in <em>Lian
                        Teck</em> and <em>Asia Pacific Breweries</em>
                    must be correct. Mutual disbelief is what engenders lawsuits; pre-action
                    discovery cannot be manipulated into becoming a matter-of-course application in
                    the name of “practicalities”. Although there appears to be
                    something to be said for the convenience that would be precipitated in the
                    present case via the disclosure of the Tape Recordings, this instinct towards
                    gratification has to be balanced against a wider policy interest in preventing
                    the widespread abuse of O 24 r 6.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Finally, I also found the plaintiff’s
                    reason for not wanting to listen to the Mavis recording to be disingenuous, and
                    indicative of his lack of <em>bona fides</em>. He had
                    expressed a desire to listen to conversations wherein his acknowledgment of the
                    Transactions was recorded, and indeed this application is for pre-action
                    discovery of the same. The Mavis recording was an example of one such
                    conversation. On what basis, then, did the plaintiff turn down the
                    defendant’s offer for him to listen to the Mavis recording? It surely
                    would have made no difference <em>which</em> recording he
                    listened to, had he been sincere in wanting to hear any proof of his sanctioning
                    the Transactions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In the light of all of the above, I dismissed
                    the plaintiff’s application. Costs were fixed at $8,000 on an indemnity
                    basis (exclusive of reasonable disbursements) pursuant to Order 24
                    Rule 6(9) of the Rules of Court (see above at <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>).</p>
