</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In connection with the claim that the pleaded Representations were false and fraudulently made, the Plaintiffs, in paragraph 26 of the SOC, set out a list of particulars in a number of sub-paragraphs. These included paragraph 26(d) which was the key sub-paragraph in dispute in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Paragraph 26(d) alleged that the Defendant had been “perpetrating a scam and never intended to carry out any of the Representations” made to the Plaintiffs. It went on to detail the Defendant’s fundraising methodology in a <span class="font-italic">separate </span>company incorporated in the US, Techmedia Advertising Inc (“TECM”), in which the Defendant was director, CEO and chairman. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 TECM was apparently a “development project” undertaken by the Defendant, and was on 17 February 2009 listed on the “US Over the Counter Bulletin Board”. I pause here to stress that there was no assertion or suggestion that the Plaintiffs were involved in any way with the TECM development project.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In order to raise funds for TECM, the board of directors, including the Defendant, resolved to offer private placement shares to private individuals from September 2008, enlisting the help of one Lim Tow Kwong (“Raymond”). Further, the Defendant had himself, between April and July 2009, offered to persons agreements to subscribe for securities in TECM. To entice investors, the Defendant claimed that TECM was due to be listed on the NASDAQ. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Both Raymond and the Defendant raised a substantial amount of money from the sale of securities to investors. Investors with US-dollar accounts remitted their investment money directly to a trust account set up on behalf of TECM. Investors who did not have a US-dollar account would pass their investment money directly to the Defendant, who would purportedly transfer the money to the trust account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 As it turned out, TECM failed to be listed on the NASDAQ, but was instead downgraded to a smaller and illiquid exchange due to a failure to file accounts. On 4 May 2011, a police report was lodged against Raymond. The investigations also involved the Defendant. Ultimately, on 31 March 2014, the Defendant was charged with, pleaded guilty to and convicted of an offence under s 82(1) of the Securities and Futures Act (Cap 289, 2006 Rev Ed) for carrying on a business in the dealing of securities without a valid capital markets services license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore. He was fined $150,000, in default of which he was to serve a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 According to the Plaintiffs, the statements in paragraph 26(d) were taken from the Agreed Statement of Facts (“ASOF”) in the criminal charge faced by the Defendant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Defendant’s pleaded case and the application to strike out</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In the Defence and Counterclaim, the Defendant denied the claims, and reserved the right to apply to strike out. According to the Defendant, the Plaintiffs had presented a business proposal for the <span class="font-italic">Solvesam </span>project to the Defendant in 2009. However, from February 2011, the Defendant discovered that the Plaintiffs had exaggerated and misrepresented the uniqueness and functionality of <span class="font-italic">Solvesam </span>and its business prospects. It was collectively decided by the parties that the <span class="font-italic">Solvesam </span>project would be discontinued.

First, she reasoned that the proceedings in the Suit were in the early stages, and that the Plaintiffs might eventually wish to lead evidence or make submissions at trial in relation the Defendant’s capacity for certain acts. To strike out paragraph 26(d) would be to unduly restrict the Plaintiffs’ latitude in bringing relevant evidence before the court at trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Second, she stated that paragraph 26(d) was relatively contained, as they appeared to be “straightforward matters of fact” more or less taken from the ASOF, which the Defendant had agreed to on a prior occasion. There was thus unlikely to be a serious dispute on these matters and the trial would not be delayed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Third, she did not consider paragraph 26(d) scandalous, frivolous or vexatious as it was not plainly irrelevant to the issues in the Suit.

This was especially because the statements contained in paragraph 26(d) were different from those set out in the ASOF. In any event, the matters in the ASOF were not strikingly similar to the present case. Finally, the statements in paragraph 26(d) did not even prove that the Defendant had made any fraudulent misrepresentations at all.

I shall briefly set them out below: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) O 18 r 19(1)(a): “it discloses no reasonable cause of action”. This involves an action which does not even have “some chance of success when only the allegations in the pleading are considered”: <span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others </span>[1997] 3 SLR(R) 649 (“<span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [21].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) O 18 r 19(1)(b): “it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious”. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) A matter is “scandalous” where it does not even have a “tendency to show” the truth of any allegation material to the relief sought: <span class="font-italic">Lai Swee Lin Linda v AG</span> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 565 at [67], citing <span class="font-italic">Christie v Christie </span>(1872-1873) LR 8 Ch App 499 at 503. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) “Frivolous or vexatious” means “obviously unsustainable” or “wrong”. A case that is “plainly and obviously unsustainable” is one which is either legally or factually unsustainable. A case is <span class="font-italic">legally unsustainable</span> if “it may be clear as a matter of law at the outset that even if a party were to succeed in proving all the facts that he offers to prove he will not be entitled to the remedy that he seeks”. A case is <span class="font-italic">factually unsustainable</span> if it is “possible to say with confidence before trial that the factual basis for the claim is fanciful because it is entirely without substance, [for example, if it is] clear beyond question that the statement of facts is contradicted by all the documents or other material on which it is based”:<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">The “Bunga Melati 5” </span>[2012] 4 SLR 546 at [39].</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) O 18 r 19(1)(b) could also apply to a case where the party bringing an action is not acting<span class="font-italic"> bona fide</span> and merely wishes to annoy or embarrass his opponent, or where there was a lack of purpose or seriousness in the party’s conduct of proceedings: <span class="font-italic">The </span>“<span class="font-italic">Osprey</span>”<span class="font-italic"> </span>[1999] 3 SLR(R) 1099 at [8].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) O 18 r 19(1)(c): “it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action”. Pleadings which could be struck out on this ground include those which are unnecessary, which include improper or irrelevant details, or where allegations unrelated to the issues were made for the purpose of embarrassing or vexing the opposing party: see Jeffrey Pinsler SC, <span class="font-italic">Principles of Civil Procedure</span> (Academy Publishing, 2013) at para 9.008. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) O 18 r 19(1)(d): “it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court”. An abuse of process of court means using the court machinery as a means of vexation and oppression in the process of litigation. For example, where a claim is brought not for the purposes of relief but for some other collateral or ulterior motive: <span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [22].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I should state at the outset that I was fully cognisant that the court should only exercise its power to strike out in “plain and obvious cases”. I was therefore careful not to carry out a minute and protracted examination of the documents and the facts of the case in reaching my decision: see <span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter </span>at [18] and <span class="font-italic">The “Osprey” </span>[1999] 3 SLR(R) 1099 at [6].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I now come to my decision on this appeal. I shall deal with each of the three issues at [37] above in turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Was paragraph 26(d) relevant to proving the state of mind of the Defendant?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The most critical question was whether paragraph 26(d) was relevant to prove the state of mind of the Defendant at the material time. In this regard, I noted the Plaintiffs’ position (at [21] above) that paragraph 26(d) was based on the ASOF in the Defendant’s conviction under s 82(1) of the Securities and Futures Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 At the hearing before me on 27 June 2016, there was no dispute that s 82(1) of the Securities and Futures Act sets out a strict liability offence. The Defendant’s <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>(<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>state of mind) therefore need not be proved in order to sustain his conviction. In other words, the Defendant’s plea of guilt and subsequent conviction would not have been conclusive on the issue of whether he had any <span class="font-italic">fraudulent intent</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at the time of the offence. Further, the Defendant also did not admit anywhere in the ASOF that he had the intention to cheat or defraud the investors of TECM. The ASOF only stated that the Defendant had carried out the objectionable <span class="font-italic">ac</span><span class="font-italic">t</span> of “offer[ing] to persons agreements to subscribe for securities in [TECM]”, without any comment on the Defendant’s <span class="font-italic">state of mind</span>.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 On this fundamental premise, I could not see how paragraph 26(d) of the SOC, which was based on the ASOF and the TECM project, could be used as evidence to prove the Defendant’s state of mind at the relevant time, and especially so in respect of the Representations complained of in connection with the agreement to raise funds for the <span class="font-italic">Solvesam</span> project. Indeed, the ASOF and conviction for the s 82(1) offence did not even have a “tendency to show” the fraudulent state of mind the Defendant allegedly had when making the Representations. Leaving paragraph 26(d) in the SOC would only serve to prejudice the Defendant’s case or embarrass him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Consequently, I did not consider it necessary to make a ruling as to whether the contents of paragraph 26(d) were “strikingly similar” to the present case such as to make them relevant facts under ss 14 and/or 15 of the Evidence Act. I should add for completeness that even if I had found that paragraph 26(d) <span class="font-italic">might</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>be relevant to the state of mind of the Defendant at the material time (which I did not), the question of admissibility of such similar fact evidence should in any case be left to the trial judge who would be in the best position to make the assessment at the appropriate junction after due submissions from the parties on the law. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Were the contents of paragraph 26(d) otherwise relevant to the Suit?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Having considered that paragraph 26(d) was not relevant in proving the state of mind of the Defendant, the second issue was whether it was nonetheless closely connected to the Suit such as to be relevant. After careful consideration, I was of the view that it was not. This was for the following reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 First, it was clear that the Representations made by the Defendant as pleaded at paragraph 23 of the SOC and stated at [13] above, bore little relation to the fundraising exercise at TECM described in paragraph 26(d) of the SOC. To recapitulate, the three purported Representations made by the Defendant in the Suit at hand were as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Defendant intended to lead the fundraising exercise in the name of SSI without any links back to Tecbiz; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The funds raised under the subscription agreement had to be under the Defendant’s control, because the potential investor only trusted the Defendant; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Defendant intended to procure the transfer and disbursement of US$900,000 to each of the Plaintiffs and the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Representations complained of in the Suit did not even refer to the promise to potential investors that SSI was due to be listed on the NASDAQ, when this was a crucial representation made by the Defendant in the fundraising exercise of TECM. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I also did not accept the Plaintiffs’ argument that the website hosted in China (see [31] above) constituted evidence of some relationship between the fundraising in TECM and that in SSI. As the Defendant’s counsel pointed out during the hearing of this appeal, the website referred to by the Plaintiffs was a personal blog and could hardly be relied on as an objective commentary on the connection, if any, between the two companies. Further, the reference to TECM merely appeared at the bottom of the webpage, without any corresponding description or explanation,

</div> and was of no assistance to the Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 For the above reasons, I could not see how the reference to the fundraising efforts in TECM outlined in paragraph 26(d) could be relied on to prove that the Representations in this Suit were similarly false, or that the Defendant must have had fraudulent intent at the time of making those Representations. Fundamentally, the representations made in each case were different, and there was no satisfactory evidence to show that the fundraisings were at all related. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Did the inclusion of paragraph 26(d) unduly delay the present proceedings?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The final question was whether allowing paragraph 26(d) to remain in the SOC would unduly delay the fair trial of the Suit. In this respect, I noted that the AR said paragraph 26(d) was “relatively contained” and “appear[ed] to [contain] straightforward matters of fact”. She opined that it was “more or less taken from an [ASOF] which the Defendant had agreed to on a prior occasion” and that these facts were “unlikely to be seriously disputed”. As a result, she was of the view that the trial “would not be delayed on account of this paragraph”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 With respect, I did not think that the situation was quite as clear. In the course of the submissions, it became evident that paragraph 26(d) would become a substantial bone of contention in the Suit, even at the interlocutory stages such as during discovery and the preparation of affidavits of evidence-in-chief. At the discovery stage, for example, the Defendant would be obliged to provide discovery of all relevant documents that could adversely affect his own case, or support the Plaintiffs’ case (see O 24 r 1(2) of the Rules of Court). This would almost certainly require the disclosure of all relevant documents relating to the Defendant’s previous offence, above and beyond the ASOF and conviction already referred to. Indeed, counsel for the Plaintiffs was unable to commit to limiting the documents he would be relying on to only the ASOF and conviction. Moreover, he candidly admitted during the hearing that the inclusion of paragraph 26(d) would allow him to seek specific discovery of other documents which would lead him to a “train of inquiry” to obtain the information he needed (see O 24 r 5 of the Rules of Court). These would, in my mind, invariably lead to interlocutory applications being filed and vigorously opposed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Further, I was also of the view that the inclusion of paragraph 26(d) would unduly lengthen the actual trial. The Defendant had already raised contentions in his submissions and during the hearing of this appeal that paragraph 26(d) was not even an accurate summary of the ASOF. For example, he said that the ASOF did not state that the Defendant sought to “entice investors” by claiming that TECM was due to list on the NASDAQ.

</div> The Defendant also submitted that if paragraph 26(d) was allowed to remain in the SOC, he would certainly have to dispute the Plaintiffs’ allegations by way of “both evidence and submissions”.

</div> I was therefore not convinced that the statements in paragraph 26(d) were “unlikely to be seriously disputed”. Instead, I envisaged that a not insubstantial amount of evidence would need to be led, with additional witnesses called for the trial, if paragraph 26(d) was not struck out. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 For the above reasons, I allowed the Defendant’s appeal.
