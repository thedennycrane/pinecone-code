</div> The court agreed with the first defendant that the property division order should not be varied in so far as it related to the second defendant’s rights (see [32] above).

In brief, the Appeal Board held that a Syariah Court does not have jurisdiction to vary a property division order in favour of non-party to the marriage (in this case, the plaintiff). The Appeal Board rested its decision on two grounds. First, a Syariah Court, when exercising matrimonial jurisdiction under s 35(2) and s 52 of the AMLA, does not have personal jurisdiction or power to determine the substantive rights of a non-party to the marriage even if the non-party had obtained leave to intervene in the matrimonial proceedings.

</div> Second, given that the foundation of the plaintiff’s claim was a proprietary interest in the Flat to the extent of $205,359.80, that interest was not “property” within the meaning of s 52(14) of the AMLA and was therefore not susceptible to a Syariah Court’s power to make orders for the disposition or division of “property” in the exercise of its matrimonial jurisdiction under s 52(3) of the AMLA.

Her evidence (see [63] below) is that it was the second defendant who repeatedly asked her to hand him $205,359.80, knowing that she had come into a substantial sum of money in early 2015. The second defendant does not deny this aspect of the plaintiff’s evidence. I accept the plaintiff’s evidence. Equally, the first defendant did not conceive or initiate the plan which has given rise to this dispute. Her evidence is that she did not at any time ask the second defendant to give her any part of this $205,359.80.

First, the second defendant would persuade the plaintiff to hand $205,359.80 to him. Second, he would hand the money to the first defendant and direct her to deposit it into her CPF account. Third, he would persuade the first defendant to do as he directed. Fourth, the first defendant would use part of the money to repay the HDB Loan in full and thereby discharge the HDB’s charge on the Flat.

</div> Fifth, the second defendant would persuade the first defendant to transfer her interest in the Flat to him. Finally, the first defendant would apply the remainder of the $205,359.80 in her CPF account towards purchasing a new flat to house herself and the defendants’ child.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In my view, the second defendant’s use of the word “purchase” (see [54] above) means that he intended the $205,359.80 which he was to hand the first defendant in the second step of his plan to be the consideration for her transfer to him of her interest in the Flat in the fifth step. This has three consequences. First, it means that he did not intend the $205,359.80 to be a gift from him to the first defendant. He expected something in exchange. Second, it means that he did not expect her to make a gift to him of her interest in the Flat. He intended to give her something in exchange. Third, it means that he did not expect to pay her anything more than $205,359.80 in order to secure her transfer of her interest in the Flat to him and in consideration of the transfer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Several points puzzled me about the second defendant’s plan. Why did the second defendant ask the plaintiff for the precise figure of $205,359.80? Why did he not just ask the plaintiff for the $125,717.15 necessary to repay the HDB Loan and instead ask for about $80,000 more? And why did the money have to be paid into the <span class="font-italic">first</span> defendant’s CPF account rather than into the <span class="font-italic">second</span> defendant’s CPF account (to fund his purchase of the first defendant’s share of the Flat in the fifth step) or directly in cash to the HDB (to repay the HDB Loan)?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 None of the parties offered a direct answer to these questions in evidence or in submissions. And the answer is ultimately immaterial to the issues I have to decide. But purely by way of background, it appears that the answer to both questions is related to the fact that the first defendant’s CPF account was “depleted”

It is therefore likely that the plaintiff also knew that the first defendant would have to purchase another flat for that purpose.

</div> The second defendant repaid the HDB Loan in full only in September 2015. That leaves only a window of only about a month, from September to October 2015, in which the plaintiff was eligible to own an interest in an HDB flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The discrepancy may be more apparent than real. The plaintiff’s evidence can be reconciled with the second defendant’s evidence by taking both their evidence as referring to the possibilities I identify at [75] below as ways in which the second defendant could account to the plaintiff for the $205,359.80. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In any event, in so far as there is an unreconciled discrepancy in the evidence on this point, I am inclined to accept the plaintiff’s evidence. Her evidence is consistent with the second defendant’s first account of his plan, which he gave to the Syariah Court in the variation application.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Plaintiff’s 13 October 2020 affidavit, p 27, para 6.</div>
</div>

</div>
</div> In that affidavit, he makes no reference to the plaintiff acquiring the Flat through him. He says simply that he obtained the money from the plaintiff and handed it to the first defendant in order for <span class="font-italic">him</span> to “take over the [Flat] and reimbursed [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] the [first defendant’s] CPF money”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Even if I am wrong on this, I consider it to be ultimately immaterial to my findings as to the parties’ knowledge and intention. Whichever account is true, it was their common intention that one or other of them was to become the sole owner of the Flat in the fifth step of the plan, in exchange for and in consideration of the plaintiff’s $205,359.80. This apparent discrepancy therefore does not alter my finding that carrying out the second defendant’s six-step plan was the common intention of the second defendant and the plaintiff from, at the latest, February 2015. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">As against the second defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 I now turn to consider the plaintiff’s knowledge and intention as against the second defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I begin by finding that the second defendant and the plaintiff did not discuss what, if anything, the plaintiff was to receive from the second defendant in return for the two cashier’s orders, let alone agree or arrive at any understanding to that effect. I make that finding because the plaintiff and the second defendant give no evidence whatsoever of any contemporaneous discussion, agreement or understanding between them in February and March 2015 as to whether the two cashier’s orders: (a) were or were not a gift from the plaintiff to the second defendant; (b) were or were not a loan from the plaintiff to the second defendant; or (c) would or would not yield in favour of the plaintiff a proprietary interest in the Flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The plaintiff’s evidence on this point is that she did not intend $205,359.80 to be a gift to the second defendant because she “reasoned that any monies handed to 2nd Defendant by [her] would be returned to [her] in some way” (see [63] above). I make two points about this. First, this is the plaintiff’s evidence of her contemporaneous internal rationalisation to herself of her decision to hand the two cashier’s orders to the second defendant. It is not her evidence of a discussion, agreement or understanding with him that this was the basis on which she was doing so. Second, this is a self-serving statement which she now makes with the benefit of hindsight, knowing that the second defendant’s plan has gone awry at the fifth step. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 On the basis of the plaintiff’s own evidence, I find that she handed the two cashier’s orders to the second defendant in total reliance on her subjective, self-engendered expectation that he would return $205,359.80 to her in some way. There are many means by which the second defendant could do this. He could become the sole owner of the Flat, sell it and pay $205,359.80 to the plaintiff out of the Flat’s net proceeds of sale. She expressly refers to this means of returning the money to her in her evidence (see [63] above). But she also expressly describes this as only one of the “means or ways” by which he could “return” $205,359.80 to her. Although she does not elaborate upon the other means, it is not difficult to posit them. He could simply pay her $205,359.80 at some point in the future. He could become the sole owner of the Flat and add her as a co-owner for no additional consideration. He could abandon the fifth step of the plan and procure the first defendant to transfer the Flat to the plaintiff and the second defendant as joint owners. He could acquire the first defendant’s interest in the Flat, discharge his own CPF charge and transfer the Flat to the plaintiff’s sole name. He could leave the Flat to the plaintiff in his will. The important point is that neither the plaintiff nor the second defendant have given any evidence that any of these ways or means was actually the subject of any discussion, agreement or even understanding between the second defendant and the plaintiff at any time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 I therefore find that the plaintiff handed the two cashier’s orders to the second defendant in 2015 relying on and induced by nothing more than: (a) his request for the money as her husband in an unregistered marriage; and (b) her faith in him, as her <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> husband, that he would do the right thing and return $205,359.80 to her by some unspecified means and at some unspecified time in the future. In that sense, she handed the two cashier’s orders to the second defendant as an advance to the second defendant to enable him to acquire the first defendant’s interest in the Flat, but with no agreement or even expectation as to the manner or time the second defendant would return it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I find further that this subjective and self-engendered expectation is all that the plaintiff means when she says that she did not intend the two cashier’s orders to be a gift to the second defendant (see [63] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 I turn now to consider the knowledge and intention of the first defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The first defendant’s knowledge and intention </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The first defendant’s evidence is that: (a) she did not know until 2016 that the plaintiff was the source of the two cashier’s orders;

The 2nd defendant was not around at that time but the three men informed me that the 2nd Defendant had taken substantial of monies from their sister. They had said that their sister had recently sold her Clementi flat and had given the proceeds thereof to the 2nd Defendant. They had also demanded that the 2nd Defendant repay all those monies owed to their sister. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16. After this incident, I had questioned the 2nd Defendant on the sources of the Cashier’s Orders.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The consequences of these findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 These findings have four important consequences. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The first consequence is that the plaintiff’s intention in handing the two cashier’s orders to the second defendant was not vitiated or defective in any way. She was not induced to hand the two cashier’s orders to him by a fraud which he perpetrated on her. Plaintiff’s counsel confirmed several times that the plaintiff makes no allegation of fraud against the second defendant. Further, she was not induced to hand the two cashier’s orders to him by any kind of mistake. Neither of these points form any part of the plaintiff’s case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 As I have found, the second defendant was honest with the plaintiff about his plan. The plaintiff knew all six steps of his plan. The second defendant and the plaintiff formed a common intention to execute the plan. And she handed the two cashier’s orders to him with that knowledge and intention. She was labouring under no deception or mistake. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The second consequence is the plaintiff did not intend to make a loan of the $205,359.80 to the second defendant. A loan entails a legal obligation on the second defendant to repay the money to the plaintiff. On my findings, neither the plaintiff nor the second defendant intended any such legal obligation. When the plaintiff handed the two cashier’s orders to the second defendant, she was induced by and relied on only her own subjective, self-engendered expectation that the second defendant would return $205,359.80 in some unspecified way and at some unspecified time. She did not do so induced by, in reliance on or in exchange for his undertaking to repay $205,359.80 to her.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The third consequence is that the plaintiff intended to part with her property in the two cashier’s orders and their proceeds when she handed them to the second defendant. I say that for two reasons. First, the third, fourth and fifth steps of the plan (see [55] above) could be carried out only if the plaintiff parted with her property in the two cashier’s orders and their proceeds. Second, as I have found, the plaintiff’s evidence that she did not intend the two cashier’s orders to be a gift to the second defendant means only that she had a subjective, self-engendered expectation that he would return $205,359.80 to her in some unspecified way and at some unspecified time. Her evidence that the two cashier’s orders were not a gift does not suggest that she intended in some way to retain property in the two cashier’s orders or their proceeds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The fourth consequence of these findings is that what the first defendant did with the two cashier’s orders and their proceeds did not in any way deceive the second defendant or in any way defeat the common intention of the second defendant and the plaintiff. What the first defendant did with the two cashier’s orders and their proceeds was exactly what the second defendant and the plaintiff intended her to do with them: she paid them into her CPF account and used the proceeds in part to repay the HDB Loan and secure the total discharge of the HDB’s charge on the Flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 It is true that the first defendant has not transferred her interest in the Flat to the second defendant. Instead, she commenced divorce proceedings against him, in the course of which she secured for herself the entire interest in the Flat. But, on the basis of my findings at [81] to [82] above about the second defendant’s knowledge and intention, that failure is not a breach of any obligation by the first defendant. Nor is it unconscionable behaviour warranting the intervention of equity. Indeed, the second defendant does not allege that he disclosed his plan to the first defendant let alone that he reached any agreement or even understanding with her that she would transfer her interest in the Flat to him. That is no doubt why neither the plaintiff nor the second defendant suggests that, by commencing the divorce proceedings and by securing the entire interest in the Flat for herself by way of the property division order, the first defendant has breached any legal obligation to them, defrauded them or even acted unconscionably towards them warranting the intervention of equity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 I now turn to consider each of the plaintiff’s claims against the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: Institutional constructive trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 I deal first with the plaintiff’s claim that the first defendant holds $205,359.80 on an institutional constructive trust for the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parties’ cases</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The plaintiff’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The plaintiff rests her case on this claim on four submissions: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The foundation of an institutional constructive trust lies in unconscionability.

That is not, however, the true legal relationship between the CPF Board and its members. In law, the CPF Board holds the credit balances in all of its members’ accounts as a single fund on a single trust for all members (see s 6(2) of the Central Provident Fund Act 1953 (2020 Rev Ed) (“the CPF Act”)). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The trust on which the CPF Board holds the credit balance in a member’s account is a <span class="font-italic">sui generis</span> trust in two fundamental respects. First, it is established by statute, not by the voluntary act of a settlor. Second, Parliament has heavily modified the duties of the CPF Board as trustee and the rights of a CPF member as the <span class="font-italic">cestui que trust</span> by the provisions of the CPF Act and the regulations made under it. But the fact remains that the CPF Board is not the debtor of a CPF member for the credit balance in her account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 I consider this assumption to be immaterial to the analysis. If the plaintiff cannot succeed if the two cashier’s orders are assumed to have increased a debt which the CPF Board owed to the first defendant at common law, <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span> the plaintiff cannot succeed if the two cashier’s orders are treated as an accretion to a single trust fund which the CPF Board holds on an express <span class="font-italic">sui generis</span> trust for all members, including but not limited to the first defendant, in equity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The second assumption I make is that the proceeds of the two cashier’s orders remain somehow sufficiently identifiable in the CPF Board’s hands as to be capable of being the subject matter of any sort of trust, whether express or implied and whether institutional or remedial. That assumption operates in the plaintiff’s favour in two senses. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 First, on the available evidence, only $79,642.65 out of the proceeds of the two cashier’s orders remains even notionally identifiable in the first defendant’s CPF account (see [21] above). The remainder of the $205,359.80 (being $125,717.15) was paid out of the first defendant’s CPF ordinary account to the HDB to repay the HDB Loan in full. That sum is no longer capable of being the subject matter of a trust. The plaintiff’s repeated reference to the “traceable proceeds” of the two cashier’s orders do not assist her. That sum was not used to acquire the Flat in 2002 but was used instead to repay the HDB Loan in full in 2015. Plaintiff’s counsel confirmed that she does not rely on backwards tracing.

</div> As authority for this proposition, the plaintiff relies on the <span class="font-italic">dictum</span> of Millett LJ (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Paragon Finance plc v DB Thakerar &amp; C</span><span class="font-italic">o</span> [1999] 1 All ER 400, cited in <span class="font-italic">Guy Neale and others v Nine Squares Pty Ltd </span>[2015] 1 SLR 1097 (“<span class="font-italic">Guy Neale (CA)</span>”) at [124]–[125]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A constructive trust arises by operation of law whenever the circumstances are such that it would be unconscionable for the owner of property (usually but not necessarily the legal estate) to assert his own beneficial interest in the property and deny the beneficial interest of another.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The plaintiff’s foundational proposition is fundamentally misconceived. A constructive trust is not equity’s response to conduct by T which is unconscionable only in the general sense of being conduct which is either not right or reasonable or which is contrary to good conscience. Unconscionability in that general sense is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for a constructive rust to arise. The Court of Appeal made that clear in <span class="font-italic">Guy Neale (CA)</span> (at [124]) by framing Millett LJ’s <span class="font-italic">dictum</span> as merely a <span class="font-italic">general</span> definition of an institutional constructive trust rather than a comprehensive definition. It is significant that the Court of Appeal went on to situate the facts of<span class="font-italic"> Guy Neal</span><span class="font-italic">e (CA) </span>within one of the specific categories and circumstances in which an institutional constructive trust arises, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a person making a profit in breach of his fiduciary duty (at [126]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In my view, T holds her rights in property on constructive trust for B if, and only if, a set of circumstances have transpired in relation to those rights which equity recognises by accretion of judicial decision are sufficient to render it unconscionable for T to exercise those rights as she sees fit, disregarding B. Equity responds to the unconscionability by burdening T’s rights in the property with a set of equitable duties to B. This set of duties includes, at the very least, the core duties of a fiduciary, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the duty not to make a profit out of his fiduciary position and duty not to put himself in a position where his own interests and his duty to his principal are in conflict (<span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong v Sakae Holdings Ltd and other appeals and other matters</span> [2018] 2 SLR 333 (“<span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong</span>”) at [135]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The reciprocal of this set of equitable duties is a set of reflected equitable rights vested in B. This set of rights is persistent in the sense that it is capable in equity of following T’s rights in the property as she transfers those rights to third parties. As a result, lawyers and judges are accustomed to thinking of B’s rights under an institutional constructive trust as being proprietary rights against a particular asset enforceable against the world at large. That serves as a useful model for most practical purposes, although it is not entirely accurate conceptually. The more accurate conceptual model is to think of B’s equitable rights as personal rights which burden T’s rights in the property in a manner which is capable in equity of surviving T’s transfer of those rights to a third party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The specific categories of unconscionability which equity recognises as being capable of giving rise to an institutional constructive trust were helpfully enumerated in <span class="font-italic">Low Heng Leon Andy v Low Kian Beng Lawrence (administrator of the estate of Tan Ah Kng, deceased)</span> [2011] SGHC 184 (at [53], cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">Guy Neale and others v Nine Squares Pty Ltd</span> [2013] SGHC 249 at [141]):</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) fraud;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the retention of property acquired as a result of a crime causing death;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) a profit in breach of a fiduciary duty;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) the retention of property by a vendor after the vendor had entered into a specifically enforceable contract to sell the property;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) the changing of a will by the survivor of two persons who had entered into a contract to execute wills in a common form;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(f) the acquisition of land expressly subject to the interests of a third party;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(g) the assertion of full entitlement to property after a common intention to share property had been formed (also known as a “common intention constructive trust”).</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 This list of categories is not of course closed. And each category in this list is not of course so rigid as to be incapable of development. But there is a very strong policy imperative, both at common law and in equity, for rights in property to be stable and for the law to allocate and alter those rights only in a manner which is transparent, consistent and predictable. Equity therefore develops each category within this list incrementally, by analogy to existing cases within the category. Equally, it adds categories to this list incrementally, by analogy to the existing categories. And this development and addition is done in the usual way: by accretion of judicial decision. Equity does not develop or add to these categories in an unprincipled and <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> way, turning on a particular judge’s subjective opinion in a particular case as to whether T has engaged in conduct which is or is not unconscionable in some general sense of the word.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Two consequences follow from this conception of an institutional constructive trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 First, an institutional constructive trust arises in real time, without any need for B to have resort to a court of equity. Thus, T will hold her rights in particular property on institutional constructive trust for B by reason of and upon the requirements of that specific category of unconscionability being satisfied. An institutional constructive trust is not imposed by the court, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it is not created by judicial decree following litigation (as opposed to a remedial constructive trust). The court’s function is merely to declare that an institutional constructive trust arose at a specific time in the past: <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[1996] AC 669<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span>") at 714–715, cited in <span class="font-italic">Ching Mun Fong (executrix of the estate of Tan Geok Tee, deceased) v Liu Cho Chit </span>[2001] 1 SLR(R) 856 (“<span class="font-italic">Ching Mun Fong</span>”) at [35]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Second, an institutional constructive trust arises independently of any intention on B’s or T’s part to create a trust or to constitute T a fiduciary for B. That is so whether the intention is approached from the perspective of: (a) a bilateral or unilateral intention held subjectively by T and B <span class="font-italic">ex ante</span>; (b) an intention which the court can ascertain objectively from T’s and B’s conduct; and even (c) an intention which the court is prepared to impute to T or B <span class="font-italic">ex post</span><span class="font-italic"> facto</span>. Their intention is relevant only in so far as it goes towards establishing the specific head of unconscionability at [107(g)] above, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, what is commonly referred to as the common intention constructive trust.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The first defendant’s conduct is not within any recognised category of unconscionability</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 The plaintiff’s case is that an institutional constructive trust arose in her favour only in May 2019, when the first defendant filed her affidavit in the variation proceedings, and at no other time. That is when the first defendant either: (a) unconscionably claimed to be entitled to return only $53,653.80 to the plaintiff after having earlier indicated her intention to return $205,359.80 to the plaintiff in full; or (b) unconscionably refused to return $205,359.80 in full to the plaintiff despite knowing that the plaintiff was the source of the two cashier’s orders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 That necessarily means that it is <span class="font-italic">not</span> the plaintiff’s case that the first defendant behaved unconscionably on any occasion before May 2019. In particular, it is not her case that the first defendant behaved unconscionably: (a) in February and March 2015, when she received the two cashier’s orders;

That leaves only categories (a), (c), (f) and (g) which require further analysis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Category (a) simply cannot apply. A transfer of property procured by fraud gives rise to an institutional constructive trust as against the fraudulent transferee: <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span> at 716; <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity </span>(John McGhee &amp; Steven Elliott eds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 34th Ed, 2020) (“<span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span>”) at paras 26-011 and 26-013. But, as I have mentioned, the plaintiff disavows any allegation of fraud as against the second defendant. The position must be <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span> as against the first defendant. There is no suggestion of any direct dealing between the plaintiff and the first defendant at the time the second defendant handed the two cashier’s orders to the first defendant in 2015.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 In any event, on the plaintiff’s own case, the time to assess whether the first defendant’s intent was fraudulent is May 2019 (see [112] above). The first defendant made no fraudulent statement to the plaintiff in May 2019. Even if I go beyond the plaintiff’s case and assume that the first defendant was fraudulent <span class="font-italic">before</span> May 2019 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> in April 2018) in falsely acknowledging and confirming her intention to return $205,359.80 to the plaintiff in full, there is still no fraud. The elements of inducement, reliance and detriment are all absent. The first defendant did not induce the plaintiff to do anything to her own detriment at any time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Category (c) simply cannot apply. This category requires a fiduciary relationship between T and B which pre-dates and is independent of the institutional constructive trust which is now said to have arisen. The plaintiff does not allege that the first defendant owed fiduciary duties to her <span class="font-italic">before</span> May 2019 or in some way independently of the first defendant’s conduct in May 2019.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Category (f) simply cannot apply. The first defendant did not acquire any interest in land which was subject to the plaintiff’s interests. The only interest in land which the first defendant acquired arose upon, and by termination of, the HDB’s charge on the Flat, leaving the Flat unencumbered. Neither the Flat nor the charge was at any time subject to any interest of the plaintiff. The Flat was owned at all times only by the first defendant and the second defendant, both at law and in equity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Category (g) requires the following conditions to be satisfied: (a) that T and B share a common intention that the beneficial interest in a property is to be shared; and (b) B relies to his detriment on this common intention (see <span class="font-italic">Lai Hoon Woon (executor and trustee of the estate of Lai Thai Lok, deceased) v Lai Foong Sin and another</span> [2016] SGHC 113 at [141]; <span class="font-italic">Sumoi Paramesvaeri v Fleury, Jeffrey Gerard and another</span> [2016] 5 SLR 302 (“<span class="font-italic">Sumoi</span>”) at [62]).

If these conditions are satisfied, equity will not permit T to exercise her rights in the property in a manner which is inconsistent with T’s and B’s common intention. The plaintiff does not allege that there was any common intention as between her and the first defendant. The plaintiff did not at any time act in reliance on any common intention as between her and the first defendant. The plaintiff relied only on (as I have found) her faith in the second defendant as her <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> husband. There being no common intention, the issue of detriment does not even arise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 The first defendant’s conduct at any time, including in May 2019, does not come within any of the categories of unconscionability which equity has recognised by accretion of judicial decision as giving rise to an institutional constructive trust. Further, none of these categories can be developed incrementally or by analogy to encompass the first defendant’s conduct in a way which is consistent with the policy imperative for rights in property to be stable and for the law to allocate and alter those rights only in a manner which is transparent, consistent and predictable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 I therefore hold that the first defendant did not become an institutional constructive trustee for the plaintiff as the plaintiff alleges or at all.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">No unconscionability in the general sense</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In case I am wrong in this, I find also that the first defendant did not behave in any way which was unconscionable in the general sense.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">No unconscionability in resiling from statements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 The plaintiff’s case on her first ground of unconscionability in the general sense proceeds as follows. On five occasions the first defendant made statements expressly: (a) acknowledging that the two cashier’s orders were the plaintiff’s property; (b) confirming either that she was not entitled to retain $205,359.80 out of the net proceeds of sale or that she was obliged to return $205,359.80 to the plaintiff out of the net proceeds of sale.

At the OS stage, it wasn’t ordered to be returned to her because she was not a party to the proceedings. But this hasn’t been done yet as flat has not been sold.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Despite making these express statements, including in the first defendant’s May 2019 affidavit, she claimed in that very same affidavit to be entitled to set off substantial sums against the $205,359.80 (see [123(b)] above) leaving only $53,653.80 to be returned to the plaintiff. This, the plaintiff submits, is unconscionable in the general sense and constitutes the first defendant an institutional constructive trustee of $205,359.80 for the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 I do not accept that the first defendant behaved unconscionably in taking the position that she did in May 2019. I say that for three reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 First, the plaintiff does not allege that any of statements on any of these five occasions was made fraudulently. The plaintiff therefore accepts that each statement was made honestly in the sense that the statement reflected accurately the first defendant’s true intention at the time she made the statement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Second, none of these statements rises to the level of a promise to the plaintiff. A promise is a bilateral statement of intention as to future conduct expressed by a promisor to a promisee: see <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore </span>(Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) at paras 03.021 and 04.001. None of these statements satisfies that test. None of them is: (a) an express or implied representation that the first defendant’s intention would never change; or (b) an express or implied undertaking to carry out that intention in the future. It cannot be unconscionable in a general sense, and thereby give rise to an institutional constructive trust, for T to act contrary to a statement of intent which was not made fraudulently, and which does not rise to the level of a promise. To hold otherwise would subvert the entire fabric of the law of obligations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Third, the result is the same even if I take the plaintiff’s case at its highest and construe these statements as the first defendant’s irrevocable and unqualified promises to return $205,359.80 to the plaintiff in full. First of all, the plaintiff did not in any way rely on these presumed promises to her detriment. The only detriment which the plaintiff ever suffered was suffered in 2015, when she handed the two cashier’s orders to the second defendant. In suffering that detriment, as I have found, she was induced by and relied only on her faith in the second defendant as her <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> husband. The plaintiff could not, in 2015, have relied to her detriment in any way on these presumed promises made in 2019. Nor did the plaintiff give any consideration in 2019 for these presumed promises. A breach of a promise made by T which is unsupported by consideration, or at the very least which does not induce detrimental reliance, cannot be sufficient unconscionability to constitute T a constructive trustee for B. Once again, to hold otherwise would subvert the entire fabric of the law of obligations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Separately, the first defendant’s breach in May 2019 of a promise to return $205,359.80 to the plaintiff cannot give rise to a constructive trust. The plaintiff handed the two cashier’s orders to the second defendant in 2015. He handed them to the first defendant in 2015. She deposited them into her CPF account in accordance with the common intention of the second defendant and the plaintiff. There is no unconscionability in the general sense in the first defendant claiming to be entitled to return only $53,653.80 in May 2019 even if I assume that she promised to return $205,359.80 in full to the plaintiff at some time before that.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">No unconscionability after the first defendant learned the truth</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The alternative way in which the plaintiff puts her case on unconscionability is that the first defendant acted unconscionably when she insisted in May 2019 on retaining $205,359.80, even in part, with knowledge that the plaintiff was the source of the two cashier’s orders.

B brought an action against T seeking to trace and recover the duplicate payment. On these facts, Goulding J held that T was a constructive trustee of the duplicate payment for B on the basis that “a person who pays money to another under a factual mistake retains an equitable property in it and the conscience of that other is subjected to a fiduciary duty to respect his proprietary right” (at 119).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 <span class="font-italic">Chase Manhattan </span>does not support the plaintiff’s case for two reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 First, the plaintiff did not make any payment to the first defendant. She handed the cashier’s orders to the second defendant. In that sense, she made a payment to the second defendant and only to the second defendant. It was the second defendant who made the payment to the first defendant. It cannot be said that the second defendant was acting as the plaintiff’s agent in procuring the two cashier’s orders and handing them to the first defendant. It was the second defendant who conceived the entire plan which has led to this dispute. He was at all times acting as principal, not agent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Second, even if I were to treat the second defendant as being merely the plaintiff’s agent, the fact remains that the plaintiff was not labouring under any mistake when she handed the cashier’s orders to the second defendant. Whether B is labouring under a mistake must be determined by reference to B’s state of mind and the state of facts or the law at the time at which B made the transfer<span class="font-italic"> </span>(see also Tang Hang Wu, <span class="font-italic">Principles of the Law of Restitution in Singapore </span>(Academy Publishing, 2019) (“<span class="font-italic">Law of Restitution in Singapore</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 04.011).

The state of mind of the payer must be related to the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">time when the payment was made</span>. So also must the state of the facts or the law. That is the time as at which it must be determined whether the payment was or was not legally justified. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The inquiry will not be a difficult one, where the mistake is said to have been one of fact, if the facts have not changed since the date of the payment and the payer is able to show that he paid due to a misunderstanding of them, to incorrect information or to ignorance. In such a case the requirements for recovery will normally be satisfied. Nor is it difficult to deal with the case <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">where the facts have changed. In such a case proof that the alleged state of the facts at the time did not emerge until afterwards will usually be sufficient to show that there was, at the time of payment, no mistake</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Although Lord Hope made these remarks in analysing mistake as an unjust factor in the law of unjust enrichment, this must also be the basis for analysing mistake for the purpose of establishing a constructive trust.

And the second defendant acted entirely in accordance with that plan in handing the two cashier’s orders to the first defendant. And the first defendant acted entirely in accordance with that plan by depositing the two cashier’s orders into her CPF account and by using part of the proceeds to repay the HDB Loan in full.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The plaintiff does not allege any dishonest receipt or unconscionability by the first defendant at the time the second defendant handed $205,359.80 to her. The first defendant’s case is that the second defendant informed her at that time that the $205,359.80 was his contribution towards his share of the loan repayments for the Flat, to which he had made virtually no contributions up to that point.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The plaintiff does not allege that the first defendant knew, when she received the two cashier’s orders, either: (i) that the plaintiff was the ultimate source of the funds; or (ii) the private arrangements or representations between the plaintiff and the second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) There is no longer an identifiable fund on which a remedial constructive trust may operate. By procuring the two cashier’s orders to be drawn in favour of the CPF Board, the plaintiff acknowledged that she anticipated their proceeds were going to be mixed with money already in the first defendant’s CPF account. The plaintiff never intended for the $205,359.80 to be kept distinct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 I accept the first defendant’s submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 The power to impose a remedial constructive trust is one said to be vested in the court to award a constructive trust as a judicial remedy for a civil wrong, long after the wrong was committed and as relief in legal proceedings relating to the wrong. But I have reservations about whether the remedial constructive trust forms part of Singapore law (see also <span class="font-italic">Sumoi </span>at [61]) or should form part of Singapore law (see <span class="font-italic">Snells’ Equity </span>at para 26-015). The remedial constructive trust allows the court to create and destroy property rights by decree. That undermines the policy imperative for rights in property to be stable and for the law to allocate and alter those rights only in a manner which is transparent, consistent and predictable: see <span class="font-italic">National Provincial Bank Ltd v Ainsworth </span>[1965] AC 1175 at 1247–1248. Once a system of law recognises a power to impose a remedial constructive trust – at least, if the remedial constructive trust is not kept within very strict constraints – it has the capacity to subvert this policy imperative. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 I am conscious that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Wee Chiaw Sek Anna v Ng Li-Ann Genevieve (sole executrix of the estate of Ng Hock Seng, deceased) and another </span>[2013] 3 SLR 801 (“<span class="font-italic">Anna Wee</span>”) (at [182]) accepted, albeit <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>, that the power to impose a remedial constructive trust is part of Singapore law and constrained it by saying that it “is not simply a response to some broad notion of unconscionability”. Thus, the Court of Appeal said that a remedial constructive trust cannot be imposed unless there is “unconscientiousness or unconscionability (as the conclusion of a process of legal reasoning in the main claim) affecting the knowledge of the recipient of the assets in question” (at [182]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 But it is the difficulty in determining when the necessary degree of unconscientiousness or unconscionability arises that carries the greatest risk to the stability of property rights. Indeed, Lord Neuberger, speaking extra-judicially, went so far as to say that the remedial constructive trust was one “discretion too many in a Chancery judge’s locker”: Lord Neuberger, “The Remedial Constructive Trust – Fact or Fiction” (Banking Services and Finance Law Association Conference, Queenstown, August 2014). In a similar vein, Lord Sumption in <span class="font-italic">Bailey and another v Angove's P</span><span class="font-italic">TY Ltd</span> [2016] UKSC 47 (“<span class="font-italic">Bailey</span>”) said at [27] that (see also <span class="font-italic">Lewin</span> at para 8-026):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">English law is generally <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">averse to the discretionary adjustment of property rights</span>, and <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">has not recognised</span> the remedial constructive trust favoured in some other jurisdictions, notably the United States and Canada. It has recognised only the institutional constructive trust: <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council</span> [1996] AC 669, 714-715 (Lord Browne-Wilkinson), <span class="font-italic">FHR European Ventures LLP v Cedar Capital Partners LLC</span> [2015] AC 250, at para 47.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 It is true, of course, that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Anna Wee </span>said that the remedial constructive trust must be developed incrementally (at [175] and [182]). And therefore, the remedial constructive trust could be said to create little more risk of instability in property rights than the institutional constructive trust itself. And the institutional constructive trust is remedial in the sense that it is an equitable remedy, and therefore can be withheld in the discretion of the court in favour of a purely personal remedy. But it remains true that a power to create or extinguish property rights as a judicial act is conceptually different from a power to recognise their existence as a historical fact.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 In any event, for present purposes, I assume in the plaintiff’s favour that the remedial constructive trust forms part of Singapore law. Even on that assumption, I would not be prepared to impose a remedial constructive trust on any property of the first defendant in favour of the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 This is because as the name suggests, a remedial constructive trust is a remedy and not a cause of action. To secure a remedial constructive trust, it is not sufficient for a plaintiff to show merely that a defendant has behaved unconscionably or that a defendant’s conscience is affected by her conduct in a past transfer of property. The plaintiff must first establish a cause of action against a defendant, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a confluence of facts recognised by law as capable of yielding a remedy. Only then can the court even begin to consider whether a remedial constructive trust is the appropriate remedy to award the plaintiff on the facts of a particular case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 In this regard, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ching</span><span class="font-italic"> Mun Fong </span>(at [36]) characterised a remedial constructive trust as a “restitutionary <span class="font-italic">remedy</span> which the court, in appropriate circumstances, gives by way of equitable relief” [emphasis added]. In a similar vein, in <span class="font-italic">Anna Wee</span>, the appellant brought a claim against the second respondent in restitution and unjust enrichment and sought the <span class="font-italic">remedy</span> of a remedial constructive trust for both causes of action (at [22]). Thus, the Court of Appeal described the availability of a remedial constructive trust as “parasitic” on the success of the appellant’s unjust enrichment claim (at [169]). To be clear, the Court of Appeal did not hold in that case that a remedial constructive trust was available as a remedy for unjust enrichment. On the contrary, the Court of Appeal said it would be hesitant to recognise the remedial constructive trust as a remedy for a claim in unjust enrichment because its availability depends on fault, whereas liability in unjust enrichment is strict and not fault-based: <span class="font-italic">Anna Wee </span>at [182].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 In my judgment, the plaintiff has failed to establish any cause of action against the first defendant. Even assuming in the plaintiff’s favour that para 16 of the first defendant’s May 2019 affidavit (see [123(d)] above) amounts to the first defendant’s promise to the plaintiff to return $205,359.80 in full to the plaintiff, reneging on that promise does not establish a cause of action or even amount to an estoppel. At law, it is a gratuitous promise and is therefore unenforceable as a contract. In equity, it is incapable of amounting to a declaration of trust. And, even if it were possible for an estoppel to found a cause of action, it is not the plaintiff’s case that she relied on that promise in any way to her own detriment. The plaintiff suffered her detriment in 2015, not 2019. There being no cause of action against the first defendant (see also my conclusion on unjust enrichment at [183]-[190] below), there is no basis on which to award the plaintiff any remedy against the first defendant, let alone a remedial constructive trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 Further, even if the plaintiff did have a cause of action against the first defendant, I would hold that merely resiling in 2021 from a gratuitous promise which the first defendant made in 2019 does not taint the first defendant’s conscience to an extent that warrants imposing a remedial constructive trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 As against the second defendant, I explain below why he is personally liable to restore $205,359.80 to the plaintiff in unjust enrichment. Is a remedial constructive trust available as a remedy for the plaintiff’s successful claim in unjust enrichment against the second defendant? As I have outlined at [151] above, the Court of Appeal expressed reservations in general as to whether the remedial constructive trust is available as a remedy for a claim in unjust enrichment. But even if the remedial constructive trust were an available remedy for unjust enrichment, I would decline to impose one on the second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 That is because the second defendant no longer has any economic interest in the Flat whatsoever. That is the result of the Appeal Board’s order. The second defendant has no economic interest in the Flat even if he continues, in some formal or notional sense, to have proprietary rights in the flat until they are extinguished by implementing the Appeal Board’s order. The result is that awarding the plaintiff a remedial constructive trust would prejudice the first defendant’s ultimate economic interests, even if the trust is confined to any notional share which the second defendant continues to own in the Flat. As the authors in <span class="font-italic">Lewin</span> say at para 8-025:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Almost as important as the discretion to impose a remedial constructive trust on property at the discretion of the court, is the discretion not to do so where in the circumstances of the case the imposition of a constructive trust would in the view of the court cause <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">injustice</span>, for instance because of the effect on <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">third parties</span>. Lord Browne-Wilkinson, referring to this purely remedial trust, said: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">‘Although the resulting trust is an unsuitable basis for developing proprietary restitutionary remedies, the remedial constructive trust, if introduced into English law, may provide a more satisfactory road forward. The court by way of remedy might impose a constructive trust on a defendant who knowingly retains property of which the plaintiff has been unjustly deprived. Since the remedy can be tailored to the circumstances of the particular case, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">innocent third parties would not be prejudiced</span> and restitutionary defences, such as change of position, are capable of being given effect. However, whether English law should follow the United States and Canada by adopting the remedial constructive trust will have to be decided in some future case when the point is directly in issue.’</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 Also cited in <span class="font-italic">Lewin</span> (at para 8-025) is <span class="font-italic">Grimaldi v Chameleon Mining NL (ACN 098 773 785) (No 2) and another</span> (2012) 287 ALR 22, wherein Finn, Stone and Perram JJ state at [583] that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… As is well accepted, a constructive trust ought not to be imposed if there are other orders capable of doing full justice: see <span class="font-italic">John Alexander’s Clubsat</span> [128] and the cases there footnoted. Such could be the case, for example, where a bribed fiduciary, having profitably invested the bribe, is then bankrupted and, apart from the investment, is hopelessly insolvent. In such a case a lien on that property may well be sufficient to achieve ‘practical justice’ in the circumstances. This said, a constructive trust is likely to be awarded as of course where the bribe still exists in its original, or in a traceable, form, and <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">no third party issue</span> arises.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 For all of these reasons, I decline to award the plaintiff a remedial constructive trust as against either defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Resulting trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 The plaintiff cites <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche </span>and <span class="font-italic">Vandervell</span><span class="font-italic"> v Inland Revenue Commissioners </span>[1967] 2 AC 291 for the proposition that a resulting trust arises if B transfers property to T with no intention to benefit T.

It is therefore unnecessary and unhelpful to summarise her submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 The grounds on which a resulting trust may arise are summarised by Aedit Abdullah J in <span class="font-italic">Moh Tai Siang v Moh Tai Tong and another</span> [2018] SGHC 280 (“<span class="font-italic">Moh Tai Siang</span>”) at [71]–[72]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">71   There are generally two ways in which a resulting trust is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">presumed</span> to arise. The first is where there has been no exhaustion or transfer of the beneficial interest because of some <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">failure or omission</span> (typically, in cases where the express trust fails), and the second is where there has been <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">unequal contribution</span> towards the acquisition of property or the transfer of property as a gift: <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye Terence and another</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 (‘<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>’) at [34]. Pausing here, the term ‘presumed’ here is used in a broad sense to denote a trust that arises by operation of law as a response to a set of presumed factual incidents, and not in the distinction between presumed and automatic resulting trusts.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">72   A resulting trust may also arise independent of the presumption of resulting trust so long as it can be shown that the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">transfer was not intended to benefit the recipient</span>. In the same vein, a resulting trust may not necessarily arise even if there were no consideration, if it can be shown that the transfer was indeed intended to benefit the recipient: <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> at [35]; <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan v See Fong Mun</span> [2014] 3 SLR 1048 (‘<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>’) at [43]. While the doctrinal basis of the resulting trust has not been fully settled, there appears to be agreement coalescing around the idea that a resulting trust arises from a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">lack of intention</span> to benefit the recipient of the property: <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>at [44]–[48].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 I will assume in the plaintiff’s favour that the presumption of a resulting trust did arise when the plaintiff handed the two cashier’s orders to the second defendant in 2015.

As the law stands, the presumption of advancement only operates against a husband and in favour of the wife: see <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>at [70]. It cannot operate against a wife in favour of a husband. In any event, the second defendant and the plaintiff were not husband and wife in 2015 (see [7]–[8] above). There is therefore no presumption that the plaintiff intended to make a gift of the two cashier’s orders to the second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 As I have found, the plaintiff knew the second defendant’s plan when she handed the two cashier’s orders to him. To carry out that plan, it was necessary that she part with her entire interest in the two cashier’s orders and their proceeds. Even if, as between <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> husband and wife, the plaintiff had an expectation that he would later allow her to acquire an interest in the Flat for no additional consideration, as the first defendant’s counsel put it, the plaintiff took the risk that that her expectation would be defeated.

The plaintiff’s evidence in the present case is that she parted with the two cashier’s orders and their proceeds in the expectation that the second defendant would use the money to carry out their common intention and <span class="font-italic">return</span> the money to her in some unspecified way and at some unspecified time in the future. But the common intention of the second defendant and the plaintiff entailed the second defendant becoming the <span class="font-italic">sole </span>legal and beneficial owner of the Flat. Before the plaintiff handed the two cashier’s orders to the second defendant, the second defendant and the first defendant held the Flat as joint tenants in law. The plaintiff consistently maintained that the second defendant wanted the $205,359.80 to “buy over the Flat” and to “purchase [the first defendant’s] interest in the Flat”.

The recipient may have represented or warranted that he intends to use it in a particular way or have promised to use it in a particular way. Such an arrangement would give rise to personal obligations but would not of itself necessarily create fiduciary obligations or a trust: <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span> at 73.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">18 So, thirdly, it must be clear from the express terms of the transaction (properly construed) or must be objectively ascertained from the circumstances of the transaction that the mutual intention of payer and recipient (and the essence of their bargain) is that the funds transferred should not be part of the general assets of the recipient but should be used exclusively to effect particular identified payments, so that if the money cannot be so used then it is to be returned to the payer: <span class="font-italic">Toovey v Milne</span> (1819) 2 B &amp; A 683 and <span class="font-italic">Quistclose Investments</span> at 580B.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">19 Fourth, the mechanism by which this is achieved is a trust giving rise to fiduciary obligations on the part of the recipient which a court of equity will enforce: <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span> at 69. Equity intervenes because it is unconscionable for the recipient to obtain money on terms as to its application and then to disregard the terms on which he received it from a payer who had placed trust and confidence in the recipient to ensure the proper application of the money paid: <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span> at 76.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">20 Fifth, such a trust is akin to a 'retention of title' clause, enabling the recipient to have recourse to the payer's money for the particular purpose specified but without entrenching on the payer's property rights more than necessary to enable the purpose to be achieved. It is not as such a 'purpose' trust of which the recipient is a trustee, the beneficial interest in the money reverting to the payer if the purpose is incapable of achievement. It is a resulting trust in favour of the payer with a mandate granted to the recipient to apply the money paid for the purpose stated. The key feature of the arrangement is that the recipient is precluded from misapplying the money paid to him. The recipient has no beneficial interest in the money: generally the beneficial interest remains vested in the payer subject only to the recipient's power to apply the money in accordance with the stated purpose. If the stated purpose cannot be achieved then the mandate ceases to be effective, the recipient simply holds the money paid on resulting trust for the payer, and the recipient must repay it: <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span> at 81, 87, 92 and 100.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">21 Sixth, the subjective intentions of payer and recipient as to the creation of a trust are irrelevant. If the properly construed terms upon which (or the objectively ascertained circumstances in which) payer and recipient enter into an arrangement have the effect of creating a trust, then it is not necessary that either payer or recipient should intend to create a trust: it is sufficient that they intend to enter into the relevant arrangement: <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span> at 71.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">22 Seventh, the particular purpose must be specified in terms which enable a court to say whether a given application of the money does or does not fall within its terms: <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span> at 16.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">23 It is in my judgment implicit in the doctrine so described in the authorities that the specified purpose is fulfilled by and at the time of the application of the money. The payer, the recipient and the ultimate beneficiary of the payment (that is, the person who benefits from the application by the recipient of the money for the particular purpose) need to know whether property has passed.’</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 She argues that these requirements are satisfied on the facts of this case. She parted with the two cashier’s orders for the “express purpose and objective” informed to her by the second defendant and did not intend to make a gift to him of the two cashier’s orders or their proceeds.

Ang SJ held that a loan agreement which expressly stated that “[t]he purpose of the [loan] is for the purchase of [9 Hillcrest Road]” did not prevent the defendant from making free use of the loan. The decisive factor for Ang SJ was the absence of any agreement that the sum advanced was not to be at the defendant’s free disposal.

The exclusive purpose for which the monies were to be applied was evident in the terms of a letter from the borrower to the appellant bank with whom the loan monies were to be deposited. This letter, before transmission to the bank, was sent to the lender under open cover in order that the cheque for the loan might be (as it was) enclosed in it (at 580).

As I explained at [173] above, once the plaintiff handed the two cashier’s orders to the second defendant, their proceeds were at his free disposal, through the medium of his or someone else’s CPF account. In this regard, where a defendant receives the plaintiff’s money, there is no question that the defendant is enriched: <span class="font-italic">Law of Restitution in Singapore</span> at para 03.006, citing <span class="font-italic">BP Exploration Co (Libya) Ltd v Hunt (No 2) </span>[1979] 1 WLR 783 at 799.

</div> to deposit the two cashier’s orders into her CPF account does not detract from his enrichment. The second defendant was enriched when the plaintiff handed him the two cashier’s orders. The fact that he handed them on to the first defendant may afford him a defence but does not negate the enrichment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 Second, the enrichment was at the plaintiff’s expense. The Court of Appeal has described the second element as “the requirement of a nexus between the value that was once attributable to the claimant and the benefit received by the defendant, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the defendant has received a benefit from a subtraction of the claimant’s assets” (<span class="font-italic">Anna Wee</span> at [113]).

</div> And the Appeal Board’s order has awarded 100% of the Flat’s net proceeds of sale to the first defendant. The basis on which the plaintiff handed the two cashier’s orders to the second defendant has failed. It is not to the point that it failed without any fault on the second defendant’s part.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 Failure of basis is not inconsistent with my rejection of the <span class="font-italic">Quistclose </span>trust on the grounds that the two cashier’s orders were at the second defendant’s free disposal. As Lord Millett held in <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [73], a lender “will often inquire into the purpose for which a loan is sought in order to decide whether he would be justified in making it. He may be said to lend the money for the purpose in question, but … once lent the money is at the free disposal of the borrower.” Thus, although, as a matter of <span class="font-italic">fact</span>, the second defendant and the plaintiff had a common intention as to the basis on which the plaintiff was handing the two cashier’s orders to the second defendant, the <span class="font-italic">legal </span>question as to whether they agreed to make that basis the <span class="font-italic">sole or exclusive</span> purpose for which the monies could be used is a separate question.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197  Finally, the second defendant has not raised any defence to the claim in unjust enrichment in his written submissions or oral submissions. I find that he has no defence available. For instance, the defendant cannot rely on the defence of change of position. In <span class="font-italic">Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 473 v De Beers Jewellery Pte Ltd </span>[2002] 1 SLR(R) 418<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [35], the Court of Appeal recognised that the three elements to the defence are that: (a) the payee has changed his position; (b) the change is <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>; and (c) it would be inequitable to require him to make restitution or to make restitution in full. Even if the second defendant’s position “changed” when the first defendant deposited the two cashier’s orders in her CPF account and used the proceeds in part to repay the HDB Loan, requiring him to make restitution is <span class="font-italic">not</span> inequitable. The first defendant’s repayment of the HDB Loan in full resulted in extinguishing his personal liability for the balance of the loan. It also increased the value of his equity of redemption in the Flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 The fact that the Appeal Board’s order has now ordered him to transfer the entire value of that equity of redemption to the first defendant and left him with no economic interest in the Flat is again not to the point.

The term “proprietary restitution” is used in at least two senses (<span class="font-italic">Alwie Handoyo v Tjong Very Sumito and another and another appeal </span>[2013] 4 SLR 308 (“<span class="font-italic">Alwie</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [116]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">116 … To Prof [Graham] Virgo, the essence of a proprietary restitutionary claim is the existence of a continuing – or retention of – <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">proprietary interest in property</span> in the hands of the defendant: <span class="font-italic">Virgo</span> at pp 580–581. The remedy for such a claim can be personal or proprietary: <span class="font-italic">Virgo</span> at pp 575–576. Prof [Andrew] Burrows, on the other hand, appears to take the position that <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">proprietary restitution is a proprietary remedy for a claim for unjust enrichment</span>. In other words, unlike a proprietary restitutionary claim where the basis of the claim is subsisting property rights, Prof Burrow’s conception of proprietary restitution reversing unjust enrichment suggests that property rights can be created to reverse unjust enrichment. As with any claim for unjust enrichment, an unjust factor is still required for the awarding of the proprietary remedy: <span class="font-italic">Burrows</span> at pp 432–433.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 The plaintiff cannot succeed in a proprietary restitution claim as understood by Prof Graham Virgo. She has no continuing proprietary interest in the two cashier’s orders or their proceeds, nor has she somehow retained any such interest. As I have held, she parted with her entire property in the two cashier’s orders and their proceeds in favour of the second defendant, and ultimately the first defendant. That leaves no room for any free-standing proprietary claim. I have held that the circumstances have rebutted the presumption of resulting trust which arose. I have also refused to declare a remedial constructive trust or a <span class="font-italic">Quistclose </span>trust in the plaintiff’s favour. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 It appears that what the plaintiff means by “proprietary restitution” is a proprietary remedy to reverse unjust enrichment. In support of this claim, she cites <span class="font-italic">Foskett v McKeown and others </span>[2001] 1 AC 102 (“<span class="font-italic">Foskett</span>”). <span class="font-italic">Foskett</span> does not assist the plaintiff. In that case, a trustee fraudulently used trust moneys to pay premiums of a life insurance policy. By a majority, the House of Lords upheld the claim by the beneficiaries to a proportionate beneficial interest in the proceeds of the insurance policy. The majority in <span class="font-italic">Foskett</span> was emphatic that the beneficiaries’ equitable title in the traceable proceeds of the breach of trust arose from a vindication of their initial property rights under the trust and <span class="font-italic">not</span> as a remedy in the law of unjust enrichment: <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Browne-Wilkinson at 109, Lord Hoffman at 115 and Lord Millett at 127 (see also <span class="font-italic">Law of Restitution in Singapore</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at paras 01.031–01.033). Nevertheless, academic opinion remains divided as to whether <span class="font-italic">Foskett</span> is best explained as a vindication of the plaintiff’s continuing property rights (as the majority held) or as a proprietary remedy reversing the defendants’ unjust enrichment at the claimants’ expense: <span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones</span> at para 37-05. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 In any event, on the reasoning by the majority in <span class="font-italic">Foskett</span>, the plaintiff can have no claim. That is because she parted with her entire property in the two cashier’s orders and their proceeds in favour of the second defendant, and ultimately the first defendant. But even on the latter explanation of <span class="font-italic">Foskett</span>, the second defendant’s unjust enrichment cannot yield a proprietary remedy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 The latter explanation of <span class="font-italic">Foskett</span> raises the more difficult question of whether proprietary restitution is available as a remedy for unjust enrichment. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Alwie</span> did not resolve this issue, preferring to leave the point to be decided in future (see [115]–[121]). In particular, the court refrained from deciding whether <span class="font-italic">Lipkin Gorman</span> was a case in which a proprietary remedy was awarded to reverse an actionable unjust enrichment. In <span class="font-italic">Lipkin Gorman</span>, a partner in a firm of solicitors withdrew cash from its client account and gambled it away at a casino. The House of Lords allowed the firm’s claim against the casino for money had and received. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Alwie</span> noted that the firm succeeded in <span class="font-italic">Lipkin Gorman</span> because the money taken by the rogue partner remained the <span class="font-italic">property</span> of the firm. Yet, the Court of Appeal refrained from concluding that the claim in <span class="font-italic">Lipkin Gorman </span>did not award a proprietary remedy for an actionable unjust enrichment. This is because several Law Lords in <span class="font-italic">Lipkin Gorman</span> expressly recognised the firm’s claim as being founded on the law of unjust enrichment (see <span class="font-italic">Alwie</span> at [119], citing Lord Bridge at 558, Lord Ackner at 568 and Lord Goff at 578). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 This area of law is developing, certainly in Singapore. It appears that the law does allow proprietary remedies to reverse an actionable unjust enrichment in <span class="font-italic">some </span>circumstances: see <span class="font-italic">Bailey </span>at [30]; <span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones</span> at para 37-026. But the English Supreme Court and academic commentators have cautioned against awarding proprietary restitution where the unjust enrichment arises from a failure of basis. Lord Sumption in <span class="font-italic">Bailey </span>at [30] sounded the death knell for proprietary restitution where the unjust enrichment is reversed by reason of a failure of consideration, <span class="font-italic">i</span><span class="font-italic">e</span> a failure of basis:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The exact circumstances in which a restitutionary proprietary claim may exist is a controversial question which has given rise to a considerable body of judicial comment and academic literature. For present purposes it is enough to point out that where money is paid with the intention of transferring the entire beneficial interest to the payee, the least that must be shown in order to establish a constructive trust is (i) that that intention was vitiated, for example because the money was paid as a result of a fundamental mistake or pursuant to a contract which has been rescinded, or (ii) that irrespective of the intentions of the payer, in the eyes of equity the money has come into the wrong hands, as where it represents the fruits of a fraud, theft or breach of trust or fiduciary duty against a third party. … The right to the restitution of money paid on a consideration which has wholly failed is simply a process of contractual readjustment, giving rise like the contract itself to purely personal obligations. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">If an actual total failure of consideration does not give rise to a proprietary restitutionary right, I do not see how a prospective one can do so</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 The authors of <span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones </span>also cast doubt on whether a proprietary remedy is available to reverse an actionable unjust enrichment where a plaintiff transfers money to a defendant intending the money to be at the defendant’s free disposal and there is subsequently a failure of basis. The preliminary point which the authors make is that whether proprietary remedies are available in a claim for unjust enrichment should turn on whether the plaintiff voluntarily undertook the risk of the defendant’s <span class="font-italic">insolvency</span>. A plaintiff who had the opportunity to bargain for security but did not take it should not be entitled to a proprietary remedy if the defendant fails to return to him the value of the benefits he conferred on the defendant: <span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones </span>at para 37-18; see also Andrew Burrows, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Restitution </span>(Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed, 2011) (“<span class="font-italic">Burrows</span>”) at pp 174–179. In this context, the authors go further to explain at para 37-19 that (see also <span class="font-italic">Burrows</span> at p 177): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [The ‘voluntary assumption of risk’ argument] is consistent with the common assumption that where a contracting party has paid money or transferred some other asset to a contractual counterparty, on terms such that the money or asset is at the recipient’s <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">free disposal</span>, the circumstance that the consideration for the payment <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">wholly fails</span> will only give rise to a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">persona</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">l</span> restitutionary remedy. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones </span>cites <span class="font-italic">Bailey </span>at [30] for this specific observation on failure of consideration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 The same point is made in Elise Bant and Michael Bryan, “A Model of Proprietary Remedies” in <span class="font-italic">Principles of Proprietary Remedies</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(Elise Bant &amp; Michael Bryan eds)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(Thomson Reuters (Professional) Australia Limited, 2013) at para 12.170. They point out that a personal remedy for unjust enrichment will usually be entirely adequate to effect corrective justice between the parties for cases involving the transfer of <span class="font-italic">non-unique</span> chattels such as money. They explain that personal restitution in such cases: (a) is sufficient to enable the plaintiff to obtain a replacement asset if so desired; and (b) is the most efficient and least invasive of corrective remedies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 Lusina Ho in “Proprietary Remedies for Unjust Enrichment: Demystifying the Constructive Trust and Analysing Intentions” in <span class="font-italic">The Restatement Third: Restitution and Unjust Enrichment</span>, <span class="font-italic">Critical and Comparative Essays</span> (Hart Publishing, 2013) argues that intention at the time of the enrichment should be the litmus test for deciding whether an unjust enrichment yields a proprietary remedy. Ho argues that a proprietary remedy is generally not available where the plaintiff manifests an intention at the time of the unjust enrichment to transfer the enrichment to the defendant outright, but the basis of the transfer later fails. She calls these “qualified intent” cases. Ho points out that the plaintiff’s intention, although qualified, is entirely unimpaired. All that happens where unjust enrichment arises from a failure of basis is that the plaintiff’s expectations about the future are defeated. In cases of qualified intent, there is no justification for taking into account what the plaintiff intends at a later point in time, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> the plaintiff’s intention at the time that the basis of the transfer fails (at 225).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 This survey shows that proprietary restitution is an extremely difficult and unsettled area of the law, both for the courts and for academics and both in terms of what it means and what it requires. The plaintiff has not attempted to grapple with any of these difficulties or to present any grounds sufficient in law to justify making the second defendant’s obligation to make restitution of the proceeds of the two cashier’s orders more than a purely personal one.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 As I have held, the plaintiff parted with her entire property in the two cashier’s orders and their proceeds in favour of the second defendant, and ultimately the first defendant. She offers no reason why a “contractual readjustment” (see <span class="font-italic">Bailey</span> at [30] cited at [206] above) by way of a personal remedy for the unjust enrichment which I have found is insufficient to achieve corrective justice (see [208] above). She has not shown, in accordance with Lord Sumption’s guidelines (see [206] above), that her intention for an outright transfer was vitiated or that the proceeds of the two cashier’s orders fell into the wrong hands in the eyes of equity. That is because she cannot. As I have found, she willingly put the two cashier’s orders in the second defendant’s hands, and at his free disposal, from the moment she handed them to him. She did that knowing what the second defendant intended to do with them. She has also not shown, <span class="font-italic">per </span>the guidance in <span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones</span> (see [207] above) that she did <span class="font-italic">not </span>undertake the risk of the second defendant’s insolvency. She could have asked for security when making the advances but did not. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 The plaintiff’s claim for proprietary restitution against both defendants therefore fails. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 7: Equitable lien</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 The plaintiff finally prays for an equitable lien to be imposed on the Flat. I decline to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 The plaintiff cites in support of this prayer Debbie Ong J’s <span class="font-italic">dictum</span> in <span class="font-italic">Philip Antony Jeyaretnam and another v Kulandaivelu Malayaperumal and others (Thirumurthy Ayernaar Pamabayan, third party; Pramela d/o Govindasamy and another, non-parties)</span> [2020] 3 SLR 738 (“<span class="font-italic">Jeyaretnam</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [35] that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">35 Where a claimant seeks a claim against a substituted asset which exists in the hands of the trustee, the claimant may elect between remedies, whether it be by way of an equitable lien or the entire beneficial ownership of the substituted asset under a constructive trust. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 This <span class="font-italic">dictum</span> means only that a plain-tiff who has traced trust property into a substituted asset which the trustee continues to hold may choose to take his relief either in the form of an equitable lien on the substituted asset or a constructive trust over the substituted asset. <span class="font-italic">Jeyaretnam</span> was a case in which the plaintiff elected to take an equitable lien because the “more effective remedy of a constructive trust [over a HDB flat was] expressly prohibited by statute” (at [37]). <span class="font-italic">Burrows </span>at p 432 similarly explains that “[a]n equitable lien is a charge imposed by law over the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">traced property</span> to secure a certain sum of money” [emphasis added] (see also <span class="font-italic">Lewin </span>at paras 44-028 and 44-032). On my analysis above, the plaintiff does not now and has never had any proprietary interest in the two cashier’s orders or their proceeds from the time she handed each of them over to the second defendant. There is therefore nothing which she can trace into the Flat to support any remedy whatsoever, whether an equitable lien or a constructive trust. <span class="font-italic">Jeyaretnam</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>does not even begin to suggest that an equitable lien is available as a remedy for an unjust enrichment where the enrichment has been paid towards a HDB flat, let alone where it has been paid to discharge a loan secured on the flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216 <span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones</span> does outline two situations in which an equitable lien is available even though a plaintiff has no proprietary interest in the subject matter of the lien. These two situations are: (a) where the plaintiff’s money can be traced into repairs or improvements to the defendant’s property; and (b) where an insured receives money from a third party in diminution of a loss for which he has already been indemnified by his insurer (see paras 37-42 to 37-43). The present case does not fall into any of these categories. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 There are no grounds for awarding the plaintiff an equitable lien over the Flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 The plaintiff does not pray for any equitable lien to be imposed on the first defendant’s CPF account. I need therefore not consider that alternative.  In any event, the plaintiff has no viable claim against the first defendant at common law or in equity to support an equitable lien over her CPF account. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">219 I have dismissed all of the plaintiff’s prayers for relief in this application, with only one exception.
