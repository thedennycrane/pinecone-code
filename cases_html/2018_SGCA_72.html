The respondent also thought that since Guru was present at the meeting with Vinod and Guru was the respondent’s friend, Vinod would not lie in front of Guru.

In the light of this, the respondent did not take sufficient steps to satisfy himself that the drugs were not those that would attract the death penalty. The Prosecution contended that Vinod’s assurances were insufficient since the respondent had no basis to trust someone that he had met only once. The Prosecution also challenged the respondent’s evidence as to Jega.  The Prosecution alleged that Jega was an afterthought as he was never mentioned by the respondent in his statements. In any event, the Prosecution submitted that consulting Jega about drugs was inadequate as Jega never saw the drugs and the respondent did not ask Jega further as to why the drugs were not dangerous.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The Prosecution submitted that the respondent could have done more, such as probing the opinions given to him by Vinod and Jega, or tasting the contents of the bundles to confirm that they were “chocolate” drugs. The Prosecution also relied on the fact that the respondent cried after the arrest, contending that it was due to the fact that the respondent knew he was in possession of diamorphine. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The respondent’s defence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The respondent’s defence at trial was that he did not know that the two bundles, A1 and A2, contained diamorphine and that the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the drugs in s 18(2) was rebutted. He contended that he believed that the drugs were “chocolate” drugs consisting of drugs normally used in discos but mixed with chocolate. In his statement recorded on 12 December 2014 under s 23 of the CPC , the respondent said, “I know that it is a drug, but the person who ask me to bring in told me that it is not a dangerous type of drug, and it is something like chocolate”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Counsel for the respondent, Mr Nathan, submitted that the respondent referred to the drugs as “chocolate” consistently and that this was corroborated by the Prosecution’s own witnesses, all of whom agreed that the respondent did not use the words “diamorphine”, “heroin” or any other street term for diamorphine to refer to the drugs. Mr Nathan also submitted that the respondent was a credible witness as he had admitted candidly to bringing the drugs into Singapore on previous occasions even though this was an aggravating factor. He also had good reasons as to why he agreed to deliver the “chocolate” drugs but would not have done so if he had thought that the drugs would attract the death penalty. Lastly, Mr Nathan argued that the respondent did take reasonable steps to assure himself that the drugs were not of the kind that would attract the death penalty. He sought the assurances of Vinod and got the opinion of a trusted third party, Jega, who was not known to Guru or Vinod. Mr Nathan explained that the reason why Jega was not mentioned in the respondent’s statements is that the statements were recorded in a question-and-answer fashion and the respondent only answered whatever was asked of him. In addition, Jega did not testify in court because he was afraid of being arrested for tax evasion. Mr Nathan tendered WhatsApp Messages to show that Jega had intended to testify initially. The respondent had also checked the packets and satisfied himself that the colour of the contents, being brown, matched what was told to him about the drugs being “chocolate drugs”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision of the High Court </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The Judge held that the respondent managed to rebut the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2) of the MDA. The Judge relied on (a) the consistency of the respondent’s evidence and (b) the respondent’s demeanour. The Judge also rejected the Prosecution’s contentions that the respondent should not have trusted Vinod’s assurances and that the respondent’s claim that he sought assurance from Jega was a mere afterthought. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Consistency of the respondent’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The Judge found the respondent’s evidence to be consistent for the following reasons. First, the respondent’s position from the time of his arrest and throughout the trial was that he did not know that the packets contained diamorphine. Although he admitted that he knew the packets contained drugs, he thought that they were “chocolate” drugs or drugs normally used in discos and mixed with chocolate. The Judge noted that this was the position taken in all the recorded statements and that the Prosecution’s own witnesses confirmed this.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The Judge noted a possible inconsistency as to whether the term “diamorphine”, “heroin” or any other slang for diamorphine was used either by the respondent or by those who recorded his statements. The Judge pointed out that most of the witnesses agreed that these terms were not used. The Tamil interpreter who assisted during the recording of the respondent’s statements, Ms Malliga Anandha Krishnan (“Mdm Malliga”), agreed in cross-examination that the investigating officer did not pose any questions to the respondent that the drugs could be heroin. She believed that the investigating officer did not use the word “heroin” and hence it did not appear in the respondent’s statements. In re-examination, Mdm Malliga added that she interpreted the word “diamorphine” as “heroin” when she was interpreting the charge to the respondent in Tamil. She said that the respondent could understand the meaning of this word as he did not ask her about it. The respondent denied that Mdm Malliga used the word “heroin” when she was reading the charge to him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The Judge found that Mdm Malliga’s evidence in cross-examination and in re-examination was “somewhat inconsistent” and therefore this aspect of her evidence was not “a reliable indicator of any lack of veracity on the part of the [respondent]” when considering his evidence in its entirety.

The Prosecution contends that the Judge erred in finding that the presumption in s 18(2) was rebutted by the respondent. In particular, the Prosecution relies on the highly suspicious circumstances and the weaknesses and inconsistencies in the respondent’s evidence. The Prosecution also challenges the Judge’s finding in relation to the respondent’s demeanour. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Our decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 As the only issue in this appeal is whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the Judge was correct in holding that the respondent succeeded in rebutting the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the drug under s 18(2) of the MDA, we begin by discussing the test for rebutting the said presumption. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Section 18(2) of the MDA provides that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Presumption of possession and knowledge of controlled drugs</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">18.</span>— …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">To rebut the presumption in s 18(2), the accused person must prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not have knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug that he was caught in possession of (see <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span><span class="font-italic"> a/l K Dharmalingam v Public Prosecutor</span> [2011] 4 SLR 1156 (“<span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span>”) at [24]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In <span class="font-italic">Obeng</span><span class="font-italic"> Comfort v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 1 SLR 633 (“<span class="font-italic">Obeng</span><span class="font-italic">”</span>), this Court addressed the issue of how the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2) could be rebutted. We stated the following (at [39]- [40]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">39 In a case where the accused is seeking to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA, as a matter of common sense and practical application, he should be able to say what he thought or believed he was carrying, particularly when the goods have to be carried across international borders as they could be prohibited goods or goods which are subject to tax. It would not suffice for the accused to claim simply that he did not know what he was carrying save that he did not know or think it was drugs. If such a simplistic claim could rebut the presumption in s 18(2), the presumption would be all bark and no bite. Similarly, he would not be able to rebut the presumption as to knowledge by merely claiming that he did not know the proper name of the drug that he was asked to carry. The law also does not require him to know the scientific or the chemical name of the drug or the effects that the drug could bring about. The presumption under s 18(2) operates to vest the accused with knowledge of the nature of the drug which he is in possession of, and to rebut this, he must give an account of what he thought it was.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">40 Where the accused has stated what he thought he was carrying (“the purported item”), the court will assess the veracity of his assertion against the objective facts and examine his actions relating to the purported item. This assessment will naturally be a highly fact-specific inquiry. For example, the court will generally consider the nature, the value and the quantity of the purported item and any reward for transporting such an item. If it is an ordinary item that is easily available in the country of receipt, the court would want to know why it was necessary for him to transport it from another country. If it is a perishable or fragile item, the court would consider whether steps were taken to preserve it or to prevent damage to it. If it is a precious item, the court would consider whether steps were taken to keep it safe from loss through theft or otherwise. If it is a dangerous item, the court would consider how the item was packed and handled. Ultimately, what the court is concerned with is the credibility and veracity of the accused’s account (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether his assertion that he did not know the nature of the drugs is true). This depends not only on the credibility of the accused as a witness but also on how believable his account relating to the purported item is.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Obeng </span>concerned an accused person who claimed that she did not know that what she was carrying was illegal. In the present case, however, the respondent admitted not only that he knew what he was carrying was illegal but also that he knew<span class="font-italic"> </span>they were drugs. His defence was that he did not know what type of drugs they were, in particular, that they were diamorphine. We therefore have to consider how the presumption of knowledge could be rebutted when an accused person admits that he knew that he was carrying drugs but claims that he did not know that the drugs were the specific kind of drugs that he was caught in possession of. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The respondent knew that he was carrying drugs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In the present case, the respondent’s evidence is that although he knew that he would be transporting drugs, he believed that they were “chocolate” drugs that consisted of drugs mixed with chocolate and which were typically used in discos. According to the respondent, he believed that the drugs were not serious drugs and they would have occasioned only a fine or a light sentence if he was caught carrying them. In our view, this would not be sufficient to rebut the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The starting point is what this Court said in <span class="font-italic">Obeng</span> about the effect of s 18(2). The presumption in s 18(2) operates to vest an accused person with knowledge of the nature of the drug which he is in possession of and to rebut this, he must give an account of what he thought it was. Since the respondent was in possession of the drugs found in the motorcycle, the law presumes that he knew the said drugs were diamorphine. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Similarly, as this Court said in <span class="font-italic">Obeng</span>, an accused person would not be able to rebut the presumption as to knowledge by merely claiming that he did not know the proper name of the drug that he was asked to carry. The law also does not require him to know the scientific or the chemical name of the drug or the effects that the drug could bring about. Since he knew that he was carrying illegal drugs and wished to show that he did not know they were diamorphine, then it was incumbent on him to tell the Court what he thought or believed the drugs were. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Here, the respondent did not even state what type of illegal drugs he thought he was carrying. Instead of drug names (whether the scientific, the popular or merely the jargon names), he only identified them according to the likely place of use (namely, in discos) and the legal consequences that he believed they would bring if he was arrested with them (namely, a fine or a light sentence). He did not claim to have knowledge about the types of drugs commonly used in discos. He also did not say that his friend, Jega, had knowledge about such things. It will be recalled that the respondent had testified that “I have no friends who use drugs so I do not know much about drugs”.

</div>
</div> The respondent claimed that he did not know what drugs he was transporting save that they were mixed with chocolate and were not dangerous or serious drugs and that if caught with the drugs in Singapore, he would be fined or be given light punishment. Even if dangerous or serious drugs meant those that would attract the death penalty, imprisonment for life or a long imprisonment term and non-dangerous or non-serious drugs meant those that would result in only a fine or a short imprisonment term, it was obvious that the respondent did not know what type of drugs would fit into each category. Similarly, he would not know the type of punishments for different amounts of any particular drug.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In order to rebut the presumption in s 18(2), which vests the respondent with the knowledge that the drugs imported were diamorphine, it is not enough for the respondent, who knew that he was transporting illegal drugs, to state merely that he did not know what sort of drugs they were or that he had never heard of diamorphine or heroin. If he did not know what diamorphine was, he could not possibly claim that the drugs he was carrying were not diamorphine. Similarly, he would not be able to say whether diamorphine was a dangerous drug or not (according to his definition of dangerous drugs). The presumption in s 18(2) is placed in the MDA precisely to address the difficulty of proving an accused person’s subjective state of knowledge with regard to any specific type of drug. It also takes care of the case of a trafficker or an importer of drugs who simply does not bother or does not want to know what drugs or even what goods he is going to carry. Allowing the respondent in these circumstances to rebut the presumption of knowledge by merely stating that he did not know what drugs he was carrying save that they were not dangerous drugs and therefore could not<span class="font-italic"> </span>be diamorphine would, as we mentioned in <span class="font-italic">O</span><span class="font-italic">beng</span> (at [39]), make the presumption of knowledge all bark and no bite. This is because in effect he would be merely stating nothing more than, “The law presumes that I know the illegal drug is diamorphine but I do not know what diamorphine is”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The penalties that a particular type of drug attracts in law cannot be used as a proxy for identifying the drug itself. In the present case, the respondent said that he made inquiries as to how dangerous or serious the drugs were in relation to the penalties that they would attract should he be caught in possession of them. That would still not inform him as to the nature of the drugs that he was going to carry. Put in another way, knowledge about the possible penalties that the drug would attract would not help the respondent to identify the drug. If his professed intention was to refuse to carry drugs that attracted the death penalty, then it was incumbent on him to find out what sorts of drugs would lead to such a penalty and how he was to identify them. He must then show that he did take adequate steps to ensure that he was not carrying those sorts of drugs. In this case, he simply did not bother to find out more about what exactly he was tasked to carry across state boundaries into Singapore despite knowing that they were illegal drugs and despite being afraid initially of transporting such drugs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 It follows that if the respondent did not know the name of the drugs that he was to carry, he could not possibly verify whether those drugs were dangerous in that they could lead to the death penalty or a long term of imprisonment. The respondent’s case was that he knew very little about drugs. He had no friends who consumed drugs. He had never heard of diamorphine or heroin. Therefore, he would have no knowledge as to whether diamorphine would attract a fine or a long imprisonment term or the death penalty. He would also not know if the drug that was mixed with chocolate that he was to carry into Singapore was diamorphine or something else based only on the penalties he had thought they would attract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 For the reasons above, we are unable to agree with the Judge that the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2) of the MDA was rebutted in this case. In any event, we have grave reservations about the evidence given by the respondent and we address these below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The respondent’s trust in the supplier, Vinod</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In determining whether an accused person believed subjectively the information given by the drugs supplier about the drugs, the court will consider the knowledge of and the efforts made by the accused person to find out about the drugs that he was going to traffic in. In our view, unique circumstances justifying a very high level of trust must be shown by the accused person before the Court is persuaded that the accused person is entitled to rely solely or mainly on the information given by the drugs supplier. This is the effect of this Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Khor</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Lee v Public Prosecutor</span> [2011] 3 SLR 201 and the High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Phuthita Somchit and another</span> [2011] 3 SLR 719, both of which turned on their respective unique factual situations. This is because the accused person, when told that he would be transporting illegal drugs across state boundaries, will know that (i) the supplier is involved in illegal activities, (ii) the supplier has chosen not to transport these drugs himself and (iii) the supplier is often willing to pay the accused person a disproportionately large amount of money for the simple task of transporting the drugs into Singapore. All these should put the ordinary accused person on notice that the drugs in question must be worth a lot more than the reward for transporting them and that the risks of doing the delivery must be correspondingly high. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In the present case, we do not think that Vinod’s assurances could do very much to help the respondent to rebut the presumption of knowledge. Vinod did not give the respondent any information that would help the respondent to identify the drugs. According to the respondent, Vinod only informed him that he would be transporting drugs mixed with chocolate without providing any further details as to what these drugs would be. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 There was also little reason for the respondent to trust Vinod. When cross-examined by the Prosecution as to why he trusted Vinod despite having just met him, the respondent explained that “… if [Vinod] wanted to cheat [him], [Vinod] would have said that it is some other item. However, [Vinod] told [the respondent] and so [the respondent] thought it must be the truth. And [Vinod] said it is not dangerous”.

</div> We do not think that this factor alone would prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the respondent truly believed Vinod’s representations as to how dangerous the drugs were. In coming to this view, we considered that (i) the respondent had met Vinod only once in person and knew little about Vinod; (ii) no inquiries were made by the respondent about Vinod’s background or reputation, although he knew then that Vinodh was involved in illegal activities; and (iii) after the meeting with Vinod, the respondent actually turned down the offer of the job because he thought “it would be a problem”.

</div> He only agreed to transport the drugs when his daughter’s operation drew near and he was still unable to raise the necessary funds. For these reasons, we do not think that the respondent believed what Vinod told him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The respondent also claimed that he believed Vinod because the representations about the drugs were made in the presence of Guru, who was the respondent’s friend. We note the Prosecution’s challenge that the respondent was not on close terms with Guru and similarly had little reason to trust Guru. Whatever the case may be, the respondent would have realised that he was not speaking to ordinary, honest businessmen who were willing to help him with his financial problems but to men who were involved in illegal activities and who wanted to draw him into such activities to earn easy money. Moreover, as we stated above, the respondent did not appear to believe Vinod then because he did not take up the offer of delivery work immediately.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 A further point indicated that the respondent did not trust Vinod or Guru. After speaking with them and thinking that it would be a problem, he went to check with his friend, Jega, regarding what Vinod had told him about the drugs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The respondent’s trust in his friend, Jega</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 We proceed on the basis that Jega was not a fictitious person, as found by the Judge. If the respondent wishes to rely on assurances given by others to him, there must similarly be unique circumstances justifying a very high degree of trust in those person(s). On this score, there are several problems with the respondent’s evidence on the assurances given by Jega to him. Firstly, we agree with the Prosecution that it was strange that in the respondent’s statements to the police, he did not mention the assurances given by Jega. Even if we accept the respondent’s explanation that the statements were recorded in a question-and-answer manner and no question was asked about Jega, it still seems strange that the respondent would explain to the investigation officer that Vinod had told him that these were disco drugs but omit to add that he also verified this important information with Jega.

</div> According to the respondent, he thought that because Jega had gone to discos before, he would know about drugs and because Jega was his friend, he would not lie to him. However, Jega’s familiarity with discos did not equate to familiarity with drugs. Jega did not see the drugs and did not know what sort of drugs was mixed with chocolate. The respondent also stated under cross-examination that he did not know if Jega had taken drugs before.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Thirdly, the respondent did not ask Jega any questions in relation to the nature of the drugs that would help the respondent to identify them. Instead, the questions posed to Jega were in relation to the seriousness of the drugs and the kind of penalties that they were likely to attract. Even if the respondent was made aware of the penalties, that alone would not help him to identify the drugs and certainly would not help him rebut the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2) because, as we have emphasised, that presumption vested him with knowledge that the drugs in question were diamorphine. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The respondent’s visual inspection of the drugs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Given the respondent’s evidence that he knew very little about drugs, any visual inspection of the drugs that he was tasked to deliver would also not help him. At best, he would know that the drugs were brown in colour, corresponding with the description of “chocolate”, but he would still not know what sort of drugs they were or what drugs had been mixed with chocolate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Comments on the Judge’s findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 We make a couple of comments on the Judge’s findings. As pointed out at [22] above, the Judge found that the evidence of the interpreter, Mdm Malliga, in cross-examination and in re-examination was “somewhat inconsistent” and therefore this aspect of her evidence was not a reliable indicator of any lack of veracity on the part of the respondent when considering his evidence in its entirety. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Her evidence was that the investigation officer did not mention the word “heroin” while he was questioning the respondent and hence that word did not appear in the statements. However, she added that she did use the word “heroin” to describe “diamorphine” when reading the charge to the respondent. The fact that the word “diamorphine” appeared in the charge is beyond dispute. Understood in context, her evidence showed that the word “heroin” was used by her to explain diamorphine in the charge (at the start of the recording) and thereafter, that word was not used by the investigating officer during the questioning. We therefore do not think there was any inconsistency in the interpreter’s evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In respect of the reduced charge, there is a high degree of artificiality in stating that the respondent “believed” he was importing a class C drug under the MDA when he did not mention a single drug name or even drug classes throughout his testimony. Why is it that a drug which is described by the respondent as not dangerous or not serious cannot be one under class A or B and of a quantity which does not attract the death penalty? For instance, why could it not be diamorphine in an amount that was way below the 15g threshold for the death penalty since the respondent had no idea what drug was mixed with chocolate? What is heavy punishment and what is light punishment in the respondent’s mind anyway? For unauthorised importation of class A and B drugs, the general punishment is imprisonment for a minimum of five years and five strokes of the cane and a maximum of 30 years or imprisonment for life and 15 strokes. Even for the importation of class C drugs, the general punishment is imprisonment for a minimum of three years and five strokes of the cane and a maximum of 20 years and 15 strokes of the cane. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 This highlights the difficulty of permitting punishments under the law to be used as proxies for drug types and is something that is not permitted in the MDA. An accused person certainly cannot rebut the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2) by substituting knowledge of the nature of the drug with knowledge of the punishments provided in law because the presumption in s 18(2) operates to vest the accused with knowledge of the nature of the drug which he is in possession of, and to rebut this, he must give an account of what he thought it was (<span class="font-italic">Obeng</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [39]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 For the reasons above, we disagree with the Judge’s decision to convict the respondent on the reduced charge. We hold that the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the drug under s 18(2) of the MDA was not rebutted by the respondent. Accordingly, we set aside the respondent’s conviction and his sentence on the reduced charge and we find him guilty on the original charge and convict him on that charge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 As a result of the Judge’s findings, there were no submissions and no finding made on whether the conditions in s 33B of the MDA were satisfied. We will therefore hear the parties on these matters now before deciding on the next course of action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Sundaresh Menon        Judith Prakash      Tay Yong Kwang<br/>Chief Justice         Judge of Appeal      Judge of Appeal</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mohamed Faizal, Tan Zhongshan and Nicholas Wuan (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the appellant;<br/>Shashi Nathan, Tania Chin and Jeremy Pereira (KhattarWong LLP) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

<em>
Public Prosecutor v Gobi a/l Avedian
<br/>
Criminal Appeal No 20 of 2017
</em>
</p>
<p>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
<strong>
Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Judge of Appeal Tay Yong
Kwang):
</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Outcome:<em> </em>CoA allowed the Public Prosecutor’s appeal, set aside the
conviction and sentence by the High Court on the reduced charge and
convicted the respondent on the original charge of importation of
diamorphine under the Misuse of Drugs Act.
</p>
<p>
<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Background to the appeal</strong>
</p>
<p>
1 Criminal Appeal No 20 of 2017 was an appeal by the Public Prosecutor
against the decision of the trial judge in    <em>Public Prosecutor v Gobi a/l Avedian </em>[2017] SGHC 145.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Facts</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
2 The respondent, Gobi a/l Avedian, was charged with one count of importing
40.22g of diamorphine, a Class A controlled drug, which is an offence under
s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed)(“the Act”). The sole
issue at the trial below was whether the respondent had rebutted the
presumption of knowledge of the nature of the drug under s 18(2) of the
Act.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
3 The respondent was arrested at the Woodlands Checkpoint with drugs found
hidden in the motorcycle that he was riding. At the trial, the respondent
claimed that he was assured by one Vinod, who instructed him to bring into
Singapore, that the items were only “chocolate drugs” and that if he were
caught with them, he would only be fined or given light punishment. The
respondent initially refused to carry out the delivery but eventually did
so because he needed money for his daughter’s operation. According to the
respondent, he also asked a friend, Jega, about the “chocolate drugs”
before transporting them into Singapore. The respondent informed Jega that
the “chocolate drugs” were to be used in discos and Jega apparently told
him that if that was so, the drugs were not very dangerous nor terrible.
The respondent also admitted to delivering similar bundles of drugs into
Singapore on eight or nine previous occasions before he was apprehended.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
4 The trial judge found that the presumption was rebutted and exercised his
power to convict the respondent on a reduced charge of attempting to import
into Singapore a Class C controlled drug. The trial judge sentenced the
respondent to 15 years’ imprisonment with effect from the date of arrest
and to ten strokes of the cane for the reduced charge.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
5 The Public Prosecutor appealed on the ground that the Judge erred in
finding that the presumption was rebutted.

<strong>Decision on appeal</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
6 The Court of Appeal allowed the Prosecution’s appeal and convicted the
respondent on the original charge of importing into Singapore a Class A
controlled drug. The sole issue on appeal was similarly whether the
presumption in s 18(2) of the Act had been rebutted. The Court of Appeal
found that the respondent had not rebutted the presumption (at    <strong>[31]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
7 The Court of Appeal noted that the presumption in s 18(2) operates to
vest the respondent with knowledge of the nature of the drug which he is in
possession of and to rebut this, the respondent must give an account of
what he thought it was (at <strong>[32]</strong>). The Court of Appeal
found that the respondent failed to do so. First, the Court of Appeal held
that it was not enough for the respondent, who knew that he was
transporting illegal drugs, to state merely that he did not know what sort
of drugs they were or that he had never heard of diamorphine or heroin (at    <strong>[35]</strong>). This was because if the respondent did not know
what diamorphine was, he could not possibly claim that the drugs he was
carrying were not diamorphine (at <strong>[35]</strong>). Second, the
penalties that a particular type of drug attracts in law cannot be used as
a proxy for identifying the drug itself (at <strong>[36]</strong>). The
Court of Appeal also noted that if the respondent intended to refuse to
carry drugs that attracted the death penalty, then it was incumbent on him
to find out what sorts of drugs would lead to such a penalty and how he was
to identify them. However, the respondent did not take such steps in this
case (at <strong>[36]</strong>). Third, the Court of Appeal found that
since the respondent did not know the name of the drugs that he was to
carry, he could not possibly verify whether those drugs were dangerous in
that they could lead to the death penalty or a long term of imprisonment
(at <strong>[37]</strong>). In particular, the Court of Appeal pointed out
that the inquiries made by the respondent as to how dangerous or serious
the drugs were in relation to the penalties that they would attract would
not have informed him about the nature of the drugs because he had no
knowledge about whether diamorphine would attract a fine or a long
imprisonment term or the death penalty (at <strong>[37]</strong>). For
these reasons, it was held that the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2) of
the Act was not rebutted (at <strong>[38]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
8 The Court of Appeal also had grave reservations about the respondent’s
evidence. In relation to the respondent’s trust in Vinod, his supplier, the
Court of Appeal stated that in determining whether the respondent believed    <em> </em>subjectively the information supplied by Vinod, it would consider
the knowledge of and the efforts made by the accused person to find out
about the drugs that he was going to traffic in (at <strong>[39]</strong>).
It was observed that Vinod did not give the respondent any information that
would help the respondent to identify the drugs (at <strong>[40]</strong>)
and there was little reason for the respondent to trust Vinod in any case
(at <strong>[41]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
9 The Court of Appeal observed that there were several problems with the
respondent’s evidence on the assurances given by his friend, Jega, to him
(at <strong>[44]</strong>). First, the respondent did not mention these
assurances in his statements to the police. Second, the respondent did not
adduce any evidence concerning Jega’s knowledge or experience in drugs.
Third, the respondent did not ask Jega any questions in relation to the
nature of the drugs that would help the respondent to identify them.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
10 The Court of Appeal also commented that any visual inspection by the
respondent would not have helped him given his evidence that he knew very
little about drugs (at <strong>[47]</strong>).
