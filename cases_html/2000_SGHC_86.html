<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>GROUNDS OF DECISION</strong></font></p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns=""><i>
<p>The background</p></i>
<p align="justify">1. The defendants in this case entered into a contract of carriage

sometime at the end of 1995, whereby they agreed to ship various consignments of cargo

("the cargo") on board their vessel, the "<i>Patraikos 2</i>"

("the vessel"). On or about 7 January 1996, the vessel was navigating through

the Singapore Straits when it ran aground on the rocks of South Ledge, approximately 2.2

miles off the Horsburgh Lighthouse. The plaintiffs, who claimed to be the owners of the

cargo, alleged that the grounding led to ingress of seawater into the vessel’s cargo

holds. This in turn led to the cargo becoming submerged, requiring rescue by professional

salvors. </p>
<p align="justify">2. The plaintiffs now bring the present action against the defendants,

claiming for damage sustained by their cargo. In so doing, the plaintiffs based their

claim on Art III rr 1 and 2 of the Hague Rules as amended by the Brussels Protocol 1968

("the Rules"). Rules 1 and 2 read:</p>
<blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3"><p align="justify">1. The carrier

  shall be bound before and at the beginning of the voyage to exercise due diligence to

  —</p>
</font><blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) Make the ship seaworthy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(b) Properly man, equip and supply the ship.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(c) Make the holds, refrigerating and cool chambers, and all other

    parts of the ship in which goods are carried, fit and safe for their reception, carriage

    and preservation. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">2. Subject to the provisions of Article IV, the carrier shall properly

  and carefully load, handle, stow, carry, keep, care for, and discharge the goods carried. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">3. It was the plaintiffs’ case that the defendants breached the

duties imposed by the above provisions. Amongst other things, the plaintiffs alleged that

the vessel’s Filipino second officer, Ben Gallardo Orlanda ("Orlanda"), was

not competent to serve on the vessel as second officer. They contended that sometime in

June 1989, Orlanda was second officer on another ship called the <i>Saronikos II</i>,

which had also run aground. The plaintiffs further alleged that the vessel had no proper

bridge management team. </p>
<p align="justify">4. The plaintiffs also contended that the grounding of the vessel alone

could not have resulted in damage to the cargo, but that entry of seawater was facilitated

by there being large corrosion holes in the vessel’s bulkhead.</p>
<p align="justify">5. The defendants denied all the plaintiffs’ allegations. Firstly,

they contended that the vessel was in fact seaworthy. Apparently, the vessel had been

surveyed and classed in Belgium just before the voyage. The vessel had then undergone

extensive maintenance repairs at Rotterdam, and passed a drydocking inspection. This

included a thorough inspection of all her compartments, which disclosed no defects

therein. Secondly, the defendants maintained that the ship was properly manned, to a level

exceeding flag requirements, by competent and certified officers and men. The defendants

further maintained that the ship was fully and properly equipped and supplied. Finally,

the defendants denied that any part of the ship was ever unfit or unsafe for the

reception, carriage or preservation of goods carried on board.</p>
<p align="justify">6. In addition to the above contentions, the defendants also alleged

that the grounding of the vessel was caused by Orlanda’s negligence. In this regard,

the defendants relied on Art IV r 2 of the Rules, which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3"><p align="justify">2. Neither the

  carrier nor the ship shall be responsible for loss or damage arising or resulting from

  —</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) Act, neglect, or default of the master, mariner, pilot, or the

    servants of the carrier in the navigation or in the management of the ship. </p>
<p align="justify">…</p>
<p align="justify">(c) Perils, dangers and accidents of the sea or other navigable waters.</p>
</blockquote></font>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">7. Apart from the present action, other proceedings had also been

instituted against the defendants in England ("the English action") by various

other cargo owners whose cargo was also on board the vessel when the grounding took place.</p>
</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The documents discovered by the defendants</p></i><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">8. On 8 October 1999, the defendants filed their list of documents for

discovery. The plaintiffs were dissatisfied with the list, and filed Summons-in-Chambers

7688 of 1999, applying for a Further and Better List of Documents and Affidavit Verifying

the same. Some of the documents requested were those which were referred to by documents

disclosed in the defendants’ original list. Some of the other documents were said to

exist based on the surrounding circumstances. The Assistant Registrar granted an order in

terms, and the defendants appealed by Registrar’s Appeal No. 600005 of 2000 (the

defendants’ appeal). I dismissed the defendants’ appeal with costs when it came

up for hearing on 12 January 2000. The defendants have appealed against my decision (in

Civil Appeal No. 17 of 2000) in so far as they relate to the following sets of documents

ordered to be disclosed:- </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) Survey reports for the vessel’s Annual Class Survey, Annual

  Loadline Survey, Annual Construction Survey, Annual Safety Equipment Survey and Annual

  Cargo Gear Survey. </p>
<p align="justify">(ii) Two faxes from Sinclair, Roche &amp; Temperly (SRT) to Dioryx

  Maritime Corporation (Dioryx), dated 19 August 1996 and 3 September 1996 respectively.

  (SRT are the defendants’ solicitors in the English action. Dioryx was the agent

  employed by the defendants to manage the vessel.) </p>
<p align="justify">(iii) All documents, including surveys relating to class

  recommendations after survey of the vessel in Belgium.</p>
<p align="justify">(iv) All invoices evidencing repairs made to the vessel in the past 5

  years prior to grounding.</p>
<p align="justify">(v) All classification survey reports/records, including but not

  limited to the Lloyd’s Classification Reports/Repairs, of the vessel for a period of

  five years prior to its grounding </p>
<p align="justify">(vi) All documents pertaining to the grounding of the <i>Saronikos II</i>

  in June 1989, including statements, if any, given by Orlanda in relation to the grounding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">I will now deal with each of these sets of documents in turn.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">(i) Survey reports for the vessel’s Annual Class Survey, Annual

Loadline Survey, Annual Construction Survey, Annual Safety Equipment and Annual Cargo Gear

Survey.</p></i>
<p align="justify">9. Before an application for discovery of particular documents will be

granted, the documents in question must be shown to "relate to matters in question in

the cause or matter" (see O 24 r 7(3) of the Rules of Court). In this regard, the

test laid in <i>Compagnie Financiere v Peruvian Guano</i> [1882] 11 QBD 55 (at 63), should

be borne in mind. A document relates to the matters in question if:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) they would be evidence upon any issue</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(ii) they contain information which may (as opposed to <i>must</i>)

  enable the party requiring the affidavit either to advance his own case or to damage the

  case of his adversary, or </p>
<p align="justify">(iii) they may fairly lead him to a train of inquiry, which may have

  either of the two consequences in (ii) above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">As some cases have put it more simply, documents relate to matters in

question if they ‘throw light on the case’ (see<i> Merchants' &amp;

Manufacturers' Insurance Co Ltd v Davies</i> [1938] I KB 196 at 210, <i>Manilal &amp; Sons

(Pte) Ltd v Bhupendra KJ Shan</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=4344&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1990] 2 MLJ 282</a>). </p>
<p align="justify">10. One of the ‘matters in issue’ in the present case would

be, as can be seen from the plaintiffs’ reliance on Art III r 1(a) of the Rules,

whether the vessel was seaworthy. Before a ship is deemed ‘seaworthy’, it must,

amongst other things, "be fit in design, structure, condition, and equipment to

encounter the ordinary perils of the voyage" (<i>Carver’s Carriage By Sea</i>,

13<sup>th</sup> ed. at para 147). That being the case, the reports for the vessel’s

Annual Class Survey, Annual Loadline Survey, Annual Construction Survey, Annual Safety

Equipment Survey and Annual Cargo Gear Survey would clearly constitute evidence as to the

seaworthiness of the vessel. I thus had no difficulty in finding that these survey reports

should be disclosed.</p>
<p align="justify">11. I would also add that in filing their list of documents, the

defendants in the present case actually included the entire list of documents discovered

by the plaintiffs in the English action. Included in this list discovered in the English

action was a Greek letter, which had in turn made reference to the above survey reports.

Having chosen to disclose the entire list of documents discovered in the English action,

the defendants thereby implied that these documents (including the Greek letter) are

relevant. It would now lie ill in their mouths to contend otherwise.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">(ii) The faxes from SRT to Dioryx</p></i>
<p align="justify">12. As mentioned above, the grounding of the vessel led to the English

action being commenced against the defendants. In the course of the proceedings in the

English action, correspondence was exchanged between SRT (i.e. the solicitors for the

defendants in the English action) and the solicitors for the English plaintiffs. In one of

the letters, dated 1 May 1997, SRT had broached the issue of the qualifications of the

vessel’s Chief Officer at the time of grounding, one Aris Sporidis. Apparently, Aris

Sporidis only had a Second Mate’s Certificate. However, SRT stated in the letter that

the defendants’ agents who managed the vessel, Dioryx, employed officers based on

their experience and not only on the basis of their paper qualifications alone. SRT

further stated in the letter that the Greek authorities had been prepared to give Aris

Sporidis dispensations to act as Chief Mate, despite his having only a Second Mate’s

Certificate. The plaintiffs thus sought discovery of certain faxes sent by SRT to Dioryx,

and I allowed their application. The defendants have appealed against my order with

respect to two of the faxes dated 19 August 1996 and 3 September 1996. I felt that the

plaintiffs’ application for discovery of the faxes was justifiable, as these faxes

would throw light on the issue regarding Aris Sporadis’ qualifications. If he only

had a Second Mate’s Certificate, and was not genuinely qualified to act as Chief

Officer aboard the vessel, then this might support the claim that the defendants failed to

properly man the vessel, as required by Art III r 1(b) of the Hague Rules (see also <i>The

"Makedonia"</i> [1962] 316, at 337-338, where it was held that the

shipowners’ failure to employ sufficiently experienced engineers amounted to a breach

of the obligation to properly man the ship). </p>
<p align="justify">13. One of the objections raised before me by the defendants was that

the faxes were privileged. I rejected this argument. Apart from the statutory protection

afforded by s 128(1) of the Evidence Act Cap 97 to communications between lawyers and

their clients, it appears that there is also protection afforded by the common law, which

extends to certain communications made in contemplation of litigation. The latter

protection has been termed ‘litigation privilege’, and consists of the following

two limbs (see <i>Singapore Court Forms and Precedents</i> at para XIX p 203): </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) communications between the client’s professional legal

  advisers and third parties, if made for the <i>purpose</i> of pending or contemplated

  litigation, and </p>
<p align="justify">(ii) communications between the client or his agent and third parties,

  if made for the <i>purpose</i> of obtaining information to be submitted to the

  client’s professional legal advisers for the purpose of obtaining advice upon pending

  or contemplated litigation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">14. Of greater relevance to the present case is the above first limb,

since the faxes constitute communications between the defendants’ legal advisers

(SRT) and a third party (i.e. Dioryx). In <i>Wheeler v Le Marchant</i> (1881) 17 Ch.D.

675, Cotton LJ held (at 684-685): </p>
<blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3"><p align="justify">"Hitherto such

  communications" -- between a solicitor and a third person -- "have only been

  protected when they have been in contemplation of some litigation, or for the purpose of

  giving advice or obtaining evidence with reference to it. And that is reasonable, because

  then the solicitor is preparing for the defence or for bringing the action, and all

  communications he makes for that purpose, and the communications made to him for the

  purpose of giving him the information, are, in fact, the brief in the action, and ought to

  be protected."</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">However, in <i>Secretary Of State For Trade And Industry v Baker </i>[1998] WLR 667, Sir Richard Scott VC considered <i>Wheeler v Le Marchant</i>, and held (at 675):</p>
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">These citations make clear, in my opinion, that

  documents brought into being by solicitors for the purposes of litigation were afforded

  privilege because of the light they might cast on the client's instructions to the

  solicitor or the solicitor's advice to the client regarding the conduct of the case or on

  the client's prospects. <i>There was no general privilege that attached to documents

  brought into existence for the purposes of litigation independent of the need to keep

  inviolate communications between client and legal adviser. If documents for which

  privilege was sought did not relate in some fashion to communications between client and

  legal adviser, there was no element of public interest that could override the ordinary

  rights of discovery and no privilege</i>. [emphasis added].</p></font>
</blockquote></font>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">15. Thus, in order to have the benefit of the privilege, the defendants

had to show that the faxes sent by SRT to Dioryx either reflected the defendants’

instructions to SRT in some way, or somehow gave an indication of the legal advice that

SRT would be giving the defendants; this they failed to do. Accordingly, I held that the

faxes should be disclosed.<i> </i></p>
</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(iii) All documents, including surveys relating to class

recommendations after survey of the vessel in Belgium</p>
</i><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">16. These documents related to the seaworthiness of the vessel, and

thus clearly "relate to matters in question" in this case. The plaintiffs had

adduced evidence before me to the effect that the survey in Belgium took place just a

matter of months before the grounding occurred, so these documents would be all the more

relevant in establishing the seaworthiness (or the lack thereof) of the vessel. </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">(iv) All invoices evidencing repairs made to the vessel in the past 5

years prior to grounding</p></i>.

<p align="justify">17. Again these documents are relevant in determining the seaworthiness

of the vessel, so they should be disclosed. In fact, they are particularly relevant,

bearing in mind that there was evidence adduced by the plaintiffs that several tons of

rust were removed from the hull of the vessel when it was being repaired in Rotterdam,

just before the grounding.</p>
<p align="justify">18. In the course of submissions, counsel for the plaintiffs argued

that it would be oppressive for the defendants to be made to produce these documents,

which stretched back for a period of 5 years. I did not find this to be the case. Of

course there may be times when the sheer volume of the documents requested might render

the application for discovery oppressive. In <i>Science Research Council v. Nass</i>

[1980] A.C. 1028, Lord Edmund-Davies remarked (at </p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns="">1076)</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">:

<blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3"><p align="justify">Again, a request

  for inspection of a great mass of documents, without any attempt at selection, could well

  be regarded as oppressive.</p></font>
</blockquote></font>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">That does not appear to be the case here. There is no evidence that the

volume of documents involved will be so massive that the defendants will find discovery

oppressive. </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">(v) All classification survey reports/records, including but not

limited to the Lloyd’s Classification reports/repairs, of the vessel for a period of

five years prior to its grounding </p></i>
<p align="justify">19. These documents are relevant in that they again pertain to the

seaworthiness of the vessel. In their defence, the defendants claimed that the vessel was

"in class and in possession of current and valid Safety Construction and Loadline

Certificates" ( at para 7(i)(a) of Defence). The documents that had been requested by

the plaintiffs under this head will go to show whether the defendants’ claim is true.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">vi) All documents pertaining to the grounding of the Saronikos II in

June 1989, including statements, if any, given by Orlanda in relation to the grounding</p></i>
<p align="justify">20. It appeared that even before the grounding of the vessel, Orlanda

had been connected with another marine accident involving the ship "<i>Saronikos II</i>",

of which he had also been second officer. After the grounding of the vessel, a statement

had been taken from Orlanda where he claimed that the "<i>Saronikos II</i>" had

only been involved in a minor collision, and that the "<i>Saronikos II</i>"

suffered no damage. The plaintiffs however adduced evidence that the "<i>Saronikos II</i>",

far from being involved in merely a minor collision, had actually been grounded (as was

the case with the vessel) The plaintiffs further contended that Orlanda had been on the

bridge when the grounding of the "<i>Saronikos II</i>" occurred. I was of the

view that all the documents pertaining to the grounding of the "<i>Saronikos II</i>",

including statements, if any, given by Orlanda in relation to the grounding, were relevant

to matters in question in this case. If these documents indicated that the grounding of

the "<i>Saronikos II</i>" resulted from Orlanda’s incompetence or

negligence, then the plaintiffs were entitled to use the evidence to argue that the

defendants, in engaging Orlanda, failed to properly man the ship, knowing his past

employment history..</p>
</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Conclusion</p></i><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">21. For all the aforesaid reasons, I dismissed the defendants’

appeal.</p>
