<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiffs, Sundercan Ltd
                    (“Sundercan”) and Alain Mallart (“Mallart”) are
                    minority shareholders in a number of companies in which the defendant, Anthony
                    David Salzman, is the majority shareholder. They claimed to have sold their
                    minority shares to the defendant and other parties and sought an order of
                    specific performance of each of the alleged agreements for the sale and purchase
                    of the said shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The defendant is a majority shareholder and
                    director of V-Trac Holdings Limited (“VHL”), Engine Company No.1
                    (“ECN1”) and V-Trac International Leasing Company
                    (“VILC”). Sundercan and Mallart were minority shareholders in VHL
                    and ECN1. In addition, Mallart was also a minority shareholder in
                VILC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In the second half of 2008, the parties began
                    negotiating the sale by the plaintiffs of their minority holdings in VHL, ECNI,
                    and VILC to the defendant and other parties. The eventual proposed transactions
                    were as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The defendant, together with ECN1, were to
                            purchase Sundercan’s shares in VHL and ECN1 (“Sundercan
                            shares) for US$1,143,667.00; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The defendant, together with ECN1 and VILC, were
                            to purchase Mallart’s shares in VHL, ECN1 and VILC
                            (“Mallart shares”) for the sum of
                        US$983,023.00.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       During the negotiations, Sundercan and Mallart
                    were represented by Codex Treuhand AG (“Codex”) and
                    Ms Francoise Macq (“Macq”) respectively, while Ms Rachel
                    Ho (“Rachel”) acted on the defendant’s behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defendant’s Offer to Sundercan</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 7 October 2008, the defendant made an
                    offer for Sundercan’s shares when Rachel forwarded a number of documents
                    to Codex for Sundercan to execute. These included the share purchase agreement
                    (“Sundercan Agreement”), which had been executed by the defendant
                    on behalf of himself and ECN1. Under the terms thereof, the defendant was to be
                    responsible for payment of the purchase price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Sundercan did not accept the offer immediately.
                    Codex continued to negotiate the terms of the Sundercan Agreement with Rachel.
                    Between 17 October 2008 and 22 October 2208, Codex sought
                    clarification from Rachel in respect of some clauses in the Sundercan
                    Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Under cl 1.1 of the Sundercan Agreement,
                    the completion date would have been 1 November 2008. On that date,
                    Sundercan was to deliver the duly executed transfer forms and written
                    resignation of Stephane de Montauzan as director of VHL and the defendant would
                    have been required to do two things:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">make the first instalment payment of 80% of the
                            purchase price, <em>ie</em>, US$914,934.00 to
                            Sundercan; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">deliver a promissory note in favour of Sundercan
                            for payment of the balance 20%, <em>ie</em>,
                            US$228,733 no later than 30 April 2009.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 22 October 2008, Rachel informed Codex
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We are deeply worried by the global crisis and fear this may require a
                        change to the payment schedule. We still hope we can proceed without any
                        change, but we need a few more weeks before we can confirm.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the meantime, to be practical, you may sign and return the documents to
                        us. If no change is needed to the payment schedule, we will initial your
                        corrections and return an initialled original to you, and proceed. If a
                        changed schedule is needed, we will inform you before we initial, so you can
                        decide if the change is acceptable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 23 October 2008, Sundercan signed the
                    Sundercan Agreement. All the relevant documents were forwarded to Rachel, who
                    acknowledged receipt of the same via an email on 10 November 2008. It was
                    Sundercan’s case that it had accepted the defendant’s offer to
                    purchase the Sundercan shares on 23 October 2008 but the defendant asserted
                    that he had withdrawn his offer to buy the shares in Rachel’s email of
                    22 October 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Defendant’s offer to Mallart</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     As for Mallart’s shares, the defendant
                    offered to buy them when a number of documents, including the share purchase
                    agreement (“Mallart Agreement”), were sent to Mallart sometime
                    after 2 October 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Mallart did not sign the Mallart Agreement
                    immediately. Instead, between 16 and 22 October 2008, there were
                    negotiations on the terms of the Mallart Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     As with the Sundercan Agreement, the
                    completion date under the Mallart Agreement would have been 1 November
                    2008. On completion, Mallart would have been required to deliver executed share
                    transfer forms and his written resignation as director of VHL while the
                    defendant was to do two things:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">make payment of 80% of the purchase price,
                                <em>ie</em>, US$786,418.00; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">deliver a promissory note in favour of Mallart
                            for payment of the balance 20%, <em>ie</em>,
                            US$195,505.10 no later than 30 April 2009.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 22 October 2008, Rachel informed Macq
                    via an email as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We are deeply worried by the global crisis and fear this may require a
                        change to the payment schedule. We still hope we can proceed without any
                        change, but we need a few more weeks before we can confirm.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Also, I am very sorry but we simply cannot amend the promissory
                        note.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the meantime, I would appreciate your confirmation that the text of the
                        agreement and promissory note are acceptable. This way, we can go ahead
                        immediately after we confirm the old schedule or in the worst case, agree
                        with you on a new one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 23 October 2008, Macq emailed Rachel
                    at 5.22pm stating that the Mallart Agreement had been signed and that Macq was
                    ready to forward the relevant documents. Macq also asked to be advised if there
                    was any change to the payment schedule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In the meantime, there was apparently a
                    telephone discussion between Rachel and Macq. The substance of that conversation
                    was stated in an email from Rachel to the defendant at 23 October 2008 5.33
                    pm. It stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">..</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Francoise confirmed on the phone today that though the promissory note is
                        not ok, but they will accept it. She asked if they would still get the money
                        on Nov 1<sup>st</sup> completion date according to
                        agreement, Answer: NO</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">They are upset about the news. Francoise says if the payment schedule is
                        like changed from now 1<sup>st</sup> Nov to for example
                        another date like 10 Nov is Ok. But if it is a material like payment 1
                        on this date, payment 2 on another date and many payments within a long
                        period of like 20 months, then it is not ok.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I told her I don’t know until later. She wants us to confirm with
                        her is the wait 1 week or 2 weeks or how many weeks. I said not sure. But we
                        will get in touch again in 2 weeks time</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s email of 8 December 2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 8 December 2008, the defendant sent an
                    email to Rachel stating that he was not able to buy their shares due to the
                    economic crisis. In addition, he wrote that he proposed to review the situation
                    at the end of every month, and planned to proceed at the very earliest moment.
                    This email was forwarded by Rachel to Macq and Codex on 9 December
                    2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Demand for performance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In January 2009, the French solicitors of
                    Sundercan and Mallart demanded payment from the defendant for the Sundercan and
                    Mallart shares. The defendant replied through his solicitors that there were no
                    binding contracts for the sale of the said shares. They added that even if the
                    draft agreements were valid and binding, Sundercan and Mallart had not shown
                    that they were ready, able and willing to complete the purported agreements on
                    the completion date and were thus in repudiatory breach, in which case the
                    repudiatory breach was accepted and the contracts terminated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Sundercan and Mallart then instituted the
                    present proceedings to obtain an order of specific performance of the Sundercan
                    and Mallart Agreements against the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The issues canvassed by the parties were as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether any contracts were formed on
                        23 October 2008 by the plaintiffs’ purported acceptance of the
                        offers set out in the draft sale agreements;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     if so, whether the plaintiffs were in
                        repudiatory breach of such contracts;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a>(c)     if the contracts for sale and purchase of the
                        plaintiffs’ shares were formed and not terminated, whether the
                        plaintiffs were entitled to claim for the full price stated in the
                        contracts; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_d"></a>(d)     whether specific performance of the contracts should be
                    ordered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether contracts were formed on 23 October 2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     For the formation of a contract, an offer must
                    be accepted. Acceptance refers to a “final and unqualified expression of
                    assent to the terms of an offer” (<em>Chitty on
                        Contracts</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 30<sup>th</sup>
                    Ed, 2008) vol 1, at para 2-027).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In <em>Projection Pte Ltd v The
                        Tai Ping Insurance Co Ltd</em> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 798, the
                    Court of Appeal cited with approval at [16] the following words of Lord Denning
                    MR in Port Sudan Cotton Co v Govindaswamy Chettiar &amp; Sons [1977]
                    2 Lloyd’s Rep 5 at 10:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... I do not much like the analysis in the text-books of inquiring whether
                        there was an offer and acceptance, or a counter-offer, and so forth. I
                        prefer to examine the whole of the documents in the case and decide from
                        them whether the parties did reach an agreement upon all material terms in
                        such circumstances that the proper inference is that they agreed to be bound
                        by those terms from that time onwards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The position was reiterated in <em>Midlink Development Pte Ltd v The Stansfield Group Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 258 (“<em>Midlink</em>”) by Rajah JC, who said at [48]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Acceptance in a contractual setting must be ascertained objectively.
                        Acceptance can be signified orally, in writing or by conduct. When there is
                        a history of negotiations and discussions, the court will look at the whole
                        continuum of facts in concluding whether a contract exists.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     When considering the history of the
                    negotiations in the present case, both the email sent by Rachel on
                    22 October 2008 were crucial. In the email, the defendant made it clear
                    that he was no longer willing to be bound by the payment schedule set out in the
                    agreements because of the economic crisis. In my view, each email was a
                        <em>qualification</em> to each offer such that it
                    effectively suspended the original offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The plaintiffs submitted that the law is that
                    there can be a valid and binding agreement even if not all the details of the
                    terms of the agreement have been worked out between the parties. However, this
                    is so only if the court finds that the parties have in fact concluded a contract
                    and did not merely agree to contract in the future.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In my view, the payment schedule was an
                    important term of both the Sundercan and Mallart Agreements and there was no
                    mechanism for determining the payment schedule other than by future agreement
                    between the parties. For instance, in regard to the Sundercan Agreement, Rachel
                    stated on 22 October 2008 that if “a changed schedule is needed, we
                    will inform you before we initial so that you can decide if the change is
                    acceptable”. Similarly, in regard to the Mallart Agreement, Rachel wrote
                    “This way we can go ahead immediately after we confirm the old schedule
                    or in the worst case, agree with you on a new one”. This was akin to an
                    agreement to negotiate which, as is clear from the decision of the House of
                    Lords in <em>Walford v Miles</em> [1992]
                    2 AC 128, is unenforceable because it lacks the necessary
                    certainty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     As for the plaintiffs’ argument that the
                    defendant’s conduct subsequent to 23 October 2008 was consistent with
                    the existence of a concluded contract, it is not entirely clear as to whether
                    the courts can look at conduct subsequent to the time of the formation of the
                    contract to determine whether a contract was concluded. The plaintiffs relied on
                    two cases, namely <em>Econ Piling Pte Ltd v NCC International
                        AB</em> [2008] SGHC 26 (“Econ Piling”) and
                        <em>Midlink</em> to support their proposition but the
                    point was not argued there. The courts there appeared to have assumed that
                    subsequent conduct could be considered to determine the existence of a contract.
                    I would add that estoppel by convention is a different matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Furthermore, in <em>Zurich
                        Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction
                        Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029, the Court of Appeal
                    observed at [132(d)] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… However, the principle of objectively ascertaining contractual
                        intention(s) remains paramount. Thus, the extrinsic evidence must always go
                        towards proof of what the parties, from an objective viewpoint, ultimately
                        agreed upon. Further, where extrinsic evidence in the form of prior
                        negotiations and subsequent conduct is concerned, … there should be
                        no absolute or rigid prohibition against evidence of previous negotiations
                        or subsequent conduct, although, in the normal case, such evidence is likely
                        to be inadmissible for non-compliance with the requirements set out at [125]
                        and [128-129] above. (We should add that the relevance of subsequent conduct
                        remains a controversial and evolving topic that will require more extensive
                        scrutiny by this court at a more appropriate juncture.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1">While that was a case on the interpretation of the terms of a contract
                    and not the determination of the existence of a contract, it might equally apply
                    to the latter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Assuming that the court can consider conduct
                    subsequent to the formation of the contract, the defendant’s conduct after
                    23 October 2008 did not support the plaintiffs’ assertion that such
                    conduct unequivocally established a concluded contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Email had been exchanged between
                    24 October and 7 December 2008. While it is true that Rachel did not
                    deny the existence of a contract, neither did she confirm it. The parties were
                    still inquiring and discussing about the payment schedule. At best, the
                    communication between the parties in that period showed that they were still
                    keen to conclude a contract for the proposed transactions regarding the sale and
                    purchase of the Sundercan and Mallart shares but not that the contract in
                    question had been concluded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In the case of Mallart, there was another
                    factor that militated against the conclusion of a contract. Unlike the Sundercan
                    Agreement, the executed Mallart Agreement was not returned to Rachel. Macq had
                    held onto it pending the resolution of the payment schedule. To me, this
                    suggested that Macq knew that there was no concluded contract yet.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The plaintiffs also argued that the
                    defendant’s acceptance of the resignations of Montauzan and Mallart, which
                    would have been part of the completion obligations of Sundercan and Mallart,
                    were consistent with a concluded contract. However, although the defendant
                    appeared to have acted on the resignations, he nevertheless still acknowledged
                    Sundercan and Mallart as shareholders of their respective shares in VHL. Hence,
                    in a proposed rights issue of VHL in 9 October 2009, the shareholdings of
                    Sundercan and of Mallart in VHL were still acknowledged and they were eligible
                    for the rights issue although they in turn took the position that they had
                    already sold their shares. For completeness, I mention that I was informed that
                    the rights issue was withdrawn in any event.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     I accepted that the defendant should not have
                    acted on the resignations given his stance to deny the existence of a contract
                    but I have made the appropriate consequential directions to have those persons
                    reinstated as directors after I dismissed the plaintiffs’
                claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Other issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     As I decided that no contract was formed on
                    23 October 2008, I need not consider the defendant’s assertion that
                    if the Sundercan and Mallart Agreements had been concluded, the plaintiffs were
                    in repudiatory breach as they were not ready and willing to complete on
                    1 November 2008 in accordance with the terms of the
                agreements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Similarly, it was not necessary for me to
                    consider whether the plaintiffs would have been entitled to claim specific
                    performance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     There was also one other argument as to
                    whether the plaintiffs’ rights for the balance 20% would have been
                    confined to the terms of the intended promissory notes but this also was
                    academic in the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     For the reasons stated above, the
                    plaintiffs’ claims were dismissed with costs.</p>
