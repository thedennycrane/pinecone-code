                    In arriving at this decision, the Judge ordered the sentences in respect of the
                    First and Second charges to be served consecutively pursuant to s 18 of the

                    of the Third to Seventh charges to run concurrently with the sentences in
                    respect of the First and Second charges. We allowed the appeal to the extent
                    that the total sentence was reduced to 22 years and 8 months’
                    imprisonment with 20 strokes of the cane, and now give the detailed grounds
                    for our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Appellant is a 30 year old Singaporean
                    who was educated in Perth, Australia. At the time of his arrest, he was a
                    regular with the Republic of Singapore Navy. He had no antecedents prior to
                    committing the present offences. The facts pertaining to the commission of the
                    offences may be summarised as follows.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> On 10 October
                    2009, at approximately 11.45pm, the Appellant drove his motor car alone into
                    Singapore <em>via</em> the Woodlands Checkpoint. At the
                    Woodlands Checkpoint, the Appellant was directed by an officer of the
                    Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (“ICA”) to Lane 6 of
                    the Arrival Car Green Channel Zone for an inspection.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       During the inspection, the ICA officers
                    discovered a box of tissues on the floor behind the driver’s seat. Various
                    glassware and glass pipes were found inside the tissue box. The ICA officers
                    then activated officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”)
                    for assistance. Upon inspection by the CNB officers, the following items were
                    found within the vehicle:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     One red plastic bag behind the radio
                        console containing two packets of granular/powdery substances wrapped in a
                        newspaper;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     One
                        orange plastic bag inside the compartment below the handbrake, which also
                        contained two packets of granular/powdery substances wrapped in a newspaper;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_c"></a>(c)     One black
                        pouch in the compartment below the radio console, which contained two
                        packets of crystalline substance, a glass tube, a glass pipe and a
                        straw.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The aforesaid items were seized by the CNB
                    officers and the Appellant was placed under arrest. Analysis of the exhibits
                    seized from the Appellant during his arrest at the Woodlands Checkpoint revealed
                    the following contents: 30.91 grams of diamorphine;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> 1.12 grams of
                        methamphetamine;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> and two sets of
                    utensils intended to be used for consumption of drugs. These exhibits formed the
                    subject matter of the First, Second, Fourth and Fifth charges
                        (see <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       After his arrest, the Appellant was accompanied
                    by CNB officers to his residence. Upon searching his residence, three tablets
                    (which were subsequently analysed and found to contain nimetazepam) and one
                    glassware with two inserts (which was subsequently analysed and found to be
                    stained with methamphetamine) were found. The Appellant was also subjected to a
                    urine test which revealed that he had consumed methamphetamine. The Third, Sixth
                    and Seventh charges arose from this set of facts (see <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       According to the Appellant, he was in financial
                    difficulties in the years 2008 and 2009. These difficulties emanated from
                    escalating credit card and mobile phone bills which amounted to approximately
                    $13,000. In order to settle his bills, the Appellant borrowed money from family
                    and friends. The Appellant was subsequently approached by a person by the name
                    of Eric on 10 October 2009 in Johor Bahru. Eric proposed that the Appellant
                    import drugs into Singapore in exchange for payment of $2,500. The drugs were to
                    be passed on to a courier after the Appellant arrived in Singapore. The
                    Appellant was acquainted with Eric prior to 10 October 2009 as they used to
                    have drinks together. The Appellant agreed to Eric’s proposal as he was
                    keen to obtain the sum of $2,500. Thereafter, the Appellant gave Eric the keys
                    to his car for the latter to load drugs onto the car. After Eric had loaded
                    drugs onto the Appellant’s vehicle, the Appellant drove back to Singapore
                        <em>via</em> the Woodlands Checkpoint where he was
                    arrested. Investigations further revealed that the Appellant had consumed
                    methamphetamine in Johor Bahru prior to his arrest, and that he had admitted
                    ownership over the drug utensils which formed the subject matter of the Fourth
                    to Seventh charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Judge’s decision on the appropriate sentence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The factors weighted by the Judge in arriving at
                    the sentences imposed were succinctly stated at [17] of the GD, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The circumstances and conduct of the [Appellant] before and
                        after his arrest are also important matters to be considered. I kept in mind
                        the mitigating factors, i.e that he had pleaded guilty to all the charges,
                        that he had co-operated in the investigations and that he had no
                        antecedents. I also took into account other factors:</p>

                                and was incurred by him in credit card and mobile phone
                                expenses;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(e)    he was not put under pressure to commit the
                                offences, but was tempted by the allure of quick cash, as his
                                counsel put it; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(f)    he would have faced the death penalty on
                                conviction if the quantity of diamorphine was not reduced by the
                                prosecution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Judge also clearly explained his decision
                    not to impose the minimum sentence in respect of the First Charge
                        (at [19] of the GD). In doing
                    so, the Judge considered that the actual quantum of diamorphine imported by the
                    Appellant (30.91 grams) was considerable and was actually more than twice
                    the quantity which could have attracted the mandatory death sentence, and that
                    there were no compelling extenuating circumstances in the commission of the
                    offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Crucially, and most relevantly to the present
                    appeal, the Judge held (at [21] of
                    the GD) that the one-transaction rule (discussed at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> below) did not apply in respect of the First and Second
                    charges. As such, the Judge was of the view that he was not constrained in
                    ordering the sentences in respect of the First and Second charges to be served
                    consecutively. In the Judge’s view, a total sentence of
                    27 years’ imprisonment with 20 strokes of the cane was
                    appropriate. The Judge’s reasoning was primarily set out at [29] of the
                    GD, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the present case, the [Appellant] had rendered his services to Eric to
                        import a substantial quantity of diamorphine from Johor Bahru into
                        Singapore. In addition to that, he was importing methamphetamine into
                        Singapore on his own account, he was consuming drugs, and he had other drugs
                        in his residence and was in possession of utensils for drug consumption. He
                        was fortunate that the prosecution reduced the quantity of diamorphine in
                        Charge 1 so that the capital punishment would not be imposed. Looking
                        at all the circumstances, an effective sentence of 27 years
                        imprisonment is not disproportionate to the [Appellant’s] total
                        culpability.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     As already mentioned at the outset of this
                    judgment, the appeal is one in relation to sentence. In this regard, the law as
                    to when appellate courts will interfere with sentences meted out by trial courts
                    was succinctly stated by Chan Sek Keong CJ, delivering the grounds of
                    decision of this court in PP v UI [2008] 4 SLR(R) 500 (“PP v
                    UI”), as follows (at [12]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is, of course, well established (see, <em>inter alia</em>, <em>Tan Koon Swan v PP</em>
                        [ 1985-1986] SLR(R) 976 and <em>Ong Ah Tiong v
                            PP</em> [2004] 1 SLR(R) 587) that an appellate court
                        will not ordinarily disturb the sentence imposed by the trial court except
                        where it is satisfied that:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    the trial judge erred with respect to the
                                proper factual basis for sentencing;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    the trial judge failed to appreciate the
                                materials placed before him;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    the sentence was wrong in principle;
                            or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    the sentence was manifestly excessive or
                                manifestly inadequate, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Counsel for the Appellant, Mr Subhas
                    Anandan (“Mr Anandan”), informed this court that <em>no</em> challenge was being mounted against the <em>individual</em> sentences meted out by the Judge <em>vis-a-vis</em> each charge. Rather, the thrust of the
                    Appellant’s arguments was that the Judge should not have ordered the
                    sentences meted out in respect of the First and Second charges to be served
                    consecutively. What the Appellant was seeking, therefore, was a reduction of the
                    overall sentence by reconfiguring the sentences which the Appellant was to serve
                    consecutively. This approach to the appeal by Mr Anandan was, in our view,
                    fair and eminently sound as the sentences meted <em>vis-a-vis</em> each individual charge were, in our view, consistent
                    with the relevant sentencing precedents and could not be challenged on any of
                    the grounds stated in <em>PP v UI</em> (at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above). Two specific issues arose from the
                    contention put forth by Mr Anandan: firstly, whether the one-transaction
                    rule applied in respect of the First and Second charges; and secondly, if the
                    one-transaction rule applied, whether the total sentence meted by the Judge
                    could nevertheless be justified.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the one-transaction rule applied in respect of the First and
                Second charges</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The nature of the one-transaction rule was
                    discussed by V K Rajah J in the Singapore High Court decision of
                        <em>PP v Law Aik Meng</em> [2007]
                    2 SLR(R) 814 (“<em>Law Aik
                    Meng</em>”), as follows (at [52]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The one-transaction rule requires that where two or more
                        offences are committed in the course of a single transaction, all sentences
                        in respect of those offences should be concurrent rather than consecutive:
                            <em>Maideen Pillai v PP</em> [1995]
                        3 SLR(R) 706; <em>Kanagasuntharam v PP</em>
                        [1991] 2 SLR(R) 874 (“<em>Kanagasuntharam</em>”). Prof Andrew Ashworth in
                            <em>Sentencing and Criminal Justice</em> [(24(f)]
                        supra) at p 245 interpreted the <em>raison
                            d’être</em> for the “single transaction”
                        principle in terms of proximity in time <em>and</em> proximity in type of offence. Such an interpretation
                        was also adopted by Dr D A Thomas in <em>Principles of Sentencing</em> (Heinemann, 2nd Ed, 1979)
                            (“<em>Principles of
                        Sentencing</em>”), who opined at p 54:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The concept of ‘single transaction’ may be held to cover a
                            sequence of offences involving a repetition of <em>the
                                same behaviour</em> towards the <em>same
                                victim</em> ... provided the offences are committed <em>within a relatively short space of time</em>.
                            [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     And, in the Singapore High Court decision of
                        <em>PP v Firdaus bin Abdullah</em> [2010]
                    3 SLR 225 (“<em>Firdaus</em>”),
                    Chan Sek Keong CJ observed thus (at [27]–[28]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27     The “one transaction” rule,
                        together with the totality principle, provides a useful guide for the court
                        to assess whether concurrent or consecutive sentences should be imposed when
                        an offender has done a criminal act or acts which have resulted in a
                        plurality of offences. A related principle that should be borne in mind is
                        where an offender is convicted of various offences arising from what is
                        essentially one incident, his overall sentence should reflect his role and
                        culpability in the incident as a whole. <em>The rationale
                            underpinning these principles is that of proportionality in
                            punishment</em>: see <em>Jeffery bin Abdullah v
                            PP</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 414 at [16] and <em>PP v Law Aik
                            Meng</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 814 (“<em>Law Aik Meng”</em>) at [60].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    Put simply, the
                            essence of the “one transaction” rule is that where two or
                            more offences are committed in the course of a single transaction, all
                            sentences in respect of these offences should be concurrent rather than
                            consecutive (the rule is, however, subject to the qualification in
                            s 18 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed)
                            in Singapore). The English Court of Appeal observed in <em>R v Peter John Kastercum</em> (1972) 56 Cr App R
                            298 at 299-300 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[W]here several offences are tried together and arise out of the same
                            transaction, it is a good working rule that the sentences imposed for
                            those offences should be made concurrent. <em>The reason
                                for that is because if a man is charged with several serious
                                offences arising out of the same situation and consecutive sentences
                                are imposed, the total very often proves to be much too great for
                                the incident in question. That is only an ordinary working
                                rule</em>; it is perfectly open to a trial judge in a case
                            such as the present to approach this in one of two ways. If he thinks
                            that the assault on the police officer is really part and parcel of the
                            original offence and is to be treated as an aggravation of the original
                            offence, he can reflect it in the sentence for the original offence. If
                            he does that, it is logical and right that any separate sentence for the
                            assault should be made concurrent. On the other hand, and, as this Court
                            thinks, a better course, in cases where an offender assaults the police
                            in an effort to escape, the sentence for the principal offence can be
                            fixed independently of the assault on the constable, and the assault on
                            the constable can be dealt with by a separate and consecutive sentence.
                            [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This approach was approved by the Court of Appeal in <em>V
                            Murugesan v PP</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 388
                            (“<em>Murugesan</em>”) at [34]. In
                            <em>Law Aik Meng</em>, the court also endorsed Prof
                        Andrew Ashworth's remarks in <em>Sentencing and Criminal
                            Justice</em> (Cambridge University Press, 4th Ed, 2005) at
                        p 244 that the “one transaction” rule “seems to be
                        little more than a pragmatic device for limiting overall sentences rather
                        than a reflection of a sharp category distinction”, which
                        consequently hindered the definition of what constituted a single
                        transaction (at [56]). In that sense, the rule is really just another
                        way of formulating the totality principle.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Much would, however, depend on <em>the precise facts and circumstances of the case</em> that are
                    before the court concerned. Hence, none of the elements of proximity referred to
                    in the preceding paragraph is conclusive (see, for example, the Singapore High
                    Court decisions of <em>Meeran bin Mydin v PP</em> [1998]
                    1 SLR(R) 522, especially at [12] and <em>Fricker Oliver v PP</em>
                    [2011] 1 SLR 84, especially at [25]). This is perhaps why Chan CJ
                    observed, in <em>Firdaus</em> (at [31]), that
                    “[r]ecent case law illustrates the uncertain boundaries of the
                    ‘one-transaction’ principle”. As importantly, the
                    one-transaction rule ought to be applied in a <em>commonsensical</em> way as well (see, for example, <em>per</em> Chan CJ in <em>Firdaus</em>
                    (at [38]), where the learned Chief Justice observed that
                    “[u]ltimately, any analysis must take a commonsensical view as to what
                    forms part of a single transaction”.).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     A qualification must, however, be noted in
                    respect of the one-transaction rule: that it is not meant to be an inflexible
                    rule which inhibits the imposition of deterrent consecutive sentences when
                    appropriate. As Rajah J pertinently observed in <em>Law Aik
                        Meng</em> (at [55] and [56]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">55    It is also
                            appropriate to reiterate that the one-transaction rule should not be
                            construed as a hard and fast rule rigidly applied across the board. In
                            this context, in <em>Kanagasuntharam</em> ([52]
                                <em>supra</em>), Yong CJ observed at
                            [6]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<em>The general rule, however, is not an absolute
                                rule</em>. The English courts have recognised that there are
                            situations where consecutive sentences are necessary to discourage the
                            type of criminal conduct being punished: see <em>R v
                                Faulkner</em> (1972) 56 Cr App R 594<em>, R v
                                Wheatley</em> (1983) 5 Cr App R (S) 417 and <em>R v Skinner</em> (1968) 8 Cr App R (S) 166. <em>The applicability of the exception is said to depend on the
                                facts of the case and the circumstances of the offence</em>.
                            It is stated in broad and general terms and although it may be
                            criticised as vague, it is necessarily in such terms <em>in order that the sentencer may impose an appropriate sentence in
                                each particular case upon each particular offender at the particular
                                time the case is heard</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Further, in recognising that the one-transaction rule is not
                        carved in stone and should be applied sensibly, the Court of Appeal in
                            <em>V Murugesan v PP</em> [2006]
                        1 SLR(R) 388 (“<em>V
                        Murugesan</em>”) also referred to the case of <em>R v Peter John Kastercum</em> (1972) 56 Cr App R
                        298, where the English Court of Appeal had considered the principles for
                        determining whether sentences for convictions of a substantive offence and
                        of assault on a police officer should run concurrently or consecutively. The
                        English Court of Appeal had rationalised the one-transaction rule, at
                        299-300, in the following terms (see <em>V
                            Murugesan</em> at [34]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[W]here several offences are tried together and arise out of the same
                            transaction, it is a good working rule that the sentences imposed for
                            those offences should be made concurrent. The reason for that is because
                            if a man is charged with several serious offences arising out of the
                            same situation and consecutive sentences are imposed, the total very
                            often proves to be much too great for the incident in question.
                                <em>That is only an ordinary working rule;
                                ...</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">56    Indeed, in <em>Sentencing and
                                Criminal Justice</em> ([25(b)] <em>supra</em>), Prof Ashworth has also perceptively remarked
                            that one stumbling block in constructing a workable definition of a
                            “single transaction” for the one-transaction rule is that
                            “it seems to be little more than a pragmatic device for limiting
                            overall sentences rather than a reflection of a sharp category
                            distinction”: see p 244. Therefore, where consecutive
                            sentences are in keeping with the gravity of the offences, courts should
                            not impose concurrent sentences simply because they feel fettered by the
                            presumed operation of the one-transaction rule. I am persuaded in any
                            event that even if the offences in the present case might conceivably be
                            perceived as part of a single transaction, consecutive sentences are
                            nonetheless not only more appropriate here, they are in fact dictated by
                            the gravity of the offences involved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Reference may also be made to <em>Firdaus</em> (at [29] and [38]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Judge in the present case considered that
                    the one-transaction rule did not apply in respect of the First and Second
                    Charges because the drugs in respect of each of the two charges were imported
                    for different purposes: the diamorphine was imported for the specific purpose of
                    passing on to a drug courier whilst the metamphetamine was imported for the
                    Appellant’s own consumption. During the hearing before us, the Prosecution
                    – not surprisingly – supported this reasoning of the Judge. On
                    closer analysis, however, such reasoning yields, with respect, counterintuitive
                    results. We elaborate by considering a hypothetical situation. If the Appellant
                    had imported the methamphetamine for the purpose of passing it on to a drug
                    courier (the same purpose for which he had imported the diamorphine), the
                    one-transaction rule would apply in his favour. This, in our view, would be an
                    unsatisfactory application of the one-transaction rule because importing drugs
                    for the purpose of trafficking is more serious than importation of drugs for
                    one’s own consumption. Such a view is founded upon the fact that
                    trafficking in drugs generally carries stiffer penalties as compared to
                    possession and/or consumption of drugs (see the Second Schedule to the Act for
                    the prescribed penalties). Given that it is trite that motive in committing an
                    offence is a relevant sentencing consideration (see, for example, the Singapore
                    High Court decision of <em>Zhao Zhipeng v PP</em> [2008]
                    4 SLR(R) 879 at [37]), it would, with respect, be wrong, on the facts
                    of this particular case, to reject the one-transaction rule and sentence a less
                    culpable offender to a more severe sentence – especially when we bear in
                    mind the fact (already referred to above at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>) that the application of the one-transaction rule is also
                    an exercise in commonsense. It also bears repeating that the application of this
                    rule depends very much on the precise facts and circumstances of the case at
                    hand (see also above at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>). Looked at
                    from the perspectives of logic, commonsense as well as the facts and
                    circumstances of the present case, although counsel for the Prosecution,
                    Mr Anandan Bala (“Mr Bala”), argued forcefully that
                    there was a distinction between the offences brought against the Appellant
                    pursuant to the First and Second Charges, this was, in our view, only a
                        <em>literal</em> distinction. When the precise facts
                    and circumstances are viewed in relation to their <em>substance</em> (as opposed to mere form) in the context of both logic
                    as well as commonsense, it seemed to us that there was indeed one transaction in
                    so far as the Appellant’s actions with regard to the First and Second
                    Charges were concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In the circumstances, we are of the view that
                    the one-transaction rule applies in respect of the First and Second charges as
                    the offences underlying these charges were committed in one instance in so far
                    as the Appellant had imported both the diamorphine and metamphetamine into
                    Singapore at the same time <em>via</em> the same modus by
                    transporting them in his vehicle. As a consequence, we are of the view that the
                    sentences meted out in respect of the First and Second charges should be ordered
                    to be served concurrently.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the total sentence meted by the Judge could still be
                justified</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     During the hearing before us, the Prosecution
                    argued that, even if the one-transaction rule could be applied in favour of the
                    Appellant, the total sentence meted out by the Judge may not necessarily be
                    manifestly excessive. The Prosecution submitted (in accordance with the
                    principle stated at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above) that courts
                    are not inexorably constrained by the one-transaction rule, and that the
                    severity of the present offences called for a deterrent sentence which may be
                    meted out by ordering the sentences in respect of the First and Second charges
                    to be served consecutively. In particular, the Prosecution relied upon in the
                    Singapore High Court decision of <em>PP v Tan Kiam
                        Peng</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 522 (“<em>Tan Kiam Peng</em>”) (affirmed in <em>Tan Kiam
                        Peng v PP</em> [2008]1 SLR(R) 1 (“<em>Tan Kiam Peng (CA)</em>”)) where V K Rajah J
                    highlighted the severity of drug related offences, as follows (at [8] (and see observations to like effect in
                        <em>Tan Kiam Peng (CA)</em> at [27]–[28] and
                    [179]–[181])):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The drug trade is a major social evil. While drug peddlers may not be
                        visibly seen or caught taking away or damaging lives, they nonetheless
                        inflict alarmingly insidious problems on society that have the potential to
                        destroy its very fabric if left unchecked. Each successful trafficker has
                        the disturbing potential to inflict enormous and enduring harm over an
                        extremely wide circle of victims. Apart from the harm that drugs inflict on
                        an addict’s well-being, drug trafficking engenders and feeds a vicious
                        cycle of crime that inexorably ripples through the community.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Mr Bala further submitted that sentencing
                    precedents in relation to offences of importing or trafficking in not less than
                    14.99 grams of diamorphine (as was the case in relation to the First
                    Charge) demonstrated that courts have meted out terms of imprisonment ranging
                    from the statutory minimum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment up to
                    25 years’ imprisonment along with 15 to 20 strokes of the cane.
                    In addition, Mr Bala argued that courts had previously calibrated sentences
                    in the same manner as the Judge did. As such, it was argued that the total
                    sentence of 27 years’ imprisonment and 20 strokes of the cane
                    meted out by the Judge in this case was not manifestly excessive. In advancing
                    this argument, the Prosecution relied, in the main, on two precedents. We will
                    now address each of them in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The first case relied upon by the Prosecution
                    was <em>PP v Ng Teng </em><em>Kian</em> in criminal case no 5 of 2010 (unreported)
                        (“<em>Ng Teng Kian</em>”) where the
                    offender pleaded guilty to three charges under s 7 of the Act for importing
                    not less than 14.99 grams of diamorphine, 15.58 grams of
                    methamphetamine and one tablet containing nimetazepam. The offender was
                    sentenced to 22 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane
                    for the charge of importing diamorphine, 5 years’ imprisonment and
                    5 strokes of the cane for importing methamphetamine, and
                    3 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane for the
                    remaining charge. The sentence of 22 years’ imprisonment and
                    15 strokes of the cane was ordered to be served consecutively with the
                    sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane. The
                    total sentence meted out was thus 27 years’ imprisonment and
                    24 strokes of the cane. The offender in <em>Ng Teng
                        Kian</em> had a dissimilar antecedent of attempting to enter a
                    protected place without permission. A factor which immediately distinguishes the
                    culpability of the Appellant from the offender in <em>Ng Teng
                        Kian</em> was the difference in the quantities of methamphetamine
                    imported: the offender in <em>Ng Teng Kian</em> imported
                    close to 15 times the amount of methamphetamine imported by the
                    Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The second case relied upon by the Prosecution
                    was <em>PP v Irzan Azhar bin Mohd Rozi</em> in criminal
                    case no 22 of 2008 (unreported) (“<em>Irzan Azhar bin
                        Mohd Rozi</em>”). The offender had pleaded guilty to two
                    charges of engaging in conspiracies to traffic in not less than 14.99 grams
                    of diamorphine and 8.36 grams of methamphetamine which were offences under
                    section 5(1)(a) read with section 12 of the Act. For the charge of
                    conspiring to traffic in not less than 14.99 grams of diamorphine, the
                    offender was sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes
                    of the cane. 5 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane was
                    meted out in respect of the remaining charge. Both sentences were ordered to be
                    served consecutively thus resulting in a total sentence of 30 years’
                    imprisonment with 20 strokes of the cane. By way of antecedents, the
                    offender in <em>Irzan Azhar bin Mohd Rozi</em> had
                    significant drug related antecedents, having previously trafficked in
                    diamorphine – the very same offence he had been charged with in <em>Irzan Azhar bin Mohd Rozi</em> – and also had
                    previously consumed morphine and methamphetamine, as well as possessed utensils
                    for drug taking. The significant antecedents present in <em>Irzan
                        Azhar bin Mohd Rozi</em> were completely absent in the present case as
                    the Appellant, as already noted, is a first time offender. This fact, in and of
                    itself, suffices in distinguishing the precedential value of <em>Irzan Azhar bin Mohd Rozi</em> from the present case. However, during
                    the hearing before us, Mr Bala very fairly highlighted a further
                    distinguishing factor which was not readily apparent: that the offender in
                        <em>Irzan Azhar bin Mohd Rozi</em> was embroiled in a
                    drug syndicate and that this factor featured prominently when the sentence was
                    calibrated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In view of the significant distinguishing
                    factors between the present case and the precedents cited by the Prosecution (as
                    discussed at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> and <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above), we were of the view that there were
                    no significant aggravating factors in the present case which warranted the
                    imposition of consecutive sentences in respect of the First and Second
                    charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision on the appropriate sentence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     We are well aware of the evils of the drug
                    trade and fully endorse the observations in <em>Tan Kiam
                        Peng</em> (reproduced above at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>). However, for the reasons set out above, the appeal
                    against the sentence imposed by the Judge is allowed and the sentence in respect
                    of the First charge is to be served consecutively with the sentence in respect
                    of the Third charge, while the terms of imprisonment imposed by the Judge in the
                    court below in respect of the remaining charges are to be served concurrently.
                    The total sentence is therefore 22 years and 8 months’
                    imprisonment with 20 strokes of the cane.</p>
