        Chan Sek Keong CJ (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In <em>Lim Eng Hock Peter v Lin
                        Jian Wei and another and another appeal</em> [2009] SGCA 48
                    (“the Judgment”), the appellant (“the Appellant”)
                    succeeded in his defamation action against the respondents (“the
                    Respondents”) and was awarded damages on an aggravated basis by this
                    court. This present judgment concerns the issue of the quantum of damages to be
                    awarded, and should, accordingly, be read together with the
                Judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The subject of quantum of damages for defamation
                    appears to be continually misrepresented or misunderstood by some sections of
                    the public in Singapore. In order to clear up these misconceptions, we shall, in
                    this judgment, touch on the various bases for awarding differentiated damages
                    for defamation committed against different classes of plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The award of damages in a defamation case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       It is apposite to begin this judgment by
                    considering, in brief, the nature of and rationale behind damages awarded in
                    defamation cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In <em>Arul Chandran v Chew Chin
                        Aik Victor</em> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 86 (“<em>Arul Chandran</em>”), this court summarised the
                    functions of <em>general</em> damages awarded in defamation
                    actions in the following manner (at [53]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">General damages serve three functions. Firstly, they act as a consolation
                        to the plaintiff for the distress he suffered from the publication of the
                        statement. Secondly, they repair the harm to his reputation. Thirdly, they
                        serve to vindicate his reputation ....</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Uren v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Pty
                        Ltd</em> [1966] 117 CLR 118 (“<em>Uren</em>”), Windeyer J, in a passage approved by the
                    House of Lords in <em>Cassell &amp; Co Ltd v Broome and
                        Another</em> [1972] AC 1027 at 1071, stressed the
                    vindicatory and consolatory functions of general damages (<em>Uren</em> at 150):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It seems to me that, properly speaking, a man defamed does not get
                        compensation for his damaged reputation. He gets damages because he was
                        injured in his reputation, that is simply because he was publicly defamed.
                        For this reason, compensation by damages operates in two ways – as a
                        vindication of the plaintiff to the public and as a consolation to him for a
                        wrong done. Compensation is here a solatium rather than a monetary
                        recompense for harm measurable in money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In <em>McCarey v Associated
                        Newspapers Ltd (No 2)</em> [1965] 2 QB 86, Pearson LJ
                    commented on general damages as follows (at 104–105):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Compensatory damages ... may include not only actual pecuniary loss and
                        anticipated pecuniary loss or any social disadvantages which result, or may
                        be thought likely to result, from the wrong which has been done. They may
                        also include the natural injury to his feelings – the natural grief
                        and distress which he may have felt at having been spoken of in defamatory
                        terms, and if there has been any kind of high-handed, oppressive, insulting
                        or contumelious behaviour by the defendant which increases the mental pain
                        and suffering caused by the defamation and may constitute injury to the
                        plaintiff’s pride and self-confidence, those are proper elements to be
                        taken into account in a case where the damages are at large.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Other than general damages, other types of
                    damages – such as aggravated damages (for aggravation of the injury
                    suffered by a plaintiff through the defamation) and exemplary damages (to,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, punish a defendant for the wilful
                    commission of a tort) – may be awarded. With that said, Singapore law,
                    like English law, does not regard the claimant’s reputation as
                    “vindicated by a symbolic award of a token or conventional sum of
                    damages” (<em>Gatley on Libel and Slander</em>
                    (Patrick Milmo QC &amp; W V H Rogers eds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 11th Ed,
                    2008) (“<em>Gatley</em>”) at p 267). In
                    this regard, the following observation of the Supreme Court of Canada in
                        <em>Hill v Church of Scientology of Toronto</em> [1995]
                    2 SCR 1130 is pertinent (at [166]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A defamatory statement can seep into the crevasses of the subconscious and
                        lurk there ever ready to spring forth and spread its cancerous evil. The
                        unfortunate impression left by a libel may last a lifetime. Seldom does the
                        defamed person have the opportunity of replying and correcting the record in
                        a manner that will truly remedy the situation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In determining the appropriate quantum of
                        <em>general</em> damages to be awarded in any given
                    case, circumstances that are relevant and should be taken into account
                    include:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     the nature and gravity of the
                        defamation;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        conduct, position and standing of the plaintiff and the
                    defendant;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     the mode
                        and extent of publication;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_d"></a>(d)     the natural indignation of the court at the injury caused
                        to the plaintiff;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_e"></a>(e)     the conduct of the defendant from the time the defamatory statement
                        is published to the very moment of the verdict;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_f"></a>(f)     the failure to apologise and retract the
                        defamatory statement; and</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(g)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the presence of malice.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Another consideration relevant to the
                    determination of the quantum of general damages to be awarded is its intended
                    deterrent effect. In <em>The Gleaner Co Ltd and another v
                        Abrahams</em> [2004] 1 AC 628, the Privy Council (<em>per</em> Lord Hoffman) said (at 646):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[D]efamation cases have important features not shared by personal injury
                        claims. <em>The damages often serve not only as compensation
                            but also as an effective and necessary deterrent</em>. The
                        deterrent is effective because the damages are paid either by the defendant
                        himself or under a policy of insurance which is likely to be sensitive to
                        the incidence of such claims. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The effectiveness of the deterrent would depend
                    on the amount of the damages awarded. In <em>Kiam v MGN
                        Ltd</em> [2003] 1 QB 281, Sedley LJ discussed the
                    importance of awarding an adequate amount of damages in order for the award to
                    be an effective deterrent, and said (at 304):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the <em>ineffectiveness of a moderate award in
                            deterring future libels is painfully apparent</em>. It is this, I
                        believe, that is leading both judges and juries once more to lift the level
                        of general damages for libel into a different league from personal injury
                        damages, at least in cases like the present where the newspaper has not
                        simply got its facts wrong but has behaved outrageously from start to
                        finish. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In recent times, the quantum of damages
                    awarded to public personages, especially political figures, has come under much
                    scrutiny. The primary criticism is that the amounts awarded in damages have an
                    alleged “chilling” effect on political and public debate on
                    matters considered to be of public interest. However, despite the expansion of
                    the common law defence of qualified privilege to political speech in
                    jurisdictions such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom
                    (which, under the previous law, might or would have been defamatory), the
                    general levels of damages awarded to political figures for defamation in these
                    countries have not been consciously reduced. For the courts in these
                    jurisdictions, the assessment of defamation damages still turns on a considered
                    weighing of the facts and circumstances of each case. The rationale for
                    continuing this established approach may be found in the following passage from
                        <em>Gatley</em> (at p 268):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">While the level of damages should not be so high as unduly to curtail
                        freedom of expression, “<em>the court should be
                            careful not to drive down damages in libel cases to a level which
                            publishers might with equanimity be tempted to risk having to
                            pay</em>”. Nevertheless, “the figure of Justice
                        carries a pair of scales, not a cornucopia” and “it serves no
                        public purpose to encourage plaintiffs to regard a successful libel action,
                        risky though the process undoubtedly is, as a road to untaxed
                        riches”. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Gradation of damages for different plaintiffs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Applying the principles set out above, the
                    Singapore courts have, over the years, established a gradation or spectrum of
                    damages to be awarded to plaintiffs. This gradation is based primarily on a few
                    dominant considerations, <em>viz</em>, the position and
                    standing of the plaintiff in society, the nature and gravity of the defamation,
                    the mode and extent of the publication, and the position and responsibility of
                    the defendant as a publisher or purveyor of the defamation. In this respect,
                    counsel for the Appellant argued – correctly in our view – that
                    broadly speaking, our courts have differentiated between categories of
                    plaintiffs for the purpose of determining the amount of damages to be awarded
                    for defamation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Singapore courts have consistently awarded
                    higher damages to public leaders than other personalities for similar types of
                    defamation because of the greater damage done not only to them personally, but
                    also to the reputation of the institution of which they are members. The
                    expression “public leaders” in this context would be a reference
                    to political and non-political leaders in the Government and public sector and
                    private sector leaders who devote their careers and lives to serving the State
                    and the public. The expression is not used in reference to people who are merely
                    famous in the public eye, such as footballers or singers and people in the
                    entertainment industry. Instead, it covers prominent figures in business,
                    industry and professions wherein the relevant outputs serve to augment public
                    welfare. Public leaders are generally entitled to higher damages also because of
                    their standing in Singapore society and devotion to public service. Any libel or
                    slander of their character with respect to their public service damages not only
                    their personal reputation, but also the reputation of Singapore as a State whose
                    leaders have acquired a worldwide reputation for honesty and integrity in office
                    and dedication to service of the people. In this connection, it is pertinent
                    that it has been said that the most serious acts of defamation are those that
                    touch on the “core attributes of the plaintiff’s
                    personality”, <em>ie</em>, matters such as
                    “integrity, honour, courage, loyalty and achievement” (see
                        <em>Gatley</em> at p 267).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Defaming a political leader is a serious
                    matter in Singapore because it damages the moral authority of such a person to
                    lead the people and the country. In <em>Crampton v
                        Nugawela</em> (1996) 41 NSWLR 176 (“<em>Crampton</em>”), the Supreme Court of New South Wales stated
                    (at 193):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In some cases, a person’s reputation is, in a relevant sense, his
                        whole life. The reputation of a clerk for financial honesty and [that] of a
                        solicitor for integrity are illustrations of this. The reputation of a
                        doctor is, I think, of this character: at least, it is so where a
                        substantial part of his work is in an area where he acts on reference from
                        or with the recommendation of other doctors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In our view, the reputation of public leaders in Singapore can, to use
                    the words of the court in <em>Crampton</em>, be considered
                    to be their “whole life”. Without a clean or credible reputation,
                    their moral authority to lead the people is compromised. We should, however,
                    clarify that this does not mean that public leaders may not be criticised at
                    all. They certainly should be strongly – and perhaps even mercilessly
                    – criticised for incompetence, insensitivity, ignorance, and any number of
                    other human frailties where the critique does not go to the extent of
                    besmirching their integrity, honesty, honour, and such other qualities that make
                    up the reputation of a person.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     For the reasons set out in the preceding
                    paragraphs, we are of the view that on the whole, damages awarded by the
                    Singapore courts in the past for the defamation of public figures have not been
                    excessive, and indeed have been rather moderate. This assessment is borne out by
                    a consideration of the damages awarded to plaintiffs of lesser public standing
                    in other Commonwealth jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Damages in Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In Singapore, damages awarded to the Prime
                    Minister and other Ministers who have been defamed have to date not exceeded
                    $500,000 in a single suit. In 1978, the then Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan
                    Yew, was awarded damages of $130,000 for a slander against him. During an
                    election rally, the defendant suggested, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, that he (<em>ie</em>, Mr Lee) had
                    abused the powers of his office (see <em>Lee Kuan Yew v
                        Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin</em>
                    [1979–1980] SLR(R) 24). In 1996, the then Senior Minister,
                    Mr Lee Kuan Yew, was awarded $400,000 against the writer of an article that
                    appeared in the <em>International Herald Tribune</em>,
                    which alleged, <em>inter alia</em>, that Mr Lee had
                    relied on a compliant judiciary to obtain judgment against political opponents,
                    thereby bankrupting them irrespective of the merits of the claim (see <em>Lee Kuan Yew v Vinocur John and others</em> [1996]
                    1 SLR(R) 840 (“<em>Lee Kuan Yew v Vinocur
                        John</em>”)). In 2008, pursuant to an article published in the
                    party newspaper of the Singapore Democratic Party (“the SDP”)
                    stating that, <em>inter alia</em>, there was a
                    “striking resemblance between how the NKF [<em>ie</em>, the National Kidney Foundation] operated and how the PAP
                        [<em>ie</em>, the People’s Action Party] ... runs
                    Singapore” (<em>Lee Hsien Loong v Singapore Democratic
                        Party and others and another suit</em>
                    [2007] 1 SLR(R) 675 at [22]), the Prime Minister, Mr Lee
                    Hsien Loong, was awarded $330,000 in damages against the SDP and members of the
                    SDP’s Central Executive Committee for defamation (see <em>Lee Hsien Loong v Singapore Democratic Party and others and another
                        suit</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 642). That suit was consolidated
                    for hearing with another suit in which the Minister Mentor, Mr Lee Kuan
                    Yew, was awarded the sum of $280,000 against the same parties. It should be
                    noted, however, that the court, in deciding on the awards of $330,000 and
                    $280,000, had taken into account settlement sums of $170,000 received by each
                    plaintiff. The original figures of damages that the court had been minded to
                    award, therefore, were $500,000 for the Prime Minister and $450,000 for the
                    Minister Mentor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Damages that have been awarded to Members of
                    Parliament who have been defamed have not exceeded $210,000. Mr Chiam See
                    Tong was awarded $50,000 as damages against the defendant in the case of
                        <em>Chiam See Tong v Xin Zhang Jiang Restaurant Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1995] 1 SLR(R) 856. In that case, the defendant
                    restaurant had used a photograph of Mr Chiam in its publicity materials.
                    The court held that the advertisements were defamatory, suggesting that
                    Mr Chiam had consented to the use of his photograph for publicity, either
                    for gain or to sponsor a private restaurant, and that he had done so by taking
                    advantage of his position as a Member of Parliament. In another case, the
                    plaintiff was awarded $210,000 as damages against the defendant, as the
                    defendant had alleged that the plaintiff, who was, at that time, the head of the
                    Department of Social Work and Psychology at the National University of Singapore
                    (“the NUS”) and a Member of Parliament, had given fabricated
                    evidence to Parliament to justify the defendant’s dismissal as a lecturer
                    at the NUS (see <em>S Vasoo v Chee Soon Juan</em> Suit
                    No 936 of 1993 (15 April 1994, unreported)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     For professionals, to our knowledge, damages
                    of up to $150,000 have been awarded. In <em>Au Mun Chew
                        (practising as Au &amp; Associates) v Lim Ban Lee</em> [1997]
                    1 SLR(R) 220, an architect was awarded $45,000 in damages. In that
                    case, the defendant had written letters to the plaintiff architect that were
                    copied to various contractors and the Building Control Division of the Public
                    Works Division, stating that the plaintiff architect had attempted to
                    “con” him (at [7]). In <em>Arul
                    Chandran</em>, a lawyer was awarded general damages of $100,000 and
                    aggravated damages of $50,000 for a serious libel that he was, <em>inter alia</em>, a “vicious and most dangerous
                    fraud” (see [14], [17], [19] and [20]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Damages in other countries</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The levels of damages awarded in other
                    Commonwealth jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, Canada and Hong Kong,
                    are not directly relevant to the levels appropriate to our own circumstances as
                    the significance of the reputations of the various classes of plaintiffs differ
                    in different jurisdictions. For example, the public in Singapore may generally
                    have a higher regard and respect for its public leaders and business leaders
                    than the public in other jurisdictions have for similar classes of persons.
                    Nevertheless, it is useful to consider some cases in these jurisdictions for an
                    indication on whether the damages awarded by the Singapore courts are
                    unreasonably excessive, having regard to the personalities defamed and the
                    nature of the defamation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In 1987, the writer Jeffrey Archer (later Lord
                    Archer) was awarded £500,000 in damages by a jury for an alleged defamation
                    by <em>The Daily Star</em> concerning a paid 15-minute
                    sexual encounter with a woman in a Mayfair hotel (see <em>Archer
                        v Express Newspapers Plc</em> (24 July 1987, unreported)). In
                    1989, Lord Aldington was awarded £1.5m in damages by a jury after he had
                    been allegedly described by the defendant, Count Nikolai Tolstoy Miloslavsky, as
                    a war criminal. The award was later found to be in breach of the right to
                    freedom of expression under the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights
                    and Fundamental Freedoms (more commonly referred to as the European Convention
                    on Human Rights) by the European Court of Human Rights (see <em>Tolstoy Miloslavsky v United Kingdom</em> (1995)
                    20 EHRR 442). Recent awards, however, have not attained the region of
                    those figures. In <em>Galloway v Telegraph Group Ltd</em>
                    [2006] EMLR 11, the English Court of Appeal upheld an award of £150,000
                    obtained by a then Member of the English House of Commons, Mr George
                    Galloway, against <em>The Daily Telegraph</em> for
                    defamatory remarks that he had, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    received money from Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq. In a recent case,
                        <em>Berezovsky v Russian Television and Radio Broadcasting
                        Co</em> [2010] EWHC 476 (QB), the plaintiff had been
                    accused, on a television programme, of, <em>inter
                    alia</em>, being a participant in a high profile political murder and
                    several other related death threats, and also being “a knowing party to a
                    criminal conspiracy to avoid his extradition and obtain political asylum in
                    Britain” (at [53]). He was eventually awarded £150,000 in damages
                    for defamation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In a Canadian case, <em>Hodgson
                        v Canadian Newspapers Co</em> [2000] 49 OR (3d) 161, the
                    plaintiff, who was the Commissioner of Engineering for the Region of York, was
                    awarded C$400,000 as general and aggravated damages, C$380,000 as special
                    damages and C$100,000 as punitive damages for a series of defamatory articles
                    published by <em>The Globe &amp; Mail</em> concerning the
                    alleged corrupt purchase of certain lands from a developer by the Region of
                    York. The Region of York had paid a substantial sum for the lands on the
                    recommendation of the plaintiff, who allegedly knew that the Region of York was
                    entitled to acquire the lands at no cost. It was alleged that the plaintiff had
                    not disclosed that fact to the Regional Council and that the developer who
                    received the money was a long-time friend of the plaintiff. These allegations
                    were repeated in several subsequent articles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     A final illustration would be the recent Hong
                    Kong SAR case of <em>John Simpson Warham v Cathay Pacific Airways
                        Ltd</em> [2009] HKCFI 1046, where the Senior Captain and the
                    First Junior Officer of the defendant airline were each awarded general damages
                    of HK$3m and aggravated damages of HK$300,000 by the Court of First Instance of
                    the Hong Kong SAR. The airline had alleged that the plaintiffs, in threatening
                    industrial action against the airline, had been unprofessional, poor employees
                    and did not care for the interests of the airline and of the Hong Kong SAR. The
                    airline has since appealed against the judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Compared with the awards for general damages
                    in these cases, the quantum of damages awarded by the Singapore courts cannot be
                    said to be unreasonable or excessive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The nature and gravity of the defamation in the present
                case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Appellant has submitted that the sting of
                    the defamatory statements in question was the unbridled attack on the
                    Appellant’s competence and integrity in managing businesses. The
                    allegations that the Appellant had culpably mismanaged Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd
                    (“the Company”), approved grossly excessive dividends, permitted
                    the off-setting of substantial loans against dividends and that the Appellant
                    received part of these dividends which led to the Company’s financial
                    difficulties, have all struck at the core of the Appellant’s professional
                    attributes. These comprise, among other things, his management ability, general
                    competence and overarching integrity as a businessman. The sums involved were
                    huge, as the amounts alleged to have been depleted from the Company due to the
                    Appellant’s mismanagement – including a sum of $124m paid out as
                    dividends to shareholders – were by no means insignificant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Respondents’ response is that the
                    libel did not attack the core attributes of the Appellant’s reputation,
                    personal integrity and personality, but merely suggested negligence, impropriety
                    or mismanagement on the part of the Appellant in the latter’s depletion of
                    the assets of the Company. As a result of its depleted assets, the Company was
                    unable to pay the damages ordered against it in an earlier suit concerning the
                    Company’s deception of members of the Raffles Town Club (“the
                    Club”), a social club the Company owns (see the Judgment at [5]).
                    Nonetheless, in the Respondents’ view, the nature and gravity of the
                    defamatory statements were much less damaging to the Appellant than the
                    defamatory statements in <em>Arul Chandran</em> where
                    $100,000 as compensatory damages and $50,000 as aggravated damages were awarded,
                    making up a total of $150,000. The suit in <em>Arul
                        Chandran</em> arose out of the election for new club committee members
                    for the Tanglin Club. The defendants had circulated three publications to
                    members of the club containing defamatory remarks against the plaintiff, a
                    practising advocate and solicitor of more than 30 years’ standing and
                    also the vice-president of the club. The sting of the defamatory remarks was
                    that the plaintiff was an “extremely vicious and dangerous fraud”,
                    who was incapable of discharging his official duties within the club (at
                        <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a>). It is the Respondents’
                    position that the defamatory statements in the present case were not as grave as
                    those countenanced in <em>Arul Chandran</em>, and
                    accordingly a smaller quantum of damages should be awarded to the
                    Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     We do not agree with the Respondents’
                    argument that the defamatory statements against the Appellant are any less
                    serious than the defamatory statements in <em>Arul
                        Chandran</em>. In <em>Arul Chandran</em>, the
                    court was concerned with alleged fraud on the part of a lawyer. Here, the
                    Respondents insinuated that there was an element of dishonesty in the way the
                    Appellant had caused the Company’s assets to be depleted. In their closing
                    submissions, the Respondents said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he charges which the [Respondents] have proven substantially show the
                        [Appellant] to be a dishonest man who mismanaged [the Company] and who
                        applied [the Company’s] monies improperly for his own benefit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     We accept that in terms of damage to character
                    and reputation, false allegations that a lawyer has committed a fraud on his
                    clients will seriously damage his reputation and standing in his profession. But
                    so would allegations of dishonesty, mismanagement and asset depletion for
                    personal gain against a heretofore reputable businessman. The Appellant is a
                    prominent businessman and investor. Since the 1980s, he has built up a
                    formidable reputation in the stock broking industry as the “remisier
                    king”. In more recent times, the Appellant has come to be regarded as a
                    shrewd investor with well-publicised shareholdings in companies like
                    “Wilmar International and F J Benjamin”. The Company itself owns a
                    luxurious social club, <em>viz</em>, the Club, with some
                    17,000 members. Separately, the Appellant is frequently cited in <em>Forbes Asia</em> as one of the richest men in Singapore and
                    Asia. There can be no doubt that the defamatory statements in question attacked
                    his professional reputation and standing as a prominent businessman and
                    investor. The libel called into question his competence, integrity and business
                    acumen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The facts as laid out in the Judgment show
                    that the Appellant, by adopting certain policies in the fiscal management of the
                    revenue of the Company (<em>viz</em>, members’
                    subscriptions), was able to defer payment of a huge tax liability for the
                    Company. In contrast, when the Respondents took over control of the Company and
                    reversed these policies in order to take money out of the Company (lawfully, we
                    should add), they caused the Company to incur a huge tax liability immediately.
                    This contributed to the Company having insufficient funds to pay damages due to
                    members of the Club pursuant to the earlier suit regarding the Company’s
                    deception of members about the Club’s exclusivity (see <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     While the defamatory statements did not allege
                    fraud, they suggested that the Appellant had caused the Company’s
                    financial losses through mismanagement for his own benefit, as a result of which
                    the Company was unable to meet its liabilities to the members of the Club
                    amounting to potentially some $52,122,000. The Respondents wanted to put the
                    blame for this on the Appellant and other persons who had been in control of the
                    Company, even though they were substantially, if not, wholly responsible for the
                    financial plight the Company was in. The libel lay in the insinuation that the
                    Company’s debt was due to the past management’s activities, which
                    was untrue. The Appellant has been vindicated in this respect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The Appellant has further contended that he is
                    a public figure in the business fraternity, and that his reputation is a key
                    component to his ability to carry on his business. However, he is in business
                    for himself and not for the public welfare. He is not a public figure in the
                    sense used in defamation law. He is not a national leader or involved in public
                    affairs. He is undoubtedly a shrewd and successful investor whose reputation for
                    shrewdness has been vindicated by this court, but that does not justify
                    elevating his standing to that of a person who serves the public and the State.
                    Accordingly, we do not regard as relevant the decisions in relation to public
                    figures referred to earlier. In <em>A Balakrishnan and others v
                        Nirumalan K Pillay and others</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 462, this
                    court upheld (at [46]) counsel’s argument that where the plaintiff is not
                    a public figure, the quantum of damages should be less. Nonetheless, plaintiffs
                    who are professionals should get a higher sum than ordinary individuals because
                    of the damage done to their professional reputations. The Appellant agreed that
                    our courts have rightly distinguished between public leaders and others; in our
                    view, however, the damages awarded to the Appellant should be closer to that
                    awarded to individuals who are not public leaders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Appellant cited several cases to show that
                    the damages to be awarded in the current case should be higher than in those
                    cases as they concerned private individuals of lesser public standing and
                    reputation than the Appellant. The cases in question are: (a) <em>Arul Chandran</em>; (b) <em>Ei-Nets Ltd
                        and another v Yeo Nai Meng</em> [2004] 1 SLR(R) 153
                        (“<em>Ei-Nets Ltd</em>”); and
                        (c) <em>TJ System (S) Pte Ltd and Others v Ngow Kheong
                        Shen (No 2)</em> [2003] SGHC 217 (“<em>TJ
                        System</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In <em>Ei-Nets Ltd</em>,
                    $80,000 in damages was awarded for an allegation that the plaintiff was
                    dismissed as an employee of the company for conspiring to make fictitious
                    journal entries in the company’s books with a view to misappropriating
                    funds. In <em>TJ System</em>, a false statement was made by
                    email to 15 persons within Cisco’s organisation that “TJ [S]ystem
                    (sales staff and directors) has been called up by CPIB [<em>ie</em>, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau] for
                    investigation on bribery made to a police officer from Police Technology Dept,
                    on 6 June 2002” (at [4]). The first plaintiff was a Singapore
                    registered company in the business of supplying security systems. The second
                    plaintiff was the managing director of the first plaintiff and the third
                    plaintiff was a director. The fourth and sixth plaintiffs were employed as sales
                    staff of the first plaintiff. The first plaintiff was awarded $25,000 in
                    damages, the second and third plaintiffs $30,000 each while the fourth and sixth
                    plaintiffs each received $20,000. The court held that the first plaintiff was
                    not a household name but was well known within industry circles and that its
                    reputation was closely linked to the second and third plaintiffs. The fourth and
                    sixth plaintiffs were sales staff and their careers were not at the same stage
                    of progression as the second and third plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The Respondents pointed out the High Court
                    decision of <em>Oei Hong Leong v Ban Song Long David and
                        others</em> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 277 (“<em>Oei Hong Leong (HC)</em>”) (upheld by this court in <em>Oei Hong Leong v Ban Song Long David and others</em> [2005]
                    3 SLR(R) 608). In that case, an article in <em>The
                        Business Times</em> contained, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, an assertion that the plaintiff was not
                    “rational” in obstructing the passing of certain resolutions
                        (<em>Oei Hong Leong (HC)</em> at [5]). The claim for
                    defamation was dismissed because certain defences were applicable. However, the
                    High Court judge stated that he would have awarded $60,000 to the plaintiff if
                    he had decided to award damages. In his view, the libel was not a serious libel.
                    There was no malice, the allegation was narrow in scope and effect and the terms
                    used did not indicate a general bad reputation on the part of the plaintiff. The
                    Respondents here have argued that the Appellant is not as prominent as the
                    plaintiff in <em>Oei Hong Leong (HC)</em> and that
                    therefore damages should be lower. We do not agree. Both are prominent or well
                    known in their respective circles. The nature of the defamation against the
                    Appellant was, however, undoubtedly more serious.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mode and extent of publication </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     It is trite law that the wider the extent of
                    publication, the greater the award of damages for defamation. In <em>Lee Kuan Yew v Vinocur John</em>, the fact that the
                    defamatory statements were published in the <em>International
                        Herald Tribune</em>, which has worldwide circulation, was found to be
                    an aggravating factor for the purposes of awarding damages. The high standing of
                    the <em>International Herald Tribune</em> as a credible
                    international newspaper made the allegations more likely to be believed and this
                    further aggravated the damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The Appellant submitted that the wide
                    circulation of the libel to over 17,000 members of the Club, many of whom are
                    distinguished professionals, and the extensive press coverage of the entire saga
                    should increase damages. Additionally, the introductory section of the
                    Explanatory Statement (dated 2 November 2005 (“the ES”)
                    explaining a Scheme of Arrangement and Compromise (“the Scheme”))
                    under the heading “Background to [the Company’s] financial
                    difficulties” would have surely been given more attention by creditors
                    under the Scheme since they would have been keen to find out why the Company was
                    unable to pay the damages that had been awarded against it. Additionally, the
                    defamatory statements were published in a document issued pursuant to the
                    Companies Act (Cap 50, 1994 Rev Ed), which afforded the document the
                    imprimatur of the court’s approval, thereby making the defamatory
                    statements even more credible to the recipients.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The Respondents claimed that the fact that the
                    statements were published in the ES and not in a national newspaper (unlike in
                        <em>Oei Hong Leong (HC)</em>), meant that the extent of
                    publication was limited to members only and the quantum of damages should be
                    reduced. We agree with this submission to the extent that there were and are
                    many more readers of <em>The Business Times</em> than there
                    were members of the Club. Only the members would have known about the defamatory
                    innuendos in the ES. The <em>prima facie</em> knowledge of
                    some 17,000 members that the Appellant had been incompetent or negligent in
                    managing the Company and had caused it to lose hundreds of millions of dollars
                    would be, without question, seriously damaging to the reputation of the
                    Appellant as a reputable businessman and investor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Quantum of damages to be awarded</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The Respondents submitted that an award of
                    $70,000 – comprising a compensatory element of $50,000 and an aggravating
                    element of $20,000 – should be made. We do not accept this
                    submission.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">General damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Applying the yardstick in <em>Oei Hong Leong (HC)</em> and <em>Arul
                        Chandran</em>, we assess the general damages to be $140,000, as the
                    defamation of the Appellant was more serious than the defamation in <em>Oei Hong Leong (HC)</em>, and having regard to the fact that
                        <em>Arul Chandran</em> was decided more than 10 years
                    ago.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Aggravated damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     We have decided that the conduct of the
                    Respondents in this case aggravated the damages payable to the Appellant. Not
                    only did the Respondents deliberately and knowingly use the court process to
                    defame the Appellant, in the process misleading the court in order to protect
                    their own investment in the Company, they also pleaded the defence of
                    justification unjustifiably and refused to tender any apology or make
                    amends.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In <em>Goh Chok Tong v
                        Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin and another action</em> [1998]
                    2 SLR(R) 971, this court disagreed with the trial judge’s
                    approach of awarding separate awards for general damages and for aggravated
                    damages. The following was observed by this court (at [51]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We now turn to the issue of damages. Before we proceed
                        further, we should say a word on the separate awards for general
                        compensatory damages and aggravated damages made by the trial judge. It is
                        well-established that aggravated damages in defamation represent merely a
                        component of the compensatory damages and aggravated damages are awarded
                        when the defendant’s conduct before and during trial has aggravated
                        the hurt to the plaintiff’s feelings. For such conduct, the quantum of
                        damages payable in respect of the defamatory publication may be enhanced to
                        compensate adequately the plaintiff for the injury occasioned. Reverting to
                        the present case, the trial judge should have awarded a single global sum
                        compensating the plaintiff for the collective actions of the defendant, from
                        the date of publication to the end of the trial. This is the approach which
                        we explored and applied in the Tang appeal, and in our judgment is the right
                        approach. It is relevant to bear in mind the following passage from the
                        speech of Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone LC in <em>Cassell &amp; Co Ltd v Broome &amp; Anor</em>
                        [1972] AC 1027, p 1072:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[I]t has always been a principle of English law that the award of
                            damages when awarded must be a single lump sum in respect of each
                            separate cause of action … I must say I view with some distrust
                            the arbitrary subdivision of different elements of general damages for
                            the same tort as was done in <em>Loudon v
                                Ryder</em> [1953] 2 QB 202, and even, subject to
                            what I say later, what was expressly approved by Lord Devlin in
                                <em>Rookes v Barnard</em>
                            [1964] AC 1129, 1228 for the laudable purpose of avoiding a
                            new trial. In cases where the award of general damages contains a
                            subjective element, I do not believe it is desirable or even possible
                            simply to add separate sums together for different parts of the
                            subjective element, especially where, as was done by agreement in this
                            case, the subjective element relates under different heads to the same
                            factor, in this case the bad conduct of the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We therefore do not commend to our courts the practice of separating an
                        award for aggravated damages from the award of general compensatory damages.
                        The courts should award one single lump sum as damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     One point we wish to make at this juncture
                    would be that whilst a single award can be made for damages in a defamation
                    action, for the purposes of assessing the damages, a judge would necessarily (in
                    his mind) have to come up with a figure for general damages and a figure for
                    aggravated damages (or other types of damages, as the case may be). The sums
                    would then be added together to constitute a single lump sum award for damages.
                    Therefore, it would be odd if the court does not provide a breakdown of the sums
                    awarded as general damages and as aggravated damages (or other types of damages,
                    as the case may be). Such an approach should be discouraged. In this connection,
                    it would be apposite to reiterate what was recently stated in <em>Basil Anthony Herman v Premier Security Co-operative Ltd and
                        others</em> [2010] SGCA 15 by this court (at [65]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[W]hile damages for defamation may be given as a single award, we are of
                        the opinion that, in awarding damages for defamation, a judge ought to
                        demarcate and explain the damages awarded for the defamation itself and the
                        additional damages awarded for the defamer’s aggravating conduct in
                        relation to the defamation. The need for some form of separation is
                        self-evident where financial loss is concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Having said that, we would like to highlight
                        <em>Arul Chandran</em> once again. In that case, the
                    High Court awarded $100,000 as general damages and $50,000 as aggravated
                    damages. The court considered the following as aggravating circumstances: the
                    reckless justification defence that was bound to fail, the humiliating and
                    embarrassing “put” questions during cross-examination as a result
                    of the adoption of the defence of justification, the unsubstantiated allegation
                    of bad reputation that was made during mitigation, and the presence of malice on
                    the part of the defendant. On appeal, this court held that even if there had
                    been no reckless reliance on the defence of justification, the award of $50,000
                    for aggravated damages could be justified in view of the humiliating
                    cross-examination, unsubstantiated allegations of bad reputation during
                    mitigation and the presence of malice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     On the facts of this case, and taking into
                    account the various aggravating factors, we award the sum of $70,000 for
                    aggravated damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Based on the foregoing, the total amount of
                    damages payable to the Appellant is $210,000 – comprising $140,000 for
                    general damages and $70,000 for aggravated damages. In addition to this sum, we
                    award the Appellant costs fixed at $10,000 plus disbursements.</p>
