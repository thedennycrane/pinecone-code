        Tan Lee Meng J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       These proceedings concerned an application by
                    the petitioner, Hong Investment Private Limited (“HIPL”), for an
                    order that Mr Roland Mah Kah Eng (“RM”) and his younger
                    brother, Mr Jason Mah Kah Leong (“JM”), be removed as the
                    liquidators of Tai Thong Hung Plastics Industries (Pte) Ltd (“the
                    Company”) and that Mr Chung Siang Joon
                    (“Mr Chung”) be appointed as the liquidator of the Company.
                    After hearing the parties, I ordered that the present liquidators be removed and
                    that Mr Chung be appointed as the new liquidator of the Company. I now set
                    out the reasons for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 17 October 2003, both RM and JM were
                    appointed as liquidators of the Company by the court after HIPL successfully
                    petitioned to wind up the Company on the basis of the latter’s failure to
                    pay a judgment debt to it. More than 7 years have passed since they were
                    appointed the liquidators of the Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       HIPL’s application to have the liquidators
                    removed was prompted by a letter that its solicitors received from the Official
                    Receiver on 24 August 2010, part of which was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2    From the 6 monthly liquidator’s accounts filed
                            to date, it would appear that the private liquidators have been charging
                            regular expenditure against the accounts of the Company. <em>We have queried the liquidators and found their reply to be
                                unsatisfactory</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3    Meanwhile, we understand that one of the 2
                            liquidators, Mr Jason Mah Kah Leong, had not renewed his licence.
                            Accordingly, you may wish to advise your Client, the petitioner of the
                            Company to consider applying to court to appoint another liquidator in
                            place of the said Mr Mah. The new liquidator may then request for
                            an audit be made on the liquidation accounts and for the
                            liquidator’s fees to be taxed in Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       While the Official Receiver may have had
                    concerns about the liquidators’ accounts, it was not true that JM had not
                    renewed his licence to act as a liquidator for the purposes of the Companies Act
                    (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) as his licence, which was
                    renewed by the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority on 1 April 2009,
                    was valid until 31 March 2012. When HIPL informed the Official Receiver about
                    this, the latter replied that its position remained the same, namely that it
                    would not object to the removal of the liquidators.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the liquidators should be replaced</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Section 268(1) of the Act provides that a
                    “liquidator appointed by the Court may resign or on cause shown be
                    removed by the Court”. The position is summed up in Woon &amp; Hicks,
                        <em>The Companies Act of Singapore - An
                    Annotation</em>, (LexisNexis, Looseleaf Ed, 2004, Issue 2) at para
                    3105-3125 as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Removal of liquidators for cause</em> See also
                        s 268(1). A liquidator may be removed if there is some unfitness of the
                        person by reason of his personal character, or from his connection with
                        other parties or from the circumstances in which he is involved: <em>Sir John Moore Gold Mining Co</em> (1879) 12 Ch D
                        325, 331 per Jessel MR. Thus, for instance, if a liquidator refuses to take
                        action against miscreant directors because he is one of them or because they
                        are his friends, he may be removed by the court: <em>Chua
                            Boon Chin v McCormack</em> [1979] 2 MLJ 156. If the liquidator is
                        not independent or impartial because of his connection with persons against
                        whom there might be pending claims, there would be cause to have him
                        removed: <em>Re: Charterland Goldfields</em> (1909) 26
                        TLR 132. Similarly, if it appears that the liquidator is in a position where
                        his duty and interest conflict: <em>Re International
                            Properties Pty Ltd</em> (1977) 2 ACLR 488, 492.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court has power to remove a liquidator not only because of his
                        personal unfitness, but also on the ground that it is in the interest of the
                        liquidation that he should be replaced: <em>Chua Boon Chin v
                            McCormack</em> [1979] 2 MLJ 156 , 158; <em>Re Adam
                            Eyton Ltd</em>(1887) 36 Ch D 299, 303-304. In <em>Procam (Pte) Ltd v Nangle</em> [1990] 3 MLJ 269 Thean J
                        declined to order the removal of a liquidator on the ground that it was not
                        in the interest of the liquidation to do so, given the advanced state of the
                        liquidation. Moreover, the errors made by the liquidator were made in good
                        faith and did not prejudice the liquidation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In <em>Re Keypak Homecare Ltd (No
                        1)</em> [1987] BCLC 409, Millet J pointed out that the
                    words “on cause shown” are very wide and it would be wrong for a
                    court to limit or define that kind of cause which is required as circumstances
                    vary widely. He added that it may be appropriate to remove a liquidator even if
                    nothing can be said about him personally or about his conduct of the particular
                    liquidation. In <em>Yap Jeffrey Henry and anor v Ho Mun-Tuke
                        Don</em> [2006] 3 SLR(R) 427, Judith Prakash J adopted
                    Millet J’s view and stated at [22] that the removal of the liquidator
                    “does not necessarily mean that fault of any sort has been found with the
                    liquidator” and it may well be that “in the circumstances that
                    have arisen in the case the court considers that there was cause to remove
                    him”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       JM contended that it is better to allow the
                    present liquidators to complete the final stage of the liquidation. However,
                    according to HIPL, there was cause for the replacement of the liquidators. It
                    pointed out that based on the liquidators’ accounts filed with the
                    Official Receiver, the liquidators have made a number of payments to Vorspann
                    Pte Ltd (“Vorspann”), of which JM is the managing director and a
                    shareholder. The payments to Vorspann included $6,000 for accounting fees, $660
                    for secretarial fees, $900 for liquidation account fees and $1,500 for audit
                    fees. Apart from paying Vorspann, the liquidators have also paid
                    “secretarial fees” amounting to $6,800 to RM’s own
                    firm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Also rather alarming was the fact that
                    liquidators’ fees amounting to $45,690 have been paid to RM and JM without
                    complying with s 268(3) of the Act, which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    A liquidator, other than the Official Receiver,
                            shall be entitled to receive such salary or remuneration by way of
                            percentage or otherwise as is determined —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    by agreement between the liquidator and the
                            committee of inspection, if any;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    failing such agreement, or where there is no
                            committee of inspection by a resolution passed at a meeting of creditors
                            by a majority of not less than 75% in value and 50% in number of the
                            creditors present in person or by proxy and voting at the meeting and
                            whose debts have been admitted for the purpose of voting, which meeting
                            shall be convened by the liquidator by a notice to each creditor to
                            which notice shall be attached a statement of all receipts and
                            expenditure by the liquidator and the amount of remuneration sought by
                            him; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    failing a determination in a manner referred to in
                            paragraph (<em>a</em>) or (<em>b</em>), by the Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       There being no committee of inspection and no
                    meeting of creditors to approve the liquidators’ remuneration, the $45,690
                    should have been approved by the Court. No application was made to the court for
                    the requisite approval.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     After having labelled the $45,690 paid to him
                    and his brother as “professional fees” paid to liquidators, JM
                    subsequently claimed that the amount in question was a “retainer”
                    for Liquidators’ Office management fees. According to him, this sum was
                    paid for the use of his and RM’s offices for liquidation work and for the
                    cost of employing staff in these two offices for administrative work. This was a
                    rather belated attempt to circumvent the provisions of the Act requiring proper
                    approval for a liquidator’s remuneration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Leaving aside the serious concerns about the
                    liquidators’ accounts for the moment, what was rather unsatisfactory was
                    the liquidators’ attitude towards their obligations as liquidators. RM,
                    who did not contest the application, was in poor health and was not interested
                    in carrying on as the liquidator of the Company. On 14 September 2010, he
                    wrote a letter to HIPL’s solicitors, Messrs Tan Lim Partnership, part of
                    which is as follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I, myself am over 62 years old and I want to retire gracefully as I am
                        limping as I underwent cerebral haemorrhage/stroke and operations five years
                        ago. <em>It is a miracle that I am still alive</em>. In
                        fact <em>I do not wish to act as a Liquidator anymore though
                            I renewed my license as a Liquidator for this year</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Remarkably, in his letter of 14 September
                    2010, RM also voiced some dissatisfaction about his co-liquidator. He
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Under the law a person who is not a member of [the Institute of Chartered
                        Public Accountants Singapore] should not be a Court Appointed Liquidator. In
                        fact I had a discussion with my brother over this issue. <em>He believes that though he is not a member of ICPAS he can act also in
                            a Court-Appointed Liquidation. In fact he has the cheque
                            books</em> and both of us are authorised signatories and one
                        signature is not enough. In fact I insisted on it for good internal
                        control.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>I have been advised by other lawyers the custody of the
                            clients cheque book should be mine and not be kept at Jason Mah’s
                            office</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     After voicing his concerns about his
                    co-liquidator and saying that the Company’s cheque book should not be in
                    JM’s possession, RM wrote to the Official Receiver on 20 September
                    2010 to say that there is no need to replace the liquidators. Part of his letter
                    is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I believe that this is a very minute matter and I advise without prejudice
                            <em>that you inform Mr Lim Chee San of TanLim
                            Partnership ... that [Mr Jason Mah and I] have been appointed by the
                            High Court as Court Appointed Liquidators of [the company]. This will
                            obviate the need to appoint Mr Chung Siang Joon as the Liquidator
                            of [the company]</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I believe that my fellow Liquidator, Mr <em>Jason Mah
                            Kah Leong is rather distressed</em> on this matter. To myself
                            <em>all disputes should be peacefully settled by all
                            parties concerned</em>. Don’t let anybody advise anybody to
                        aggravate the matter ... by bringing this matter to court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The fact that a liquidator has been appointed
                    by the Court does not mean that he will not be replaced with another liquidator
                    by the Court if the situation warrants this. Furthermore, an application to
                    remove a liquidator is a rather serious matter and the allegations by HIPL do
                    not, as RM claims, concern a “very minute matter”. RM ought to
                    have known that whether or not his brother was distressed with an application to
                    remove him as the liquidator is not a matter that is relevant to a decision by
                    the court to retain or replace the Company’s liquidators.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     As for the second liquidator, JM, whose
                    registration as a public accountant was cancelled with effect from
                    19 November 2007 by the Oversight Committee appointed under the Accountants
                    Act (Cap 2, 2005 Rev Ed), his explanation as to why he had consented
                    to become the liquidator of the Company raised eyebrows. On 16 September
                    2010, he e-mailed HIPL’s solicitors as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With reference to our teleconversation this morning, I wish to place on
                        record that; I have intimated to you that <em>my
                            co-liquidator (also my elder brother) had already suffered a stroke ...
                            and that, his state of health, even today, is at best fragile. That is
                            the reason why I got myself “dragged” into this rather
                            unpalatable job</em>. I sincerely hope that you and Mr Chung
                        consider this “ fact” seriously before proceedings further on
                        this matter. If you have any doubt over this “fact”, do not
                        hesitate to contact me and I [will] immediately set up a meeting (in Roland
                        Mah’s office, of course) so that both of you can assess for yourself,
                        how serious this issue can become.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Liquidation of a company should be undertaken
                    by a committed liquidator and it was unfortunate that JM regarded himself as
                    having been “dragged” into the “rather unpalatable”
                    task of liquidating the Company on account of the sickness and fragile health of
                    the other liquidator, who happens to be his brother.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The tenor of a second e-mail sent by JM to
                    HIPL’s solicitors on 16 September 2010, may also be viewed with concern.
                    Part of this second e-mail was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My apologies, Mr Roland Mah’s cerebral haemorrhage occurred in
                        2002, not 2003, as intimated earlier. He has recovered somewhat, but his
                        speech is still slurred, and needs someone to support him when he walks (he
                        relied also, on a “4-legged” cane). <em>Another
                            stroke could result in his death. Having advised you, such an occurrence
                            will not be on my head</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     JM should have realised that it was in the
                    Company’s interest that RM be replaced as a liquidator of the Company in
                    view of the latter’s health. In <em>Re Adam Eyton
                        Ltd</em> (1887) 36 Ch D 299, Bowen LJ pointed out that for
                    the purpose of determining whether a liquidator should be removed on the basis
                    of due cause having been shown, the due cause is measured in relation to the
                    "real, substantial, honest interests of the liquidation, and to the purpose for
                    which the liquidator is appointed”. He added that while fair play to the
                    liquidator himself is not to be left out of sight, the measure of due cause is
                    the substantial and real interest of the liquidation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     After considering all the circumstances, I
                    found that there was cause for the replacement of both the current liquidators.
                    As such, I ordered that they be replaced by Mr Chung, who had given his
                    consent to act as the liquidator of the Company.</p>
