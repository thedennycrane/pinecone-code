</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In 2000 and 2001, the first plaintiff sourced six marine engines of a single specific model from the MAN group. The six marine engines were sold and shipped directly to shipbuilders in China, to be installed in six ships which were being built there for the Skaugen group. The plaintiffs’ case is that, in the course of promoting this model of engine to the first plaintiff, the defendants negligently or fraudulently misrepresented to the first plaintiff that that model of engine consumed fuel at no more than a specific rate under certain specified conditions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The plaintiffs now bring this action in Singapore to seek damages from the defendants for the alleged misrepresentation. The question which arises before me on this registrar’s appeal is whether the Singapore courts have jurisdiction over the plaintiff’s misrepresentation claim. The assistant registrar held that the Singapore courts do not have jurisdiction. He agreed with the plaintiffs that its claim falls within Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed). But he also agreed with the defendants that Singapore is <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span>. That latter finding made this case “not a proper one for service out of Singapore” within the meaning of Order 11 r 2(2) of the Rules of Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The plaintiffs now appeal against the assistant registrar’s decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The issue before me now, quite simply, is whether the assistant registrar was correct. But the geographical reach of this case takes it beyond the anodyne procedural dispute over jurisdiction. The defendants authored the promotional material containing the representation in Germany. They delivered the material to the Skaugen group at sales and marketing meetings held either in Denmark or Norway. The six engines are the subject-matter of contracts of sale governed by English law,

Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii) is satisfied because there is a good arguable case that owners of the ships who have assigned their claims to the plaintiffs suffered loss and damage in Singapore.

Further, I have also held that the plaintiffs have established that Singapore is clearly the appropriate forum for the trial of this action because of the possibility of a transfer to the Singapore International Commercial Court (“SICC”) and also because the appropriateness of both alternative forums – Germany and Norway – has been overstated.

</div> Although both defendants seek an order that the writ be set aside, neither defendant suggests any grounds to set aside the writ other than the plaintiffs’ failure to bring themselves within Order 11. That aspect of the defendants’ application therefore does not require independent analysis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Both defendants are represented on their applications by the same counsel and advance the same arguments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28  The defendants’ arguments, in brief, are as follows. First, both plaintiffs lack standing to bring this action. That is because the two plaintiffs have never owned any of the six ships, and thus did not themselves suffer any loss or damage. Second, the plaintiffs’ claim is not within any of the three heads of Order 11 on which the plaintiffs rely (see [25] above).

</div> His reasons for doing so are set out comprehensively in his grounds of decision in <span class="font-italic">Skaugen</span>. Those reasons can be summarised as follows. First, the plaintiffs’ claims have sufficient merit for leave to serve out of the jurisdiction to be granted. The plaintiffs have shown that the causes of action on which they rely have been assigned to one or other of them (<span class="font-italic">Skaugen</span> at [46]). Second, the plaintiffs’ claim comes within Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii). They have shown that their claim is founded on damage sustained within Singapore caused by a tort “wherever occurring” (<span class="font-italic">Skaugen</span> at [106]). Finally, however, Singapore is not the appropriate forum for the resolution of this dispute.<span class="font-italic"> </span>German law is the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span> (at [55] of <span class="font-italic">Skaugen</span>). Germany is therefore a more appropriate forum than Singapore. A German court would have the home court advantage in determining the plaintiffs’ claim under German law. Moreover, a German court would not have to apply Singapore’s double actionability rule, and would therefore determine the plaintiffs’ claims under German law alone (at [129] and [139] of <span class="font-italic">Skaugen</span>). The double actionability rule would require a Singapore court to apply <span class="font-italic">both</span> German law <span class="font-italic">and</span> Singapore law to determine the plaintiffs’ claims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The plaintiffs have appealed

That is axiomatic: it is the plaintiff who is the applicant and it is therefore the plaintiff who must bear the burden on the application. But it is also the position that where a defendant has been served outside Singapore under Order 11 and applies to set aside service, the burden even then <span class="font-italic">remains</span> on the <span class="font-italic">plaintiff</span> to establish all three requirements.

A “good arguable case” entails one side having “a much better argument on the material available”: <span class="font-italic">Canada Trust Co v </span><span class="font-italic">Stolzenberg (No 2) </span>[1998] 1 WLR 547 at 555F-G. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The standard to which a plaintiff must discharge its burden on the second<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Zoom</span> requirement is that the plaintiff must show merely that there is a serious question to be tried: <span class="font-italic">Bradley Lomas</span> at [14] and [19]. The standard on the second <span class="font-italic">Zoom</span> requirement is therefore less stringent than that on the first. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 However, where a plaintiff relies on a head of jurisdiction under Order 11 r 1 which, in itself, requires the court to examine the merits of the plaintiff’s claim when considering the first <span class="font-italic">Zoom</span> requirement, the inquiry on the second <span class="font-italic">Zoom</span> requirement is subsumed in the first: <span class="font-italic">Bradley Lomas</span> at [18]–[20]. That has two consequences. First, the plaintiff must establish a good arguable case on the merits of its claim, and not merely a serious question to be tried. Second, there is no need for the plaintiff to address the second <span class="font-italic">Zoom</span> requirement separately. For example, in <span class="font-italic">Bradley Lomas</span> itself, the Court of Appeal observed that a plaintiff who establishes on the first <span class="font-italic">Zoom</span> requirement a good arguable case that its claim comes within Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(i) does not need to show separately on the second <span class="font-italic">Zoom</span> requirement a serious question to be tried on the merits of its claim. A plaintiff in that situation, by satisfying the first <span class="font-italic">Zoom</span> requirement, has already established a good arguable case that its “claim is founded on a tort … constituted, at least in part, by an act or omission occurring in Singapore”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 That point is significant in the appeals before me. All of the three heads of jurisdiction on which the plaintiffs rely – Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(i), Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii) and Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">p</span>) – require an examination of the merits of the plaintiffs’ claim. The plaintiffs must therefore show a good arguable case on the merits rather than merely a serious question to be tried.

</div> The defendants’ challenge to standing proceeds in two steps. First, they point out that the plaintiffs themselves have no cause of action against the defendants. Neither plaintiff was ever the owner of any of the six ships. Quite apart from anything else, therefore, neither plaintiff could have suffered any loss or damage by reason of the alleged misrepresentation.

</div> Further, the only claims of its own which Somargas SG assigned to the second plaintiff were claims arising from the misrepresentation of the results of the FATs, and not claims arising from the misrepresentation in the PPM or the FSI. But the plaintiffs’ pleaded case does not allege that the misrepresentation of the results of each FAT was an actionable misrepresentation in its own right. Instead, the plaintiffs’ case is that the FAT results are merely confirmations of an earlier actionable representation as to fuel consumption.

Both companies became owners of the ships after delivery and before the representation as to fuel consumption was falsified, at the latest in June 2012. Both companies are, on the defendants’ own case, in a position to argue that they became owners of the ships without knowledge that the fuel consumption figures had been manipulated and also that they suffered loss thereby. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I consider first the position of Somargas SG.

It has assigned those causes of action to the second plaintiff under the Assignment Agreement. This, to my mind, suffices in itself to establish a good arguable case that the plaintiffs have standing to bring this action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 But I accept also that the plaintiffs have established a good arguable case that Somargas SG has a cause of action against the defendants derived from Somargas HK. For this purpose, I accept – both as a matter of evidence and substance – that the plaintiffs have established a good arguable case that Somargas SG acquired Somargas HK’s claims against the defendants together with the six ships in February 2011. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 As a matter of evidence, the plaintiffs rely on a statement on oath by Mr Morits Skaugen on behalf of the plaintiffs that Somargas HK transferred its claims against the defendants to Somargas SG together with the six ships and all its other assets.

</div> It is true that the only evidence of this transfer is a statement on oath. But the defendants are unable to adduce any evidence to the contrary, not even a statement on oath. A statement on oath is evidence even if it is unsupported by independent evidence. The lack of documentary evidence does not disprove the plaintiffs’ statement on oath that such a transfer took place. I therefore accept that evidence as being sufficient to establish a good arguable case on this aspect of the plaintiffs’ claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Further, as a matter of substance, I observe that the absence of documentary evidence is not fatal to the plaintiffs’ case that there was a transfer of Somargas HK’s claims to Somargas SG.

</div> Both before me and before the assistant registrar, neither party has suggested that any of the issues arising in the law of assignment should be determined under either system of foreign law. The assistant registrar held that, in the absence of any submissions by the parties on foreign law, the presumption of similarity of laws applies: see <span class="font-italic">Skaugen </span>at [40]. He therefore applied Singapore law to determine questions relating to assignment. He held that under Singapore law, an assignment can either be a legal assignment or an equitable assignment. He held, further, that an equitable assignment need not be in writing (<span class="font-italic">Skaugen</span> at [43]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64  I agree broadly with the assistant registrar’s approach. The fact that Somargas HK’s assignment of its claims to Somargas SG is not documented does not suffice to reduce the plaintiffs’ case on this aspect below a good arguable case because the assignment could have been an equitable one: <span class="font-italic">Skaugen</span> at [43]. The defendants do not allege that an equitable assignment would be ineffective either for lack of notice or for failure to join the assignor to this action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Similarly, both before me and before the assistant registrar, the defendants did not argue that the assignments to the plaintiffs are void as the assignment of bare rights of action in tort: <span class="font-italic">Skaugen </span>at [45]. Both parties appear to accept, therefore, that causes of action in tort – just like causes of action in contract – are assignable provided that the assignee has a genuine commercial interest in taking the assignment.

</div> That is what the assistant registrar held, citing the seminal House of Lords decision in <span class="font-italic">Trendtex</span><span class="font-italic"> Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse</span> [1982] AC 679 (“<span class="font-italic">Trendtex</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 I agree with the assistant registrar. The assignability of a cause of action in tort, however, requires a little further consideration. A leading local textbook observes that a bare right to litigate is not generally assignable and, further, that that includes a bare right to litigate a “personal tort”: Tan Yock Lin, <span class="font-italic">Personal Property </span>(Academy Publishing, 2014) (“<span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Yock Lin</span>”) at para 18.014. The bar exists because the assignment of a bare right of action in tort facilitates a third party meddling officiously in the disputes of others, thereby tending to stir up unwanted litigation and contravening public policy in the same way as maintenance and champerty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67  It might be said in favour of assignability in this case that the tort of misrepresentation is not a “personal tort” and therefore not caught by the bar on assignment of causes of action in tort. But the bar on assignment is not always framed in terms which limit it to “personal torts”. For example, <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> in the High Court of Australia’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Poulton</span><span class="font-italic"> v The Commonwealth</span> (1952) 89 CLR 540 (“<span class="font-italic">Poulton</span>”) suggests that the bar extends to the right to litigate <span class="font-italic">a</span><span class="font-italic">ny</span> cause of action in tort (see <span class="font-italic">Poulton</span> at 602). That said, some Australian courts have recognised an exception to even this broad formulation of the rule where the assignee has a genuine and legitimate commercial interest in taking an assignment of the right. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In the decision of the High Court of Australia in <span class="font-italic">Equuscorp</span><span class="font-italic"> Pty Ltd v Haxton </span>[2012] CLR 498, Heydon J noted that <span class="font-italic">Poulton</span> predated the decision in <span class="font-italic">Trendtex</span> (at [156]–[157]) and suggested that the bar in <span class="font-italic">Poulton</span> does not apply where a genuine commercial interest underlies the assignment. In the same case, Gummow and Bell JJ took a similar view, holding that there is an exception to the bar where there is “a genuine and substantial commercial interest” (at [79]). It must be noted, however, that their comments were not made specifically in relation to causes of action in tort. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Similarly, the Queensland Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">WorkCover</span><span class="font-italic"> Queensland v AMACA Pty Limited</span> [2012] QCA 240 was prepared to find that even causes of action for personal injuries are assignable where the assignee has a pre-existing legitimate commercial interest in enforcing the right: at [17]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 It therefore appears to me that causes of action in tort are assignable under Singapore law where the assignee has a genuine commercial interest in taking the assignment. That broader single exception encompasses within it the mischief contemplated by the bar on the right to assign the bare right to litigate a “personal tort”. The real mischief in all cases is the lack of a sufficient interest in the assignee taking the assignment rather than the difficult question of whether a particular tort can be characterised as a “personal tort” (see <span class="font-italic">Simpson v Norfolk </span><span class="font-italic">and Norwich University Hospital NHS Trust</span> [2012] 1 All ER 1423).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Here, the causes of action in tort assigned under both the Claims Transfer Agreement and the Assignment Agreement are capable of being assigned. As far as the Skaugen assignors are concerned, they assigned their claims to the second plaintiff, who is an entity within the same group of companies. As far as the GATX assignors are concerned, until April 2013, the GATX group had – by reason of its joint venture with the Skaugen group to construct and operate the six ships as a fleet – an equal interest in the six ships and in the corporate entities which owned the six ships. The GATX assignors’ assignment to the first plaintiff is an extension and a natural consequence of their commercial relationship in the joint venture. The claims have, broadly speaking, moved with the transfers of the ships. They are now vested in the plaintiffs for a specific purpose: to enable the plaintiffs to attempt to recover compensation for a wrong done to the economic and commercial enterprise associated with the six ships. This is sufficient for the plaintiffs as assignees to have a genuine commercial interest in taking the assignments and pursuing the claims assigned. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 I therefore accept that both plaintiffs have established a good arguable case on the issue of standing. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Material non-disclosure</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The defendants contend that the plaintiffs failed to make full and frank disclosure when they applied <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> for leave to serve the writ out of jurisdiction.

The pleading asserts only that damage was suffered in Norway, not that the <span class="font-italic">entire</span> damage was suffered in Norway.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Further, reading the pleading in context, it is clear that the assertion being made is that “as a result of the case’s connection with Norway”, damage “must be regarded” to have taken place in Norway. In other words, what the plaintiffs did is to take a position that the result of applying Norwegian procedural law to the facts of the case pointed to Norway as the place in which the damage “must be regarded” as having been suffered. That is not the same thing as taking a position that damage factually occurred in Norway let alone that the <span class="font-italic">entire</span> damage factually occurred in Norway. That position taken in Norway has little or no bearing on a submission that <span class="font-italic">some</span> damage <span class="font-italic">factually</span> occurred in Singapore. I therefore find that, even though the plaintiffs’ position in the Norwegian proceedings was not disclosed to the court on the plaintiffs’ <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> application for leave to serve the defendants out of the jurisdiction, that failure does not amount to material non-disclosure. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I reject also the defendants’ second and fourth points. These two points do not raise any facts which the plaintiffs failed fully and frankly to disclose. These two points are no more than two contested points on which the defendants simply take a different position from the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs believe, and have argued, that tortious acts and omissions did occur in Singapore and that there were valid assignments of all of these claims. The defendants taking a different view from the plaintiffs on a contested point does not suffice to establish non-disclosure of facts, much less to establish material non-disclosure of facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Finally, I reject also the defendants’ third point. It is true that the statement of claim as it stood at the time of the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> application concluded by pleading that the first plaintiff and the second plaintiff had each suffered loss and damage respectively in their own right.

</div> It then went on to plead expressly and with particulars the entire chain of transfers, the Claims Transfer Agreement and the Assignment Agreement. There was therefore no material non-disclosure of the fact that the plaintiffs bring this action to recover damages as assignees of the underlying causes of action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In any event, even if I accepted that there had been a failure to make full and frank disclosure in March 2015 at the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> application for leave to serve the defendants out of the jurisdiction, that would at best result in setting aside the specific order made on that application. The defendants do not suggest that any of the alleged failures to make full and frank disclosure in this case were so egregious as to amount to an abuse of the process of the court sufficient to preclude the plaintiffs making a fresh application for leave. That fresh application would have to be considered today on its merits and in light of all the evidence which is now before me. That evidence, of course, includes evidence of all of the facts which the defendants allege were not fully and frankly disclosed on the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> application. Setting aside the order of March 2015 on grounds of a failure to make full and frank disclosure would serve little purpose except to waste time and costs. The plaintiffs would remain entitled to re-apply for leave on the same evidence which is before me now and to have that fresh application adjudicated on its merits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 It is to those merits that I now turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Order 11 rule 1 </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The next <span class="font-italic">Z</span><span class="font-italic">oom</span> requirement is that the plaintiffs establish a good arguable case that one of the heads of jurisdiction under Order 11 r 1 of the Rules of Court is satisfied. As I have mentioned, the plaintiffs rely on three heads: Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(i), Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii) and Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">p</span>). The first two heads are founded specifically on tort. The third head is a general head and requires merely that the plaintiffs’ cause of action arose in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In order to ascertain whether a claim founded on tort is justiciable in Singapore at all, it is necessary first to ascertain where the tort was committed. To answer this question, the court applies the <span class="font-italic">lex</span><span class="font-italic"> fori</span>, in this case Singapore law: <span class="font-italic">Macmillan </span><span class="font-italic">Inc v Bishopsgate Investment Trust Plc (No 3) </span>[1996] 1 WLR 387 at 392C. If the answer to the question is that the tort was committed in a foreign jurisdiction, the court must then take the further step of analysing whether the tort satisfies the double actionability rule, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> that it is actionable both under the law of the jurisdiction in which the tort was committed, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the <span class="font-italic">lex</span><span class="font-italic"> loci delicti</span>, and also under the substantive law of the <span class="font-italic">lex</span><span class="font-italic"> fori</span>: <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Nicolai Baron von Uexkull</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 377 (“<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments</span>”) at [53]. The double actionability rule is subject to a flexible exception allowing the court to disapply one or both limbs if injustice or unfairness would otherwise result. This exception is, however, strictly applied lest the exception overwhelm the rule: <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments </span>at [58]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 It should also be noted that Singapore law’s adherence to the double actionability rule to determine justiciability appears to be an anachronism. Most common law jurisdictions have by now abandoned the rule. Canada’s Supreme Court abrogated the rule by judicial decision in 1994, in <span class="font-italic">Tolofson</span><span class="font-italic"> v Jensen</span> (1994) 120 DLR (4th) 289. England abrogated the rule by statute in 1995, when it passed the Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995 (c 41). Australia’s High Court abrogated the rule in 2002, in <span class="font-italic">Regie</span><span class="font-italic"> Nationale des Usines Renault SA v Zhang </span>(2002) 210 CLR 491. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In 2003, the Law Reform Committee of the Singapore Academy of Law called for the double actionability rule to be abolished in Singapore law, proposing a legislative regime mirroring the English statute: see Law Reform Committee of the Singapore Academy of Law, <span class="font-italic">Reform of the Choice of Law Rule Relating to Torts</span> (31 March 2003). The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments</span> (at [66]) held that abolition of the double actionability rule in Singapore could not be achieved by common law and noted the Law Reform Committee’s recommendation for statutory abolition. In the meantime, the Court of Appeal consoled itself by noting that, even if the law were not reformed as proposed, the flexible exception to double actionability remained available to ensure that a just and fair result could nevertheless be achieved in all cases. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 I am bound by <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments</span> to apply the double actionability rule to the plaintiffs’ causes of action. That is another way of saying that the plaintiffs cannot establish a good arguable case in tort if they cannot establish a good arguable case that they satisfy the double actionability rule. That is critical for their case for service out of the jurisdiction under Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(i) and Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii). Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">p</span>), being a general head of jurisdiction not confined to tort, raises different considerations. I analyse how Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">p</span>) interacts with causes of action founded on tort and the double actionability rule below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Before I can even consider whether the plaintiffs are able to bring themselves within Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(i) or Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii), therefore, I must address the following questions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, where was the tort committed?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, if the tort was committed in a foreign jurisdiction, is the tort actionable under the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span>?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, would the acts which constitute a tort actionable under the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span> also constitute a tort under Singapore law? and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, does the flexible exception to the double actionability rule apply? </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Order 11 r 1(f): claims founded on tort</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Where did the tort occur? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87  The first issue that must be addressed is where the tort took place. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals FZC</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Mineral Enterprises Ltd</span> [2011] 1 SLR 391 (“<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span>”) at [90] observed that the test that is applied is one “which looks at the events constituting the tort and asks where, in substance, the cause of action arose”. This is known as the “substance test”: <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span> at [90].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Applying the substance test to the tort of misrepresentation is especially prone to complication, precisely because the tort is founded on human communication. Modern technology now has the ability to amplify the temporal and spatial reach of human communication. The law can no longer assume, in formulating general rules, that the typical misrepresentation is communicated in a single place on a single occasion to a single person. A misrepresentation today can be communicated, in a literal sense, to the world at large, preserved permanently and be relied upon all over the world by a significant subsection of the world’s population.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 But the complications associated with the tort of misrepresentation are not due only to advances in modern technology. They are due also to the interplay between the intrinsic and intangible nature of human communication and the constituent elements of the tort. A misrepresentation can quite easily be made in one jurisdiction, received in a second and relied upon in a third. The Court of Appeal itself recognised that each of these three elements plays a role in applying the substance test to the tort of misrepresentation. Thus, at [93], the Court of Appeal observed that there is “room for debate as to whether the place where the representation was made is more significant than the place where the representation was received”, and later, at [94], contrasted the place where the misrepresentation was received with the place where it was relied upon. The Court of Appeal’s analysis in <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals </span>therefore suggests that applying the substance test to the tort of misrepresentation requires examination of all three elements: where a representation is made, where it is received and where it is relied upon.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 With all this in mind, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span> held that the following specific rules operate as a gloss on the ordinary substance test when determining the <span class="font-italic">loci delicti</span> in the tort of misrepresentation:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Where the misrepresentation is received and relied upon in a single jurisdiction, then that jurisdiction is the <span class="font-italic">loci delicti</span> unless (at [93]) it is fortuitous that the misrepresentation was received and relied upon in that jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Where the misrepresentation is made in one jurisdiction and is received and relied upon in another jurisdiction:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) if the misrepresentation is made to a specific person or to a specific class of persons, the <span class="font-italic">loci delicti</span> is the place where the representation is received and acted upon: <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span> at [91] and [93], citing <span class="font-italic">Cordoba Shipping Co Ltd v National State Bank, Elizabeth, New Jersey (The “</span><span class="font-italic">Albaforth”)</span> [1984] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 91 at 92, and <span class="font-italic">Diamond v Bank of London and Montreal Ltd</span> [1979] QB 333 at 345–346;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) if the misrepresentation is made to an unspecified class of persons, the <span class="font-italic">loci delicti</span> is the jurisdiction in which the misrepresentation is made: <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span> at [91], citing <span class="font-italic">Cordova Land Co Ltd v Victor Brothers </span><span class="font-italic">Inc</span> [1966] 1 WLR 793 at 801.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Where the misrepresentation is made in more than one jurisdiction, or is received in more than one jurisdiction, or is relied upon in more than one jurisdiction, it is the ordinary substance test which applies: <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span> at [93]–[95]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The case before me is a case where it can plausibly be argued that the misrepresentation was made in more than one jurisdiction, was received in more than one jurisdiction and also was relied upon in more than one jurisdiction. It is therefore the ordinary substance test which I must apply, unassisted by any gloss.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">The representation</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 It is appropriate at this juncture to set out in greater detail the content of the representation which the plaintiff alleges to be a misrepresentation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The plaintiffs’ case is that the representation was made in the PPM. The PPM states that the fuel consumption of the MAN Engine under ISO conditions at a load of 85% is 180 g/kWh.

The key dates are May 2011, January 2012, April 2012 and June 2012.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">The relevant locations under the substance test</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I now apply the substance test with these facts and dates in mind. To begin, if the focus is on where the representation was made, it appears that Germany is the relevant location. The first defendant is a German company. It authored the PPM in Germany. The representation in the PPM might therefore be said quite obviously to have been made in Germany. The same applies for the occasions on which that representation was maintained and confirmed in the FSI and at the FATs, all of which have their location in Germany. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 But if the question is where the representation was received, then four options present themselves. In relation to each of these four options, it is also possible to argue that that location is also where the representation was, for all intents and purposes, made. The argument is that a representation is not made when it is published in the abstract, but only when the representation is actually communicated to a putative plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The first option as to the location of receipt is Norway.

</div> This misrepresentation therefore might plausibly be said to have been received in China, or, alternatively, Norway. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 The fourth and final option as to the location of receipt is Germany. The FATs, which also maintained and confirmed the representation made in the PPM, were conducted in Germany and the results were reported in Germany. The misrepresentation might therefore have been received in Germany.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 On the question of where the representation was relied or acted upon, several options again present themselves. Reliance might be said to have occurred the moment the first plaintiff accepted the representation in the PPM as being true. That occurred when that representation was apparently confirmed at the manipulated FATs. On that analysis, reliance took place where the FATs took place, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> in Germany. Alternatively, it might be said that reliance took place when the first plaintiff – first on behalf of itself in 2000 and then on behalf of Vintergas in 2001 – approved the MAN Engine for installation in the six ships. On that analysis, reliance took place where that decision was taken, probably Norway where the first plaintiff is located. Or it might be said that reliance occurred only when the ships were physically delivered to and accepted by Somargas HK. The location of reliance could then be China, where the shipyard is located, or Hong Kong where Somargas HK is incorporated. Or it might also be said, as the plaintiffs say, that reliance was and is continuing, and therefore continues to occur so long as loss continues to be suffered. In that case, Singapore enters the picture. Loss continued to be suffered by Somargas SG when it took ownership of the ships in February 2011 and put them under the Singapore flag in March 2011. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Applying the substance test, I take the view that Germany is the place where the tort occurred. It is true that the PPM and the FSI were both authored in Germany. But that is, to my mind, a marginal factor in favour of Germany. The weightiest factor pointing to Germany is that Germany is where the FATs took place. It is the representation at each FAT which are at the core of the plaintiffs’ loss, not the representation in the PPM or in the FSI. The representation in the PPM and the FSI could not be said to be untrue until the FATs took place. Further, it is only because the FATs were manipulated that the plaintiff was prevented from knowing that the FATs had proven the representation in the PPM and the FSI to be false. The misrepresentation as to the true fuel efficiency of each of the six MAN Engines was therefore made in Germany, received by the plaintiffs in Germany and relied upon in Germany.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 It is true, of course, that the first plaintiff relied on the representation in the PPM and the FSI at a much earlier point in time: when it approved the MAN Engine for installation in the six ships in 2000 and 2001. But it was the six manipulated FATs which induced the first plaintiff to accept the six specific engines which the defendants actually supplied to the shipbuilders and which the shipbuilders actually installed in each of the six ships. On the plaintiffs’ case, if the FATs had not been manipulated, the FATs would have revealed the representation in the PPM and the FSI to be a misrepresentation, the plaintiffs would have rejected each engine, and the ships would have been fitted with other engines which consumed fuel at the rate represented in the PPM and FSI. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In contrast, the places where the representation in the PPM and the FSI was actually communicated to and received by the first plaintiff are too far removed from the substance of this tort to say that any one of them is in substance the place where the tort occurred. The place at which the PPM and FSI were handed over to the first plaintiff is, to my mind, fortuitous. Given that both the first plaintiff and the first defendant operate around the world, these documents could have been handed over to the first plaintiff in any jurisdiction in the world, or even in no jurisdiction in the world, <span class="font-italic">eg</span> on a private jet in international airspace or on the high seas. In that sense, Norway’s connection to the tort on the facts of this case is tenuous in that it is simply the first plaintiff’s principal place of business. So too, China’s and Singapore’s claim to be the location of the tort on the facts of this case is tenuous.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 I hold, therefore, that Germany is the <span class="font-italic">loci delicti</span>. German law is therefore the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Is the tort actionable under the </span>lex loci delicti?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The question of whether the tort is actionable under the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span> was argued before the assistant registrar.

The last waiver expired on 31 March 2015.

Before proceeding, it is necessary to clarify what the <span class="font-italic">lex</span><span class="font-italic"> fori</span> limb of the double actionability rule requires. This limb asks the counterfactual question whether the acts constituting the plaintiffs’ claim, <span class="font-italic">if </span><span class="font-italic">all of those acts were carried out in Singapore</span>, would constitute a tort under Singapore law. It does not ask the factual question whether the defendants’ acts – done as they were here across a range of countries, with only some acts done in Singapore – constitutes a tort under Singapore law. This much is clear from well-established authority. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 To begin, the leading textbook, <span class="font-italic">Dicey and Morris on the Conflict of Laws</span> (Lawrence Collins gen ed) (12th Ed, 1993) at pp 1487 to 1488 expresses the view that the <span class="font-italic">lex</span><span class="font-italic"> fori</span> limb requires assuming that all of the acts constituting the tort were done in the <span class="font-italic">forum</span>: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) As a general rule, an act done in a foreign country is a tort and actionable as such in England, only if it is both: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) actionable as a tort according to English law, or <span class="font-italic">in other words is an act which, if done in England, would be a tort</span>; and </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) actionable according to the law of the foreign country where it was done.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 This is the position also in Singapore. In <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span> vol 6(2) (LexisNexis, 2016 Reissue) (“<span class="font-italic">Hal</span><span class="font-italic">sbury’s Laws of Singapore</span>”) at para 75.374, the editor observes that “[for] a tort to be actionable under the law of the forum, the claim must be made out in all its elements under the domestic law of Singapore, <span class="font-italic">as if the wrong had been committed in the forum</span>” [emphasis added]. Similarly, <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2018</span> vol 1 (Foo Chee Hock JC gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell 2018) indicates at para 11/1/30 that where the double actionability rule applies, the Court should give leave under Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) “only if the act complained of is one which, <span class="font-italic">if done here</span>, would be a tort, and which is also actionable according to the law of the foreign country where it has been done” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 This approach has also been applied in case law. In <span class="font-italic">Kuwait Airways Corporation</span><span class="font-italic"> v Iraqi Airways Company and others (Nos 4 and 5)</span> [2002] 2 AC 883 (“<span class="font-italic">Kuwait Airways</span>”), the Iraqi government took ten aircraft owned by Kuwait Airways Corporation (“KAC”) from Kuwait, flew them to Iraq and purported to vest ownership of the aircraft in Iraqi Airways Co (“IAC”). Through no act of its own, therefore, IAC found itself in possession and control of several aircraft which KAC claimed continued to be its own property. KAC brought a claim in England against IAC for conversion. The House of Lords applied the double actionability rule, first considering whether IAC’s acts amounted to conversion in English law and then considering whether IAC was liable under Iraqi law for the civil wrong of usurpation: <span class="font-italic">Kuwait Airways</span> at [37] and [45]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Lord Nicholl’s analysis of actionability under English law in <span class="font-italic">Kuwait Airways</span> is of chief concern here and is instructive. The acts by IAC which were said to constitute a tort took place entirely overseas, and only in Iraq. He identified the three material acts as: (i) being in possession and control of the aircraft; (ii) intending to keep the aircraft as its own; and (iii) treating the aircraft as its own. He considered that by doing those acts, IAC was asserting rights inconsistent with KAC’s rights as owner: <span class="font-italic">Kuwait Airways</span> at [43]. He then concluded that “IAC’s acts would have been tortious <span class="font-italic">if done in this country</span>” [emphasis added]: <span class="font-italic">Kuwait Airways</span> at [44].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The proper approach in the present case, therefore, is to consider whether the tort – which I have found as a matter of general substance occurred in Germany – would constitute a tort in Singapore law <span class="font-italic">if </span><span class="font-italic">the acts said to constitute the tort had been carried out entirely in Singapore</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Kuwait Airways</span>, that counterfactual hypothetical was easy to construct and analyse. All of IAC’s acts had taken place in only one country, Iraq. Constructing the hypothetical simply involved swapping Iraq for England. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 In this case, the acts complained of took place in a multiplicity of jurisdictions: at the very least, Germany, Denmark, Norway, China, Hong Kong and Singapore. It might be said that it is overly artificial simply to sweep away this multiplicity of jurisdictions and treat all of the acts as having taken place in Singapore. But that is, to my mind, what the <span class="font-italic">lex</span><span class="font-italic"> fori</span> limb of the double actionability rule requires. I therefore proceed on this limb by assuming that all the acts complained of took place in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 That does not mean, however, that I should ignore the fact that the acts complained of involved separate legal entities. The <span class="font-italic">lex</span><span class="font-italic"> fori</span> limb requires the court to assume, contrary to the facts, that all of the acts took place in Singapore but nothing else. But in applying the <span class="font-italic">lex</span><span class="font-italic"> fori</span> limb, the court must continue to acknowledge that distinct legal entities were involved. This approach allows me to be both consistent with the rule and also not be overly artificial. It would be wholly unrealistic to pretend that the representation was not only made, received and relied upon in Singapore, but also that it was also made by only one party and received by, relied upon by and damaged only one party. The interposition of separate legal entities on the facts of this case raises its particular difficulty in the context of the tort of misrepresentation. Even if it is assumed that all the acts which constitute the tort took place in Singapore, it remains the case that the same entity did not receive, rely upon and suffer loss by reason of the misrepresentation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 I now consider elements of both fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation. The assistant registrar has helpfully set out the relevant elements for each tort in <span class="font-italic">Skaugen</span> at [65]–[66], and I adopt them here: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">65. The elements for fraudulent misrepresentation are: first, there must be a representation of fact made by words or conduct; second, the representation must be made with the intention that it should be acted upon by the plaintiff, or by a class of persons which includes the plaintiff (restated, there must be inducement); third, it must be proved that the plaintiff had acted upon the false statement (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>there must be reliance); fourth, it must be proved that the plaintiff suffered damage by so doing and fifth, the representation must be made with knowledge that it is false; it must be wilfully false, or at least made in the absence of any genuine belief that it is true (<span class="font-italic">Panatron</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Lee Cheow Lee </span>[2001] 2 SLR(R) 435 at [14]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">66. The elements for negligent misrepresentation are: first, the defendant must have made a false representation of fact; second, the representation induced actual reliance (see <span class="font-italic">e.g. </span><span class="font-italic">Fong Maun Yee v Yoong Weng Ho Robert </span>[1997] 1 SLR(R) 751 at [52]); third, the defendant must owe a duty of care; fourth, there must be a breach of that duty of care; and fifth the breach must have caused damage to the plaintiff (<span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span><span class="font-italic"> Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 100).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 I deal with the elements common to both torts first. The first common element is that there be a false representation of fact. I have no hesitation in finding that the plaintiffs have established a good arguable case on this aspect for the same reasons as the assistant registrar did below. The PPM and the FSI represented that the MAN Engine consumed fuel at a certain rate under certain specified conditions. The results of the FATs confirmed that the six specific MAN Engines constructed for the Skaugen group consumed fuel at no worse than the rate represented. The first defendant accepts that there are indications that the fuel consumption measurements for three of the six engines were externally influenced in an improper manner during the FATs with the result that the fuel consumption rate specified in the PPM and the contracts were exceeded for those engines.

</div> The three remaining MAN Engines were of an identical design. They were manufactured at the same factory in Germany. The FATs were carried out on them on the same compromised test equipment at that factory. The plaintiffs have therefore established a good arguable case that the other three engines similarly consume fuel at a rate which exceeds that set out in the PPM and confirmed in the FSI and the FAT results. Through a combination of concession and inference, the plaintiffs have therefore established a good arguable case that the representation in the PPM, repeated in the FSI and at the FATs, were false in point of fact for all six of the MAN Engines. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 The next common element asks whether there was inducement and reliance. The plaintiffs’ case is that the actionable misrepresentation is the rate set out in the PPM as the rate at which the MAN Engine consumes fuel under the conditions also set out in the PPM. That representation was then maintained and confirmed by the FSI and in the results of the six FATs. I therefore agree with the assistant registrar that it would be artificial to consider the misrepresentation on a document-by-document basis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 The defendants make the point that the alleged misrepresentation was acted upon only by the first plaintiff, when it was induced by the FATs to accept the six engines.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 It seems to me, however, that subsequent owners of the six ships might also be said to have relied on the misrepresentation. I agree with the reasoning of the assistant registrar in <span class="font-italic">Skaugen</span> at [77] that the facts, viewed holistically, suggest that the defendants knew that the engines were to be installed on ships which were not to be owned by any one corporate entity in particular but to be deployed generally within the Skaugen group. So long as the entities which owned the ships and which have assigned their claims to the plaintiffs are part of the Skaugen group, I consider there to be a good arguable case that they were within the class of persons to whom the representation was made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 It is also not clear to me that the effect of the first defendant’s misrepresentation was displaced by knowledge of the ships’ actual fuel consumption. The misrepresentation was in relation to the rate at which the MAN Engine consumed fuel under certain specified conditions which the FATs were intended to replicate. The fact that the actual fuel consumption, once the engines were in operation, was different from the figure represented in the PPM does not by itself mean that the misrepresentation as to fuel consumption under <span class="font-italic">the specified conditions</span> became inoperative. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The last common element is damage. It seems to me that the plaintiffs have also established a good arguable case on this element. The ship owners who have assigned their claims to the plaintiff have suffered loss either because they had to purchase more fuel to operate the ships than they would have but for the misrepresentation, or because the market value of each ship is diminished by the confirmation that its engine’s fuel efficiency under the specified conditions is below the specification in the PPM, quite apart from the engine’s actual fuel efficiency under actual operating conditions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128  As for the elements specific to each species of misrepresentation, I do not propose to go into these further because I substantially agree with the reasoning of the assistant registrar in <span class="font-italic">Skaugen</span> at [82]–[83]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 I therefore conclude that the plaintiffs have established a good arguable case that the acts of the defendants which the plaintiffs allege to be tortious would have been actionable under Singapore law had they been committed in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Does the flexible exception apply? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The double actionability rule is subject to a flexible exception. I hold that there is a good arguable case that the flexible exception does not apply. As explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments</span> at [57], the exception comes into play when: (i) the parties and other connecting factors have nothing to do with the place where the tort was committed; (ii) have nothing to do with the place where the place the action is brought, or (iii) have nothing to do with both. If the place where the tort was committed is purely fortuitous, then the flexible exception does not require that the tort be actionable under the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span>. And similarly, if the action is brought in Singapore purely fortuitously, the flexible exception does not require the acts be actionable under the <span class="font-italic">lex</span><span class="font-italic"> fori</span>. Further, if both the place where the tort was committed, and Singapore as the forum, are purely fortuitous, it is possible that a third possible law might govern the action concerned. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 Here, the tort was committed substantially in Germany. Singapore is also a place where current and former owners of the ships are located. They, together with all other owners of the ships, have assigned their claims to the plaintiffs. There does not seem to be any “clear or satisfying grounds” to displace either or both of these places for the purposes of the double actionability rule. That is the threshold for invoking the flexible exception: <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments</span> at [65]. There is therefore a good arguable case that the flexible exception does not apply. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 I now turn to consider the particular requirements of each of the two heads of jurisdiction under Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) on which the plaintiffs rely. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Order 11 r 1(f)(i)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 The first head on which the plaintiffs rely is Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(i): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“(f) (i) the claim is founded on a tort, wherever committed, which is constituted, at least in part, by an act or omission occurring in Singapore”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Before the assistant registrar, the plaintiffs argued that the words “a tort…which is constituted…by an act or omission in Singapore” are wide enough to cover both acts or omissions by a tortfeasor as well as acts or omissions by the victim of the tort.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 I am not persuaded that the defendants’ omission to rectify the misrepresentation can be said to be located in Singapore for the purpose of Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(i). I assume, only for the sake of argument, that the omission to rectify the misrepresentation was in this case an omission which constituted the tort. Even then, it seems to me impossible to say that that omission had its location in Singapore. I say that for two reasons. First of all, it appears to me that the most natural place in which an omission is located is where the person who has failed to act is located, not where the effect of the failure to act is felt. In this case, it would be far more natural to say that the omission took place in Germany than to say it took place in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 My second reason, however, is far more fundamental. An act, by its very nature, is positive. It therefore always has a factually-ascertainable location. This is true even if there is some difficulty in making a second-order finding of fact as to what precisely that location is. One example would be in determining in which country a man fires a gun if he has one foot on either side of an international border when he does so. But an omission is by definition a failure to act. An omission is by its nature negative. A failure to act has significance only because the law attaches a significance to it, usually because the failure to act comes in the face of a duty to act. Unlike an act, an omission has no independent, physical significance of its own and, accordingly, has no factually-ascertainable location. As the Victorian Court of Appeal has observed, “it makes no sense to speak of the place of an omission”: <span class="font-italic">Puttick</span><span class="font-italic"> (as Executor of the Estate of Russell Simon Puttick) v Fletcher Challenge Forests Pty Ltd</span> [2007] 18 VR 70 at [16]. An omission occurs both nowhere and everywhere. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 In my view, a mere failure to correct an earlier misrepresentation to a person located in Singapore who has received or relied on that misrepresentation does not satisfy Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(i). If it were otherwise, because of the negative nature of an omission, the scope of Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(i) would be far too broad. That, in turn, would defeat the purpose of the Order 11 heads of jurisdiction, which is to ensure that jurisdiction over a foreign defendant is not too easily exercised. It is also the case that the plaintiff’s claim against the defendants as pleaded is based only on an actionable misrepresentation in 2000 and not on an actionable failure to remedy the misrepresentation between 2000 and 2012. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 I therefore hold that the plaintiffs are unable to bring their claim within Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(i). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Order 11 r 1(f)(ii)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 In the alternative, the plaintiffs say that they are within Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii) because they bring this action to recover damages for damage suffered in Singapore: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(f) (ii) the claim is wholly or partly founded on, or is for the recovery of damages in respect of, damage suffered in Singapore caused by a tortious act or omission wherever occurring</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 The plaintiffs say that the defendants’ tort caused damage to be suffered in Singapore for two reasons, correlated to the two types of damage which flow from the defendants’ misrepresentation.

</div> Somargas SG suffered this type of loss when it acquired the ships from Somargas HK. The value for the six ships in that transfer was fixed by a straight-line depreciation of their purchase price rather than by assessing the ships’ actual value on the open-market. The open market value of the ships would have reflected the lower value of the ships by reason of their fuel inefficient engines.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 I do not accept the defendants’ argument. On the facts of this case, the cause of action in tort which the plaintiffs now pursue was not complete when the first plaintiff accepted the engines in Germany. At that point, although there was in place misrepresentation and reliance, there was no damage whatsoever. Indeed, at any point in time from the time the first plaintiff accepted the engines after each FAT until Somargas HK took delivery of the ships, the plaintiffs could not have pursued the defendants for the cause of action which they are now pursuing. That is because the plaintiffs’ decision to accept the engines remained in point of fact and as a matter of law reversible up until that time. If the plaintiffs had found out the truth at any time before the shipbuilders tendered delivery of the ships to Somargas HK, they could have substituted fuel-efficient engines, holding the defendants liable for any delay, and avoided the two types of damage which they now claim they have suffered. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 It is true that Somargas HK did suffer damage when it took delivery of the ships. By that act alone, Somargas HK became the owner of ships which had a lower market value than they would have had if the misrepresentation had never been made and if they had been installed with fuel efficient engines instead. But the damage suffered by Somargas HK upon delivery does not, in itself, preclude future damage. And it is certainly the case that the owners of the ships thereafter did suffer damage, at the very least by increased fuel expenditure which they incurred and which they would not have incurred if the misrepresentation had never been made. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 Nor do the defendants’ contentions on the directness of damage really assist them. As I noted at [125] above, the plaintiffs have made a good arguable case that the misrepresentation was not only intended to be relied upon by the first plaintiff, but also by the subsequent owners of the ships. If this is the case, then these owners would also have suffered damage that results directly from the misrepresentation. Even if that is not the case, however, I agree with the assistant registrar’s reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Skaugen</span> at [103] that direct damage is not required under Order 11 r 1 (<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii). The text of Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii) requires only that the claim is at least “…partly founded on…damage suffered in Singapore”. It nowhere speaks of a requirement that the damage suffered in Singapore must arise directly from the tort. The owners of the ships have suffered damage in the form of the increased fuel expenditure and the diminished capital value of the ships.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 The plaintiffs have therefore established a good arguable case that their claim falls within Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Order 11 r 1(p)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 I turn now to Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">p</span>), which is the last head of jurisdiction on which the plaintiffs rely: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(p) the claim is founded on a cause of action arising in Singapore</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 The plaintiffs’ argument on Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">p</span>) has evolved.

</div> and (ii) that there was a good arguable case that that test applied to the facts of this case pointed to Singapore as the place where the plaintiffs’ cause of action arose. Before me, however, the plaintiffs advance a new argument. They thereby implicitly accept that the substance test does not point to Singapore, as both the assistant registrar and I have found.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 The argument which the plaintiffs now advance on Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">p</span>) runs as follows. The test to determine whether a claim is founded on a cause of action which arose in Singapore within the meaning of Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">p</span>) is not the substance test approved in <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span> but the test set out in the decision of the Privy Council in <span class="font-italic">Distillers Co (</span><span class="font-italic">Biochemicals) Ltd v Laura Anne Thompson</span> [1971] AC 458 (“<span class="font-italic">Distillers</span>”). Under the <span class="font-italic">Distillers</span> test, a claim falls within Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">p</span>) if the plaintiffs’ “cause of complaint” is located in Singapore. There is a good arguable case on the facts of this case that the “cause of complaint” for at least some of the plaintiffs’ assignors is located in Singapore because that is where those assignors are incorporated and accordingly where those assignors suffered the damage complained of in this action.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 The crux of the plaintiffs’ case on Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">p</span>) turns on the appropriate test to be applied. If the defendants are right and the substance test from <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span> applies, the analysis which I have already undertaken establishes that Germany is not only the <span class="font-italic">loci delicti</span> but also the place where the causes of action arose. Conversely, if the plaintiffs are right and the <span class="font-italic">Distillers</span> test is a different test from the substance test, capable of yielding a different result, the plaintiffs’ failure to establish that Singapore is the <span class="font-italic">loci delicti</span> does not in itself mean that it cannot bring itself within Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">p</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 Central to this aspect of the plaintiffs’ case is the Privy Council decision in <span class="font-italic">Distillers</span>. The first point I make is that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span> in fact cited <span class="font-italic">Distillers</span> (at [90]) as authority for the substance test. It could thus be argued that the plaintiffs’ submission before me – distinguishing between the substance test and the <span class="font-italic">Distillers</span> test for the purposes of Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">p</span>) – is based on a false dichotomy. However, <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span> is not a case on Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">p</span>). It is a case which considers double actionability in the context of an application to stay proceedings at common law on grounds of <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span>. <span class="font-italic">Distillers</span>, on the other hand, is a case in which the Privy Council had to interpret and apply a statutory provision which is <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia</span> with Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">p</span>). Indeed, the statutory provision considered in <span class="font-italic">Distillers</span> and its successor procedural rule in New South Wales is very closely connected to our Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">p</span>): see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2018</span> vol 1 (Foo Chee Hock JC gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell 2018), paragraph 11/1/40. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 It therefore appears to me that <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span> is not authority that the substance test used to determine the <span class="font-italic">loci delicti</span> when applying the double actionability rule is equally to be used to determine whether a claim is founded on a cause of action arising in Singapore within the meaning of Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">p</span>). The two concepts are quite different. The place of a tort is a question of weighing the facts. A cause of action is a legal construct under Singapore law. Although determining whether a cause of action arose in Singapore also involves weighing the facts, it requires the court to weigh and view those facts not in isolation but through that legal construct. To put it another way, the inquiry as to the <span class="font-italic">loci delicti</span> starts with the facts and weighs them in order to identify the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span> and then to ascertain whether the facts in question give rise to a claim known to the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span>. The inquiry under Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">p</span>) starts instead with the actual cause of action which the plaintiff has chosen to plead under Singapore law and asks whether that specific cause of action arose in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 I turn now to consider the facts of <span class="font-italic">Distillers</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 <span class="font-italic">Distillers</span> came to the Privy Council from the Court of Appeal of New South Wales. In <span class="font-italic">Distillers</span>, an English drug company manufactured a drug in England which contained thalidomide. Thalidomide causes birth defects when taken by pregnant women. The drug company sold the drug to a distributor in Australia. The drug company knew or ought to have known that the drug posed a risk to pregnant women. But it did not warn the distributor of the risk or place any warnings on the packaging in which it sold the drug to the distributor. The plaintiff and her mother were both domiciled in New South Wales. The plaintiff’s mother, while she was pregnant with the plaintiff, took the drug in New South Wales. The plaintiff was later born with serious birth defects. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 The plaintiff sued the drug company in New South Wales in the tort of negligence. She served the writ on the drug company in England<span class="font-italic"> </span>under s 18(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of New South Wales’ Common Law Procedure Act (No 21 of 1899) (NSW). That provision permits service of a New South Wales writ out of the jurisdiction if the judge is satisfied that “there is a cause of action which arose within the jurisdiction”. The drug company entered a conditional appearance and immediately applied to the New South Wales court to set aside service on the grounds that the plaintiff’s cause of action against the drug company did not arise in New South Wales. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 The Privy Council considered (at 466C-D) that there were three possible theories as to how s 18(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) should be interpreted. The first was that “cause of action” must mean “the whole cause of action, so that every part of it, every ingredient of it, must have occurred within the jurisdiction”. The second theory was that “it is necessary and sufficient that the last ingredient of the cause of action, the event which completes a cause of action and brings it into being, has occurred within the jurisdiction”. The third and final theory is that “the act on the part of the defendant which gives the plaintiff his cause of complaint must have occurred within the jurisdiction”. The Privy Council held (at 467A) that the third theory was correct. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 The Privy Council dismissed the first theory out of hand as being too narrow. That view would deny the courts of a country jurisdiction unless all the ingredients of the cause of action also occurred within that country. The Privy Council considered that approach to be too restrictive for modern times. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 The Privy Council also rejected the second theory. It held that the place where the last event which completed the cause of action occurred might be quite fortuitous, and therefore should not be the sole determinant of jurisdiction: <span class="font-italic">Distillers</span> at 468A. It would not be just and reasonable to ask the defendant to answer for his wrongdoing in whatever country in the world the plaintiff happened to be in when the tort became complete: <span class="font-italic">Distillers </span>at 468D. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 This left the last theory, which proposes that a cause of action arises within the jurisdiction if the act on the part of the defendant which gives the plaintiff his “cause of complaint” occurs within the jurisdiction: <span class="font-italic">Distillers </span>at 468E. The Privy Council considered this to be an inherently reasonable rule, as the defendant would be called upon to answer for his wrong only in the courts of the country where he did the wrong (at 468F).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 The Privy Council explained what it meant by “cause of complaint”. It observed at 468G that “[the] defendant does not merely by behaving negligently give the plaintiff any cause of complaint in law.” Rather, “[the] plaintiff has such cause of complaint if the defendant’s negligence has caused damage to the plaintiff.” The Privy Council recognised there could be considerable separation in time and place between the negligent act of the defendant and the resulting damage to the plaintiff: <span class="font-italic">Distillers</span> at 468H to 469A. Ultimately, however, the Privy Council did not have to deal with that difficulty on the facts of <span class="font-italic">Distillers</span>. The Privy Council accepted that the negligent act and the resulting damage both occurred in New South Wales. The drug company’s negligent act was the failure to warn pregnant women in New South Wales of the risks of taking the drug while pregnant. And the plaintiff’s damage obviously arose in New South Wales. The plaintiff’s cause of action therefore did arise in New South Wales.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 It is apparent from the reasoning of the Privy Council that the negligent act in this case was actually an omission (at 469D). But, as I have pointed out at [138] above, it is a nonsense to speak of an omission, without more, as being localised in a specific place. On the facts of <span class="font-italic">Distillers</span>, what localised the drug company’s omission to warn in New South Wales were three plaintiff-centric factors: (a) New South Wales was where the plaintiff’s mother purchased the drug, bereft of a warning; (b) New South Wales was where the plaintiff’s mother consumed the drug while pregnant with the plaintiff, in ignorance of the risk which the drug posed to the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">in utero</span>; and (c) New South Wales was where, on the assumptions on which the case was decided, the plaintiff suffered damage <span class="font-italic">in utero</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 The plaintiff-centric nature of the test in <span class="font-italic">Distillers</span> is apparent from the Privy Council’s focus on the “cause of complaint”. According to the Privy Council, the “cause of complaint” is neither simply the defendant’s tortious act nor equally simply that which completes the cause of action. The “cause of complaint” is a combination of all of the factors, but which trains the court’s focus on the gist of the plaintiff’s complaint in the action. That would obviously include the type of harm which the plaintiff complains of and seeks to remedy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 The effect of <span class="font-italic">Distillers</span>, therefore, is to adopt a more plaintiff-centric approach on Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">p</span>) than the substance test for the <span class="font-italic">lex loci delicti</span> limb of the double actionability rule set out in <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span>. That is also the effect of the Privy Council’s emphasis on the plaintiff’s “cause of complaint”. The more plaintiff-centric approach is not surprising, because Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">p</span>) requires the court to view the facts of the case through the cause of action which the plaintiff has sought to invoke. It is significant to me that <span class="font-italic">Distillers</span> (at 468E)  mandates “look[ing] back over the series of events constituting [the tort] and ask[ing] the question, where in substance did <span class="font-italic">this</span> <span class="font-italic">cause of action</span> arise” [emphasis added]. The question posed by the Privy Council is not the more general and more factual question “where in substance did <span class="font-italic">the tort take place</span>”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 On the facts of this case, the plaintiffs and their assignors had no cause of complaint simply because the first defendant made a misrepresentation in the PPM and the first plaintiff relied upon it. As soon as the assignors suffered damage by reason of the misrepresentation, they would have a complete cause of action against the defendants in misrepresentation. But even then, their “cause of complaint” would not be fixed. It would vary, depending on when they discovered the misrepresentation and the type of damage they were seeking compensation for by the cause of action asserted. Thus, for example, if the first plaintiff had discovered the misrepresentation <span class="font-italic">after</span> the first plaintiff had accepted the results of an FAT on a particular MAN Engine but <span class="font-italic">before</span> that engine had been delivered and installed in one of the ships, its cause of complaint would be that the construction and delivery of the ships would be delayed while the plaintiff sourced substitute engines with the required fuel efficiency. The cause of action in this hypothetical scenario would be misrepresentation, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> the same cause of action as the one which the plaintiffs pursue in this action on behalf of their assignors. But the cause of complaint – or the gist of the plaintiff’s complaint – would be quite different. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 The cause of complaint in this action includes the increased expenditure on fuel incurred by the plaintiffs’ assignors. That complaint is continuing in nature. The plaintiffs’ assignors continued to suffer that harm so long as they owned the ships and bore that increased expenditure. The plaintiffs’ assignors who suffered loss of this type include entities located in Singapore. The plaintiffs’ “cause of complaint” occurred in Singapore. And therefore their cause of action within the meaning of Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">p</span>) arose in Singapore. The plaintiffs have thus made a good arguable case that Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">p</span>) is satisfied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 Although it is not strictly necessary for me to do so, I should make clear that the approach I have adopted does not propose that the place where the last element of a tort occurs is the place where the cause of action based on that tort arises. That is simply the second theory which the Privy Council in <span class="font-italic">Distillers</span> rightly rejected as being capable of leading to arbitrary results. An example of those arbitrary results – based on an example given in <span class="font-italic">Distillers</span> itself (at 468A) – would be if the plaintiff’s mother had bought the drug in New South Wales from a New South Wales drug company, travelled to Singapore with the drug for a short holiday while she was pregnant, consumed the drug in Singapore causing damage to the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">in utero</span> in Singapore and then returned to New South Wales. On the second discredited theory considered in <span class="font-italic">Distillers</span>, the cause of action in this example would have arisen in Singapore, and only in Singapore. That is not the approach which <span class="font-italic">Di</span><span class="font-italic">stillers</span> advocated or which I have adopted here. Further, the fact that damage in this case was suffered in Singapore may not have been anticipated by the defendants – or even by the plaintiffs – at the time the MAN Engines were selected, tested, accepted and installed. But the fact that damage was suffered in Singapore is not fortuitous. The Skaugen group moved the ownership of the ships to Singapore in the course of their business, for genuine and long-term commercial reasons. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 4: A proper case for service out of Singapore </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 The final step in the analysis is to determine whether this was a proper case for leave to be granted to the plaintiffs to serve the writ out of Singapore within the meaning of Order 11 r 2(2). The test to be applied to determine this is the same test which is to be applied when considering whether to stay proceedings commenced in Singapore in which the defendant has been served within the jurisdiction, without leave and as of right, on grounds of <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span>. Order 11 r 2(2) will therefore be satisfied if the plaintiff is able to establish that Singapore is clearly the appropriate forum in which to resolve the parties’ dispute (<span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> at 481D).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 Before I turn to apply the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>test to the facts of this case, however, I deal with a preliminary issue raised by the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 The defendants contend that, on an application to set aside service out of the jurisdiction, the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test is to be applied by reference only to the factual position which obtained when leave to serve out of the jurisdiction was granted. That contention means, on the facts of the defendants’ applications, that I would have to disregard events which took place after the plaintiffs were granted leave to serve the defendants in Germany and Norway respectively in March 2015.

</div>
</div> In other words, once the plaintiffs commenced the Norwegian proceedings, the courts of Germany ceased to be available to the parties as a possible forum for resolving this dispute. That is an important factor because both the assistant registrar and I have found that the <span class="font-italic">loci delicti</span> is Germany and the<span class="font-italic"> lex loci delicti</span> is accordingly German law. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Preliminary issue: the facts to be taken into account</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 Whether a particular case is a proper one for service of originating process out of the jurisdiction within the meaning of Order 11 r 2(2) is determined by the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test (<span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> at 481A). Satisfying the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test is therefore an integral part of the plaintiff’s burden under Order 11, both when applying <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> for leave and also when resisting a defendant’s <span class="font-italic">inter partes</span> application to set aside leave. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 The substance of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test is “to identify the forum in which the case can be suitably tried for the interests of all the parties and for the ends of justice” (<span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> at 480G). The forum identified by the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test is the <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens</span> or, in English, the appropriate forum. As the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">Zoom </span>at [30], the substance of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test is the same whether it is applied under Order 11 r 2(2) where a defendant is to be or has been served out of the jurisdiction with the leave of court or it is applied on a defendant’s application for a discretionary stay of proceedings where a defendant has been served within the jurisdiction as of right. The only difference between those two situations lies in who bears the burden on the application. In the former situation, the burden is on the plaintiff to satisfy the court that Singapore is clearly the appropriate forum (<span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> at 481E). In the latter situation, the burden is on the defendant to satisfy the court that some other forum is clearly and distinctly more appropriate than Singapore (<span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> at 477E).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 The logical consequence of this approach is that, if a defendant fails in its application to set aside service out of the jurisdiction, that necessarily means that the plaintiff has discharged its burden under Order 11 r 2(2) and established that Singapore is indeed clearly the appropriate forum. Any application which the defendant brings at the same time and on the same evidence seeking a discretionary stay of the action on grounds of <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> must necessarily fail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 The Court of Appeal elaborates on this observation in <span class="font-italic">Zoom </span>at [78], noting that “if the substance of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test does not differ according to the nature of the application, then a foreign defendant who seeks the setting aside of an overseas service leave order and prays as a fall-back for a stay of proceedings on improper forum grounds, as was done here, will find that his stay application is pointless”. It concludes its observations on this matter by pointing out that “it is in fact wholly unnecessary and likely counter-productive for a foreign defendant who does not wish to have his dispute with the plaintiff tried in the local court to make both a jurisdictional challenge and a stay application based on the <span class="font-italic">same material</span>” [emphasis in original]: <span class="font-italic">Zoom </span>at [79]. Of course, a standalone stay application brought at a later time and on different evidence may succeed: <span class="font-italic">Zoom </span>at [30].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 As was the case in <span class="font-italic">Zoom</span>, each defendant here prays in its application both to set aside service and, alternatively, for a stay of this action on grounds of <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span>.

</div> These two prayers of the defendants’ applications, having been filed at the same time and on the same evidential material, would ordinarily stand or fall together. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 But the defendants’ preliminary issue adds another string to their bow. If the defendants are correct, their prayer to set aside service must be determined on the factual position as at March 2015, when the plaintiffs secured leave <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte</span>, while their prayer to stay this action on grounds of <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> must be determined on the factual position now. That difference in the underlying evidential material means that each prayer must be analysed separately and could yield different outcomes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 The defendants make this argument primarily on the authority of a decision of Hoffmann J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">ISC Technologies Ltd and another v James Howard Guerin and others</span> [1992] 2 Lloyds Rep 430 (“<span class="font-italic">ISC Technologies</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">ISC Technologies</span>, the plaintiffs issued a writ in England and obtained leave to serve the writ out of the jurisdiction on a defendant in the United States. That defendant then sought to set aside service under Order 12 r 8 of the English Rules of the Supreme Court 1965 (SI 1965 No 776) (UK) (“RSC”). Before Hoffmann J, the defendant argued that the application under RSC Order 12 r 8 was a rehearing of the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> application, and involved the exercise of a fresh discretion. He argued that Hoffmann J could therefore take into account events that had taken place after leave was granted in deciding whether or not to set aside service. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 Hoffmann J disagreed. He held instead that the defendant’s application was to discharge the order granting leave to serve out, and the question was therefore “whether that order was rightly made at the time it was made”: <span class="font-italic">ISC Technologies</span> at 434. Therefore, the court being asked to set aside service could not receive evidence that had not been put before the court at the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> stage, and could not take into account changes to the factual position after leave was granted unless that was necessary to throw light upon the relevant considerations at the time leave was granted. Conversely, Hoffmann J observed that the position would be different where the defendant applied for a stay on grounds of <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span>.

This decision of the English High Court, however, is not of much assistance.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Plaintiffs’ Response (24 July 2017) at paragraph 33. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In <span class="font-italic">William Jacks</span>, the plaintiff secured leave to serve a writ on the defendant outside the jurisdiction. The writ asserted a cause of action for breach of a specific contract for the sale of a specific shipment of honey. When the defendant applied to set aside leave, the plaintiff relied on a broader distributorship agreement between the parties and pointed to an exclusive jurisdiction clause in that agreement in favour of Singapore. The plaintiff accordingly attempted to oppose the setting-aside application on the basis that it was entitled to leave under Order 11 r 1(r). But that was not a ground on which the plaintiff relied when it had secured leave <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span>. And the plaintiff’s pleaded cause of action was not founded on the broader distributorship agreement which contained the exclusive jurisdiction clause. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 The assistant registrar held that, in the absence of any finding that the plaintiff’s conduct was an abuse of process, the plaintiff was entitled to rely on the new head of jurisdiction under Order 11 r 1(r) and on the new cause of action arising from the distributorship agreement even though neither had been raised or relied upon at the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> stage. The assistant registrar also allowed the plaintiff to adduce additional evidence to support the new cause of action, holding that it would not make sense to allow the plaintiff to rely on the new cause of action but to then bar it from adducing fresh evidence on the setting-aside application to support it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 The case before me is an even stronger case than <span class="font-italic">William Jacks</span>. In this case, the plaintiffs do not rely on a new cause of action or on a new head of Order 11 r 1. They seek simply to argue, by reason of the Norwegian proceedings, that Germany is now unavailable as an alternative forum. The plaintiffs are not changing either their substantive cause of action against the defendants nor their case on Order11. They merely seek to rely on evidence of events that took place after they secured leave <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 A further consideration of <span class="font-italic">William Jacks</span> is warranted. There is a line of English authority which holds that, in any action where leave to serve a defendant outside the jurisdiction is required, the plaintiff cannot add a new cause of action by amending the pleadings in that action but must instead commence fresh proceedings and seek fresh leave to serve the originating process in those proceedings on the defendant outside the jurisdiction: see <span class="font-italic">Parker v Schuller </span>[1901] 17 TLR 299 and <span class="font-italic">Metall</span><span class="font-italic"> und Rohstoff AG.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 There is a competing line of English authority which rejects this position. The leading case in this line is <span class="font-italic">NML Capital Ltd v Republic of Argentina</span> [2011] 2 AC 495 (“<span class="font-italic">NML Capital</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">NML Capital</span>, Lord Phillips held (at [74]) that “procedural rules should be the servant not the master of the rule of law” and that the objective of the rules is to “enable the court to deal with cases justly, and that this involves saving expense and ensuring that cases are dealt with expeditiously”. To that end, Lord Phillips observed that “where there is a valid basis for subjecting [an out-of-jurisdiction person] to the jurisdiction, it is not obvious why it should be mandatory for the claimant [seeking to invoke new grounds] to be required to start all over again rather than that the court should have a discretion as to the order that will best serve the overriding objective”: <span class="font-italic">NML Capital </span>at [75].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 In deciding <span class="font-italic">William Jacks</span> as he did, the assistant registrar (at [19]) followed Lord Phillips’ approach. Lord Phillips’ point is, in essence, the same point which I made with regard to a failure to make full and frank disclosure which is not sufficiently egregious as to constitute an abuse of process precluding a fresh application for leave to serve out (see [79] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 This is undoubtedly the correct approach, subject as it must be to the court’s overarching power to prevent an abuse of the process of the court. The other approach wastes costs and time for both the plaintiff and the defendant. For the plaintiff, it is a waste of costs and time to require the plaintiff to file a fresh originating process even where there is a good arguable case that the additional causes of action come within a head of jurisdiction in Order 11. For the defendant, it also wastes costs and time to require the defendant to take out a second setting aside application based on the fresh originating process.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 I therefore agree with Lord Phillips’ approach in <span class="font-italic">NML</span> and with the assistant registrar’s approach in <span class="font-italic">William Jacks</span>. I hold that the court has a discretion to take into account evidence of events occurring after leave is granted <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> when a defendant applies to set aside service out of the jurisdiction. It seems to me that time and costs will be wasted if a court assesses a setting-aside application only on the facts and matters as they existed at the time leave was granted. That would leave it open to the plaintiff, upon service being set aside, simply to seek leave to re-serve the writ or to issue a fresh writ and seek leave to serve that writ, fortified by the fact that there is now a new factor that tends in his favour. The defendant would then come to court again, presumably, to have the re-service or the fresh writ set aside. Everyone will then be made to go over the entire process again, when this could have been dealt with at the hearing to set aside the first writ. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 It also seems to me that taking into account on a setting aside application supervening events transpiring after leave was granted <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> does not go against the purpose of Order 11 of ensuring that both the court and the defendant are given full and proper notice of the basis on which the plaintiff claims the court should exercise jurisdiction over the defendant. A setting aside application is an <span class="font-italic">inter partes</span> hearing. In the course of that hearing, the defendant will be notified and informed of any supervening events on which the plaintiff intends to rely. If the court’s analysis is that the original order granting leave should not have been granted on the material then before the court, but that the material now before the court justifies leave being granted, any prejudice to the defendant can be addressed by an appropriate order as to costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 Further, it cannot be said that allowing the court to take into account events after leave is granted is an approach which unjustly favours plaintiffs as a class over defendants as a class or <span class="font-italic">vice versa</span>. In the long run, the approach is likely to operate equally as between the two classes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 The court is not, of course, obliged to take into consideration any supervening events. If the plaintiff has engaged in sharp practice or conduct which causes substantive prejudice to the defendant, the court may disregard the supervening events and allow the setting aside application. If the plaintiff’s conduct amounts to an abuse of the process of the court, the plaintiff will be precluded from making a fresh application. If not, the plaintiff is at liberty to make a fresh application for leave. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 Conversely, to follow <span class="font-italic">ISC Technologies</span> is to give the defendant a systemic advantage from the procedural sequence in which a setting aside and a stay application are heard. Where the supervening event is against the defendant’s case, the plaintiff will never be able to rely on it. The defendant simply asks the court to shut its eyes to the event on the setting aside application. That makes it more likely that the setting aside application will succeed. If so, the plaintiff will never get the chance to rely on the event on the stay application. But where the supervening event supports the defendant’s case, the defendant can always rely on it. Even if the setting aside application fails, the defendant can still ask the court to take the supervening event into account on the stay application. The approach in <span class="font-italic">ISC</span><span class="font-italic"> Technologies</span> confers an inevitable advantage on the defendant and an inevitable disadvantage on the plaintiff. It is not apparent why this state of unfairness should be the law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 One might say that, if the supervening event favours the plaintiff, the plaintiff’s case is no weaker than it was at the time it applied for leave, and thus it should be foreclosed from relying on new factors in its favour. After all, when it applied for leave it did not have the reinforcing factor of there being, for example, another appropriate forum being unavailable. But it seems to me that this does not compel the conclusion that the courts must deliberately ignore the change in circumstances that has led to a weak case becoming stronger. The conclusion should not be that if the case was weak then, it <span class="font-italic">must still</span> be weak now, when everyone knows that this not true. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 I would add also that taking into consideration events occurring after the leave is granted will help align the substantive approaches under the setting-aside application and the stay application (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, aside from burden of proof). As things stand, if <span class="font-italic">ISC Technologies</span> is right, the court will have to apply <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> twice in a case where there are supervening material events, once for each application. On the setting-aside application, the court pretends that the supervening events did not occur and assesses whether leave should have been granted. But on the stay application, the court takes into account the supervening events, and assesses whether Singapore is the appropriate forum. Moreover, in the case where the supervening events favour the defendant, it becomes apparent that the defendant is made to file the setting-aside application unnecessarily. It knows that its case is stronger on the stay application, but it has to file the setting-aside application anyway to indicate that it has not submitted to the jurisdiction: <span class="font-italic">Zoom </span>at [56]. So the application itself is superfluous, and the court’s consideration of it pointless. To my mind, this duplication of efforts ignores reality, and has the potential to create unjust results. It is also unnecessarily laborious, and disruptive of the current practice, which, as the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">Zoom </span>at [80] is for the local court to “collapse the issue of the proper forum into one question considered in the round”. I would therefore not follow <span class="font-italic">ISC Technologies</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 Applying the above observations to the present facts, it seems quite unnecessary to force the court to pretend that Germany continues to be an available forum, when in reality it is not. I therefore consider that this is a relevant factor in the test to be applied, which is now the same on the setting-aside application and the stay application. I turn now to apply the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Stage 1: Forum Conveniens</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 At the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test, as it applies under Order 11 r 2(2), the plaintiffs have the burden of showing that Singapore is clearly the appropriate forum: <span class="font-italic">Zoom </span>at [71]–[75], <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> at 481E. As the Court of Appeal recently observed in <span class="font-italic">Rappo</span><span class="font-italic">, Tania v Accent Delight International Ltd and another and another appeal</span> [2017] 2 SLR 265 (“<span class="font-italic">Accent </span><span class="font-italic">Delight</span>”) at [70], this inquiry is concerned with finding those incidents or connections that have “the <span class="font-italic">most relevant and substantial associations</span> with the dispute” [emphasis in original]. In so doing, the lodestar for the court is whether any of the connections point to a jurisdiction in which the case may be tried more suitably for the interests of all parties and for the ends of justice: <span class="font-italic">Accent Delight</span> at [72]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 I begin with the four connecting factors I consider most significant, namely:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The availability of Germany as an alternative forum;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The governing law and possible transfer to the SICC;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The availability of witnesses; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The availability of documents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 I will then turn to deal with other connecting factors that were less significant in my analysis, namely:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The availability of Norway as an alternative forum; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) What the plaintiffs, adopting the language of Lord Goff in <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span>, have called the <span class="font-italic">Cambridgeshire</span> factor.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Availability of Germany as an alternative forum</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 The first connection I consider is whether Germany is available as an alternative forum. I consider Germany as a forum first because the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments</span> indicated at [35]–[39] that the <span class="font-italic">loci delicti</span> is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> the appropriate forum for a claim in tort (“the <span class="font-italic">Albaforth</span> principle”). Having said that, the Court of Appeal did observe at [40] that this is “only the <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>position and/or a weighty factor pointing in favour of that jurisdiction”. Building on that observation, I share the view of the assistant registrar that the weight to be given to the <span class="font-italic">Albaforth</span> principle is greatly attenuated when the exercise of determining the <span class="font-italic">loci delicti</span> is not a straightforward one. In this case, as my analysis above has shown, the overall conclusion that Germany is the <span class="font-italic">loci delicti</span> is by no means obvious and does not detract from the fact that significant acts of reliance upon the representation and much of the loss and damage arising from the representation occurred outside Germany. Accordingly, the claim of Germany to be the most appropriate forum simply by virtue of the <span class="font-italic">Albaforth</span> principle is not a strong one.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 Further, it is the case that Germany is no longer available as a forum for the parties to resolve this dispute. The Norwegian proceedings which the plaintiffs commenced in August 2015 mean that, as matters stand today, any German court asked to determine this dispute is obliged to cede jurisdiction to the courts of Norway. The German courts are thus now bound by the “court first seised” rule in the Lugano Convention to decline jurisdiction over this dispute.

</div> The assistant registrar agreed with the defendants, holding that the plaintiffs cannot assert unavailability of another court if the unavailability is due to their own acts: <span class="font-italic">Skaugen</span> at [125]. My view is that I cannot disregard the reality that this dispute cannot be litigated in the German courts. I say that for three reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 First, the plaintiffs cannot in my view be criticised for having chosen to commence proceedings in Norway.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The first plaintiff has a real and substantial connection to Norway. So does the second defendant. The subject-matter of this dispute too has a real, though perhaps not substantial, connection to Norway. That is the place at which the plaintiff received the PPM and from which the first plaintiff took the decision to select the MAN Engine in reliance on the PPM. The plaintiffs’ decision to commence proceedings in Norway is both reasonable and <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>. It cannot in my view be stigmatised as a tactical decision calculated to exclude Germany as an available forum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 The second reason that I cannot disregard the unavailability of Germany as a forum is because that is the result of the very design of the Lugano Convention. Both Germany and Norway, amongst other countries, have acceded to the Lugano Convention. Those two countries have thus adopted, as part of their own respective procedural law, the “court first seised rule” embodied in Art 27 of the Convention. The procedural law of the two countries therefore accepts that a plaintiff with a claim for which both Germany and Norway are <span class="font-italic">an</span> appropriate forum has a free choice as to whether to commence those proceedings in the courts Germany or in the courts of Norway. More importantly, the procedural law of the two countries also accepts that both the counterparty to those proceedings as well as the forum which the plaintiff does not choose are obliged to respect the plaintiff’s choice of forum. Again, in those circumstances, it does not appear to me that this court ought to disregard the very real consequences of the “court first seised principle”, at the very least where it is common ground that the court first seised is <span class="font-italic">an</span> appropriate forum and where I have found that the first plaintiff has reasonably and <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> chosen that forum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 The third reason I cannot disregard the unavailability of Germany as a forum is the actual outcome of the Norwegian proceedings. In October 2016, the Norwegian Court of Appeal decided that, in its view, the plaintiffs’ dispute with the defendants should not be litigated at all – whether in Norway, Germany or Singapore. Instead, the court held that the plaintiffs are bound by the arbitration clauses in the contracts between the shipbuilders and the first defendant for the sale and purchase of the six MAN Engines to arbitrate this dispute in China, even though the plaintiffs are not parties to those contracts or to the arbitration agreements which they contain. The plaintiffs have appealed the decision of the Norwegian Court of Appeal to the Norwegian Supreme Court. But, until and unless the Norwegian Supreme Court reverses that decision, it binds the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 The final reason I cannot disregard the unavailability of Germany as a forum is because, at least on one view, the limitation period applicable to the plaintiffs’ claim against the defendants under German law has expired. The applicable limitation period in Germany is the long-stop limitation period of ten years pursuant to §199(3) of the German Civil Code (“BGB”).

</div> It is true that a plaintiff who fails to issue protective proceedings in the more appropriate forum cannot then argue that the expiry of the limitation period in that forum is a reason that it should be allowed to continue proceedings in the less appropriate forum it has chosen (see <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> at 483F-G). But in this case, as I have found, the plaintiffs acted reasonably and <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in commencing proceedings in Norway rather than Germany.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 I therefore conclude on this factor that significant weight must be given to the fact that Germany is no longer an available forum. That leaves a choice between only Singapore and Norway as the appropriate forum.

That suffices to make Singapore clearly the appropriate forum in which the case can be tried more suitably for the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209   I shall nevertheless analyse the remaining factors on the basis that the courts of both Germany and Norway continue to be available, in case I am wrong on this aspect.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The governing law &amp; possible transfer to the SICC </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 The next key factor is the law governing the dispute.

Our double actionability rule would require a Singapore court to apply both German law and Singapore law.

Additional time and costs will still be required to establish double actionability, because that principle of Singapore private international law applies even when the forum is the SICC. Further, the SICC does not have a German judge who can deal with issues of German law by way of submission rather than evidence.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The possibility of a transfer to the SICC therefore favours Singapore as the appropriate forum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 I agree with the plaintiffs that the possibility of a transfer to the SICC mitigates substantially the disadvantage of having to apply German law in the present dispute. I start by observing that the availability of the SICC is a factor I can take into account in my analysis. As the Court of Appeal indicated in <span class="font-italic">Accent Delight</span> at [121], a relevant factor in the <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> analysis is a possible transfer to the SICC. A transfer is available where the requirements of Order 110 r 12(4)(a) are met. First, the claims must be of an “international and commercial nature”; second, the parties must not seek any relief in the form of, or connected with, a prerogative order; and third, the High Court must deem it more appropriate that the case be heard in the SICC. There is a good arguable case that those requirements are satisfied here. The claims are indeed of an international and commercial nature; neither party has sought relief in the form of, or connected with, a prerogative order; and the fact that German law applies is a significant factor in favour of deeming it more appropriate for this case to be heard in the SICC than in the High Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 Turning to the advantages of the SICC, Order 110 r 25 of the Rules of Court allows the SICC to order, on the application of a party, that a question of foreign law be determined on the basis of submissions instead of proof. This will substantially reduce the time and expense involved in pleading issues of foreign law. Similarly, the Court of Appeal also noted in <span class="font-italic">Accent Delight</span> at [122] that the fact that foreign law applies carries less weight in the <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> analysis if the Singapore courts, through the International Judges in the SICC, are familiar with and adept at applying that foreign law. Although I appreciate that there is currently no German judge appointed as an international judge eligible to sit on SICC cases, there are judges from civil law jurisdictions who are nevertheless equipped with the necessary skills and experience to deal with German law here. Indeed, a Japanese judge sits on the SICC bench, and Japan’s Civil Code has historically been influenced by the German Civil Code. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 Further, it is not obvious that the cost and expense to be saved by litigating this dispute in Germany will be so great as to justify discontinuing the proceedings in Singapore, when no proceedings have even commenced in Germany at this time. I appreciate that this situation is the result of the plaintiffs’ choosing to commence proceedings in Norway. But it seems to me that on this separate factor of saving time and expense, I must take things as they stand. And as things stand, the plaintiffs’ Norwegian proceedings are ongoing, with no proceedings whatsoever in Germany. Additionally, it is not guaranteed that the plaintiffs will withdraw the Norwegian action and attempt to proceed in Germany, even if I hold that Singapore is not available as the appropriate forum. That would nullify the basis of preventing the plaintiffs from litigating this dispute in Singapore. Even if the plaintiffs were to withdraw the Norwegian proceedings and proceed in Germany, it seems to me that parties will have to appoint counsel in Germany

</div> and initiate proceedings in the German courts. This will incur additional expense of time and costs. I acknowledge, of course, that time and expense will also be incurred in appointing German counsel to assist the SICC. But it seems to me that this process will be made faster by the involvement of the local counsel already briefed on both sides, who are already quite familiar with this dispute. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216 I add that a dispute of this nature – where the factual and legal connections are distributed across jurisdictions as diverse and geographically divided as Norway, Germany, China, Hong Kong, and Singapore – is the archetypal dispute which might be better dealt with by an international panel of judges, as is available under the SICC, than by the judges of any one jurisdiction. That is a factor which weighs in favour of SICC against both the Norwegian Courts and the German courts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 My conclusion on this factor is that the advantages of having the matter heard in either Germany or Norway are overstated once the benefits of the SICC are taken into account. Hence the good arguable case in favour of a transfer to the SICC tends to favour Singapore as clearly the more appropriate forum to hear the dispute.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Availability of witnesses</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 I turn now to the connections of the parties and the witnesses. The assistant registrar held that witness location would favour Germany, as the relevant personnel on both sides are based in Europe. As a result, it would be more convenient for the trial to be heard in Germany. The first defendant is based there. And Germany is closer to the second defendant’s and the first plaintiff’s place of business than Singapore: <span class="font-italic">Skaugen </span>at [130]. The defendants echo and amplify these concerns on appeal: they say that concerns of witness compellability and witness convenience both point to Germany as the appropriate forum.

</div> It appears to me, therefore, that much of the focus at trial will be on the issue of loss and damage. Much of the evidence on that issue, both in terms of witnesses as well as documents, will be located in Hong Kong and Singapore, and at any rate outside Germany. Given all these factors, the non-availability and non-compellability of German witnesses becomes much less significant a factor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 In these circumstances, I consider that the defendants’ inability to point to any specific witnesses that they will have difficulty in compelling to give evidence at a trial in Singapore means that witness location does not favour Germany.

It seems to me that the point on translation of documents is slightly in favour of Singapore. A parallel to <span class="font-italic">Siemens</span> can be drawn here. In <span class="font-italic">Siemens</span>, the Court of Appeal took the view that the fact that the relevant agreement and the documentary evidence in that case were all in English suggested that English was the <span class="font-italic">lingua franca</span> of the parties and that an English-speaking forum would thus be preferable (at [11]). The key documents exhibited in this case – the PPM, FSI and FATs – are either solely in English, or in both English and German.

But the plaintiffs’ documents – which go to the question of receipt, reliance and loss and damage – are likely to be in English and will have to be translated into German if the action proceeds in Germany. The point on translation therefore does not clearly assist either side or may even be said to slightly favour Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">228 The thornier question concerns the German and EU data protection requirements.

</div> I take the view, however, that the common-law discovery available in Singapore, as compared to civil law jurisdictions such as Germany or Norway, is a legitimate advantage that the plaintiffs may make use of. Further, insofar as it is the plaintiffs’ intent to deploy this material in other litigation, they cannot do so unilaterally and must instead seek the court’s permission to relax their implied undertaking not to do so: <span class="font-italic">Beckkett</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Deutsche Bank AG</span> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 555 at [18].

That evidence lies with the plaintiffs in Singapore, not Germany. The first defendant’s letter to the first plaintiff accepts that there were deceptive FATs in relation to three out of the six MAN Engines.

</div> and the outcome of that appeal was unknown at the time I rendered my decision. The decision of the Norwegian Court of Appeal is, of course, final until and unless it is reversed on appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">237 The effect of all this is that Norway appears now to be unavailable to the plaintiffs as an alternative forum. I do acknowledge that this ultimately depends on the outcome of the appeal to the Supreme Court of Norway. To that extent, the court of Norway are not unavailable to the plaintiff in the same way as the courts of Germany are unavailable. The plaintiffs’ appeal means that they are still attempting to pursue a resolution of the dispute through litigation in the Norwegian courts. As compared to that, no proceedings at all are pending before the German courts. And even so, if the German time bar has set in, no proceedings can ever be commenced or determined on the merits in Germany. But the current state of affairs in the Norwegian proceedings significantly diminishes the prospect of Norway serving as an alternative forum. It also diminishes the chances of conflicting judgments arising in Norway and in Singapore. On this point, therefore, there is something to be said that the objective interests of justice would favour the action proceeding in Singapore as compared to Norway. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">238 Quite apart from all this, the other connecting factors assessed objectively also point to Singapore being the more appropriate forum than Norway. The points which are likely to be most heavily disputed in this action are issues such as the validity of the assignments, whether any of the assignors relied on the alleged misrepresentation, the degree of reliance, and the extent of loss and damage suffered by the assignors. As I have already found, the evidence on all those issues is far more likely to be in Singapore than in Norway. Only two key acts took place in Norway: (i) Norway is where the first plaintiff received the misrepresentation in the PPM, and (ii) the first plaintiff communicated its acceptances of the MAN Engine to the shipbuilders from Norway. Both of those acts are of only marginal relevance to ascertaining where this dispute can be tried suitably in the interests of the parties and in the interests of justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">239 Conversely, many of the current and former owners of the ships were or are located in Singapore, and their losses would presumably be documented here. Further, the evidence is also that the Skaugen group focused on Singapore as the centre of its ship owning location and operations from 2004 to date.

The facts here are quite far removed from those in <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span>.

The judge at first instance in <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span>, Staughton J, had heard a substantial part of another action brought by a different ship owner against the same shipper for the same type of damage caused in the same way: <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>at 485B. The ship in the other action was the <span class="font-italic">Cambridgeshire</span>. The <span class="font-italic">Cambridgeshire</span> action involved 15 counsel, each of whom was familiar with a substantial mass of documents: <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> at 467G. The shipper’s witnesses had already been brought over from Canada for the <span class="font-italic">Cambridgeshire</span> action; both sides of the Cambridgeshire action were represented by the same counsel as both sides of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>action; both sets of counsel had educated themselves on the various topics on which expert evidence would be called; and a number of English experts had been called: <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> at 470E–471A. Staughton J observed it would be wasteful in the extreme if all the talent, effort and money which the parties had already invested in having <span class="font-italic">Cambridgeshire</span> brought to trial were not put to use again to determine the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> action, as would have been the result if British Columbia were to be held to be the appropriate forum instead of England: <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> at 471B. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">245 The Court of Appeal held that Staughton J had given the <span class="font-italic">Cambridgeshire</span> factor too much importance. But on further appeal to the House of Lords, Lord Goff accepted that Staughton J was correct, on the particular facts before him, to have treated the <span class="font-italic">Cambridgeshire </span>factor as a legitimate factor in the <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> analysis and to have given it the weight that he did. In particular, Lord Goff spoke of the <span class="font-italic">Cambridgeshire</span> factor in these terms (at 485F–H): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I believe that anyone who has been involved, as counsel, in very heavy litigation of this kind, with a number of experts on both sides and difficult scientific questions involved, knows only too well what the learning curve is like; how much information and knowledge has to be, and is, absorbed, not only by the lawyers but really by the whole team, including both lawyers and experts, as they learn about the interrelation of law, fact and scientific knowledge, having regard to the contentions advanced by both sides in the case, and identify in their minds the crucial matters on which attention has to be focused, why these are the crucial matters, and how they are to be assessed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">246 Lord Goff therefore held that Staughton J had been right to take the view that having experienced teams of lawyers and experts available on both sides of the litigation who were already familiar with <span class="font-italic">Cambridgeshire</span> would contribute to efficiency, expedition and economy in the resolution of <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>itself, and moreover, advance the interests of justice: <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>at 486A–C. He further noted that although the plaintiffs in the <span class="font-italic">Cambridgeshire</span> action and in the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> action were different, they were insured by the same insurers; those insurers had been financing both actions and thus were <span class="font-italic">dominus</span><span class="font-italic"> litis</span>; and those insurers had instructed solicitors for both the <span class="font-italic">Cambridgeshire</span> action and the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> action: <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>at 486D–F. The <span class="font-italic">Cambridgeshire</span> action would therefore set the backdrop against which the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> action would be decided or settled.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">247 The facts here are quite far from those in <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span>. Although the present facts are fairly complex, they do not appear to require highly specialised expert evidence. There have been no related proceedings in the Singapore courts that have involved the same legal team litigating substantially the same issues, albeit between different parties. There will in all likelihood have to be foreign counsel appointed to submit on German law if the matter is transferred to the SICC, and these foreign counsel may not be familiar with the matter. The plaintiffs therefore cannot derive any assistance from the <span class="font-italic">Cambridgeshire </span>factor. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Stage Two: substantial injustice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">248 Having concluded that the key connecting factors in the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test point to Singapore as being clearly the appropriate forum, it is not strictly necessary to consider the plaintiffs’ further contention that they would suffer substantial injustice if they were shut out from proceeding in Singapore and required to proceed in Germany instead. This parallels the Court of Appeal’s analysis in <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments</span>, in considering an appeal against an order granting a stay of proceedings. The Court of Appeal held that once the factors for the first stage pointed to Singapore as the appropriate forum, the court did not then have to consider whether the plaintiffs would also succeed in arguing on the second stage that they would suffer substantial injustice if compelled to litigate in the foreign jurisdiction instead of Singapore (at [91]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">249 Similarly, in the applications before me, the plaintiffs have succeeded on the first stage in establishing that Singapore is clearly the more appropriate forum than any other. There is thus no need for me to consider whether they would suffer substantial injustice if made to litigate elsewhere under the second stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test. I therefore do not address the plaintiffs’ arguments that the lack of common law discovery, and the German time bar having set in, would operate to make them suffer substantial injustice if they were compelled to litigate in Germany. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">250 Indeed, it would appear that, the plaintiffs having succeeded on the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test, the burden now shifts to the defendants to show why <span class="font-italic">they</span> would suffer substantial injustice if this action were to proceed in Singapore. This shifting of the burden simply mirrors the approach that would be taken if this were an application by the defendants for a stay in a case where service had been effected within the jurisdiction as of right. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">251 In a stay application, the defendants would bear the burden of proving that the connecting factors at the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test pointed to some forum elsewhere which was clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore, while the plaintiffs would then bear the burden at the second stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test of showing that they would not obtain justice in the foreign jurisdiction: <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> at 477E and 478D. The converse of that test, to be applied in the Order 11 context, is that the plaintiffs bear the burden of proving that the connecting factors point to Singapore: <span class="font-italic">Zoom </span>at [75], and if the plaintiffs fail on the first stage, they must then go on to show that they would suffer substantial injustice in the foreign jurisdiction. But if the plaintiffs succeed on the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test, the burden shifts to <span class="font-italic">the defendant</span><span class="font-italic">s</span> to show that they would suffer substantial injustice in Singapore. After all, it cannot be right that the plaintiffs who succeed on the first stage must also go on to show that the defendants would not suffer substantial injustice in Singapore. This goes too far and essentially asks the plaintiffs to make the defendants’ case. Nor does it seem to me that this is what the Court of Appeal had in mind when it said that in the Order 11 context, the plaintiff retains the burden of showing that Singapore is the proper forum “at all times”: <span class="font-italic">Zoom </span>at [76].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">252 With these principles in mind, the relevant consideration here on the second stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test is whether the defendants allege that they will suffer substantial injustice should the action be allowed to proceed in Singapore. The defendants make no such allegation and have produced no such evidence. I therefore do not need to consider any further the second stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The defendants’ stay application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">253 For the sake of completeness, I also address briefly the defendants’ alternative prayer for a stay of this action on grounds of <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span>. The defendants submit that if they fail to set aside service, the court must consider their stay application. The defendants accept that the substance of the test to be applied remains the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test. The only material change of approach is that the defendants now bear the burden of showing that there is another forum which is clearly and distinctly more appropriate for the trial of the action.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">254 I consider that my application of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test in determining whether this was a proper case for service out of the jurisdiction within the meaning of Order 11 r 2(2) precludes any separate consideration of the defendants’ alternative prayer for a discretionary stay on grounds of <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span>. There might have been a point to applying the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test once again to the defendants’ alternative prayer for a stay if I had followed <span class="font-italic">ISC Technologies </span>and accepted that the court could not look at events occurring after leave had been granted to serve the writ out of jurisdiction on the setting-aside application but could do so on a <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> application for a stay. But for the reasons already stated above, I have not adopted that approach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">255 There is therefore no material difference between the two alternative prayers – one for setting aside and one for a discretionary stay – that could lead to a different outcome upon the application of the substantive <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test. The Court of Appeal was alive to this unnecessary duplication in <span class="font-italic">Zoom</span>, and observed at [78] that where the “substance of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> test does not differ according to the nature of the application, then a foreign defendant who seeks the setting aside of an overseas service leave order and prays as a fall-back for a stay of proceedings of improper forum grounds…will find that his stay application is pointless”. I agree. The transfer of the burden on the application from the plaintiff to the defendant does not change the analytical framework set out above or the outcome of applying that framework to the facts of this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">256 Singapore remains the <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens</span>. The defendants’ alternative prayer for a discretionary stay must fail. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">257 For the reasons I have set out above, I have found that the plaintiffs have shown a good arguable case that they fall within the heads of jurisdiction under Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">f</span>)(ii) and Order 11 r 1(<span class="font-italic">p</span>). Singapore is also the <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens</span>. I have therefore allowed the plaintiffs’ appeal in RA 163 of 2016 and dismiss the defendants’ appeals in RA 167 and 168 of 2016. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Vinodh Coomaraswamy  <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lawrence Teh, Loh Jen Wei and Ravin Periasamy (Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP) for the plaintiffs;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Danny Ong, Yam Wern-Jhien and Eunice Wong (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
