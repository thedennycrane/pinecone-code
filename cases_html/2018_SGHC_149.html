Clearly, a party will not be able to satisfy the court that there is a serious question to be tried unless he establishes that he has a reasonable cause of action. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In the light of the arguments presented, the issues that arose for my determination were:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) regarding the Plaintiff’s interlocutory injunction application in SUM 5611:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) whether there was a serious question to be tried in Suit 1089; and </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) if so, whether the balance of convenience lay in favour of granting the interlocutory injunction; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) regarding the Defendant’s striking-out application in SUM 5650, whether there was a reasonable cause of action in respect of the following claims by the Plaintiff (see [22] above):</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) the Material Falsehood Declaration Claim; </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) the Prospective Infringement Declaration Claim; </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) the Injunction Claim; and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) the Actual Infringement Declaration Claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Given my observation at [24] above, I will first deal with the Defendant’s striking-out application before addressing the Plaintiff’s interlocutory injunction application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The striking-out application in SUM 5650</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 There was no dispute that the threshold to be met for striking-out was that the claim “must be obviously unsustainable, the pleadings unarguably bad and it must be impossible, not just improbable, for the claim to succeed”; also, that an application to strike out under this head of O 18 r 19(1) solely concerned issues of law and did not involve affidavit evidence: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2018</span> vol I (Foo Chee Hock JC gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2018) (“<span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil </span><span class="font-italic">Procedure</span>”) at paras 18/19/6 and 18/19/10.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In my judgment, the Material Falsehood Declaration Claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action, while the Prospective Infringement Declaration Claim, the Injunction Claim and the Actual Infringement Declaration Claim all disclosed no reasonable cause of action.

</div> Instead, the Plaintiff relied on reg 24(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the TPR and, alternatively, the inherent jurisdiction of the court, both of which it argued could provide the basis for a separate and independent cause of action in prospective infringement outside of the PA framework. I will address both arguments in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Regulation 24(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the TPR</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The Plaintiff contended that it had a cause of action in prospective<span class="font-italic"> </span>infringement under reg 24(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the TPR. As counsel for the Plaintiff cited <span class="font-italic">AstraZeneca</span> as the authority for this proposition, I set out below in some detail the facts and the decision in that case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 <span class="font-italic">AstraZeneca</span> was a decision of an assistant registrar (“AR”) of the High Court in 2012. By way of background, the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">AstraZeneca</span> was the owner of a patent for which the claimed invention comprised two elements: an active ingredient (Rosuvastatin Calcium) and a stabiliser. The defendant applied to the HSA for product licences in respect of three products: Rosucard Film-coated Tablet 10mg, Rosucard Film-coated Tablet 20mg, and Rosucard Film-coated Tablet 40mg. As this was prior to the enactment of the TPR, the statutory provisions governing the registration of drugs and other “medicinal products”, as defined in s 3 of the Medicines Act (Cap 176, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the MA”), were found in what was then Part II of the MA. Part II established a statutory framework for the issuance of product licences in respect of medicinal products which was similar to the present system of registration of therapeutic products set out in Part 5 of the TPR. Section 12A of the MA was the forerunner to what is currently reg 23 of the TPR (see <span class="font-italic">AstraZeneca </span>at [29]). Under s 12A(2) of the MA, the party applying for a product licence had to make a declaration stating <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> whether a patent under the PA was in force in respect of the medicinal product to which its application related, and if there was such a patent which the applicant itself was not a proprietor of, whether the proprietor had consented to or acquiesced in the grant of the product licence, or whether in the applicant’s opinion and to the best of his belief, the patent was invalid or would not be infringed by the doing of the act for which the licence was sought (which corresponds to regs 23(2) and 23(3) of the TPR).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The defendant in <span class="font-italic">AstraZeneca</span> made a declaration stating that: (a) a patent was in force in respect of its Rosucard products; (b) the defendant was not the proprietor of the patent; and (c) it believed the patent would not be infringed by the doing of the acts for which the product licence was sought. The defendant was then requested by the HSA to serve a notice on the plaintiff pursuant to s 12A(3) of the MA (which corresponds to regs 23(5) and 23(6) of the TPR). The plaintiff filed a suit against the defendant. This had the effect of triggering a 30-month moratorium against the processing of the defendant’s licence application pursuant to s 12A(5) of the MA read with reg 5B(3) of the Medicines (Licensing, Standard Provisions and Fees) Regulations (Cap 176, Rg 6, 2000 Rev Ed) (“the MR”) (which corresponds to regs 23(8) and 23(9) of the TPR). In its statement of claim, the plaintiff prayed for, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, a declaration that the defendant’s performance of the acts for which a product licence was sought would infringe the plaintiff’s patent, and an injunction to restrain the defendant from infringing the patent.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The import of s 12A of the MA became the key issue in contention in <span class="font-italic">AstraZeneca</span> because the plaintiff in that case stated that it was not taking out a patent infringement action under the PA and that it relied instead on s 12A of the MA for its cause of action. The plaintiff took the position that s 12A gave rise to a cause of action separate and independent from a patent infringement action under the PA. The defendant, on the other hand, argued that s 12A merely provided a notification mechanism whereby a patentee would be informed of any application for a product licence which related to its patent, and that any action to protect its patent would still have to be by way of patent infringement proceedings under the PA. Before the AR, the defendant applied to strike out the statement of claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In finding for the plaintiff, the AR agreed with the plaintiff that it could not have proceeded under the PA because “it is a fundamental feature of a patent infringement action under the [PA] that there be a <span class="font-italic">past</span> act of infringement” [emphasis in original] (at [30]). Conversely, s 12A of the MA, read with reg 5B and the Sixth Schedule of the MR, “contemplates the taking out of an action for <span class="font-italic">prospective </span>infringement – the patent will be infringed” [emphasis in original] (also at [30]). In the AR’s view, these legislative provisions (at [32]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… reflect Parliament’s intention to allow a patentee to take out an action pursuant to those provisions fairly clearly. Section 12A(3) of the [MA] allows the HSA to require an applicant for a product licence to serve a notice in a prescribed form to the patentee. The form … informs the patentee that the HSA may grant the licence to the applicant unless the patentee applies “for a court order restraining the act for which the licence is applied for or a declaration by a court or the Registrar of patents that the patent will be infringed by the doing of that act.” Reading the provisions holistically, it is, in my view, apparent that the legislature intended for an independent cause of action to be provided pursuant to these provisions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I pause at this point to note that the AR’s decision in <span class="font-italic">AstraZeneca</span> does not appear to have been appealed against. <span class="font-italic">AstraZeneca </span>has been cited and relied upon by parties in other cases: see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Genetech</span><span class="font-italic"> Inc and others v Celltrion Healthcare Singapore Pte Ltd</span>, Suit No 786 of 2017 (Summons No 4555 of 2017) (27 December 2017).

The drafting of various provisions in the PA indicates that the legislature was clear as to the distinction between <span class="font-italic">past</span> acts of infringements and <span class="font-italic">prospective</span> acts of infringement: see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, s 77(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the PA, where reference is made both to “acts in respect of which proceedings were threatened <span class="font-italic">constitute</span> … an infringement of a patent” and acts which “if done, <span class="font-italic">would constitute</span> an infringement of a patent” [emphases added]. The fact that s 67, which enables a patentee to bring civil proceedings for patent infringement and enumerates the reliefs it may seek, is drafted so as to reference <span class="font-italic">past</span> infringement also indicates a conscious legislative decision that patent infringement claims under the PA should be founded on <span class="font-italic">past</span> acts of infringement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The view that patent infringement actions under the PA must be founded on <span class="font-italic">past</span> acts of infringement is also supported by the provisions of O 87A r 2(2) of the ROC. Order 87A deals with how proceedings under the PA are to be brought. As the AR in <span class="font-italic">AstraZeneca </span>pointed out (at [22]), O 87A r 2(2) expressly provides that the plaintiff in a patent infringement action under the PA must serve with his statement of claim “particulars of the infringement relied on, showing which of the claims in the specification of the patent are alleged to be infringed and giving at least one instance of each type of infringement alleged”. In this regard, the corresponding commentary in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure </span>notes that although it “is made clearly obligatory to name some definite instance of the general type of article of the sale, use or manufacture of which the plaintiff complains”, the “instances of alleged infringement in the particulars of infringement are not required to be exhaustive” (at para 87A/2/6, citing <span class="font-italic">Towa Corp v ASM Technology Singapore Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and another </span>[2017] 3 SLR 771 at [136]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Having found that the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">AstraZeneca</span> had no cause of action under the PA, the AR went on to hold that it could rely on a separate cause of action in <span class="font-italic">prospective</span> infringement based on s 12A of the MA read with its accompanying subsidiary legislation. Again, I found the AR’s analysis in this respect (at [24]–[30]) sensible and well-reasoned. However, it did not assist the Plaintiff here. Whilst the terms of s 12A of the MA correspond closely to those of reg 23 of the TPR, the immediate difficulty which confronted the Plaintiff in its attempt to rely on <span class="font-italic">AstraZeneca</span> was the absence of a reg 23(5) notice in the present case. This meant that there was no triggering of the mechanism provided in reg 23 for the patentee to be notified of and to challenge the registration application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Evidently the Plaintiff recognised this difficulty, because its written submissions stated that its cause of action in prospective infringement was <span class="font-italic">based on</span> <span class="font-italic">reg</span><span class="font-italic"> 24(1)(a)(i) of the TPR</span>.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> However, its submissions did not go on to explain how, in these circumstances, <span class="font-italic">AstraZeneca</span> might assist its case. As noted earlier, in <span class="font-italic">AstraZeneca</span> the finding of a cause of action in prospective infringement independent of the PA rested on the statutory language of s 12A of the MA. Section 12A, read with the relevant subsidiary legislation, envisaged the proprietor of a patent applying within 45 days of a s 12A(3) notice for a declaration that its patent is valid or “will be infringed” by the doing of the act for which the licence is sought. In the same vein, reg 23(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the TPR envisages the proprietor of a patent applying within 45 days of a reg 23(5) notice for a declaration that its patent is valid or “will be infringed” by the doing of the act for which the licence is sought. There is no reference to the PA in s 12A of the MA or in reg 23 of the TPR. As the AR noted in <span class="font-italic">AstraZeneca</span>, “section 12A of the [MA] does not envisage the taking out of a patent infringement action under the [PA]” (at [30]). In contrast, reg 24(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the TPR, which the Plaintiff relied on, expressly contemplates a scenario in which a court (or Registrar or Deputy Registrar of Patents) has determined that the doing of an act authorised by the registration “<span class="font-italic">infringes</span> a patent <span class="font-italic">under the Patents Act</span>” [emphasis added]. When reg 23(8) and reg 24(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) are read side by side, it is clear that the former provision contemplates <span class="font-italic">prospective</span> infringement whereas the latter contemplates a scenario in which there has been <span class="font-italic">actual</span> infringement justifying infringement action under the PA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 When asked about this difference, counsel for the Plaintiff said that the Defendant was “reading too much” into the difference in the statutory language of reg 24(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) as against that of reg 23(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii), and that the word “‘infringes’ can encompass prospective infringement”. No authority was cited for this proposition, and with respect, I did not see how it could be correct. There is nothing in the drafting of reg 23 and reg 24 – or indeed, in the TPR as a whole – to suggest that the words “infringes” and “will be infringed” are to be used interchangeably. Indeed, given that the words “will be infringed” already appear in the TPR (reg 23(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii)), it would be chaotic if the word “infringe” were also capable of being understood to mean “will be infringed”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In any event, the word “infringes” in reg 24(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) is expressly used in conjunction with the words “under the Patents Act”. The Plaintiff had conceded from the outset that patent infringement actions under the PA would not be sustainable unless they featured a past act of infringement. Even on the Plaintiff’s own case, therefore, it made no sense to read the phrase “infringes a patent <span class="font-italic">under the Patents Act</span>” in reg 24(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) as encompassing cases of prospective infringement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The Plaintiff argued that reg 24(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) should be given a broad construction so as to give effect to Parliament’s intention to create a pro-patentee regime. The authority relied on for this proposition appeared to be <span class="font-italic">AstraZeneca</span> at [47] and [48]. I disagreed with the Plaintiff’ argument. Those remarks in <span class="font-italic">AstraZeneca</span> related to the AR’s view that a patentee who filed proceedings within 45 days of a s 12A(3) notice should not be required to “plead facts to support its allegation that its patent will be infringed” (at [47]). They did not provide support for the proposition that the word “infringes” in reg 24(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) should be understood to mean the same thing as the words “will be infringed”. As Andrew Phang Boon Leong J (as he then was) noted in <span class="font-italic">Nation Fittings (M) </span><span class="font-italic">Sdn Bhd v Oystertec plc and another suit</span> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 712 (at [27]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the favoured approach nowadays (and rightly so … ) is a purposive approach that is exemplified not only by the case law but also by s 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act itself (Cap 1, 1999 Rev Ed). Indeed, a purposive approach towards the statutory text does not ignore the literal meaning of the text by any means but, rather, complements it by ensuring that the purpose and intent of the statutory text itself is achieved and that any strained and, a fortiori, absurd result is avoided. I should reiterate that <span class="font-italic">the court’s interpretation </span><span class="font-italic">should be consistent with, and should not either add to or take away from, or stretch unreasonably, the literal language of the statutory provision concerned</span>. In other words, the literal statutory language constitutes the broad framework within which the purpose and intent of the provision concerned is achieved. It is imperative, to underscore the point just made, that this framework is not distorted as the ends do not justify the means. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Plaintiff’s suggestion that the word “infringes” in reg 24(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) be read interchangeably with “will be infringed” would, in my view, “stretch unreasonably” the literal statutory language of the provision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Moreover, if reg 24(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) were to be construed as encompassing prospective acts of infringement, this would in my view render largely ineffectual the framework established under reg 23. Regulation 23 has put in place a clearly defined process whereby a patentee may – upon service of a reg 23(5) notice – obtain a 30-month moratorium on an application for therapeutic product registration by following the steps detailed in reg 23(8) and complying with the stated 45-day timeline. Pursuant to reg 23(9), if the patentee fails to obtain within the 30-month moratorium period a declaration that its patent is valid or will be infringed by the doing of the acts for which the therapeutic product registration is sought, the HSA may register the therapeutic product without further notice to the patentee. If reg 24(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) were to be construed as creating another cause of action for prospective infringement <span class="font-italic">separate from and in addition to</span> the cause of action under reg 23, it would mean that the patentee who alleges prospective infringement but who fails to act before the 45-day deadline or fails to obtain the necessary declaration during the 30-month moratorium gets a second bite of the cherry even after registration. The potential repercussions are widened when we note that reliance on reg 24(1) is not restricted to patentees but is expressly open to “any interested person”. It does not seem to me credible to suggest that it must have been the legislature’s intention to create another separate cause of action for prospective infringement which would render largely pointless the framework already provided in reg 23. The Plaintiff could not point to any material which supported such a suggestion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Finally, the Plaintiff argued that if its claim for prospective infringement were to be struck out, it would signal that a patentee pharmaceutical company was completely “impotent” to protect its patent when a generic acted “dishonourably” in failing to make a truthful patent declaration in its application for therapeutic product registration. I did not think this was an accurate depiction of the present state of the law. As observed earlier, the TPR allow for a patentee to pre-emptively halt registration of a therapeutic product via the prospective infringement regime under regs 23(5) and 23(8) – but assuming the patentee is unable for some reason to halt registration, it can still bring patent infringement proceedings under the PA if, pursuant to the registration, the successful applicant does any act which infringes the patent. Nor will a false or misleading patent declaration go unsanctioned: the patentee can still get the registration cancelled under reg 24(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) if it can obtain a court determination on the false or misleading declaration. Furthermore, the applicant who makes a false patent declaration may be prosecuted for an offence under reg 25 of the TPR and subjected to criminal sanctions. In short, there was no basis for the submission that a patentee pharmaceutical company would be completely helpless if a generic failed to declare its patent.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The inherent jurisdiction of the court </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The Plaintiff’s written submissions stated that it relied on the court’s inherent jurisdiction as an alternative basis for a cause of action in prospective infringement.

</div>
</div> however, nothing else was said by the Plaintiff in the course of the hearing. The Plaintiff did not elaborate – nor did it cite any authorities – on the basis for invoking the court’s inherent jurisdiction in this case. No arguments were made by the Defendant either on this issue. Nevertheless, as I indicated to parties when issuing my decision, I did consider whether the claim for a declaration of prospective infringement could be sustained on the basis of what was pleaded in the Statement of Claim – and did not find it to be the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In <span class="font-italic">AstraZeneca</span>, the AR opined that apart from s 12A of the MA (read with the accompanying subsidiary legislation) affording the plaintiff a cause of action for prospective infringement outside of the PA, the plaintiff’s statement of claim “may be able [to] sustain an action for a declaration of future infringement under the inherent jurisdiction of the court” (at [36]). In expressing such an opinion, the AR referred (at [37]) to s 18 read with para 14 of the First Schedule of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”), which empower the High Court to make binding declarations of right.

</div> in which it was held that a party applying for declaratory relief need not have a subsisting cause of action or a right to some other relief: “[i]t is when an infringement of the plaintiff’s rights in the future is threatened or when, unaccompanied by threats, there is a dispute between parties as to what their respective rights will be if something happens in the future, that the jurisdiction to make declarations of right can be most usefully invoked” (at 501). The AR further alluded to the decisions in <span class="font-italic">Nokia Corp v Interdigital Technology Corp </span>[2007] FSR 23 (“<span class="font-italic">Nokia</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Wyko</span><span class="font-italic"> Group Plc v Cooper Roller Bearings Co Ltd</span> [1996] FSR 126 (“<span class="font-italic">Wyko</span>”) as establishing that the court had the inherent jurisdiction in patent cases to grant declarations of infringement or non-infringement pertaining to prospective events, provided firstly that the “question must be a real and not a theoretical question; the person raising it must have a real interest to raise it; he must be able to secure a proper contradictor, that is to say, someone presently existing who has a true interest to oppose the declaration sought” (at [40]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I make two points in relation to the above observations. Firstly, I do not think there is any magic to invoking the court’s inherent jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief in the context of patent cases. The general principle, that the “essential touchstone” for any exercise of the court’s inherent jurisdiction is that of “need”, must continue to apply in such cases as it does to all other cases where parties seek to rely on this inherent jurisdiction: see <span class="font-italic">Wee Soon Kim Anthony v Law Society of Singapore</span> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 821 at [27]. The requirement stated in cases such as <span class="font-italic">Wyko</span> for the party seeking declaratory relief to show a “genuine interest” in raising the question appears to me to be simply another way of expressing the general principle. Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Nokia</span>, for example, where the respondent (“Nokia”) sought declarations that certain patents of the appellant (“InterDigital”) did not cover that which it was essential to use for complying with the internationally agreed 3G standard for mobile phones, it was acknowledged by both parties that Nokia did not have a licence from InterDigital, and that if the patents were truly essential for the 3G standard, then Nokia needed one and was at that stage “technically infringing”. On that basis, it can hardly be gainsaid that Nokia had a “need” for the declarations sought. The English Court of Appeal had no difficulty holding that Nokia had shown a “real commercial reason” for seeking the declarations. InterDigital’s appeal against the High Court’s refusal of its application to set aside the proceedings and/or to enter summary judgment was accordingly dismissed. Conversely, in <span class="font-italic">Wyko</span>, the plaintiff – who wished to start manufacturing roller bearings and associated products which would closely match the defendant’s products – sought declarations of non-infringement of the defendant’s copyright in respect of some of the parts it wanted to manufacture. The court noted that: (a) the plaintiff had yet to manufacture any items which might be said to infringe; (b) it had not identified any particular copyright; (c) in the absence of some allegedly infringing product, none was capable of being identified; and (d) the defendant had not as yet asserted any claim (a mere reservation of rights in inter-solicitor correspondence being insufficient for this purpose). On these facts, the plaintiff was held to have failed to demonstrate any basis for the grant of declaratory relief. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Secondly, assuming as a general proposition of law that the court may in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction grant a declaration of prospective infringement, a plaintiff who seeks to rely on this inherent jurisdiction must plead sufficient facts to provide basis for its exercise. This is why we see the court in <span class="font-italic">Wyko</span>, for example, scrutinising the plaintiff’s statement of claim “in order to see the precise case which they seek to put” (at 130–132). In the present case, the Statement of Claim asserts that: (a) the Plaintiff has patents over processes for the manufacture of Bortezomib; (b) the Defendant has registered a therapeutic product containing Bortezomib as an active ingredient; and (c) the acts for which registration has been obtained “would infringe one or more” of the 64 claims of the Plaintiff’s Patents.

In any event, having regard to the reasons set out in the preceding paragraph, I would respectfully disagree with his suggestion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 For the reasons set out above, I held that the Prospective Infringement Declaration Claim disclosed no reasonable cause of action and was obviously unsustainable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Injunction Claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Next, the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim sought an injunction to restrain the Defendant from infringing its patents. As noted earlier, the Plaintiff conceded that this was not a case where any infringing act had actually taken place, and that its claim for an injunction was only premised on a cause of action in <span class="font-italic">prospective</span> infringement arising either from regulation 24(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the TPR or from the court’s inherent jurisdiction (see [32] above). Accordingly, for the reasons that I have set out earlier in rejecting the Prospective Infringement Declaration Claim (at [31]–[53] above), I found that this claim disclosed no reasonable cause of action and was obviously unsustainable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Actual Infringement Declaration Claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Finally, aside from the alleged cause of action in <span class="font-italic">prospective</span> infringement, the Statement of Claim also asserted <span class="font-italic">actual</span> infringement by the Defendant: see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, paras 13–15 of the Statement of Claim. The Defendant pointed out in its written submissions that the claim of actual infringement is baseless because the Plaintiff has not pointed to and cannot point to any infringing act by the Defendant. Indeed, as noted earlier, the Plaintiff conceded that: (a) this was not a case where any infringing act had taken place; (b) the Plaintiff was not claiming actual infringement under the PA. As such, the claim of actual infringement in the Statement of Claim – as well as the associated prayers for an order for the delivery up or destruction of infringing articles and an inquiry into damages (or alternatively an account of profits) – were plainly unsustainable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The interlocutory injunction application in SUM 5611</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I now turn to the Plaintiff’s application in SUM 5611 for an interlocutory injunction to restrain the Defendant from performing any of the acts for which registration of the Defendant’s therapeutic product was obtained. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 To succeed in this application, the Plaintiff had to show firstly that there was “a serious question to be tried”; and secondly, that “the balance of convenience [lay] in favour of granting” the interlocutory injunction: <span class="font-italic">American Cy</span><span class="font-italic">anamid </span>at 407–408.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In my judgment, the Plaintiff failed to satisfy either limb of the <span class="font-italic">American Cy</span><span class="font-italic">anamid </span>test. I therefore dismissed the Plaintiff’s application for an interlocutory injunction.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Serious question to be tried</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 On the first limb of the <span class="font-italic">American Cy</span><span class="font-italic">anamid</span> test, I held that the “serious question to be tried” must relate to the right for which the Plaintiff has sought protection from injury.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In so far as the Plaintiff appeared to suggest in its arguments in SUM 1764 (when seeking leave to appeal against my decision in SUM 5611) that the first limb of the <span class="font-italic">American Cy</span><span class="font-italic">anamid</span> test can be satisfied so long as a valid cause of action is found in respect of <span class="font-italic">any</span> right asserted in the statement of claim, regardless of what that right might be, I do not think the suggestion is correct as a matter of principle. As Lord Diplock held in <span class="font-italic">American Cyanamid </span>(at 406), “[t]he object of the interlocutory injunction is to protect the plaintiff against injury by violation of his right for which he could not be adequately compensated in damages recoverable in the action if the uncertainty were resolved in his favour at the trial”. To put it somewhat colloquially, when the court asks of a plaintiff “what do you seek to injunct the defendant from doing”, the “flip-side” of that question must be “what right do you seek to protect from injury by the defendant”. It does not make sense for the court to injunct a defendant from doing specific acts without knowing what rights of the plaintiff’s those specific acts are alleged to injure. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In the context of the present application, the “serious question to be tried” must therefore be one which related to the Plaintiff’s alleged right to protection from prospective infringement of its patents. In this connection, the Plaintiff has conceded that there has been no actual infringement of its patents by the Defendant (see [32] above), and I have indeed so found (at [55] above). I have also found that the Plaintiff had no reasonable cause of action for prospective infringement of its patents (at [31]–[53] above). In the circumstances, I was of the view that the Plaintiff could not satisfy the first limb of the <span class="font-italic">American Cy</span><span class="font-italic">anamid</span> test. To quote Lord Diplock again, this time from his judgment in <span class="font-italic">Siskina</span><span class="font-italic"> (Owners of cargo lately laden on board) and Others v Distos Compania Naviera SA </span>[1979] AC 210 (“<span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Siskina</span>”) (at 256): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… A right to obtain an interlocutory injunction is not a cause of action. It cannot stand on its own. It is dependent upon there being a pre-existing cause of action against the defendant arising out of an invasion, actual or threatened by him, of a legal or equitable right of the plaintiff for the enforcement of which the defendant is amenable to the jurisdiction of the court. The right to obtain an interlocutory injunction is merely ancillary and incidental to the pre-existing cause of action. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Although <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Siskina</span> concerned an application for a <span class="font-italic">Mareva</span> injunction, the principle articulated by Lord Diplock in the aforementioned passage is of general application, having been applied, for example, by Hoffmann J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Associated Newspapers Group </span><span class="font-italic">Plc v Insert Media Ltd and Others</span> [1988] 1 WLR 509 (at 514–515).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The balance of convenience</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In the event that I was wrong about the Plaintiff’s ability to satisfy the first limb of the <span class="font-italic">American Cy</span><span class="font-italic">anamid</span> test, I also proceeded to consider the second limb of the test, that is, whether – assuming it could cross the threshold of “serious question to be tried” – the Plaintiff was able to show that the balance of convenience lay in favour of granting it the interlocutory injunction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The governing principles in this respect are set out in Lord Diplock’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">American Cy</span><span class="font-italic">anamid</span>. For ease of reference, I reproduce the relevant passages (at 408–409) below:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the court should first consider whether, if the plaintiff were to succeed at the trial in establishing his right to a permanent injunction, he would be adequately compensated by an award of damages for the loss he would have sustained as a result of the defendant’s continuing to do what was sought to be enjoined between the time of the application and the time of the trial. If damages in the measure recoverable at common law would be adequate remedy and the defendant would be in a financial position to pay them, no interlocutory injunction should normally be granted, however strong the plaintiff’s case appeared to be at that stage. If, on the other hand, damages would not provide an adequate remedy for the plaintiff in the event of his succeeding at the trial, the court should then consider whether, on the contrary hypothesis that the defendant were to succeed at the trial in establishing his right to do that which was sought to be enjoined, he would be adequately compensated under the plaintiff’s undertaking as to damages for the loss he would have sustained by being prevented from doing so between the time of the application and the time of the trial. If damages in the measure recoverable under such an undertaking would be an adequate remedy and the plaintiff would be in a financial position to pay them, there would be no reason upon this ground to refuse an interlocutory injunction.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is where there is doubt as to the adequacy of the respective remedies in damages available to either party or to both, that the question of balance of convenience arises. It would be unwise to attempt even to list all the various matters which may need to be taken into consideration in deciding where the balance lies, let alone to suggest the relative weight to be attached to them. These will vary from case to case.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where other factors appear to be evenly balanced it is a counsel of prudence to take such measures as are calculated to preserve the status quo. If the defendant is enjoined temporarily from doing something that he has not done before, the only effect of the interlocutory injunction in the event of his succeeding at the trial is to postpone the date at which he is able to embark upon a course of action which he has not previously found it necessary to undertake; whereas to interrupt him in the conduct of an established enterprise would cause much greater inconvenience to him since he would have to start again to establish it in the event of his succeeding at the trial.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Save in the simplest cases, the decision to grant or to refuse an interlocutory injunction will cause to whichever party is unsuccessful on the application some disadvantages which his ultimate success at the trial may show he ought to have been spared and the disadvantages may be such that the recovery of damages to which he would then be entitled either in the action or under the plaintiff’s undertaking would not be sufficient to compensate him fully for all of them. The extent to which the disadvantages to each party would be incapable of being compensated in damages in the event of his succeeding at the trial is always a significant factor in assessing where the balance of convenience lies; and if the extent of the uncompensatable disadvantage to each party would not differ widely, it may not be improper to take into account in tipping the balance the relative strength of each party’s case as revealed by the affidavit evidence adduced on the hearing of the application. This, however, should be done only where it is apparent upon the facts disclosed by evidence as to which there is no credible dispute that the strength of one party’s case is disproportionate to that of the other party. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The Plaintiff contended that damages would not provide it with an adequate remedy in the event of its succeeding at the trial, for the following reasons. Firstly, it alleged that the Defendant had participated in the 2017 tender thrown by Singapore public hospitals for the supply of Bortezomib.

</div> Previously, the Plaintiff’s exclusive licensee in Singapore – Johnson &amp; Johnson – had been the sole supplier to the public hospitals. The Defendant’s entry into this market would, according to the Plaintiff, result in a “devastating decimation of the Plaintiff’s (or its exclusive licensee’s) market share for Bortezomib”: the Defendant “would be able to supply the Defendant’s Product at a significantly lower price than the Plaintiff’s (or its exclusive licensee’s) own product for Bortezomib … because the Defendant does not have to recoup the extensive research and development expenditure and marketing costs incurred by the Plaintiff and/or its exclusive licensee”.

However, it asserted that damages would be an adequate remedy for the Plaintiff if it succeeded at trial. Firstly, the Defendant pointed out that the Plaintiff’s Patents were in respect of a number of processes for the manufacture of the active ingredient Bortezomib, but the Plaintiff itself was not marketing or selling Bortezomib in Singapore. Instead, Johnson &amp; Johnson held the product licence for the drug “Velcade” which contained the active ingredient Bortezomib, and Johnson &amp; Johnson was the one marketing and selling Velcade in Singapore.

</div> Johnson &amp; Johnson was not a party to the present proceedings, and no affidavit evidence had been procured from any of its representatives. In the two affidavits filed in these proceedings, the Plaintiff had omitted to disclose the terms of its relationship with Johnson &amp; Johnson. There was also no evidence of the terms of the licensing agreement or of what losses, if any, the Plaintiff would suffer in the event of Johnson &amp; Johnson losing the contract to supply to the public hospitals. In the circumstances, and absent any other evidence from either the Plaintiff or Johnson &amp; Johnson, the Plaintiff’s “best case” could “only be limited to a cut of revenue / royalty payments from Johnson &amp; Johnson[’s] … sales”, which was a loss that was “easily quantifiable and would be adequately remedied by damages at trial”.

On my querying the Plaintiff’s counsel about the outcome of the 2017 tender, the only response I received was that there was “[n]o outcome as yet <span class="font-italic">at the time of [Yeung’s] second affidavit</span>”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, as<span class="font-italic"> </span>of<span class="font-italic"> </span>25 January 2018. No further information was provided as to whether the outcome of the 2017 tender had been made known between 25 January 2018 and 28 March 2018. This was, with respect, unfortunate. What it left me with – in so far as the issue of the contract to supply to public hospitals was concerned – was that as at 28 March 2018, the Plaintiff conceded that there was no evidence of the Defendant having supplied Bortezomib in Singapore, and the Plaintiff did not dispute the Defendant’s assertion that the contract was in any event for a defined and limited period of one year.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 As to the terms of the Plaintiff’s relationship with Johnson &amp; Johnson, the Plaintiff’s counsel replied that it would not make a difference because it was “up to [the] patentee-owner how to exploit its invention, including through licensing”, and what was important was that the “generic’s entry will slash prices and it affects the patentee too. The boat has been rocked, and you cannot calibrate [the] price to its original point”. Plaintiff’s counsel cited the four cases in the Plaintiff’s supplementary bundle as authorities in which interim injunctions were granted on the basis that the generic’s entry would slash prices and cause unpredictable and incalculable damage. Further, he contended that I should hold it against the Defendant that it had failed to take steps under s 78 of the PA to obtain a declaration of non-infringement before registering its therapeutic product.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I will address first the Plaintiff’s reliance on the cases in its supplementary bundle of authorities.

In each case, it was only after a careful analysis of the evidence available that the court concluded that damages would be an inadequate remedy for the claimants in the event of their success at trial, and that the balance of convenience favoured the grant of an interlocutory injunction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In <span class="font-italic">Leo Pharma A/S </span><span class="font-italic">and Another v Sandoz Ltd</span> [2008] EWCA Civ 850,

</div> for example, the claimant-patentee Leo owned the patent for the monohydrate of a vitamin D analogue called calcipotriol. Leo was itself selling the patented product as an ointment under the trademark Dovonex and as a combination product containing calcipotriol monohydrate with a steroid under the trademark Dovobet. Evidence was adduced to show that these products made up 45% of Leo’s turnover in the UK. Evidence was also adduced to show that the defendant Sandoz – a “substantial player in the generic pharmaceutical market” with “considerable marketing powers” – had already launched a generic calcipotriol cream, and that whilst the total sales figure for Sandoz’s product over a four-month period was relatively modest, this was not surprising because Sandoz had launched its product on an unusually small scale for a generic company and had been selling at a price which was of the order of Leo’s price. The first-instance judge concluded, after reviewing the evidence, that Leo could not be entirely compensated in damages and granted it an interlocutory injunction against Sandoz. In particular, Leo’s evidence showed that in effect 70% of the market for this cream could be open to generic competition because 70% was for prescriptions use in the generic name rather than in Leo’s trademark. Neither the first-instance judge nor the English Court of Appeal had any difficulty in accepting Leo’s evidence that a competitor such as Sandoz would want to get that 70% of the market and that the only way it could do so was to market at a price less than Leo’s (at [11]). Leo’s evidence was that Leo could not be clear as to what it would do once Sandoz cut its price: there would be instead “a great field of speculation” (at [16]). There were also “further heads of uncertain damages” in this case, such as the effect on the price of Leo’s products in Spain (at [17]). In all, the Court of Appeal held that the exercise of discretion by the first-instance judge revealed “[no] error of principle” in the assessment of the evidence (at [25] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Jacob LJ), and “was entirely justified <span class="font-italic">on the material before him</span>” [emphasis added] (at [27] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Mummery LJ). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 <span class="font-italic">SmithKline Beecham Plc v Generics UK Ltd </span>[2001] EWHC 563 (Pat)

</div> again featured Smithkline Beecham’s UK patent for the particular form of paroxetine hydrochloride sold in hemihydrate form under the trademark “Seroxat”. The claimants were Smithkline Beecham Plc and GlaxoSmithKline (UK) Limited (collectively, “SB”), who were the proprietor and the exclusive licensee of the patent respectively. They sought an interlocutory injunction to restrain the defendants Apotex Europe Limited (“Apotex”) from making and selling hydrochloride anhydrate. The injunction was granted by the first-instance judge. On appeal, Apotex contended that any infringement, even if established at trial, would result in no unquantifiable loss. The Court of Appeal examined the evidence before it in considering the issue of adequacy of damages. Aldous LJ (with whom Carnwath LJ and Sir Christopher Staughton agreed) noted, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that in addition to Apotex, there were three other companies with stocks of generic paroxetine hydrochloride which were already packaged, licensed and ready for immediate sale and distribution (at [36]). Aldous LJ also observed that Apotex accepted that if they or any other generic company entered the market, SB would not only lose substantial sales, but the price would also “collapse”, and SB’s prices would be “severely eroded” (at [32], citing the decision of the first-instance judge). Where parties differed was on the question of whether SB had sufficient market power to reinstate prices at the existing levels (at [37]). Considering the conflicting evidence produced by the parties on this, Aldous LJ held that the first-instance judge was entitled to conclude that damages would not be an adequate remedy for either SB or Apotex because there was “no clear case to conclude that it would be easier to assess the damages due to SB if no injunction was granted than it would be to assess the damages to Apotex under the cross-undertaking of damages if an injunction was wrongly granted” (at [38]). Finally, Aldous LJ also found that having found damages to be an inadequate remedy for both SB and Apotex, the first-instance judge was entitled to find that Apotex knew at least a year before the proceedings that SB would likely seek to injunct the sale of their product – this was a case where “Apotex walked into the situation that they find themselves in with their eyes open to the risk that they were taking” (at [39]–[40]).

</div> the High Court of Delhi went through a similar process of examining the evidence adduced before deciding that an interim injunction against the defendant Glenmark Pharmaceuticals (“Glenmark”) would remove the possibility of irreparable harm to the claimant-patentee Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme (“MSD”) as well as maintain the public interest involved. The court found it relevant first of all that the evidence showed a “strong case of infringement” and that it was especially in such cases that courts should be mindful of the interest in enforcing the Indian Patents Act, 1970 (at [85]). The court noted that the price differential between MSD’s drug and Glenmark’s infringing drug was 30%, a significant portion of which was due to the customs duty that MSD had to pay. On the other hand, whilst there was a well-established principle in Indian jurisprudence that the courts must consider the public interest in ensuring access to drugs, in this case the price difference between MSD’s and Glenmark’s commercial products was not so startling as to compel the court to infer that allowing Glenmark to sell its drug at depressed prices would result in increased public access to the drug (at [82]). The court considered the offer made by MSD to compensate Glenmark for loss of earnings if MSD’s suit for infringement of its patent were to be dismissed, and concluded that such an undertaking sufficed to ensure not only that Glenmark would (if successful) be able to return to the market without any handicap, but also compensate it at market value for the period for which it was excluded (at [86]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I have gone through the four cases raised by the Plaintiff in some detail in order to demonstrate that in all these cases, the court’s decision to issue or uphold an interlocutory injunction against the defendant-generic in each case was based on a careful review of the evidence adduced. None of these cases establishes a general proposition of law that in every pharmaceutical case where a patentee is pitted against a generic, the damage suffered by the patentee if denied an injunction pending trial will <span class="font-italic">inevitably and automatically</span> be found to be “incalculable”. The position is perhaps best put in <span class="font-italic">Cephalon</span><span class="font-italic">, Inc and Others v Orchid Europe Limited and Generics (UK) Ltd (t/a Mylan)</span> [2010] EWHC 2945 (Pat) (“<span class="font-italic">Cephalon</span>”) (an authority brought to my attention by the Defendant’s counsel during the hearing) by Floyd J, who stated (at [49]–[51]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There have been a number of cases where interim injunctions have been granted in cases concerning patented pharmaceuticals and generic competition where the court has concluded that the loss likely to be suffered by the patentee would be larger and more unquantifiable than the loss to the generic. Mr Carr [counsel for the claimants] reminded me of <span class="font-italic">SKB v Generics</span> (23rd October 2011) [(<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the case referred to above)] at 11 lines 7-10; <span class="font-italic">SKB v </span><span class="font-italic">Apotex</span> [2003] FSR 30 and<span class="font-italic"> Abbott v Ranbaxy </span>(19th November 2004). In each case a significant factor has been the fact that the generic competition was likely to produce price cutting, and that restoring those prices to the full monopoly level after success at trial could cause the patentee to lose goodwill.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A second theme which has emerged from the cases is that a factor in the balance of convenience may be that the generic company which is threatening to come on the market has taken no steps to “clear the way”. Given that the launch of a pharmaceutical cannot be achieved overnight, and requires the obtaining of marketing approval after the submission of data, it has been said that a generic company which does not also take steps to ensure that it is not arguably infringing the relevant patents should not be able to rely subsequently on the resulting uncertainty. This was said in <span class="font-italic">SKB v </span><span class="font-italic">Apotex</span> (above) at [65]–[68] and on appeal by Aldous LJ at [2003] FSR 31 at [38]–[40]. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">These are certainly considerations which, depending on the evidence, may be material in particular cases.

As I have also noted (at [32] above), when queried at the hearing on 28 March 2018, the Plaintiff admitted that this was not a case where it was relying on actual infringing acts by the Defendant. In any event, even assuming that the Defendant had been awarded the 2017 public hospitals’ tender, the Plaintiff did not dispute the Defendant’s assertion that any such contract would only be for the specific, limited period of one year.

Critically, however, there was no evidence adduced before me which could have provided some basis for making such a supposition. There was no basis for me to accept the sweeping argument that because the courts in the above four cases had accepted that the generic’s entry in those cases meant an irretrievable downward price spiral, so too the present Plaintiff must be assumed to face an irreversible price crash and correspondingly, incalculable damage. As the Defendant rightly pointed out, there have after all been other cases where the courts have declined to find that a generic’s entry presaged an irreversible price crash. In <span class="font-italic">Cephalon</span>, for example, Floyd J found the evidence before him insufficient to show “irreversible price erosion” (at [62]). He noted in particular that: (a) the claimants Cephalon, Inc (“Cephalon”) had previously dealt with competition from parallel importers of modafinil by giving discounts to pharmacy chains; (b) the evidence showed Cephalon to be able to raise their prices in relation to modafinil after lowering them temporarily; and (c) there was no suggestion that Cephalon experienced any significant loss of goodwill when they did so (at [61]–[66]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Further, in assessing the impact of any entry by the Defendant into the local market, it must be remembered that the present Plaintiff is not the party selling Velcade in Singapore, nor is it the manufacturer of Velcade.

</div> It was on this basis that the Defendant’s Baey Yam Khuang had asserted in his affidavit dated 12 January 2018 (“Baey’s affidavit”) that any loss suffered by the Plaintiff if it succeeded at trial must at best be “limited to a cut of revenue / royalty payments from Johnson &amp; Johnson[’s] … sales”.

</div> In fact, in one of the cases cited by the Plaintiff, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, <span class="font-italic">Apotex</span>, Aldous LJ had astutely observed that “[i]n cases where the patentee is not a manufacturer, the patentee will normally only be able to establish that he has lost that which he would have charged for use of his invention, namely a reasonable royalty” (at [8]). This did <span class="font-italic">not</span> mean that infringement might not cause a patentee loss exceeding a reasonable royalty: the extent of recovery in each case would “depend upon the facts and the normal considerations of causation and remoteness” (also at [8]). In this case, it was telling that not only had Yeung’s first affidavit been silent on the terms of the Plaintiff’s agreement with Johnson &amp; Johnson, but Yeung’s second affidavit – which was filed in response to Baey’s affidavit – also made no response to the critical assertion by Baey that the Plaintiff’s loss was at best limited to a cut of the revenue or royalty payments from Johnson &amp; Johnson’s sales. All that Yeung’s second affidavit did was to repeat in vague and general terms that “damages would not be an adequate remedy for the Plaintiff”.

For the reasons set out above, I found that the Plaintiff had failed to show that damages would be an inadequate remedy for it in the event it succeeded at trial. On the evidence available, the Defendant was not unjustified in saying that the Plaintiff’s damage in the event of success at trial was limited to a reasonable royalty. I therefore concluded that even if the Plaintiff were able to show a “serious question to be tried”, damages would be an adequate remedy for it if it succeeded at trial after being denied an interlocutory injunction.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 As I found that damages would be an adequate remedy for the Plaintiff in the event it succeeded at trial, I did not find it necessary to consider the Plaintiff’s argument that the Defendant should have acted first to obtain a declaration of non-infringement under s 78 of the PA before registering its therapeutic product.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The Defendant had in its affidavit put on record its willingness to pay any damages awarded to the Plaintiff at trial, and also exhibited documentary evidence of its financial ability to do so.

</div> as these were not put forward in the course of the substantive hearing on 28 March 2018. In any event, I did not think these further submissions and authorities would have assisted the Plaintiff at the substantive hearing. It did not appear to me that the Defendant disputed the possibility – in principle – of an injunction being issued to prevent an <span class="font-italic">anticipated</span> (as opposed to an <span class="font-italic">actual</span>) infringement. The principles by which it is decided whether an injunction should be granted or refused are not different merely because relief is sought <span class="font-italic">quia</span><span class="font-italic"> timet</span>. As noted in I C F Spry, <span class="font-italic">The Principles of Equitable Remedies</span>: <span class="font-italic">Specific Performance, Injunctions, Rectification and Equitable Damages </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 9th Ed, 2014) (at p 389): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [t]he equitable remedy of injunctions has been moulded to fit many purposes, and various classifications have been developed, according to the particular distinctions that happen to be in question. It is important to note that precisely the same general principles are applied by court of equity whatever the nature of the particular injunction that is sought may be. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In other words, the Plaintiff still had to be able to show, on its summons for interlocutory injunction, that there was a “serious question to be tried” and that damages would not be an adequate remedy for it in the event it succeeded at trial. Indeed, it appeared to me that the Plaintiff accepted this since it alluded to a <span class="font-italic">quia</span><span class="font-italic"> timet</span> injunction being available to protect a plaintiff from a feared or threatened infringement “so long as a valid cause of action exists”. I would also add that the authorities are clear that a plaintiff who seeks a <span class="font-italic">quia</span><span class="font-italic"> timet</span> injunction “takes upon himself the burden of proving that it is reasonably certain that what the defendant is threatening and intending to do will cause imminent and substantial damage to the plaintiff”: see <span class="font-italic">Royal Insurance Co Ltd v Midland Insurance Co Ltd</span> (1908) 26 RPC 95 at 97 <span class="font-italic">per </span>Cozens-Hardy MR.
