</div> Despite the best arguments made by counsel, I was of the view that the proper interpretation was that there only need be common intention to cause the criminal act (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, some form of grievous hurt), and not the specific injury inflicted. However, I concluded that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive as inappropriate weight was placed on certain factors, and accordingly reduced the sentence imposed to seven months’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">4 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The Appellant and the co-accused were involved in an altercation with the victim, after the victim had sounded his lorry’s horn when the Appellant and co-accused had dashed across a road.

Thereafter, a fight ensued, with the Appellant and co-accused hitting the victim on his face and body. After he had fallen to the ground, they stepped on and kicked his chest, and also kicked his back. In the midst of this, the victim’s right middle finger was fractured. A passing CISCO officer intervened. The fight lasted for a total of about two minutes. Aside from the fracture, the victim was found to have bruising over his face and shoulder and suffered pain.</span>

Where the primary offence, such as s 300(c) of the Penal Code, requires the infliction of a particular type or nature of injury, it would follow that a secondary offender must also have the common intention to cause such injury.

More significantly, it has also not been followed in Hong Kong, which shares largely the same body of criminal law as the United Kingdom. The Appellant’s reading of the United Kingdom case, that it abolished joint criminal enterprise in English law, would effectively render s 34 of the Penal Code otiose.

</div><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> An assault by a group as against that by an individual merits a heavier sentence, all other things being equal, as such an assault entails a greater degree of culpability: the victim is outnumbered, and generally overwhelmed. It may also entail greater harm, through the sheer scale of the injuries caused. An assault by a group of persons also potentially endangers public order: mob assaults have a tendency to go out of hand, and lead to other dangers. But there must be consideration of whether the assault is indeed a group assault. An attack by five would be by a group, but will also probably constitute other, more serious, offences. An assault by four would be as well. That by three, as well, though that may be on the boundaries of the meaning of the word ‘group’. An assault by two though is on the very edges of such meaning. It is important then to unbundle the meaning and objective of the term “group assault”, and to ensure that consideration is given to the fact that the situation is perhaps different from an assault by a larger number, as it would be as regards a solo assault. It is in between, and I was of the view that the sentencing should be undertaken with that in mind.  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 I note that similar problems exist in respect of other labels commonly used in submissions, such as “premeditation” and “abuse of position”. Care must be taken not to be carried away with loose labelling.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 As for the duration of the assault, a two-minute assault is not brief, and I had no doubt that it was a long two minutes for the victim. But this was not the sort of attack that attracts the label of viciousness. There are, unfortunately, many common instances of actual viciousness. The duration and degree of attack was not such as to push the sentence further along the scale to the extent identified by the District Judge. On the other side of the coin, I did take into account that the accused was intoxicated.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Taking all of these in mind, I was of the view that a sentence of seven months’ imprisonment was appropriate, and accordingly so ordered.  </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Aedit Abdullah  <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tang Jin Sheng and Aw Jansen (LVM Law Chambers LLC) for the appellant;<br/>Chew Xin Ying and Tan Yen Seow (Attorney General’s Chambers) for the respondent.<br/></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
