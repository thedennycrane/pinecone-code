        Lai Siu Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was a claim by Erin Brooke Mullin
                    (“the first plaintiff”) against Rosli Bin Salim (“the first
                    defendant”) and Toh Yoke Chin (“the second defendant”) for
                    the horrendous injuries that the first plaintiff sustained arising out of a
                    motor accident on 18 September 2007 involving vehicles driven by the two
                    defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The first plaintiff is an American citizen who
                    left Singapore after the accident and returned to Illinios, in the United
                    States, together with her husband Jason Elliot Mullin (“the second
                    plaintiff”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       At about 7.30am on 18 September 2007, the
                    first plaintiff was at MacDonald’s Tea Garden
                    (“MacDonald’s”) located at Queensway to buy breakfast.
                    MacDonald’s has an open car park (“the car park”) for its
                    patrons. Just then, a Honda Odyssey multipurpose vehicle with automatic
                    transmission numbered SDU 2401E (“the vehicle”) driven by the
                    first defendant turned into the car park. As the vehicle was turning into the
                    car park, a bus numbered CB 4939U (“the school bus”) driven by the
                    second defendant collided into its rear. (Hereinafter this collision will be
                    referred to as “the first accident”). Instead of braking and
                    stopping, the first defendant accelerated the vehicle. As a result, the vehicle
                    collided into the front bumper of a stationary vehicle numbered SCQ 1166Z
                    (“the second vehicle) before colliding into the right front bumper of
                    another stationery vehicle numbered SGW 8811 (“the third vehicle”)
                    as well as the first plaintiff. The left front bumper of the vehicle crushed the
                    first plaintiff’s right leg. (Hereinafter this second collision will be
                    referred to as “the second accident”). The serious injuries
                    sustained by the first plaintiff necessitated her right leg being amputated
                    below the knee in consequence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Subsequently (on 6 January 2009), the first
                    defendant was charged and convicted under ss 279 and 338 respectively of the
                    Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Penal Code”) for
                    rash and negligent driving and causing grievous hurt. The first defendant
                    pleaded guilty to the charges, was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment of
                    four months and one month each for the two offences (the sentences to run
                    consecutively) and was also disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles
                    for four years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The first plaintiff sued for damages arising out
                    of the second accident while the second plaintiff sued for the post-traumatic
                    stress disorder he claimed he suffered as a result of his wife’s injuries.
                    The plaintiffs relied on the first defendant’s conviction
                        in <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> as evidence of the
                    latter’s negligence pursuant to s 45A of the Evidence Act
                    (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“The Evidence
                Act”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Initially, the first defendant denied the
                    plaintiffs’ claims. The first defendant pleaded that he lost control and
                    panicked after the first accident, causing him to step on the accelerator
                    instead of on the brake and to collide into the second and third vehicles
                    consequentially. He admitted he pleaded guilty to and was convicted of the
                    criminal charges in <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>
                above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In his defence, the second defendant alleged
                    that the vehicle had encroached into the path of the school bus, causing the
                    second defendant to collide into the vehicle. The second defendant denied he was
                    liable for the second accident contending that those subsequent collisions were
                    independent acts of the first defendant and separate from the first
                    accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In their respective defences, the defendants did
                    not allege any contributory negligence on the part of the first plaintiff for
                    the second accident. However, the second defendant alleged that it was the first
                    defendant’s negligence that caused or contributed to the second
                    accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In March 2011, the first defendant consented to
                    interlocutory judgment being entered against him for the plaintiffs’
                    claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The first defendant had initially issued a
                    Third Party Notice against the second defendant after the commencement of these
                    proceedings. The Third Party Notice was subsequently discontinued with leave of
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In May 2011, the first defendant issued a
                    Notice of Indemnity and Contribution against the second defendant pursuant to
                    O 16 r 8(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev
                    Ed) for the issue of the proportion of liability between the two defendants to
                    be determined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In September 2011, the two defendants agreed
                    to the quantum of the second plaintiff’s claim being fixed at $10,000
                    subject to the issue of liability being determined between them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The trial before this court was only to
                    determine the extent of liability between the two defendants for the second
                    accident. Parties agreed to dispense with the first plaintiff’s presence
                    at the trial. Both defendants testified for their respective defences. Although
                    the first defendant’s wife was the front seat passenger of the vehicle at
                    the material time, she did not testify even though the first defendant made
                    repeated reference to her reactions prior to the second accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The first defendant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief
                    (“AEIC”), the first defendant deposed that on that fateful
                    morning, he and his wife left home at about 6.45am for work. The first defendant
                    was then a driver for Mitsui Chemicals Asia Pacific Ltd (“Mitsui”)
                    which had leased the vehicle. The first defendant was allowed to drive the
                    vehicle home if he worked late into the night and/or had to be at work early in
                    the morning. The couple intended to have breakfast at MacDonald’s before
                    the first defendant dropped his wife off at her office at Robertson
                Quay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     To get to MacDonald’s from his home at
                    Woodlands, the first defendant used (i) the Seletar Expressway,
                    (ii) the Bukit Timah Expressway and (iii) the Pan Island Expressway in
                    that order. He deposed he exited from the Pan Island Expressway at Eng Neo
                    Avenue and travelled down Farrer Road and Queensway. Traffic that morning along
                    the first defendant’s route was moderate and the weather was fine with
                    good visibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As the first defendant approached
                    MacDonald’s, his vehicle which was then in the left lane, was travelling
                    at approximately 50 kph. The first defendant noticed the school bus in front of
                    him moving “a bit slow” (N/E 31) and decided to overtake it when
                    approaching MacDonald’s. He shifted the vehicle to the centre lane and
                    when he was approximately 3 to 4 car lengths in front of the school bus and
                    about 2 lamp posts away from the car park entrance, he signalled left, increased
                    his speed slightly, overtook the school bus and eased the vehicle back into the
                    left lane, at the same time slowing down to enter the car park.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     As the vehicle was turning into the car park
                    entrance, the first defendant saw that another vehicle was coming out. He
                    therefore braked and slowed down further to allow the exiting vehicle to pass
                    the vehicle. As he resumed turning into the car park and was moving his foot
                    from the brake onto the accelerator, he felt a sudden and violent impact at the
                    rear of the vehicle when the school bus collided into the vehicle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The first defendant claimed that upon that
                    sudden impact, the windscreen in front of him turned completely white and he
                    could not see anything. He lost control of the vehicle and surged forward into
                    the car park. It was only when his wife screamed (in Malay) “why so
                    fast” that his vision cleared and the first defendant realised that the
                    vehicle was headed towards MacDonald’s. To prevent a collision, the first
                    defendant turned the vehicle sharply in the direction of the car
                park.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In his state of shock, the first defendant
                    deposed he was unable to control the speed of the vehicle. His foot was still on
                    the accelerator and even though his mind told him to brake, he was unable to do
                    so as he could not lift his foot off the accelerator. Consequently, the vehicle
                    continued to surge forward and it hit the second and third cars in
                    succession.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The first defendant’s wife screamed
                    again (in Malay) “there is a person”. The first plaintiff had
                    suddenly appeared in front of the third vehicle with a dog. The first defendant
                    claimed he swerved to avoid hitting her but it was too late. She was crushed by
                    the left front bumper of the vehicle and by the right front bumper of the third
                    vehicle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     After colliding into the first plaintiff, the
                    first defendant turned the vehicle sharply to his right. The vehicle climbed a
                    slight slope, crossed a large drain and only then came to a stop on a grass
                    verge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The first defendant blamed the second
                    defendant for the second accident contending that it all started with the first
                    accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Having set out the first defendant’s
                    version of events, I turn now to consider the testimony that was adduced from
                    him by counsel for the second defendant during cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Questioned by counsel for the second
                    defendant, the first defendant estimated that he was about 100m from
                    MacDonald’s when he first saw the school bus. Notwithstanding the short
                    distance, he said he overtook the school bus because he thought it was safe to
                    do so. He accelerated after shifting the vehicle into the second lane, overtook
                    the school bus and then changed back to the left lane. By this time, the vehicle
                    was 20m away from the entrance to MacDonald’s. When overtaking the school
                    bus, the vehicle’s speed was more than 50kph and he was going faster than
                    the school bus. However, after he moved back to the left lane, the first
                    defendant testified he slowed down. Indeed he was dead slow (N/E 18) at the time
                    of the impact.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     When his attention was drawn to photographs
                    showing tyre marks made on Queensway by the school bus indicating it had braked
                    and braked hard just before the latter collided into the rear of the vehicle,
                    the first defendant claimed he did not hear any screeching of tyres or horning
                    before the collision. Questioned where he had placed his foot while turning into
                    the car park, the first defendant claimed it was on the brake and not on the
                    accelerator until after the car exiting the car park had passed him. He conceded
                    stepping on the accelerator was the wrong move but maintained he was unable to
                    take his foot off therefrom.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The first defendant’s attention was
                    drawn to his police report which he lodged a few hours after the accident.
                    Questioned why he had not mentioned he had a blackout and/or saw white and he
                    could not remove his foot from the accelerator, the first defendant claimed he
                    had mentioned those matters to the police officer who recorded his statement.
                    Although he was literate in English, it did not occur to the first defendant to
                    inform the police officer in question that those significant facts had been
                    omitted from his statement. He denied counsel’s suggestion it was due to
                    the fact they never happened. Counsel also noted that the statement of facts
                    read in court (to which he admitted without qualification) for the criminal
                    charges preferred against the first defendant in <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> also did not mention any of the three facts. The first
                    defendant claimed he did not read that document.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The first defendant denied he was driving at
                    an excessive speed when he overtook the school bus and that he suddenly
                    encroached onto the path of the latter after overtaking in order to make a left
                    turn into the car park. However, the first defendant conceded that if he had not
                    overtaken the school bus, there would not have been any accident at
                all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     When the court as well as counsel for the
                    second defendant inquired why his wife was not called as his witness, the first
                    defendant’s absurd explanation was that the investigating officer had
                    informed him she was not eligible to be a witness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Questioned by the court, his counsel explained
                    that he felt the testimony of the first defendant’s wife would not have
                    had much value/weight under s 124 of the Evidence Act. Instead, counsel
                    produced a report from New Zealand vehicle accident analysts Marks and
                    Associates Limited dated 3 October 2008 (“the expert’s
                    report”) which opined that the accident happened due to
                    “unintended acceleration” on the part of the first defendant who
                    actually intended to brake. Notwithstanding that the expert from Marks and
                    Associates Limited who authored the report (Christopher Marks) did not testify,
                    the first defendant’s submissions referred to the report <em>in extenso</em> arguing that the inclusion of the report in
                    the agreed bundles before the court meant that it formed part of the evidence
                    before this court. I shall return to these submissions later in my
                    findings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The second defendant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The second defendant had been driving the
                    school bus since 2000. In his AEIC, the second defendant deposed that on the
                    morning of 18 September 2007, he was going round picking up French students
                    from their homes and sending them to their school at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 where
                    classes commenced at 8.15am. He had been doing this routine for over a year
                    before the accident. When he was at Queensway at about 7.30am, he was on his way
                    to pick up a student from Holland Road.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Traffic was heavy and the second defendant was
                    travelling in the left lane. Suddenly and without warning, the vehicle that was
                    then in the middle lane made a sudden left turn, cutting across his path to try
                    to enter the car park on the left. Although he braked immediately and was able
                    to slow down the school bus substantially, the second defendant was unable to
                    stop in time and the school bus hit the rear of the vehicle. The second
                    defendant then pulled up at the road side to look for the vehicle. He walked to
                    the car park and was informed by bystanders that the vehicle had been involved
                    in the second accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The second defendant alleged that the first
                    accident was due to the first defendant’s act of cutting across his path
                    without warning, and the impact of that collision would not have propelled the
                    vehicle across the substantial distance where it caused the second
                    accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     During cross-examination by counsel for the
                    first defendant, the second defendant testified that there were no cars in front
                    of the school bus as he approached MacDonald’s. The road leading to
                    MacDonald’s (after the exit from the Farrer Road tunnel) initially sloped
                    up and then sloped down once past an Esso petrol station (“the Esso
                    station”) situated there. His own speed was about 40kph going up the
                    slope and about 50kph coming down. The second defendant testified that when he
                    first saw the vehicle alongside the school bus in the middle lane, it was
                    travelling at a faster speed than the school bus. He indicated on one of the
                    photographs (at 1AB19) that the vehicle was very close to the entrance of
                    the car park when the first defendant cut across his path. The second defendant
                    could not recall sounding his horn then but denied he was travelling closer to
                    the maximum speed of 60kph at the time because he was rushing to pick up the
                    remaining 10 (of 30 students) to get them to school by 8.15am. In answer to the
                    court’s subsequent inquiry, the second defendant testified he had to make
                    three more pickups that morning before heading to Ang Mo Kio Avenue
                3.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     As in the case of the first defendant, the
                    second defendant’s police report lodged on the day of the accident omitted
                    certain facts. In his case, there was no mention that the vehicle had cut across
                    his path or that he had applied his brakes hard. His police report merely stated
                    that the vehicle then in front of him made a sudden stop, not that it cut into
                    his path. The second defendant claimed he had given the police officer recording
                    his statement the two missing statements but they were not included in his
                    police report. (The second defendant does not read or write English although he
                    can speak simple English).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Questioned by the court, the second defendant
                    explained that the capacity of the school bus was/is 37 passengers. Because of
                    its size, he said the bus could not go fast and he would only drive it
                    at 60kph if and when he was using the expressways.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The second defendant’s testimony showed
                    he had a poor appreciation of distances and time based on the photographs
                    produced in court, particularly as to when he first sighted the vehicle and
                    where the vehicle cut into his path. As the time and distances involved could be
                    factors relevant to the court’s determination of liability between the two
                    defendants, I directed counsel for the parties (and for the plaintiffs) to visit
                    the accident scene to take measurements of certain distances. This was done
                    before trial resumed on the second day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Following the site inspection, parties advised
                    the court of the following distances:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a>(a)     between the exit from the Farrer
                        Road tunnel and the car park entrance it was 570m;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a>(b)     between the Farrer Road tunnel exit
                        and the Esso station (top of the slope) it was 280m;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_c"></a>(c)     between the Esso station and the car
                        park entrance it was 290m; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_d"></a>(d)     where the first defendant cut across the second
                        defendant’s path it was 36.2m before the car park’s entrance
                        alongside the car park’s lot no. 13.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Travelling
                    at 50kph, the court calculated that the second defendant would have taken
                    just 2.6 seconds to travel the distance from the time he first saw the first
                    defendant cutting across his path (which the second defendant estimated was two
                    car lengths away) until the collision at the entrance of the car park where the
                    vehicle had stopped after barely turning in. The second defendant did not recall
                    seeing another vehicle at the entrance of the car park when the vehicle was
                    turning in.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The damage to the school bus from the
                    collision was to its front left portion. The second defendant explained it was
                    because the vehicle was straightening out after it cut across his path and he
                    hit the centre and right rear sides of the vehicle at an angle. He disagreed
                    with counsel for the first defendant that the substantial damage to the vehicle
                    (which included breakage of the rear windscreen) was reflective of the high
                    speed at which he was travelling at the time of the impact. He pointed out that
                    the heavy impact was due to the size of the school bus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I should point out that the first defendant
                    was recalled to the witness stand after the second defendant had testified and
                    after parties had visited the accident scene and taken measurements. When he was
                    recalled, the first defendant’s testimony changed materially from his
                    earlier evidence. He said:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"></a>(a)     He had actually noticed the school
                        bus when the vehicle was approaching (less than 20m from) the Esso station.
                        Just a day earlier, (in <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> and in
                        his AEIC) he had testified that he first noticed the school bus about 100m
                        from the entrance to the car park.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_b"></a>(b)     He had started overtaking the school bus somewhere just
                        before the Esso station instead of less than 100m away from the car park
                        entrance.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_c"></a>(c)     He
                        had completed overtaking the school bus and filtered into the left lane just
                        after the overhead bridge and bus-stop shown in the photograph
                        at 4AB10.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In order to determine which of the two
                    defendants (or both) were liable for the second accident and the
                    plaintiffs’ claim, the court has to decide:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_a"></a>(a)     Was the first accident caused by the
                        first or the second defendant?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_b"></a>(b)     Even if the first accident was caused or partly caused by
                        the second defendant, was there a break in the chain of causation between
                        the first and the second accidents under the <em>novus
                            </em><em>actus </em><em>interveniens</em> principle such that the first and not the
                        second defendant is liable for the plaintiffs’
                claim?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Before I set out my findings, it would be
                    appropriate at this juncture to consider the closing submissions tendered by the
                    parties. Earlier at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>, I had alluded
                    to two of the first defendant’s submissions. I shall now return to those
                    two submissions and will also address the first defendant’s other
                    submissions where necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The first defendant’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The first defendant accused the second
                    defendant of embellishing his testimony by alleging that the first defendant cut
                    into his path. The first defendant made much of the fact that there was no
                    mention of this allegation in the second defendant’s police report which
                    was a contemporaneous document and likely to be more accurate. As it was a
                    critical fact and the trigger point for the second accident, the second
                    defendant would not have failed to mention it in his police report if it had
                    been true. To make matters worse, the second defendant had then disavowed his
                    police report by contending he did not understand the contents. Neither was this
                    allegation pleaded in the second defendant’s defence which only alleged
                    that the first defendant suddenly encroached into his lane. The first defendant
                    argued that the allegation was clearly an afterthought and contended that the
                    second defendant was an unreliable witness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The submissions (in para 58) went on to
                    assert that the lane change and overtaking by the first defendant were totally
                    uneventful as they happen all the time in multi-lane traffic. It was further
                    contended that the first defendant was already safely in the left lane as he was
                    turning into the car park entrance when the school bus of the second defendant
                    collided into the rear of the vehicle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The first defendant further relied on the
                    extensive damage to the vehicle and to the school bus as corroborative evidence
                    of the first defendant’s version of how the first accident took place, but
                    not the second defendant’s version.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     It was further contended by the first
                    defendant that the second defendant was in a hurry that morning to pick up 10
                    more students from three condominiums in the Holland Road area. He only had 45
                    minutes in peak hour traffic to get to Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 by 8.15am via Farrer
                    Road, Lornie Road, Braddell Road and the Central Expressway The first defendant
                    submitted that the second defendant must have been speeding when going down the
                    slope after the Esso station, since there were skid marks appearing in
                    photographs of Queensway near the scene of the first accident which could only
                    have been made by the school bus (as the court pointed out).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The first defendant’s submissions went
                    further to put the blame for the first and second accidents squarely on the
                    second defendant, contending it was his negligence that set off the chain of
                    events leading to the second accident, relying on <em>Teng
                        </em><em>Ching Sin and Anor v Leong Kwong
                        Sun</em> [1994] 1 SLR(R) 382. It was submitted that the
                    second defendant was inattentive and hence, failed to apply his brakes in time.
                    Further, he should have known that vehicles would enter and leave the car park,
                    having plied the same route for over a year.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Citing <em>SBS Transit Ltd v
                        Stafford Rosemary Anne Jane</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 211
                    and <em>Mohammad Kassim Bin Sapil v Quah Lai Tee &amp;
                        Others</em> [2003] SGHC 118 as well as the
                    expert’s report in <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>, the
                    first defendant submitted that but for the first accident, the first defendant
                    would not have caused the second accident. Consequently, the second
                    defendant’s case based on <em>novus </em><em>actus </em><em>interveniens</em> was
                        untenable<em>.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The first defendant argued that the second
                    defendant had relied on the first defendant’s criminal convictions
                        in <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>. As the expert’s report
                    was part of the documents tendered in those proceedings in relation to the first
                    defendant’s mitigation plea and sentence, the expert’s report must
                    be treated as having been admitted as evidence of its truth. There was also no
                    rebuttal evidence from the second defendant. Therefore, it was no longer
                    possible for the second defendant to question the truth of the expert’s
                    report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     For the reasons set out in my findings
                        at <a href="#p1_66">[66]</a>, I do not accept the above
                    submission. The expert’s report was not admitted as part of the evidence
                    before this court. Consequently, the first defendant’s submissions based
                    on the document are rejected. The first defendant’s reliance on
                    s 45A(5) of the Evidence Act in this regard is also misconceived. The first
                    defendant’s contention that he can still call the expert to testify in
                    relation to the expert’s report (because the trial is not yet over) is
                    incorrect; the principles in <em>Ladd v
                    Marshall</em> [1954] 1 WLR 1489 would certainly preclude
                    the calling of such expert testimony after this trial. The first defendant
                    should not be given a second bite of the cherry to the irreparable prejudice of
                    the second defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The second defendant’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     I turn now to the submissions of the second
                    defendant. He submitted that the first defendant’s evidence was wildly
                    inconsistent and in some parts logically impossible. In this regard, I had
                    earlier (at <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a>) noted the different
                    versions given by the first defendant of how the first accident happened, before
                    and after he had visited the accident scene.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Counsel for the second defendant argued that
                    his client’s version of how the first accident happened was wholly
                    consistent with a sudden cutting into his lane by the first defendant/vehicle.
                    As for the omission of this fact in the police report of the second defendant,
                    it was submitted that the second defendant had given an adequate explanation for
                    the failure of the police officer who recorded his statement to do so –
                    unlike the first defendant, the second defendant does not read but speaks only
                    basic English. The said police officer had spoken to the second defendant in a
                    mixture of English and Mandarin. Therefore, it was quite believable that the
                    communication between them was less than perfect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The second defendant submitted that the first
                    defendant’s plea of guilt and conviction in <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>, and unqualified admission to the statement of facts
                    presented by the prosecution were clear evidence of his encroachment into the
                    lane of the second defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     It was also submitted that the court should
                    draw an adverse inference against the first defendant for his failure to call
                    his wife to testify. Even if less weight would be accorded to her testimony as
                    she was not an independent witness, she was a material witness and would have
                    been able to corroborate the first defendant’s version of events. (The
                    first defendant had countered this submission by contending that a similar
                    adverse inference should be drawn against the second defendant for failing to
                    call his bus conductress to testify).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     It was pointed out that the first defendant
                    had never patronised that MacDonald’s outlet (N/E113) previously.
                    Consequently, his unfamiliarity with the outlet lent credence to the possibility
                    that he did not know where the car park entrance was when he overtook the school
                    bus. He realized after overtaking that the car park entrance was almost upon
                    him. He tried to make a sudden left turn into the car park, and in doing so, he
                    cut into the path of the second defendant causing the latter to brake the school
                    bus hard albeit too late to avoid the collision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Consequently, the second defendant contended
                    he should not be held liable for the first accident. Even if the second
                    defendant was to some extent contributorily negligent for the first accident,
                    there was no casual link between the first and the second accidents (both in
                    fact and in law) as to hold the second defendant liable for the second accident.
                    He blamed the first defendant for causing both accidents.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The findings </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was the first accident caused by the first or the second
                defendant?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Having considered the oral and documentary
                    evidence presented in court, I am of the view that the first defendant was
                    wholly to blame for the first accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Notwithstanding the robust submissions put
                    forth by his counsel that his client’s testimony should be preferred to
                    that of the second defendant, I find that the first defendant’s version of
                    how the first accident took place to be less credible than the second
                    defendant’s version and inconsistent with the site measurements taken at
                    the scene of the first accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The first defendant had contended initially
                    that he first saw the school bus when he was about 100m from the car park
                    entrance. He had also admitted he was driving at an excessive speed (N/E30) when
                    he overtook the school bus. I therefore do not believe the first defendant when
                    he said he was travelling at 50kph for about a minute when he was behind
                    the school bus. At that speed, he would have covered 13.9m every second or 834m
                    per minute. In 30 seconds, the vehicle would have travelled 417m. The first
                    defendant would have long passed the car park entrance before he overtook the
                    school bus if his evidence was true. He was going well beyond 50kph. In this
                    connection, the first defendant’s submission that the second defendant was
                    speeding undermined his own case. If the school bus was travelling at or beyond
                    50kph, it must mean that the first defendant was travelling at an even greater
                    speed in order to overtake the school bus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     When he filtered into the left lane from the
                    middle lane, the first defendant’s original testimony was that there was
                    only 20m to the car park entrance. The first defendant was also not familiar
                    with that MacDonald’s outlet. He had obviously cut sharply into the left
                    lane in front of the school bus when he realised he was about to overshoot the
                    car park entrance. He must also have braked hard to turn left into the car park
                    entrance. As the second defendant was driving a heavy bus with 20 students, he
                    did not have sufficient reaction time or distance to stop even after braking
                    hard. There was no vehicle leaving the car park when the vehicle turned sharply
                    left into the car park. That was a fabrication on the part of the first
                    defendant for his stopping at the entrance. He stopped because he had braked
                    hard in making the turn; it was not to allow any vehicle to leave the car park.
                    He was not going dead slow when he approached the car park entrance as he
                    claimed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     It was telling that after he had visited the
                    accident scene, the first defendant changed his testimony to say he noticed the
                    school bus as the vehicle was approaching the Esso station. He went further to
                    claim that he started to overtake the school bus just before the Esso station,
                    as shown in the position marked X in the photograph at 4AB5. This belated
                    change in his testimony was clearly an afterthought. Even if his altered
                    testimony was to be believed, he would still have gone past the car park
                    entrance if he travelled at or faster than 50kph. The distance between the
                    Farrer Road tunnel exit and the car park entrance is only 570m
                        (see <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a> above). It would have
                    taken the first defendant 41 seconds to cover that distance had he stayed behind
                    the school bus for any amount of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     It was more likely than not that the first
                    defendant, driving the vehicle at more than 50kph, overtook the school bus some
                    distance after the Esso station. Given the short distance of 20m to the car park
                    entrance after his overtaking, it would have taken the vehicle no more than 1.44
                    seconds to cover that distance. The first defendant applied the brakes of the
                    vehicle hard and almost stopped because he had nearly overshot the car park
                    entrance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Upon being recalled, the first defendant
                    testified there was another vehicle (which make and model he could not recall)
                    in the middle lane in front of the vehicle that prevented him from filtering
                    back to the left lane immediately after he had overtaken the school bus before
                    the Esso station. This evidence was not in his AEIC or oral testimony on the
                    first day of trial. He suddenly remembered this crucial piece of evidence
                    (N/E106) on the second day. I disbelieve this new evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     I turn now to address the issue of whether an
                    adverse inference should be drawn against the first defendant for failing to
                    call his wife to testify. The first defendant’s closing submissions had
                    cited s 124 of the Evidence Act to explain her non-attendance in court.
                    That provision has no relevance at all. It states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>124</b>.    No person who is or
                            has been married shall be compelled to disclose any communication made
                            to him during marriage by any person to whom he is or has been married;
                            nor shall he be permitted to disclose any such communication unless the
                            person who made it or his representative in interest consents, except in
                            suits between married persons or proceedings in which one married person
                            is prosecuted for any crime committed against the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In fact the relevant section of the Evidence
                    Act is s 116(g) which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>116</b>.    The court may presume the existence of any
                            fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the

                            business, in their relation to the facts of the particular
                        case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">
<em>Illustrations</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court may presume –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(g)    that evidence which could be and is not produced
                            would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds
                        it;</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     I am of the view that an adverse inference
                    should be drawn against the first defendant for not calling his wife as his
                    witness. Unlike the second defendant who made no mention of the bus conductress
                    save when he was cross-examined, the first defendant specifically referred to
                    his wife’s reactions when he was accelerating the vehicle in the car park
                    instead of braking and stopping. It was for the court and not the first
                    defendant or his counsel to decide that the wife’s testimony would have
                    little or no probative value, after she had taken the stand. Based on
                    s 116(g) of the Evidence Act, I am of the view that had she testified, the
                    wife’s testimony would have been unfavourable to the first
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Earlier (at <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a>), I had indicated that the expert’s report would not
                    be admitted as evidence before this court as the maker Christopher Marks did not
                    testify. Contrary to the submissions of the first defendant, documents
                    incorporated in the various agreed bundles before the court were only meant to
                    dispense with formal proof. This was the basis upon which this court marked the
                    agreed bundles at the commencement of trial. The contents of the documents were
                    not admitted unless counsel indicated to the court otherwise. The fact that
                    counsel for the second defendant did not object to the inclusion of the
                    expert’s report in the agreed bundle did not mean he accepted the contents
                    of the expert’s report as true without more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The first defendant’s submissions had
                    conflated the issue of his conviction under ss 279 and 338 of the Penal Code as
                    admissions by the first defendant under s 45A of the Evidence Act with that
                    of the admission of the expert’s report by the second defendant. Just
                    because the expert’s report formed part of the documents presented in the
                    criminal proceedings against the first defendant did not mean the second
                    defendant had accepted the document’s contents. This is clear from
                    s 45A(1) of the Evidence Act which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>45A.</b> —(1) Without prejudice to
                        sections 42, 43, 44 and 45, the fact that a person has been convicted
                        or acquitted of an offence by or before any court in Singapore shall be
                        admissible in evidence for the purpose of proving, where relevant to any
                        issue in the proceedings, that he committed (or, as the case may be, did not
                        commit) that offence, whether or not he is a party to the proceedings; and
                        where he was convicted, whether he was so convicted upon a plea of guilty or
                        otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The second defendant was merely relying on the unqualified admission
                    made by the first defendant to the prosecution’s statement of facts as
                    evidence of his negligence that caused the first and second accidents. Contrary
                    to the first defendant’s submissions, the expert’s report does not
                    fall under the ambit of s 45A(5) of the Evidence Act which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where relevant, any document containing details of the information,
                        complaint, charge, agreed statement of facts or record of proceedings on
                        which the person in question is convicted shall be admissible in
                        evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     I accept that the criminal conviction of the
                    first defendant is most relevant. More significantly, the first defendant
                    admitted to the convictions in his defence. It therefore does not lie in his
                    mouth to deny his admission that he encroached into the path of the school bus
                    and to submit that this court should consider evidence to the contrary. It is
                    also a relevant factor that the second defendant was never charged for any
                    offence over the collision of the school bus with the vehicle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The first defendant’s submissions (at
                    para 213) had referred to the second defendant’s admissions of 10%
                    liability for the claims made by the second and third cars involved in the
                    second accident. The second defendant should, but was never cross-examined on
                    why he had admitted to 10% liability for those claims. Consequently, this
                    submission of the first defendant is to be disregarded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Notwithstanding the second defendant’s
                    poor estimates of distances and the minor inconsistencies in his evidence, I
                    find that he was a truthful witness who did not attempt to embellish his
                    testimony as the first defendant sought to do after visiting the accident scene.
                    After that visit, the court was able to establish that the vehicle cut into the
                    second defendant’s path at the location of car park 13 which was 36.2m
                    away from the entrance to the car park. Travelling at 40 – 50kph, the
                    school bus would have taken 3.2 or 2.6 seconds to cover the distance before the
                    collision. I note that prior to the site inspection, the second defendant had
                    indicated that the encroachment by the first defendant was some 200m away from
                    the car park entrance. I do not see this change in distances as an inconsistency
                    in the second defendant’s testimony that cast doubts on his credibility.
                    He had readily admitted his figure was an estimate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     It bears noting that the first
                    defendant’s original testimony was consistent with the second
                    defendant’s version that the former had suddenly cut into the
                    latter’s path after the vehicle overtook the school bus and the vehicle
                    then tried to make a left turn into the car park.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was there a break in the chain of causation between the first and the
                second accidents?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Even if I am wrong in my first finding and the
                    second defendant was partly liable for the first accident, there was a break in
                    the chain of causation such that he is not liable for the second accident and
                    the plaintiffs’ claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     As observed earlier (at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>), the first defendant’s submissions
                    relied heavily on the expert’s report and that the second accident was
                    caused by the unintended acceleration of the vehicle by the first defendant. I
                    have already rejected the expert’s report and need say no more on the
                    issue. What is most telling of the first defendant’s explanation of how
                    the second accident happened, both in his AEIC and in his oral testimony, is
                    that he did not once state that he had stepped on the accelerator accidentally.
                    His evidence throughout was that he could not take his foot off the accelerator
                    and he could not offer an explanation for his action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The first defendant did not allege that the
                    first accident caused him to step on the accelerator. Instead, he pleaded in his
                    defence that he panicked (but offered no reasons), deposed in his AEIC that he
                    saw something white, claimed in court he had a blackout, and in his police
                    report he stated he had lost control of the vehicle after being hit by the
                    school bus. Notwithstanding his panicked state and/or blackout and/or white
                    vision, the first defendant had the presence of mind to swerve the vehicle
                    towards the car park to avoid crashing into MacDonald’s when his wife
                    screamed. Then, he failed to brake and continued to step on the accelerator and
                    collided into the second and third vehicles as well as the first plaintiff as a
                    result. At this moment, he then had the presence of mind to swerve the vehicle
                    sharply to his right thereafter. I note too that during his cross-examination
                    (N/E26), the first defendant agreed that he should not have stepped on the
                    accelerator and it was clearly the wrong thing to do.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     I further note that the first defendant gave
                    an unconvincing explanation in <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> as
                    to why his police report made no mention of his blackout, the white vision he
                    allegedly saw and his inability to take his foot off the accelerator. Unlike the
                    second defendant, the first defendant is literate in English. Such important
                    facts which could well have explained his conduct then could not have been
                    omitted from his police report if indeed they were true. I am of the view that
                    these excuses were conjured up by the first defendant after the event and are
                    unlikely to have taken place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     As stated earlier at <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a>, the expert’s report was not admitted
                    into the evidence before this court. It served little purpose therefore to
                    consider Christopher Mark’s opinions on why the first defendant stepped on
                    and continued to step on the accelerator. No medical evidence, which would have
                    been more relevant, was presented to explain why the first defendant stepped on
                    the accelerator and was unable to remove his foot therefrom (if it was true
                    which I doubt).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     I should add that the cases cited in the first
                    defendant’s submissions are not helpful. The finding in every case of
                    negligence turns on its own facts. How a court decides in a case will depend
                    very much on the facts peculiar to the case itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     I therefore accept the submission of the
                    second defendant that the first defendant’s act of stepping on the
                    accelerator, instead of braking the vehicle, constituted an intervening act that
                    effectively broke the chain of causation if there was indeed a causal link
                    between the first and second accidents.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Consequently, I find that the first
                    defendant’s conduct caused the second accident and he is wholly liable for
                    the plaintiffs’ claim. The second defendant shall have his costs from the
                    first defendant for these proceedings which are to be taxed on a standard basis
                    unless otherwise agreed.</p>
