<strong>Judgment:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><b>GROUNDS OF DECISION</b></font></p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify">BACKGROUND<br/>
<br/>
</p></i></b>1.    The Plaintiff Hendrawan Setiadi is an Indonesian businessman. He was a

client of the first defendant OCBC Securities Private Limited (OCBC Securities), a

stockbroking company incorporated in Singapore.<b xmlns=""><i>
<p></p></i></b>2.    At all material times, the second defendant Ng Haw Hua was a dealers

representative and an associate director employed by OCBC Securities.<b xmlns=""><i>
<p></p></i></b>3.    At all material times, the third defendant Tang Boon Hai was also a

dealers representative employed by OCBC Securities.<b xmlns=""><i>
<p></p></i></b>4.    The additional background information below is based on Mr Setiadis

allegations.<b xmlns=""><i>
<p></p></i></b>5.    Sometime in July 1995, Mr Setiadi opened an account with OCBC

Securities and traded in securities through Mr Ng and Mr Tan. For the purpose of that account, Mr

Setiadi deposited the sum of $5m. In respect of the trading under this account, about $4.13m was

returned by OCBC Securities leaving a balance of about $587,000 (Singapore transactions).<b xmlns=""><i>
<p></p></i></b>6.    Sometime in May 1996, at the request/advice of Mr Ng, Mr Setiadi

deposited US$10m with OCBC Securities for investment in the shares of Megaworld Properties and

Holdings Inc., a company in the Philippines (Megaworld shares).<b xmlns=""><i>
<p></p></i></b>7.    Mr Setiadis case is that Mr Ng had represented to him that in

return for his investment of US$10m, there would be a guaranteed gross return of 20% of that

investment by OCBC Securities. In consideration of a guarantee being given to him by OCBC

Securities, he agreed to invest about US$10m in Megaworld shares. The guarantee (the Guarantee)

was faxed over by Mr Ng to Mr Setiadi at his offices in Jakarta. Upon receipt of the Guarantee, Mr

Setiadi remitted the sum of US$10m which was then used to purchase Megaworld shares. The value of

Megaworld shares subsequently plummeted and he suffered a loss.<b xmlns=""><i>
<p></p></i></b>8.    To mitigate his loss, Mr Setiadi sold off the Megaworld shares. He

then commenced an earlier action in Suit No 559 of 1998 (the Firs Action) against OCBC

Securities and Mr Ng to recover the losses suffered under the Singapore transactions and in respect

of the Megaworld shares.<b xmlns=""><i>
<p></p></i></b>9.    Under the Singapore transactions, Mr Setiadi claimed that the losses

were suffered as a result of various unauthorised transactions effected by Mr Ng. Consequently, OCBC

Securities was also vicariously liable to him for the losses.<i xmlns=""><b>
<p></p></b></i>10.    In respect of the Megaworld shares, Mr Setiadis claim against

OCBC Securities was based on the Guarantee. Alternatively, his claim was that the terms in the

Guarantee were representations made by Mr Ng as a servant/agent of OCBC Securities to induce him to

purchase the Megaworld shares which he did. As the representations were made fraudulently, he was

entitled to rescind the contract or to claim damages for the loss suffered. As an alternative, he

also claimed that his loss and damage was occasioned by the negligence of Mr Ng as servant/agent of

OCBC Securities.<i xmlns=""><b>
<p></p></b></i>11.    The writ in the First Action was filed on 15 April 1998 and fixed

for trial in November 1998 before Justice Rajendran.<b xmlns=""><i>
<p></p></i></b>12.    On 12 November 1998 (Day 1), on the application of Counsel

for OCBC Securities and for Mr Setiadi, the hearing was adjourned to Monday, 16 November 1998 on the

ground that parties needed some time to prepare the various trial bundles.

<p xmlns="">13.    On 16 November 1998 (Day 2), the then Counsel for Mr Setiadi in his

opening statement informed the court that Mr Ng had still not been served with the Writ. Mr Setiadis

solicitors were still trying to serve Mr Ng with the Writ and believed he was away in the

Philippines.</p>
<p xmlns="">14.    On Day 2 of the hearing, Counsel for OCBC Securities also applied for

security for costs, further discovery etc against Mr Setiadi.</p>
<p xmlns="">15.    On Day 4 of the trial, Mr Setiadis Counsel applied to amend his

Statement of Claim in respect of some of the Singapore transactions. The trial was then adjourned to

5 April 1999.</p>
<p xmlns="">16.    At the adjourned hearing on 5 April 1999, OCBC Securities Counsel

applied for leave to amend the Defence to include the point that the Guarantee was fabricated. OCBC

Securities claimed that based on its document experts report, the Guarantee was a cut and

paste job.</p>
<p xmlns="">17.    For that reason, the trial was then adjourned again and was fixed for

hearing from 13 July 1999 to 26 July 1999.</p>
<p xmlns="">18.    In the course of the adjournment, Mr Setiadi engaged a document expert from

Australia to deal with the issue as to whether the Guarantee was a cut and paste job.</p>
<p xmlns="">19.    On 13 July 1999, Mr Setiadi was re-called to the stand for continued

cross-examination. By then, he was represented by a new Counsel i.e Ms Molly Lim SC, who also

appeared before me.<b><i></i></b></p>
<p xmlns="">20.    On 16 July 1999, Ms Lim applied under O 21 r 3 for leave to

discontinue the action. At that stage, the cross examination of Mr Setiadi had not yet been

completed.</p>
<p xmlns="">21.    It was alleged for Mr Setiadi that during the resumed trial of the First

Action on 13 July 1999, it had became clear that the evidence of Mr Ng was crucial. Before the

amended Defence of OCBC Securities, its pleaded case was a denial of any liability on the Guarantee

and they alleged that Mr Ng had no authority to issue the Guarantee. Mr Setiadis then solicitors

inability to serve the Writ on Mr Ng was therefore thought not to be crucial and his case could be

proceeded with against OCBC Securities in the absence of Mr Ng.</p>
<p xmlns="">22.    After the defence was amended to include the point that the Guarantee was

fabricated and during the continuation of the trial from 13 July 1999, Mr Setiadi learnt from his

own document expert that there were at least two different versions of the Guarantee. The copy in

the possession of OCBC Securities was different from that in the possession of Mr Setiadi</p>
<p xmlns="">23.    Mr Setiadi alleged that it then became clear that the participation and

evidence of Mr Ng was crucial.</p>
<p xmlns="">24.    It is important to bear in mind what transpired then before Rajendran J on

16 July 1999 in respect of the application on behalf of Mr Setiadi to discontinue the action. I set

out below the notes as recorded by the judge:</p>

<p align="justify">Order 21, rule 3, is for leave. Under that rule court has discretion. My

    institution in Singapore and prides itself on its reputation. In this context, it is important

    for world to know that allegations are frivolous. The best way to achieve this is to have action

    struck out.</p>
<p align="justify">(2) Court has seen the plaintiff on stand. It does not fit within parameters

    of what we may see as acceptable behaviour in Singapore. If leave is granted, nothing to stop

    him from starting fresh action in Singapore or in Indonesia on some issues.</p>
<p align="justify">If Court dismisses the action, then there would be serious difficulties in

    him commencing fresh proceedings in Singapore. He may not find difficulties in Indonesia but he

    will find any judgment entered difficult to enforce outside of Indonesia.</p>

<p xmlns="">25.    Mr Setiadi alleged that after the order of 16 July 1999 (the Order),

he tried to locate Mr Ng. When Mr Ng was located, Mr Setiadi commenced the present action in October

2000 (the Second Action). He also added Mr Tan as a party to the Second Action.</p>
<p xmlns="">26.    Mr Ng entered an appearance to the writ on 29 March 2001 and the writ was

served on OCBC Securities on 16 April 2001. If Mr Ng could not be located, the Second Action would

not have been proceeded with since nothing had changed from the date of the Order.</p>
<p xmlns="">27.    OCBC Securities then applied for Mr Setiadis claim in the Second Action

to be struck out.</p>
<p xmlns="">28.    On 18 July 2001, the Deputy Registrar struck out the Second Action.</p>
<p xmlns="">29.    Mr Setiadi appealed and on 22 August 2001, I dismissed his appeal.</p>
<p xmlns="">30.    Mr Setiadi has appealed against my decision.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><br/>
<em><strong>ARGUMENTS</strong></em></p>
<p xmlns="">31.    Mr Muthu Arusu for OCBC Securities based his submission on res judicata, in

its original and extended form as enunciated in Henderson v Henderson [1843-1860] All ER 378 and

abuse of the process of the court.</p>
<p xmlns="">32.    Ms Lim accepted that Mr Setiadi's claim against OCBC Securities in the

Second Action is the same as the claim in the First Action, save for an additional claim for

negligence against OCBC Securities directly rather than vicariously as in the First Action.</p>
<p xmlns="">33.    Ms Lim stressed that the judge had not dismissed the claim in the First

Action but had instead ordered that it be struck out.</p>
<p xmlns="">34.    She sought to rely on a passage in the judgment of Kirby P in Linprint Pty

Ltd v Hexham Textiles Pty Ltd [1991] 23 NSWLR 508 at p 520. However that passage was based on a

clear distinction in the Victorian County Court Rules between orders of dismissal and striking

out. Furthermore, Ms Lim did not suggest that there was such a clear distinction under the

Singapore Rules of Court.</p>
<p xmlns="">35.    Ms Lim submitted that the judge could have imposed an express term to the

effect that Mr Setiadi was precluded from commencing a fresh action but the judge did not.

Accordingly, Mr Setiadi was not so precluded.</p>
<p xmlns="">36.    While it was true that the judge did not impose such a term expressly, the

question was whether that was the meaning of the Order in any event. Having regard to Ms Lims

attempt to discontinue the First Action and the insistence by Mr Shanmugam SC, who appeared for OCBC

Securities, that the action or claim be dismissed/struck out, and the submissions before the judge,

there was no doubt in my mind that the Order made was to preclude any fresh action by Mr Setiadi

against OCBC Securities.</p>
<p xmlns="">37.    Ms Lim also submitted that if the intention was to shut out Mr Setiadi from

commencing a fresh action, then he would have withdrawn his application to discontinue the action.</p>
<p xmlns="">38.    However, the judges notes show clearly that Ms Lim did not have any

doubt then that that was what Mr Shanmugam was insisting on. Indeed, she herself said she had the

choice of withdrawing the application if such an order was to be made. After the judge intimated

that he might well make such an order, she then said that she would take instructions. The matter

was then adjourned.</p>
<p xmlns="">39.    Subsequently, Ms Lim returned and said she was proceeding with the

application to discontinue. She also pointed out that the discontinuance was only as regards the

claim against OCBC Securities and not against Mr Ng whereupon Mr Shanmugam said that this made it

all the more imperative that the First Action be struck out.</p>
<p xmlns="">40.    In those circumstances, the judge denied leave to discontinue the action

and ordered that the claim against OCBC Securities be struck out.</p>
<p xmlns="">41.    It really was not open to Ms Lim to argue that Mr Setiadi would have

withdrawn his application to discontinue if he might be precluded from commencing a fresh action

against OCBC Securities.</p>
<p xmlns="">42.    Ms Lim also submitted that because Mr Shanmugam had submitted that there

would be no prejudice to Mr Setiadi, Mr Setiadi was led to believe that he would not be precluded

from commencing a fresh action against OCBC Securities.</p>
<p xmlns="">43.    I was of the view that Ms Lims reliance on the argument of no prejudice

was an attempt to take the argument out of context. Seen in the context of what had transpired,

there was no doubt in her mind and Mr Setiadis mind that if the claim was dismissed or struck

out, as opposed to being discontinued, he would be precluded from commencing a fresh action against

OCBC Securities.</p>
<p xmlns="">44.    Ms Lims next argument was that no irreparable harm was caused to OCBC

Securities if Mr Setiadi was allowed to proceed with his present claim as OCBC Securities could even

apply for costs on a full indemnity basis if Mr Setiadi fails in the present claim.</p>
<p xmlns="">45.    I was of the view that this was a disingenuous argument. The point is that

OCBC Securities would have to defend a claim which it was not obliged to defend as Mr Setiadi was

precluded from making the claim against it.</p>
<p xmlns="">46.    Ms Lim then argued that the judge would prohibit Mr Setiadi from commencing

a fresh action only if it was just to do so, relying on as it thinks just in O 21 r 3,

and it was not just to do so.</p>
<p xmlns="">47.    Again, this was not the point. Whether it was just to do so or not was for

the judge to decide. He had made the Order. If Mr Setiadi was not satisfied, he should have appealed

against the Order. He did not.</p>
<p xmlns="">48.    I also did not agree with Ms Lim that to accept the contentions for OCBC

Securities would be tantamount to interfering with the judges order as I have concluded that the

Order means what OCBC Securities contends and not what Mr Setiadi contends.</p>
<p xmlns="">49.    In Linprint Pty Ltd v Hexham Textiles Pty Ltd [1991] 23 NSWLR 508, Linprint

Pty Ltd (Linprint) had sued Hexham Textiles Pty Ltd (Hexham) in the Supreme Court of

Victoria. In its defence, Hexham included a counterclaim. Subsequently, the action was ordered to be

tried in the County Court of Victoria.</p>
<p xmlns="">50.    On 22 July 1982, the case came on for trial before Murdoch CCJ. Hexham

applied for an adjournment and the case was adjourned to 26 July 1982.</p>
<p xmlns="">51.    On 26 July 1982, another application for an adjournment was made on behalf

of Hexham. The application was refused and the case was adjourned to the next day to be heard after

the conclusion of a part-heard case. Counsel for Hexham then announced that he was withdrawing from

the case.</p>
<p xmlns="">52.    On the next day, 27 July 1982, the case was heard. There was no appearance

for Hexham. Linprint proceeded to present its claim, after which judgment for a sum was entered for

it. The counterclaim was dismissed.</p>
<p xmlns="">53.    More than six months later, Hexham brought an action against Linprint in

the Supreme Court of New South Wales. The statement of claim was equivalent to the counterclaim

previously filed by Hexham.</p>
<p xmlns="">54.    Linprint pleaded, inter alia, issue estoppel and res judicata.</p>
<p xmlns="">55.    Linprint applied for these issues to be dealt with as a separate question

pursuant to the Supreme Court Rules 1970 Pt 31. The question came before Loveday J who answered it

adversely to Linprint.</p>
<p xmlns="">56.    Linprint then appealed to the Court of Appeal of New South Wales.</p>
<p xmlns="">57.    The argument before the Court of Appeal took an entirely different course

from that adopted by Hexham before Loveday J. Before the judge, Hexham had based its arguments upon

a construction of the County Court Rules in Victoria but conceded before the Court of Appeal that

the argument based on such Rules could not be relied upon. Instead Hexham, as the respondent, argued

that it had never had a hearing on the merits of its counterclaim.</p>
<p xmlns="">58.    The Court of Appeal decided that Hexham was precluded from making a fresh

claim, Kirby P deciding on both the grounds of res judicata and issue estoppel.</p>
<p xmlns="">59.    At p 519, he said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">In England, however, in litigation between private litigants the courts have

  not been in doubt. At least so far as the doctrine of issue estoppel is concerned, it has been

  held in the English Court of Appeal that a party which has put forward a positive case to a court

  and then at trial declines to proceed, will not be permitted later to pursue the same case and

  this, even though there has been no determination on the matter "on the merits". In Khan

  v Golechha International ltd [1980] 1 WLR 1482; [1980] 2 All ER 259, the Court of Appeal held that

  a party was estopped from asserting the contrary of what had been raised in earlier proceedings

  and there conceded by counsel then appearing for that party. </p>
<p align="justify">[Emphasis added.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">60.    At p 520, he said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">.</p>
<p align="justify">The English Court of Appeal applied the decision in Khan in SCF Finance Co Ltd

  v Masri (No 3) [1987] QB 1028 at 1048. Whilst the decisions are not binding on this Court, the

  reasoning in them is persuasive. Whilst that reasoning is confined to the application of the law

  of issue estoppel (where a matter has not been specifically judicially determined) it applies with

  even greater force where the issue has been so determined and is thus res judicata. It should be

  remembered that res judicata has lately been described as "cause of action estoppel":

  see, eg, Thoday v Thoday [1964] P 181 at 197 per Diplock LJ; and see also Lord Wilberforce in Carl

  Zeiss (No 2) (at 966). The genus dealt with by these two branches of law is the same. The public

  policy upon which each rests is that of the finality of judicial determinations in respect of

  which a litigant should not be vexed for a second time. If the reasoning in Khan and SCF Finance

  are applied to the present case, there can likewise be but one answer to the rhetorical question.</p>

<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Would it not be a case of the [appellant] company being vexed a second

    time in relation to an issue which it was open to the plaintiff to have determined in the

    previous proceedings?"</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">That answer is that it would. If, as it is contended, the respondent did not

  have a trial "on the merits" this was solely by virtue of its own conduct. It instructed

  its counsel to withdraw. Once the adjournment was refused, no endeavour was made (for example by

  subpoena of witnesses, the evidence of experts or otherwise) to prove the respondents case. It

  was simply abandoned. The respondent walked away from it. </p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">61.    At p 521, he continued:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Issue estoppel: a wider principle:</p>
<p align="justify">If, contrary to the foregoing conclusions, a proper interpretation of the

  proceedings in the County Court of Victoria is that there was no judicial adjudication of the

  matters involved in the counter-claim by virtue of the withdrawal of the respondent, and therefore

  that res judicata does not apply, the same result nonetheless follows from the application of the

  law of issue estoppel. The issues which the respondent now wishes to litigate in the Supreme Court

  of this State were either (a) necessarily inherent in the issues raised by the counter-claim and

  defence in the County Court of Victoria or (b) so intimately connected with those issues that the

  Court would require that the party to the litigation should have pleaded them in such a way as to

  have them resolved in the Victorian proceedings. It would have been unreasonable not to have

  pleaded them in those proceedings and, to the extent that they were not pleaded, they should not

  now be allowed to be pleaded again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">62.    Another member of the Court of Appeal Clarke JA said, at p 525:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The second question which then arises is whether that order founds a plea of

  res judicata. According to counsel for the respondent it does not for there had been no hearing of

  the counter-claim and in these circumstances, the dismissal should be regarded as having the same

  effect as a discontinuance. I cannot accept this proposition for the rules prescribe procedures

  which must be followed in order to enable a party to discontinue. Unless a party complies with

  those procedures it cannot be said to have discontinued nor is it entitled to the benefits, if

  any, which flow from such discontinuance. The case must, therefore, be judged solely upon the

  basis that the counter-claim was dismissed for want of appearance of the counter-claimant at the

  trial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">63.    At p 526, Clarke JA said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">I take it that these authorities establish that if a plaintiff withdraws

  from the trial and an order is made in its absence dismissing its claim then that order will,

  unless set aside or successfully appealed from, ground a later plea of res judicata in the event

  that a later attempt is made to litigate the same case. The position is no different than that

  which arises under a default judgment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">64.    On the facts before me, the Order was made in the presence of Counsel for

Mr Setiadi after some argument on the nature of the order to be made and after she had taken

instructions from him with full knowledge of the possible consequence of his application.</p>
<p xmlns="">65.    In my view, the principle of res judicata and issue estoppel would apply a

fortiori.</p>
<p xmlns="">66.    The judgment in Linprint and the two English cases cited therein also

dispose of Ms Lims other argument that there can be no issue estoppel unless there is a decision

on the merits of the case.</p>
<p xmlns="">67.    As for the argument that Mr Setiadis fresh claim was an abuse of the

process of the court, Ms Lim submitted that this was not so because mere re-litigation, in

circumstances falling short of cause of action estoppel or issue estoppel, did not necessarily give

rise to such an abuse.</p>
<p xmlns="">68.    The short answer to that was that the circumstances before me did give rise

to res judicata and issue estoppel.</p>
<p xmlns="">69.    The two cases which Ms Lim cited to support her argument were Bradford

&amp; Bingley Building Society v Seddon (Hancock and others, t/a Hancocks (a firm), third parties)

[1999] 4 All ER 217 and Ching Mun Fong (executrix of the estate of Tan Geok Tee, deceased) v Liu Cho

Chit &amp; another <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=50779&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2000] 1 SLR 517</a>.</p>
<p xmlns="">70.    However the facts in those two cases and in the case before me were

different. In those two cases, the party who was relying on res judicata or issue estoppel was not a

party in the earlier proceedings.</p>
<p xmlns="">71.    Accordingly, if Mr Tan, as the third defendant in the Second Action, was

raising the issue of res judicata or issue estoppel against Mr Setiadi, Mr Tan would probably not

succeed because he was not even a party in the First Action.</p>
<p xmlns="">72.    Likewise, Mr Ng would probably also not succeed on such an argument for a

different reason i.e the claim against him was not struck out.</p>
<p xmlns="">73.    Ms Lim also submitted that an order made pursuant to an application under O

21 r 3 is similar to one made under O 13 r 9 and is not capable of giving rise to res judicata. She

cited Mullen &amp; Conoco Ltd [1998] QBD 382.</p>
<p xmlns="">74.    However, again, the facts in Mullen were different from those before me.</p>
<p xmlns="">75.    In that case, Conoco Ltd sued Mr Mullen in the High Court for the price of

petrol delivered to him and obtained judgment in default of defence. Mr Mullen applied to set aside

the judgment under O 13 r 9 RSC on the grounds that the petrol supply agreement between Conoco Ltd

and him was so one-sided, unfair and unreasonable as to be unenforceable against him. His

application was dismissed by the deputy master.</p>
<p xmlns="">76.    Two months later, he issued a county court summons against Conoco Ltd for

trading losses arising out of the enforcement of an improper and unreasonable supply agreement.</p>
<p xmlns="">77.    Conoco Ltd then applied to strike out the claim. One of their grounds was

cause of action or issue estoppel.</p>
<p xmlns="">78.    The application was heard by a District Judge who struck out the claim for

damages but allowed an implicit claim for rescission of the agreement to stand.</p>
<p xmlns="">79.    On appeal to Judge Urquhart, the claim in both respects was struck out.</p>
<p xmlns="">80.    Mr Mullen then appealed to the Court of Appeal which concluded that an

application under O 13 r 9 to set aside a default judgment involved a discretionary jurisdiction. If

the courts power was exercised on a discretionary basis, eg for delay, then it was difficult to

say that any issue had been decided by the court.</p>
<p xmlns="">81.    Evans LJ said, at p 391E, that the question was whether the earlier ruling

in Conocos High Court Action, which he considered to be an interlocutory one, was so clear and so

specific as regards a particular defence of Mr Mullen and were there no special factors so that an

estoppel may arise.</p>
<p xmlns="">82.    On those facts and bearing in mind that Mr Mullen was not represented prior

to the default judgment obtained in the High Court, Evans LJ allowed Mr Mullens appeal in respect

of Conocos application to strike out.</p>
<p xmlns="">83.    However the Court of Appeal did not say that a decision based on O 13 r 9

could never constitute an estoppel. Indeed this possibility was accepted by Evans LJ at p 391D.</p>
<p xmlns="">84.    Moreover, the Court of Appeal also did not say that a decision based on the

exercise of a discretion under any of the rules of court would never amount to res judicata or issue

estoppel. Obviously each case must depend on its facts.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><em><strong>Additional claim by Mr Setiadi<br/>
</strong></em><br/>

85.    As for the additional claim by Mr Setiadi against OCBC Securities on the

ground that OCBC Securities was directly, as opposed to vicariously, liable for negligence, Mr

Setiadi appeared to be precluded from maintaining the claim under the extended doctrine of res

judicata as propounded in the oft-cited judgment of Wigram VC in Henderson v Henderson [1843-1860]

All ER 378:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"> where a given matter becomes the subject to litigation in, and of

  adjudication by, a court of competent jurisdiction, the court requires that the parties to that

  litigation to bring forward their whole case, and will not, except in special circumstances,

  permit the same parties to open the same subject of litigation in respect of matter (sic) which

  might have been brought forward as part of the subject in contest, but which was not brought

  forward only because they have, from negligence, inadvertence, or even accident, omitted part of

  their case. The plea of res judicata applies, except in special cases, not only to points on which

  the court was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to

  every point which probably belonged to the subject to litigation and which the parties, exercising

  reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">86.    However, Ms Lim submitted that the rule in Henderson has been explained by

Goulding J in Jelson (Estates) Ltd v Harvey [1984] 1 All ER 12 at p 16 where he said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">That seems to me a misconception of the doctrine put forward in such cases

  as Henderson v Henderson (1843) 3 Hare 100, [1843-60] All ER Rep 378 and Yat Tung Investment Co

  Ltd v Dao Heng Bank Ltd [1975] AC 581. Where there is litigation of a certain question or issue

  before the court resulting in a final or substantial order which decides it, then it is well

  established that it is too late (save in exceptional cases) for a party to adduce in subsequent

  litigation against the same opponent, or one privy to him, a fact that might well have been

  brought forward on the previous occasion. That doctrine, however, does not apply where there is a

  mere procedural defect and the court has never gone into the merits, though both parties were

  before it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">87.    I noted that the facts in Jelson were quite different from those before me.</p>
<p xmlns="">88.    In that case, a plaintiff had obtained interlocutory injunctions

restraining the defendant from doing certain acts on the plaintiffs land. The plaintiff then

applied by a notice of motion seeking the defendants committal for alleged disobedience of the

order. The notice of motion did not set out on its face the grounds of the plaintiffs application

as required by the English Rules of the Supreme Court and accordingly the motion was dismissed for

irregularity without the hearing of evidence or the consideration of merits.</p>
<p xmlns="">89.    The plaintiff then filed a fresh motion. The defendant contended, by

analogy with criminal proceedings, that he was entitled to the defence of autrefois acquit</p>
<p xmlns="">90.    Hence, the procedural defect that Goulding J was referring to was the

defect in the notice of motion.</p>
<p xmlns="">91.    Mr Setiadis application to discontinue the First Action against OCBC

Securities could not be said to be a mere procedural defect.</p>
<p xmlns="">92.    In so far as Goulding J had suggested that the court must have gone into

the merits before res judicata can apply, that is not the law as I have elaborated above.</p>
<p xmlns="">93.    The additional claim against OCBC Securities was so intimately connected

with the claim against it in the First Action that it should have been pleaded then.</p>
<p xmlns="">94.    As for the alleged reason for discontinuing the First Action, I did not

accept the reason.</p>
<p xmlns="">95.    In April 1999, Mr Setiadi and his then Counsel knew that OCBC Securities

were relying on the argument that the Guarantee had been fabricated. They must have realised by then

that Mr Ngs evidence was crucial.</p>
<p xmlns="">96.    It was not necessary to wait until Mr Setiadis expert had advised that

there were different versions of the Guarantee to realise that Mr Ngs evidence was crucial.

Besides, on 16 July 1999, Ms Lim did not even apply for an adjournment to try and locate Mr Ng

before applying for leave to discontinue.</p>
<p xmlns="">97.    The fact that Mr Setiadi would pay costs if he lost in the Second Action or

that Mr Setiadi would otherwise be shut out was also not a special circumstance. Otherwise, the

extended doctrine of res judicata would be rendered nugatory.</p>
<p xmlns="">98.    In summary, there was no special circumstance to allow Mr Setiadi to

re-litigate against OCBC Securities even in respect of his additional claim.<b><i></i></b></p>
