The defendant, on the other hand, characterised it as purely a purchase by the plaintiffs of some shares in the company set up to carry out the project. The central issues before me concerned the construction of an agreement dated 31 May 2013 entered into by the parties (hereinafter referred to as the “31 May 2013 Agreement”), as well as the plaintiffs’ complaints of fraudulent misrepresentations on the part of the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The 1st plaintiff, RJC Resource Pte.

</div> Hua Kai BVI was the corporate entity at the centre of the dispute between the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 At the conclusion of a 5-day trial, I gave partial judgment for the plaintiffs, ordering that the defendant reimburse a sum of US$300,000 to the 1st plaintiff (with interest and costs).  The plaintiffs and the defendant having both appealed my decision, I am setting out my reasons in these written grounds. As the parties’ pleadings are lengthy and often repetitive and confusing, I propose to first set out a summary of the plaintiffs’ claims and the defendant’s defence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary of plaintiffs’ claims</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The plaintiffs alleged that the parties had contracted in the 31 May 2013 Agreement for the 1st plaintiff to invest a total sum of US$1.2 million into a “project” for the supply of sand to a Japanese company known as Japan Resources Development Co Ltd (“JRDC”).  This “project” was referred to as the “Japan Project” by the parties.  The monies invested by the 1st plaintiff were clearly designated for specific uses such as the hiring and chartering of sand dredging equipment.  It was further agreed that various sums which the 2nd plaintiff had previously lent the defendant in the period between 23 July 2012 and 14 May 2013 would be treated as part of the investment sum of US$1.2 million.  The plaintiffs claimed that the amounts paid to the defendant in relation to the investment in the Japan Project totalled $1,242,500 and US$200,000; which the plaintiffs said was the equivalent of the US$1.2 million referred to in the 31 May 2013 agreement.

It will be noted that the name Hua Kai Engineering and Resources Co Ltd is very similar – but not identical to – the name of the BVI company referred to as Hua Kai BVI in these proceedings; the main difference being that the word “Co” does not appear in Hua Kai BVI’s name. It will also be noted that Hua Kai Engineering and Resources Co Ltd was named as one of the parties to the 31 May 2013 Agreement, although no particulars were given of this entity in the agreement;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) that as Hua Kai Engineering and Resources Co Ltd and/or the defendant did not have the funds to carry out its obligations under the said sand concession, the defendant wanted the 1st plaintiff and/or the 2nd plaintiff to invest and/or inject sums (in the sum of USD 1,200,000) for the purpose of hiring and/or chartering dredges and also towards the deposit required by Hoang Viet under the terms of the sand concession;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) that there was “very little risk” in the said investment and/or injection as there was a “secured” sale and purchase agreement with the supplier of the sand, and the end-buyer (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, JRDC) was also secured.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The plaintiffs claimed that they subsequently discovered the falsity of the defendant’s representations after entering into the 31 May 2013 Agreement.  The representation set out above at [7(a)] was false because there was in fact no company called Hua Kai Engineering and Resources Co Ltd in existence at the time of the 31 May 2013 Agreement; and the sand concession from Hoang Viet was not granted to Hua Kai Engineering and Resources Co Ltd. It was only after the signing of the agreement that Hua Kai BVI was incorporated on 18 July 2013 as the vehicle for the Japan Project. The representation about the uses to which the plaintiffs’ investment funds would be applied was also false because the funds were not used for the stated purposes of paying the sand deposit and hiring or chartering dredgers and equipment. As for the representation that the investment carried “very little risk”, this too was false: the plaintiffs ended up “suffering great risks” due to the fact that the new entity Hua Kai BVI did not have a sand concession in Vietnam and the eventual lack of any agreement concluded for the supply of sand to JRDC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The plaintiffs also claimed that following the 31 May 2013 Agreement, the defendant made further false representations to the 2nd plaintiff to induce him to sign a document referred to in these proceedings as the “SNC Deed”.

</div>  The SNC Deed concerned the payment by SNC and/or the defendant to the plaintiff of certain sums apparently computed by reference to sand to be supplied by SNC to an entity named Starhigh Asia Pacific (Pte. Ltd.) (“Starhigh”).  The SNC Deed did not concern the Japan Project. However, it was the plaintiffs’ case that the defendant had procured the 2nd plaintiff’s execution of this deed in order to convince the 2nd plaintiff that the defendant was still able to secure the sand concession in Vietnam for the supply of sand to JRDC, and to persuade him that the intention of the parties <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the investment and injection of funds (amounting to US$1,200,000) under the terms of the 31 May 2013 Agreement, could still be carried out despite the defendant’s falsehoods.

According to the defendant, the 2nd plaintiff had carried out his own checks prior to entering into the 31 May 2013 Agreement by visiting and inspecting the sand operations in Vietnam; and he had also had sight of the sand concession agreement signed between Hoang Viet and Singapore Hua Kai, among other things.

By way of background, the 2nd plaintiff testified that he had first met the defendant in 2006 in the Middle East. They then lost touch with each other until 2012, when the defendant asked him out for coffee. Sometime in 2012, the 2nd plaintiff and the defendant visited Cambodia together, to check out the latter’s sand barge. While they were in Cambodia, the defendant helped the 2nd plaintiff to obtain a “sand licence” for his company from a Cambodian sand owner. The defendant also saved the 2nd plaintiff from drowning when a boat they were traveling in took in water.  As a result, the 2nd plaintiff felt that the defendant was someone he could trust.

Following this confrontation, the defendant got the 2nd plaintiff to sign the SNC Deed (dated 3 August 2013), in which the 2nd plaintiff was promised certain payments by SNC and/or the defendant. This deed purported to promise the 2nd plaintiff payments based on the quantity of sand supplied by SNC to Starhigh.  Whilst the subject-matter of the SNC Deed had nothing to do with Hua Kai BVI or the Japan Project, the 2nd plaintiff claimed that the Deed came about because the defendant wanted to use it to convince the plaintiffs that the defendant was still able to secure the sand concession in Vietnam for the supply of sand to JRDC and to persuade them that the investment under the terms of the 31 May 2013 Agreement could still be carried out.  To further convince the 2nd plaintiff to sign the Deed, the defendant represented, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that he was the majority shareholder of SNC and that he controlled SNC.

At that stage of their discussions, the two of them envisaged an arrangement whereby Singapore Hua Kai would obtain sand from Vietnam via the sand concession it had from Hoang Viet, before selling it to Raffles-Sand for on-selling to JRDC.

The plaintiffs were therefore entitled to claim damages at law (or at least damages pursuant to s 2 of the Misrepresentation Act) or seek rescission of the 31 May 2013 Agreement;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Alternatively, the return of the total sums of $1,242,500 and US$200,000 paid by the plaintiffs to the defendant for a total failure of consideration of these payments;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Alternatively, the defendant was contractually obligated to refund a sum of US$500,000. In this respect, as noted earlier, the plaintiffs pleaded reliance on clause 8 of the 31 May 2013 Agreement, as well as clauses 16 and 18 of the agreement, and made reference to the preamble of the SNC Deed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The substantive differences between the parties in this case were largely factual: the parties were in broad agreement on the applicable legal principles.

Was it a share purchase agreement, as the defendant claimed, with the plaintiffs purchasing from the defendant 18% of the shares in Hua Kai BVI for US$1.2 million?  Or was it an agreement for the plaintiffs to invest US$1.2 million in the Japan Project in return for profits to be made from the supply of sand to Japan, as the plaintiffs claimed?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The determination of [51(a)] was relevant to disposing of the plaintiffs’ claim for fraudulent misrepresentation; whereas the determination of [51(b)] was relevant to disposing of the claims for total failure of consideration and for the refund of US$500,000 based on clause 8 and other provisions in the 31 May 2013 Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Did the defendant make the fraudulent misrepresentations complained of by the plaintiffs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In respect of the plaintiffs’ claim for fraudulent misrepresentation, parties were agreed that in law, the elements of such a claim were as follows (see <span class="font-italic">Panatron</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd and another v Lee Cheow Lee and another </span>[2001] 2 SLR(R) 435 at [13]–[14]).

</div> Not only did Khoo agree with this suggestion, he also testified that in the case of the Japan Project, no firm deal was eventually concluded with JRDC because JRDC was reluctant to sign a firm agreement and had instead referred Raffles-Sand to the “big company” in Japan. The “big company” had suggested getting a proxy to sign the agreement instead, and had also refused to provide any deposit payment. In the circumstances, and having regard to the “big risk” involved, the Japan Project could not proceed any further.

Tellingly, however, what Khoo’s evidence suggested was that if no dredgers or other equipment were eventually hired to operationalise the supply of sand to JRDC, it would have been because of JRDC’s subsequent conduct in refusing to sign a firm agreement or to provide a deposit payment – and not because the defendant had all along intended to renege on the stated intention to use the funds for hiring such equipment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 For the above reasons, even assuming the defendant had represented that the monies injected by the plaintiffs were intended “for the purpose of hiring/chartering dredgers and also towards the deposit required by [Hoang Viet]”, the plaintiffs failed to prove that this representation was false at the time the 31 May 2013 Agreement was concluded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In respect of the representation set out at [54(c)], the defendant was prepared to agree that he had characterised the Japan Project as being potentially profitable, although he asserted that the 2nd plaintiff had in any event come to the same conclusion for himself, after making his own calculations.

He also knew, as at 31 May 2013, that Hua Kai Engineering and Resources Co Ltd had yet to be incorporated at the point in time when the 31 May 2013 Agreement was signed. Whether there was some plan for Singapore Hua Kai to assign the sand concession to the BVI company to be set up (as the 2nd plaintiff claimed), or whether the plan was for this new  BVI company to “have priority” in procuring sand from Singapore Hua Kai (as the defendant claimed), the point is that the plaintiffs would have known prior to 31 May 2013 that there was no Hua Kai Engineering and Resources Co Ltd – indeed, no BVI company – which had an “agreement with Hoang Viet for the sale and purchase of sand”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In cross-examination, the 2nd plaintiff further conceded that as at <span class="font-italic">April 2013</span>, he knew that the arrangement for the supply of sand to JRDC consisted of an <span class="font-italic">MOU</span> between JRDC and Raffles-Sand.

</div> The fact that the 2nd plaintiff knew prior to 31 May 2013 that there existed only an MOU with JRDC -– as opposed to a binding contract – was at odds with the allegation that the defendant had assured him JRDC was a <span class="font-italic">secured end-buyer</span> for the sand.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Indeed, the fact that the 2nd plaintiff took care to provide in the 31 May 2013 Agreement for the reimbursement of certain sums in the event that “the Vietnam concession and the Japan Project does not [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] materialize” (see clause 8 of the 31 May 2013 Agreement reproduced above at [18]) is consistent with his knowledge that as at 31 May 2013, there was no Hua Kai Engineering and Resources Co Ltd which had an “agreement with Hoang Viet for the sale and purchase of sand”, and also no binding agreement with JRDC for the supply of sand.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 For the above reasons, I did not accept that the defendant had represented to the 2nd plaintiff that his investment would carry little risk because there existed “a secured agreement” with Hoang Viet for the sale and purchase of sand and/or because the end-buyer for the sand was “also secured”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Given the above findings of fact, I did not find it necessary to deal with questions relating to the plaintiffs’ allegations of reliance on the purported fraudulent misrepresentations and/or the damage allegedly suffered in consequence.  Based on these findings of fact, I was satisfied that the plaintiffs could not make out their claim for fraudulent misrepresentation. In the circumstances, I rejected their claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation and the alternative claim for rescission of the 31 May 2013 Agreement and return of the total sums of $1,242,500 and US$200,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The plaintiffs’ Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) also included a prayer in the alternative for damages under s2 of the Misrepresentation Act. This appeared to be a reference to s 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act, although unfortunately the elements of this alternative claim were not dealt with in the parties’ closing submissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Section 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where a person has entered into a contract after a misrepresentation has been made to him by another party thereto and as a result thereof he has suffered loss, then, if the person making the misrepresentation would be liable to damages in respect thereof had the misrepresentation been made fraudulently, that person shall be so liable notwithstanding that the misrepresentation was not made fraudulently, unless he proves that he had reasonable ground to believe and did believe up to the time the contract was made that the facts represented were true.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The elements for relief under s 2(1) have been summarised by the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Spice Girls Ltd v Aprilia World Service BV </span>[2002] EMLR 27 at [12] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…(L)iability depends on four elements: (a) a misrepresentation made by one person to another, (b) a subsequent contract between them, (c) consequential loss and (d) an absence, at the time the contract was made, of a belief or reasonable grounds therefor in the truth of the facts represented. If all those conditions are satisfied then the representor is liable to the representee for such damages as would be payable if the misrepresentation had been made fraudulently.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 It has also been held that the Misrepresentation Act does not change the law as to what amounts to a representation; it only alters the relief for non-fraudulent misrepresentation: <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Ching Seng v Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd </span>[2003] 3 SLR(R) 307 at [23].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 From the above, it is plain that damages under s 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act is still premised first and foremost on a false statement of fact having been made at the pre-contractual stage. As seen in [54] to [73] above, I have found against the plaintiffs on the alleged misrepresentations. In the circumstances, it was clear that the plaintiffs could not establish even the first of the four elements of liability under s 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act; and I rejected their alternative claim for damages under this provision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">If no fraudulent misrepresentations were made, and on the basis that the 31 May 2013 Agreement was valid and binding, what did the parties agree to in the 31 May 2013 Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Having rejected the plaintiffs’ claim that the 31 May 2013 Agreement should be rescinded for fraudulent misrepresentation, I next considered the issue of what the plaintiffs and the defendant had contracted for in this agreement.  As I observed earlier, the determination of this issue was relevant to the plaintiffs’ claims for total failure of consideration and for the refund of US$500,000 based on clause 8 and other provisions in the 31 May 2013 Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I first considered the defendant’s understanding of the 31 May 2013 Agreement.  It must be stated at the outset that the defendant did not seek to challenge the validity of the 31 May 2013 Agreement. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, the defendant had stated that the agreement “does not evidence the true agreement or the Share Purchase Agreement” between him and the 2nd plaintiff.

</div> However, the defendant did not plead the defence of <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum</span> or any other similar defence. I therefore proceeded on the basis that he did not intend to disavow the 31 May 2013 Agreement in its entirety and that he was simply saying it should be understood as being purely an agreement for the sale and purchase of his shares in Hua Kai BVI.  Indeed, in the same paragraph of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, he went on to state that “the main essence of the agreement … lies in <span class="font-italic">Clause 17 </span>of the 31 May 2013 Agreement, wherein [the 2nd plaintiff] would buy 18% of [his] shareholding in Hua Kai BVI and once the business venture started generating returns, he would also be entitled to 18% of the profits” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 I found the defendant’s “understanding” of the 31 May 2013 Agreement as a share purchase agreement to be wholly baseless.  In <span class="font-italic">Yap Son On v Ding Pei Zhen</span> [2017] 1 SLR 219 (“<span class="font-italic">Yap Son On</span>”), the Court of Appeal (“CA”) has pointed out that in any exercise of contractual interpretation, the “text of the agreement is of first importance” (at [30]).   The defendant’s proposed “understanding” of the 31 May 2013 Agreement essentially required that all clauses apart from clause 17 be disregarded – a proposition for which the defence provided no legal or evidential basis. If the only thing agreed between the plaintiffs and the defendant was that the former should purchase from the latter 18% of the shares in Hua Kai BVI for US$1.2 million, then it was anomalous that the 31 May 2013 Agreement should have incorporated multiple clauses providing for the purposes for which the plaintiffs’ “financial injection” of US$1.2 million was to be used.  It also could not be disputed that these stated purposes related to the supply of sand to JRDC (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Japan Project); and that clause 8 specifically provided for the reimbursement of part of the US$1.2 million in the event that the Vietnam sand concession and/or the Japan Project failed to materialise. The incorporation of these terms in the 31 May 2013 Agreement made sense only if it was understood to be – at least in part – an agreement for the plaintiffs <span class="font-italic">to invest</span> <span class="font-italic">in the Japan Project</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 I would add that whilst the defendant claimed at some points in his testimony that he had been unaware of what the 31 May 2013 Agreement said,  I found this testimony unbelievable.

</div> Not only did he sign the 31 May 2013 Agreement, there was no evidence at all – up until the time these proceedings commenced -– of his having subsequently sought to disavow the agreement or to protest his alleged ignorance of its terms. Having heard the exchanges between the defendant and the 2nd plaintiff in the audio recordings of their meetings, and having observed the defendant’s behaviour in the witness stand, I had no doubt that the defendant would have had no difficulty in making known his objections had he really been kept ignorant of the terms of the 31 May 2013 Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 I would also add that I did not find the Statement of Account dated 3 August 2013 to be of any help to the defendant.  Whilst this document purported to refer to the “sale” to the 2nd plaintiff of 18% of the Hua Kai BVI shares “@ USD 1.2 mil”, there was no basis on which to suppose that it had in some way revoked or varied those express terms of the agreement which – as observed earlier – clearly provided for the plaintiffs to invest in the Japan Project.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Furthermore, insofar as the exercise in contractual construction is informed “by the surrounding circumstances or external context” and insofar as the court may have regard <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> to the factual matrix constituting the background in which the contract was drafted (<span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 at [131]), it did not make sense for the 2nd plaintiff to agree to shell out US$1.2 million <span class="font-italic">solely</span> for the purpose of purchasing an 18% shareholding in a BVI company which had not even been set up at the point in time when the 31 May Agreement was signed. Indeed, even when the company (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Hua Kai BVI) was eventually set up, it had only 50,000 issued shares each with a par value of US$1.

In short, despite alleging that the entire sum of US$1.2 million was paid by the plaintiffs as consideration for an 18% shareholding in Hua Kai BVI, the defendant had no coherent explanation for how the 9,000 shares in this new BVI company came to be valued at US$1.2 million.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Indeed, the defendant himself appeared at times to forget his own insistence that the agreement he had with the plaintiffs was no more than a sale and purchase agreement for 18% of the Hua Kai BVI shares.

</div> It is true that the 31 May 2013 Agreement referred to the 1st plaintiff “injecting” a total sum of US$1.2 million for the purpose of hiring/chartering dredgers and also towards the deposit required by Hoang Viet (see clauses 2 and 4); that the agreement included provision for partial reimbursement of this sum in the event the sand concession with Hoang Viet and/or the Japan Project did not materialise (see clause 8);

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> the key provision may be found in clause 8 of the 31 May 2013 Agreement which provided as follows (reproduced here for convenience):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the Vietnam concession and the Japan Project does not materialize KOH will reimburse a maximum of US$500,000 to RJCR depending on which projects do not materialize. US $500,000 if both do not materialize, US$200,000 if the Vietnam concession does not materialize and US$300,000 if the Japan Project does not materialize.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The defendant argued that the plaintiffs could no longer rely on clause 8 because it was subject to an “expiry” period of 2 years from the date of the Agreement.  In making this argument, the defendant sought to rely on clause 16; specifically, the last sentence in that clause which read: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The personal Guarantee by [the defendant] for this contract to be relinquish after 2 years from the date of this contract signed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 I should state that it was not clear exactly what the term “relinquish” was intended to convey. Neither the plaintiffs nor the defendant made any submissions on this: instead, both sides appeared to assume that it meant the same thing as “expire”. Assuming this was what the term was intended to convey, the above sentence still had to be read in its entirety:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In consideration of the sums set out in Clause 4 herein paid<span class="font-italic"> </span>and to be paid by RJCR, KOH agrees to guarantee the payments or minimum profits payable to be made by HK to RJCR mentioned herein should any of the said payments or minimum profits not be forthcoming within 1 month after the time limited for HK to make payment.  Notice in writing by RJCR to KOH will be sufficient demand for payment and KOH cannot deny or dispute the amounts payable hereunder as stated in any letters of demand for [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]<span class="font-italic"> </span>RJCR to KOH. Koh also agrees that if the sand is found to be in non compliance with ITC specifications that he will also guarantee to repay to RJCR the US$200,000 paid by RJCR as set out in Clause 4 herein.  The personal Guarantee by Mr. Koh for this contract to be relinquish after 2 years from the date of this contract signed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Having regard to clause 16 in its entirety, it was apparent that even if the last sentence were intended to set an “expiry date” of 2 years to the personal guarantee given by the defendant, this was targeted at and limited to the guarantees provided for in clause 16 itself; namely, the guarantee of payment of the profits and other payments payable by Hua Kai BVI to the 1st plaintiff, and the guarantee of repayment of the US$200,000 paid to Hoang Viet in the event that the sand supplied failed to satisfy JTC specifications. Having regard to the express wording of clause 16, it was simply not possible to construe it as a provision which stipulated a 2-year “expiry date” for other clauses in the 31 May 2018 Agreement – such as clause 8.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In order to invoke clause 8 successfully to obtain reimbursement of the “maximum” sum of US$500,000, the plaintiffs had to prove that both “the Vietnam concession” and “the Japan Project” had failed to materialise.  Regrettably, the plaintiffs’ case in respect of “the Vietnam concession” was rather incoherent.  It was never clear what precisely they claimed would amount to non-materialisation of the Vietnam sand concession.  In the first place, it was not disputed that there <span class="font-italic">was</span> a valid Vietnam sand concession – albeit one held by Singapore Hua Kai. The plaintiffs started with the proposition that the defendant had falsely represented that a company known as Hua Kai Engineering and Resources Co Ltd already held a sand concession from Hoang Viet at the time the 31 May 2013 Agreement was executed.  However, in [55] to [61] above, I have found that no such representation was made, nor could the 2nd plaintiff have believed when signing the Agreement that a BVI company held such a sand concession – not least because he himself conceded that he had seen the Hoang Viet sand concession agreement on or around 27 May 2013, and would therefore have seen that it was Singapore Hua Kai that held the concession.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Somewhat belatedly, there was an attempt in re-examination by the 2nd plaintiff to suggest that the defendant had agreed that the sand concession in Vietnam would be assigned from Singapore Hua Kai to Hua Kai BVI. Apart from the reasons stated at [58] above, this allegation was never pleaded by the plaintiffs in their amended statement of claim (which notably underwent two amendments). The court cannot make a finding based on facts which have not been pleaded: see <span class="font-italic">Ong </span><span class="font-italic">Seow Pheng and others v Lotus Development Corp and another</span> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 113 at [41]. In the circumstances, I did not give weight to this allegation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 For the reasons set out above, I found that the plaintiffs were unable to satisfy me that “the Vietnam concession” had “not materialised”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 On the other hand, insofar as “the Japan Project” was concerned, it could not be disputed that this never materialised. There was an attempt by the defendant to suggest that this was the 2nd plaintiff’s fault. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, the defendant suggested that “the investment project with the Japanese failed to proceed” because the 2nd plaintiff had reneged on his promise to provide a credit line to a company named Opera House Co Ltd in relation to another project.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 I did not find the defendant’s suggestion credible.  Not only was the defendant unable to offer any sensible explanation as to the connection between the MOU to supply sand to JRDC and the separate dealings with Opera House Co Ltd (“Opera House”), his own witness Khoo gave a wholly different explanation as to why the MOU with JRDC did not lead to a binding contract.  As noted in [66] above, Khoo’s evidence was that JRDC itself had backed away from signing a binding contract; and the “big company” in Japan which JRDC had referred Raffles-Sand to had also declined to sign any contract or to pay any deposit. In short, the eventual failure of the Japan Project could not in any way be said to have been caused by the 2nd plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 As the Japan Project had clearly failed to materialise, I held that the 1st plaintiff was entitled to be reimbursed a sum of US$300,000 pursuant to clause 8 of the 31 May 2013 Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Peripheral issues</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the 1st plaintiff was a non-signatory to the 31 May Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 I conclude by addressing a number of peripheral issues raised by the parties in the course of the trial. The first concerns the defendant’s contention that the 1st plaintiff was not a signatory to the 31 May 2013 Agreement and should, accordingly, be precluded under clause 15 from seeking to enforce any of its terms.  Clause 15 reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">No party not a signatory to this agreement shall be in any manner entitled to claim any right or benefit or enforce any rights herein.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Rather curiously, whilst this point was pleaded in the Defence (Amendment No. 3),

</div> It should be pointed out that in making these findings, the District Judge essentially agreed with the claim put forward by the 2nd plaintiff in DC 923 of 2016 regarding the nature and effect of the document known as the SNC Deed.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-2fc2fd8c-f243-45ca-9a3a-f5313e62b0b4" data-toggle="modal" type="button">130</button></sup>

</div>
</div>
</div> On that basis, the 2nd plaintiff was awarded judgement in DC 923 of 2016 against both the defendant and SNC Training Consultants Pte Ltd for the sum of $180,658.68.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Rather belatedly, having proceeded to plead the terms of the SNC Deed in the amended statement of claim in these proceedings, the 2nd plaintiff conceded in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief that the plaintiffs were “not making any claims under the SNC Deed” and that the defendant had since paid him the judgement sums ordered in DC 923 of 2016.

</div>
</div>
</div> However, even this concession failed to go far enough – especially since it came only after the 2nd plaintiff had put forward a substantial amount of material in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief regarding the circumstances in which the SNC Deed was entered into and its terms.

</div>
</div>
</div> In my view, the terms of the SNC Deed and the circumstances in which it was entered into should not have been pleaded by the plaintiffs in the first place in their present suit. Having put forward a certain version of events relating to the SNC Deed, its origins, and the nature of its terms in DC 923 of 2016, it was highly inappropriate – indeed, impermissible – for the plaintiffs to attempt to put forward a <span class="font-italic">different version of events</span> in the present suit by claiming that the SNC Deed had been offered to them by the defendant as a means of reassuring them that “the terms of the 31st May 2013 Agreement could still be carried out”.
