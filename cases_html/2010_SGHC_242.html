<p class="Judg-Heading-1">(I)   Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, Ng Joo Soon
                    (“NJS”), brought two principal actions, which were consolidated on
                    3 June 2009. In Suit No 59 of 2009 (“Suit 59”), NJS
                    seeks, <em>inter alia</em>, a declaration that he was
                    wrongfully removed as a director of the defendant, Dovechem Holdings Pte Ltd
                    (“the Company”) and an order that he be allowed to inspect the
                    accounting and other records of the Company pursuant to s 199 of the
                    Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (the “Companies Act”). In
                    Suit No 140 of 2009 (“Suit 140”), NJS claims against the
                    Company for breach of agreements pursuant to which the Company was to pay him:
                    (a) a monthly payment of $25,000.00 (the “Monthly Interest
                    Reimbursement”); (b) a monthly allowance of U$20,000.00 or $35,000.00 (at
                    an agreed exchange rate of U$1 to $1.75) (the “Monthly Life
                    Allowance”); (c) a monthly instalment of $13,750.00 for 24 months
                    for amounts mistakenly deducted from an outstanding loan (the “Deduction
                    Instalment Repayment”); and (d) a monthly instalment of $140,278.00 for
                    36 months (the “Loan Instalment Repayment”). He seeks an
                    order for specific performance of the payment of those amounts. Further, he
                    seeks relief against Andrew Ng Iet Pew (“Andrew”), Anta Ng
                    (“Anta”), Ng Ju Aik (“Ju Aik”) and Ng Joo Tian
                    (“Joo Tian”), the second to fifth defendants respectively
                    (collectively “the Family Defendants”), who are directors of the
                    Company, for inducing the Company’s breach of contract and for conspiring
                    with each other to cause the relevant breach. NJS and the Family Defendants, who
                    are NJS’s younger brothers and his nephews, are all and the only directors
                    and shareholders of the Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       This case is at one level a corporate and
                    contractual dispute, but during trial, considerable underlying family emotional
                    tensions were evident. The tensions were the result of a complex mix of
                    personalities and generations, with the Family Defendants displaying mixed
                    feelings of respect coupled with resentment towards the plaintiff for what he
                    did to them. Lawsuits such as these reflect an unfortunate but increasing
                    incidence of fractious generational transitions within Singapore family
                    businesses which are unable, for various reasons, to achieve the balance of an
                    orderly succession characterised by mutual familial respect and filial dignity
                    .The outcome of lawsuits are determined by the law and the evidence before the
                    court and provide resolution only of the legal issues. The underlying family
                    tensions, being beyond the purview of the court, remain to be resolved by the
                    parties themselves.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">(II)   Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(A)   Starting out</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       NJS was born in 1938 in Malaysia as the fourth
                    child of a couple who were rubber tappers. He received an education in Mandarin
                    up to junior high school. In 1957, NJS came to Singapore to seek a better
                    future. He started a paint and chemical solvent business in 1960 known as Thiam
                    Joo Pte Ltd which eventually grew to become the Dovechem Group (“the
                    Group”) (hereinafter references to “the Group” mean all the
                    companies described and referred to as “Dovechem Group” in the
                    26 December 2001 Meeting Notes in <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>
                    below. For accuracy it should be noted that “the Group” here is
                    used to refer to companies in which the family have interests and not holding
                    and subsidiary companies within groups as defined in s 5 of the Companies
                    Act. Around 1965, NJS invited his younger brother, Joo Tian, and later in 1972,
                    another younger brother, Ju Aik, to join him in the business. They also
                    contributed to the growth of the business and were later issued shares in the
                    company for which they did not pay. Subsequently, other members of the Ng family
                    also came to work in the business. Anta and Andrew, who are NJS’s nephews,
                    joined in the 1970s and 1980s respectively, after receiving overseas education
                    scholarships from the Group. It is estimated that 16 members of the family
                    work in the Group.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(B)   Building a conglomerate</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       NJS was the Company’s and the
                    Group’s managing director. He and the other family members developed the
                    family business into a considerable conglomerate with businesses in chemicals,
                    formaldehydes and resins, paints, bulk terminals, steel drums, transportation
                    and property, with country holding companies and operating subsidiaries in
                    Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and China. The Company is the holding company of
                    all the Singapore subsidiaries and associated companies in Indonesia and China.
                    NJS was the 52% majority shareholder of the Company. He was the leader and
                    public face of the family business with the other family members each having
                    less than 17% shareholding in the Company and contributing in various financial
                    and operational capacities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(C)   Encountering the 1997 Financial Crisis</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In 1997, the Company encountered financial
                    difficulties during the Asian Financial Crisis. NJS provided personal loans
                    totalling $6.1m to the Company between 1997 and 2001. He borrowed these funds
                    from banks by mortgaging his house. Anta, Joo Tian and Ju Aik also lent the
                    Company sums of $498,000, $750,000 and $850,000 respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 26 December 2001, there was a meeting
                    chaired by Andrew which marked the handover of leadership from NJS to Andrew.
                    NJS and the Family Defendants attended the meeting. The records of the meeting,
                    which I shall refer to as the 26 December 2001 Meeting Notes, were
                    described as “Dovechem Group, Minutes of the Members Meeting, Thiam Joo
                    Office, Singapore 26 December 2001 Agenda: The Way Forward for the Dovechem
                    Group”. (I refer to the records as “Meeting Notes” rather
                    than “Minutes”, as they were originally titled, in order to
                    distinguish them from formal board and shareholder minutes and resolutions which
                    have to be duly maintained by the Company in accordance with s 188 of the
                    Companies Act. The Meeting Notes were not part of or filed and maintained as
                    minutes of directors’ or shareholders’ meetings in accordance with
                    s 188, nor did they purport to be directors’ or shareholders’
                    resolutions of the Company.) The 26 December 2001 Meeting Notes state that
                    accountants and lawyers were appointed to advise on the Group’s current
                    financial position and legal issues. Further, to show the Group’s
                    commitment to repay its loans, it was proposed that Andrew be the new
                    President/Chief Executive Officer of the Group to spearhead the negotiation with
                    the bankers and creditors and to lead the Group into the new generation. Andrew
                    proposed a new shareholding structure to ensure representation of the original
                    directors in the next generation. It was also agreed that (a) cash injections by
                    certain family members including NJS would be reimbursed with interest as soon
                    as the Company deemed itself capable of doing so, and (b) in the event that NJS
                    had no income, the company would grant him a cash payment of US$20,000 on a
                    monthly basis. The 26 December 2001 Meeting Notes were signed by everyone
                    attending as being “confirmed, accepted and acknowledged” by the
                    signatories. It also contained a closing note: “Chinese translated copy
                    of this minutes [<em>sic</em>] will be provided upon
                    request.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       At a subsequent meeting on 14 January 2002
                    attended by NJS and the Family Defendants, it was confirmed that out of the
                    $6.1m, a sum of $5,050,001.55 (“the Loan”) remained due and owing
                    from the Company to NJS. The notes of that meeting also reflected that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">starting from January 2002, all interest
                            incurred by individual members listed on a loan list would be borne by
                            the Company;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">NJS would be paid a monthly allowance of
                            US$20,000 in the event that he left the Group or a company named
                            Dovechem Stolthaven or was without salary; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">if possible, a bilingual version of the minutes
                            was to be made available, and in the event of dispute, the Chinese
                            version would prevail over the English version.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">The notes were also signed as “confirmed, accepted and
                    acknowledged” by NJS and the Family Defendants. Andrew was recorded as
                    the chair of the meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(D)   Responding to the 1997 Crisis </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(i)   Ceding management and shareholder control in exchange for
                personal guarantees</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In the aftermath of the Asian Financial Crisis
                    of 1997, there were recriminations by the Family Defendants against NJS that it
                    was his investment decisions, and not the Asian Financial Crisis, which had led
                    to the corporate financial crisis of the Group. Because of the need to conclude
                    schemes of arrangement acceptable to the creditor banks who in turn required
                    personal guarantees of each of the family directors and shareholders, and
                    because the Family Defendants would not agree to provide personal guarantees
                    otherwise, NJS was obliged and agreed to dilute his shareholdings and effect
                    generational management succession.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       It was agreed that NJS would cede his 52%
                    majority shareholding control for a diluted stake of 24%, with Andrew acquiring
                    25% and Ju Aik, Ju Tian and Anta each holding 17%. Further, Andrew was to manage
                    the Company and Group but NJS was to become non-executive chairman of the
                    Company. All these were inscribed in a Restructuring Agreement of 8 July
                    2002 (“the Restructuring Agreement 2002”) between NJS and the
                    Family Defendants, to which the Company was not a party. Pursuant to the
                    Restructuring Agreement 2002, NJS also retained the option to transfer his
                    shares to his children or to exercise a put option to the Family Defendants
                    after completion of the schemes of arrangement. Clause 4 of the
                    Restructuring Agreement 2002 further provided:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.1    Upon the restructuring of shareholdings in the
                            Private Companies pursuant to Clause 3.2, the Parties shall procure

                            directors of Dovechem Holdings Pte Ltd and (ii) the executive chairman
                            of the boards of directors of Dovechem Stolthaven Limited until the

                    2002 (the “Loan Repayment Agreement 2002”). Under the Loan
                    Repayment Agreement 2002 the parties agreed, <em>inter

                            the parties agree that the said payment shall continue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Pursuant to the Loan Repayment Agreement 2002, NJS was to receive
                    the Monthly Interest Reimbursement (<em>ie</em>, the
                    monthly allowance equivalent to the amount of interest of the Loan which was
                    fixed at $25,000) and the Monthly Life Allowance of U$20,000 or $35,000 (based
                    on an agreed rate of U$1 to $1.75) in the event that he resigned or retired as
                    the chairman of the board of Dovechem Stolthaven. I have already alluded to

                    acceptable to the Group’s creditors were approved by the Court. NJS was
                    appointed non-executive chairman of the Company on 6 January 2003 and
                    Andrew was appointed managing director and chief executive officer on

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Andrew chaired the next members’ meeting
                    on 11 March 2003, at which NJS and all the Family Defendants were present.
                    At that meeting, Anta was commissioned to:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… list down and match all working family members to the rewards and

                    27 May 2003 at a meeting between NJS and the Family Defendants. The meeting
                    notes show:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6. Any Other Matters</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As there was no objection, Members unanimously adopted and signed on the

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(iii)   Abandonment of definitive loan repayment
                agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     A definitive agreement relating to the loan
                    repayments was contemplated and provided for in the Loan Repayment Agreement
                    2002 (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above). However, as NJS and
                    the Family Defendants each would not accept the other’s draft definitive
                    agreement no further agreement was entered into and accordingly the Loan
                    Repayment Agreement 2002 remained definitive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In 2004, NJS ceased to be employed by Dovechem
                    Stolthaven. In accordance with the Loan Repayment Agreement 2002 (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above), he began to receive the Monthly Life
                    Allowance. The Company made regular monthly payments of the Monthly Life
                    Allowance until July 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(E)   Emerging from crisis but with unresolved family
                tension</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In 2007, a dispute emerged over NJS’s
                    contention that the Company had wrongly deducted a sum of $429,998.45
                    (“the Mistaken Deduction”) from the principal amount of the loans
                    that he had lent to the Company. This sum, he says, was in effect interest
                    payments, and not loan repayments, made by the Company to him over the
                    years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     A series of conversations and emails took
                    place. In particular, Andrew alleges that in October 2007 when NJS met with him,
                    he was informed that the Company was not able to make immediate payment of the
                    Mistaken Deduction as it was still facing uncertainties and cash flow
                    difficulties having just emerged on 14 May 2007 from the scheme of
                    arrangement it had entered into. In spite of that, on 14 November 2007, the
                    Company sent a letter to NJS (the “letter of 14 November
                    2007”), which stated:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On 26 November 2007, NJS sent an email to
                    Andrew:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear Andrew Ng,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Reference to the Balance Outstanding Interest of S$329,998.45 pertaining
                        to my Individual Loan, please arrange to pay the monthly instalment of
                        S$13,750 together with my monthly interest remittance of S$25,000 starting
                        from December 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Andrew forwarded the email to his assistant and instructed him to
                    “please prepare accordingly”. The Company, by making this
                    Deduction Instalment Repayment (see <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a>
                    above) to NJS, contractually undertook a direct payment obligation to NJS. NJS
                    also claims that, based on the above, there was an agreement under which the
                    Company would repay the Loan in 36 monthly instalments of $140,278.00 over
                    3 years. This is the Loan Instalment Repayment referred to above in
                        <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a>. In return, he says that he accepted
                    repayment of the Mistaken Deduction in the following manner:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a sum of $100,000.00 on 1 November 2007;

                            Instalment Repayment alluded to in <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a>, which would commence from December 2007
                            onwards.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Subsequently, the Company paid NJS:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">$100,000 on 1 November 2007;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">6 payments of $13,750 between January 2008

                            May 2008.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Whilst the Company’s Deduction
                    Instalment Repayment is not disputed, Andrew, however, denies the tenor of the
                    letter of 14 November 2007 (at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>
                    above) to NJS. He maintains that NJS approached him to obtain the letter from
                    the Company for the purposes of supporting a loan application. Andrews denies
                    that the letter was to vary the Restructuring Agreement 2002 that the loan
                    repayments were due only after the scheme of arrangement was completed (see
                        <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above). Andrew admitted that the
                    Mistaken Deduction was due and was to be reinstated as principal owing to NJS.
                    However, the upshot of his evidence was that there was no intention or
                    obligation on the part of the Company to accelerate the repayment plan to
                    3 years as per the letter of 14 November 2007, and this was known to
                    NJS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Company’s letter of 14 November
                    2007 was signed by Andrew as Group Managing Director and copied to the Board of
                    Directors. Payment of the exact instalments duly followed. In the absence of any
                    contradictory evidence, I find that the Company had by this letter (and its
                    making due payment thereon), contractually undertaken to repay NJS the Loan
                    Instalment Repayments in accordance with the terms of this letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(F)   Fighting an internal war</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(i)   NJS attains age of 70 and continues attending
                meetings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     NJS turned 70 on 3 March 2008. As before,
                    he attended the Dovechem Group meeting on 7 April 2008 and the meeting
                    notes disclose no questions having been raised as to his attendance or
                    retirement from the Company’s board. However they do disclose that there
                    was a heated discussion over NJS’s request for a thirteenth month payment
                    which led to his walking out of the meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(ii)   NJS demands inspection of accounting records of Malaysian
                companies</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The tension and acrimony between the parties
                    escalated such that on 11 June 2008 NJS sent a letter to Thiam Joo (M) Sdn
                    Bhd (“TJ Malaysia”), stating that he wished to exercise his right
                    as a director of the company to appoint a public accountant to inspect the
                    accounting and other records of TJ Malaysia. He explained that, in May 2008, he
                    discovered that the funds of TJ Malaysia had been misused. He says that Andrew
                    purported to purchase shares in another company using those funds, while
                    disguising the payment as being made to a supplier. On the same day, NJS also
                    sent a letter to the Company making a request to inspect its records. NJS also
                    filed police reports against Andrew in Malaysia and against Andrew and Anta in
                    Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(iii)   NJS is removed from Malaysian directorships</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In response, NJS received a letter from the
                    Malaysian holding company of the Group on 19 June 2008, signed by the
                    Family Defendants, notifying him of his removal as a director of TJ Malaysia and
                    another Malaysian company, Dovechem Terminals Sdn Bhd. The letter stated that,
                    as he had been removed as a director of TJ Malaysia, it would not be responding
                    to the letter he had sent requesting inspection of its records.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     NJS was subsequently removed from yet another
                    Malaysian company, Imperial Steel Drum Manufacturers Sdn Bhd, on 20 June
                    2008. NJS wrote to the Malaysian companies’ bankers demanding release from
                    his personal guarantees, an act which allegedly caused several bankers to reduce
                    their credit lines to the Malaysian companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(iv)   Commencement of legal proceedings in 2009 disputing
                NJS’s retirement as director</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In Singapore, on 24 June 2008, NJS
                    instituted Suit 59, seeking a declaration that he was wrongfully removed as
                    a director of the Company and an order that he be allowed to inspect the records
                    of the Company. He also later brought Suit 140, claiming the Company
                    breached agreements by which it was obliged to make payment of the Monthly
                    Interest Reimbursement, Monthly Life Allowance, Deduction Instalment Repayment
                    and Loan Instalment Repayment (see <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a>
                    above). In Malaysia, in addition to the police reports he had filed (see
                        <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> above), NJS also launched
                    oppression proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(G)   Wrongful dismissal as director and director’s right to
                inspect accounting and other records of Company</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Here it should be noted that
                        s 173(6)(<em>a</em>) of the Companies Act requires
                    a company to lodge a notice of cessation of directorship with the Accounting and
                    Regulatory Authority of Singapore (“ACRA”) within one month of
                    such cessation. Section 173(6)(<em>a</em>) of the
                    Companies Act enables a director who resigns from office to himself lodge such
                    notice if he has reasonable cause to believe that the company will not lodge it
                    with ACRA. It therefore significant that NJS reached 70 on 3 March 2008 but
                    no action was taken by the Company until 15 July 2008, <em>ie</em>, more than three months later, to notify ACRA of
                    NJS’s purported cessation of directorship. On 14 July 2008 the
                    remaining board of directors of the Company excluding NJS, <em>ie</em>, the Family Defendants, passed a board resolution in
                    writing:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Filing with Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority

                        2008 in accordance with the Ng Family Remuneration Plan dated May 27,
                        2003, Mr Anta Ng be and is hereby authorized to file the appropriate
                        returns with ACRA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     On 15 July 2008, the Company notified
                    ACRA that NJS had ceased to be a director of the Company with effect from
                    5 March 2008. NJS wrote to ACRA to dispute the Company’s notification
                    on 4 August 2008. ACRA wrote to the Company on 20 August 2008
                    requesting the following information/documents:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) Were any meetings held and/or resolutions passed to effect the removal
                        of Ng Joo Soon@Nga Ju Soon as a director of the company? If so, please
                        forward us a copy of said minutes of the meeting and resolutions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) Did Ng Joo Soon@Nga Ju Soon give any consent to be removed as a
                        director of the company? If yes, please forward documentary proof showing
                        that Ng Joo Soon@Nga Ju Soon had consented to be removed as a director of
                        the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     On the same day, NJS’s lawyers wrote to
                    the defendants’ lawyers without prejudice to his position that he remained
                    a director, proposing the appointment of a new director in his place on the
                    boards of the private companies, including the Company, pursuant to cl 4.1
                    of the Restructuring Agreement 2002. NJS proposed to immediately resign and
                    deliver a letter to appoint a director of his choice. Thereafter the other
                    shareholders would “exercise their voting rights for the time being in
                    the relevant Private Company to enable each Parties’ [<em>sic</em>] directors to be appointed and to prevent the passing of any
                    resolution giving effect to the removal from office as director any person so
                    appointed.” The letter also included a request for confirmation that a
                    new director could exercise his rights of inspection of the financial records of
                    the Company. This was rejected by the remaining directors of the Company on the
                    grounds that NJS’s intention was “just so that the new director can
                    then inspect the Records of the Defendant.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     As for ACRA’s questions, the
                    defendants’ lawyers responded to ACRA on 26 August 2008 as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In reply to paragraph 3(a) of your said letter, please be informed
                        that Ng Joo Soon @ Nga Ju Soon (“Ju Soon”) was not removed as
                        a director of the Company. Based on the Ng Family Remuneration Plan dated
                        27/5/03 signed by Joo Soon as well as all the other directors of the Company
                        Joo Soon automatically retired as a director of the Company with effect from
                        5/3/2008 after attaining the age of 70 on 4/3/2008. Enclosed herewith
                        is a photocopy each of the Ng Family Remuneration Plan and the
                        directors’ resolution of the company 14/7/2008 for your easy
                        reference. As Joo Soon automatically retired as a director of the Company
                        with effect from 5/3/2008 pursuant to the Ng Family Remuneration, Plan,
                        there was no necessity in law to hold any meeting or pass any resolution to
                        effect the automatic retirement of Joo Soon as a director of the
                        Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In reply to paragraph 3 (b) of your said letter, we reiterate
                        paragraph 3 hereof and state that by signing the Ng Family Remuneration
                        Plan, Joo Soon has already agreed and consented to automatically retire as a
                        director of the Company with effect from 5/3/2008 after attaining the age
                        of 70 on 4/3/2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I have narrated the background in some detail
                    as it reveals the multifaceted challenges faced by the family: to inject
                    emergency personal loans into the Group and to produce a restructuring plan
                    which would be acceptable to the banks and other creditors; the apparent loss of
                    confidence in NJS as a result of the corporate financial crisis; finding a
                    family member to immediately manage the Group; providing personal guarantees to
                    the banks; cash flow management and asset disposal. Concurrently, the family had
                    to face governance and succession planning problems. Each of these problems
                    would be demanding at the best of times. To have to confront external corporate
                    financial battles whilst concurrently addressing internal generational
                    succession and governance without internal unity is to have to fight a war on
                    all external fronts and a war within.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">(III)   Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The main legal issues arising in the actions
                    before me are as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Whether NJS retired as a director of the Company
                            upon reaching the age of 70? If so, he would not thereafter have had a
                            statutory right to inspect the financial records of the
                        Company.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">What was the contractual agreement, if any,
                            between NJS and the Company in relation to payments of the Monthly
                            Interest Reimbursement, the Monthly Life Allowance, the Deduction
                            Instalment Repayment and the Loan Instalment Repayment?</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">(IV)   Request for inspection and automatic retirement</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(A)   Scope and limitations of statutory right of serving
                directors to inspect the financial records of the company</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Only a serving director has the right to
                    request inspection of the Company’s financial records. Had NJS retired as
                    a director of the Company at the time of his inspection request, he would have
                    had no statutory right to do so (see <em>Haw Par Bros (Pte) Ltd v
                        Dato Aw Kow</em> [1971-1973] SLR(R) 813).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     A director has the absolute right to inspect
                    the accounting books and other records of a company under s 199 of the
                    Companies Act, so long as the right is being exercised to enable him to
                    discharge his duties as a director (<em>Wuu Khek Chiang George v
                        ECRC Land Pte Ltd</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 352
                        (“<em>Wuu Khek Chiang</em>”) at [25] and
                    [33]). He does not need to furnish any particular reason for his request for
                    inspection (see <em>Wuu Khek Chiang</em> at [27] and [34]
                    and <em>Welch and another v Britannia Industries Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 64 (“<em>Welch</em>”) at [29]). In <em>Wuu Lhek
                        Chiang</em>, the Court of Appeal held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    At common law, a director has the right of
                            inspection of any documents such as the accounting and other records of
                            the company and such a right is concomitant of the fiduciary duties of
                            good faith, care, skill and diligence which the director owes to the
                            company. As such, this right like other rights and powers of a director
                            must be exercised for the benefit of the company. This right is
                            recognised in s 199 of the Companies Act ... The language of this
                            provision clearly shows the obligation of the company to allow
                            inspection by its director as mandatory.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">33    The right of a director to inspect the books and
                            records of the company flows from his office as a director and enables
                            him to perform his duties as a director, including the duty to ensure
                            that the company complies with the requirements as to accounts set out
                            in the Companies Act: see s 204(1) of the Act. Such right is an
                            important one, as the books and records of a company are a primary, and
                            sometimes the only, source of information as to the state of affairs of
                            a company. It follows that unless a director has access to these sources
                            of information, he would be severely inhibited in the proper performance
                            of his duties. So long, therefore, as such right is exercised for that
                            purpose and not with a view to causing any detriment to the company, the
                            right to inspect is “absolute”. In this sense and to that
                            extent, the right may be termed “absolute”. The corollary
                            of this is that the right will be lost where it is exercised not to
                            advance the interests of the company but for some ulterior purpose or to
                            injure the company”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     When there are grounds for suspicion and lack
                    of co-operation, a director is all the more entitled and even obliged to act in
                    the interests of the company and ask for inspection. In <em>Welch</em>, the High Court held at [36]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… some boardroom and interfactional discord can be expected.
                        Distrust and even hostility may develop. When there is suspicion and lack of
                        co-operation, a director is all the more entitled, perhaps even obliged, to
                        inspect company accounts to protect the interests of the company and its
                        shareholders. The right is not only to be exercised or the duty imposed when
                        there is harmony within the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">While a company could be justified in denying a director’s
                    request to inspect the company’s records where such request is <em>mala fides</em>, in <em>Wuu Khek
                        Chiang</em> at [34], it was held that the onus of establishing that
                    the right to inspection is being, or will be, exercised for an improper or
                    ulterior purpose against a company lies on the person asserting this:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The onus of establishing that the right is being, or will be, exercised
                        for an improper purpose lies on the person who asserts it: per Isaacs J
                        in <em>Australian Metropolitan Life Assurance Co Ltd v
                            Ure</em> (1923) 33 CLR 199, 219. There is no burden on a
                        director to show any particular reason for his request for inspection
                        – this will ordinarily be assumed: see <em>Molomby v
                            Whitehead</em> (<a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> supra)
                        at 293. It is for those who oppose the director’s right to
                        inspect to show “clear proof” and to satisfy the court
                        “affirmatively” that the grant of the right of inspection
                        would be for the purpose which would be detrimental to the interests of the
                        company. There must be a real ground that the right would be abused and that
                        substantial harm would be caused to the company thereby.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The defendants aver that the Company was
                    justified in not permitting NJS to inspect his financial records as he had
                    “persistently failed, refused and/or neglected to divulge his real reason
                    or for that matter any reason at all for wanting to have access to the financial
                    records”
                    <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> of the
                    Company; and that this request to inspect the Company’s records was part
                    of his “self-serving scheme” to “have his present 24%
                    shareholding increased to 34% and then splitting the Dovechem Group of Companies
                    accordingly so that he can then eventually end up with 34% of the split
                        entity”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     These objections are misconceived. If NJS was
                    still a director at the time he requested for the Company’s records, he
                    would not be obliged to provide a reason for his request. Instead, the onus
                    would lie on the defendants to prove the <em>mala
                        fides</em> they are alleging. However, save for making bare assertions
                    that NJS’s inspection request was <em>mala
                    fides</em>, the defendants have failed to adduce any evidence to show why
                    NJS’s request for inspection of the records was, or will be, detrimental
                    to the interests of the Company. The only remaining issue is whether at the time
                    of the request NJS was still a director of the Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(B)   Retirement of Directors of the Company</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I will next examine the law relating to the
                    retirement of directors and the legal basis of such retirement under the
                    Companies Act, the memorandum and articles of association of the Company,
                    contract and other legal grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(i)   Companies Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Section 153 of the Companies Act provides
                    for the automatic retirement of directors at the age of 70. However, it
                    applies only to public companies. It does not apply to the Company which is a
                    private company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(ii)   Memorandum and articles of association</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The Company’s articles of association
                    provide:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">71    The company may by ordinary resolution remove any

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     It is common ground that NJS has not resigned
                    his office by notice in writing to the company whether before, on or since
                    reaching the age of 70, as contemplated by article 74 of the
                    Company’s articles of association. It is further not averred that NJS has
                    been removed from office by ordinary resolution of the shareholders pursuant to
                    article 71 of the articles of association. There has been no filing of such
                    cessation by retirement or removal by the Company with ACRA within one month of
                    such date as prescribed by s 173 of the Companies Act. Furthermore, the
                    formal directors’ and general meetings’ resolutions and minutes of
                    the Company maintained as required under s 188 of the Companies Act and
                    produced in evidence related only to approvals of the annual directors’
                    report and audited statement of accounts, re-election of directors and
                    appointment of auditors. No formal resolutions or minutes of directors’ or
                    shareholders’ resolutions were produced from this register which revealed
                    any unanimous decision that NJS had or was to retire at 70. Neither were
                    there any directors’ or shareholders’ resolutions or minutes from
                    this register produced which showed the articles of association had been amended
                    such that NJS and all directors were in future to be automatically retired upon
                    reaching the age of 70.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(iii)   Contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     As for contract, neither the Restructuring

                    action provided that NJS was obliged to retire upon reaching 70. The
                    Restructuring Agreement 2002 merely provided that he was to serve as
                    non-executive chairman and had the right to appoint a director in his
                    place.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(iv)   Other legal grounds: informal unanimous assent or
                agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(a)   The <em>Duomatic</em>
                principle</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The defendants averred that NJS had
                    automatically retired from his directorship of the Company upon attaining the
                    age of 70 by reason the Remuneration Plan of 2003, approved by all five
                    years earlier. This Remuneration Plan, the defendants argue, by virtue of his
                    and their signatures on the document and certain Meeting Notes, expressed and
                    recorded the informal agreement of all shareholders. The legal foundation of
                    this averment may be on one of two bases: (a) that the Remuneration Plan evinces
                    the informal (in the absence of a formal board or shareholder resolution)
                    unanimous agreement of all directors and shareholders that NJS would retire when
                    he reached 70 and is binding on all directors, shareholders and the
                    Company, or (b) the Remuneration Plan is a contractual document binding on NJS,
                    all directors and the Company. The second basis was not argued before
                me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The particular question of law raised in this
                    case is whether the informal unanimous assent or agreement of directors or
                    shareholders that all directors would retire in the future upon reaching the age
                    of 70 is binding on the Company and all directors and shareholders, such as
                    to be automatically activated without further action either by the directors or
                    shareholders of the Company as prescribed in the articles of
                association.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Under the <em>Duomatic</em> principle, expounded in <em>Re Duomatic
                        Ltd</em> [1969] 2 Ch 365, the courts have regarded informal
                    unanimous director or shareholder assents to be binding on the company provided
                    it was <em>intra vires</em>. In <em>Re
                        Duomatic</em>, the court upheld the payment of salaries to directors
                    challenged by the liquidator as not having been approved in general meeting in
                    the light of the fact that all the shareholders having the right to attend and
                    vote at a general meeting had assented to this payment which a general meeting
                    could approve. This assent, given by all the directors, who were also the
                    shareholders of the company, was held to be binding as a resolution in general
                    meeting. The <em>Duomatic</em> principle has been applied
                    in Singapore in <em>Jimat bin Awang &amp; Ors v Lai Wee
                        Ngen</em> [1995] 3 SLR(R) 496 and <em>SAL
                        Industrial Leasing Ltd v Lin Hwee Guan</em> [1998]
                    3 SLR(R) 31.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The <em>Duomatic</em>
                    principle has over time been refined and clarified (see D French,
                    S Mayson and C Ryan, <em>Mayson, French &amp; Ryan on
                        Company Law</em> (London: Oxford University Press, 26th ed, 2009)
                    at paras 14.13.1 to 14.13.5). It is inherent in the <em>Duomatic</em> principle that everyone entitled to vote on the
                    question must have applied his mind to it and decided in favour of the step
                    taken (see <em>Re D’Jan of London Ltd</em>
                    [1994] 1 BCLC 561).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The manner of characterisation of the consent

                    on other grounds (see <em>EIC Services Ltd and another v Phipps
                        and others</em> [2005] 1 WLR 1377)), Neuberger J stated
                    at [122] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The essence of the <em>Duomatic</em> principle ... is
                        that, where the articles of a company require a course to be approved by a
                        group of shareholders at a general meeting, that requirement can be avoided
                        if all members of the group, being aware of the relevant facts, either give
                        their approval to that course, or so conduct themselves as to make in
                        inequitable for them to deny that they have given their approval. Whether
                        the approval is given in advance or after the event, whether it is
                        characterised as agreement, ratification, waiver, or estoppels, and whether
                        the members of the group give their consent in different ways at different
                        times, does not matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     With respect to statutory prescriptions, in
                        <em>Monecor (London) Limited v Euro Brokers Holdings
                        Limited</em> [2003] 1 BCLC 506, Mummery LJ at [62] held
                    that the <em>Duomatic</em> principle allows members of a
                    company:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To reach an agreement without the need for strict compliance with formal
                        procedures, where they exist only for the benefit of those who have agreed
                        not [to] comply with them. It does not matter whether the formal procedures
                        in question are stipulated for in the articles of association, in the
                        Companies Act or in a separate contract between the members of the company
                        concerned. What matters is that all the members have reached an agreement.
                        If they have, they cannot be heard to say that they are not bound by it
                        because the formal procedure was not followed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In the case at hand, however, the question is
                    whether the prior informal unanimous assent of all directors and shareholders of
                    the Company to a <em>future</em> action is to be given
                    automatic legal effect upon its occurrence, in the face of the Company’s
                    articles of association which require an activating step which could have (but
                    had not) been undertaken, and in light of the relevant facts at the time of such
                    future occurrence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     I have two principal difficulties with the
                    defendants’ averment at <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a> above.
                    Even if the Remuneration Plan evinces the assent of all directors and
                    shareholders of the Company at that time that NJS was to retire in future upon
                    reaching 70, a further step would necessarily be required to activate such
                    assent as far as the Company and all external persons are concerned. By all
                    accounts, no activation had occurred. In order to activate his retirement when
                    he reached 70, NJS would at such time, under the existing article 74
                    of the Company’s articles of association, have been required to tender a
                    notice of resignation. No such letter of resignation was tendered. Neither was
                    there any formal board resolution recording NJS retirement or resignation. This
                    does not appear on the evidence to have been an oversight of a formality. On the
                    contrary, NJS continued to attend Group meetings as before with neither he nor
                    any of the other shareholders raising any question as to his continued
                    attendance or the capacity in which he was in attendance. Alternatively,
                    activation could have been made by the parties proceeding to amend the articles
                    of association of the Company to insert a new provision that a director would
                    automatically be retired on reaching 70 or that his directorship would
                    automatically become vacant upon reaching this age. No such amendment of
                    articles has been made. When NJS attained the age of 70, neither he nor the
                    Family Defendants (who comprised all the directors and shareholders of the
                    Company) took any step to effect the averred unanimously agreed Remuneration
                    Plan until several months later, when acrimony and disputes emerged between the
                    parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In the light of these difficulties, I am
                    doubtful whether the <em>Duomatic</em> principle came into
                    play here. There was no action taken either by NJS and/or the Family Directors
                    when NJS reached the age of 70 confirming the previous assent, and on the
                    contrary the conduct of all parties at this time was inconsistent with such
                    assent. In the absence of confirming actions by NJS and/or all the other
                    directors and shareholders whose unanimous agreement is relied upon, and in the
                    absence of any amendment of the articles of association to provide for the
                    automatic retirement of all directors including NJS, I would be hesitant,
                    without more, to extend the <em>Duomatic</em> principle to
                    this case. To do so would be to leave unanswered the troubling question (were
                    NJS to be regarded by this court to have retired and vacated his office as
                    director) whether and how this would be binding on the new generation of
                    directors who had previously agreed with NJS that they too would retire at 70,
                    but thereafter amongst themselves decided otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(b)   Remuneration Plan</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Even assuming that an informal unanimous
                    assent as to a future event of retirement as director upon reaching 70 is
                    effective and operates automatically in the future to bind all directors,
                    shareholders and the Company, this does not conclude the matter before me. I
                    would next have to construe the Remuneration Plan, the relevant Meeting Notes
                    and the evidence to determine whether or not these evince the assent of all
                    directors or shareholders that all directors including NJS would automatically
                    retire at 70.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The Remuneration Plan was submitted in
                    evidence as annexed to the Meeting Notes dated 27 May 2003. The copies
                    produced of the Meeting Notes made over time reveal that, for the meetings held
                    on 26 December 2001, 14 January 2002, 11 March 2003, and
                    27 May 2003, all pages were initialled by 2 directors/members and all
                    directors/members signed the last page as “Confirmed, Accepted &amp;
                    Acknowledged” by them. The first Meeting Notes of 26 December 2001
                    additionally concluded with a note: “Chinese translated copy of this
                    minutes [<em>sic</em>] will be provided upon
                    request.” The nature of the Meeting Notes appear to be notes of family
                    business updates, proposals and consensus decisions which would be subsequently
                    implemented by management.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     It was repeatedly pointed out by all witnesses
                    that this was a Chinese family business with participants who had varying
                    degrees of command of English, Mandarin and Hokkien dialect. In short, these
                    appear to be the notes of the discussions amongst all parties of the business
                    and financial matters of the Company and the other family businesses in
                    Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong and China for the period 2001 and 2003
                    right through the corporate and financial crisis. They contain financial and
                    business reports, discussion points, power point presentations, suggestions,
                    comments, plans, proposals and exhortations. The occurrence of every
                    member’s initials on all pages and signatures at the end of each of the
                    Meeting Notes during this period indicates an uneasy transfer of management from
                    NJS to Andrew during the creditor restructuring. It is significant however that
                    the Meeting Notes of 2008 are initialled and signed only by Andrew. This
                    suggests that the documents needed to be initialled and signed only as long as
                    NJS was in attendance and that this was dispensed with after the lawsuits
                    commenced. This suggests at one level that the initialling and signatures on
                    these Meeting Notes were for the purposes of identifying and authenticating the
                    documents and did not necessarily indicate agreement to the content
                    thereof.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     A different case can be made for the
                    signatures of the Remuneration Plan, however. NJS and the Family Defendants all
                    signed the Remuneration Plan, which bore words indicating it had been
                    “confirmed, accepted and acknowledged”. Furthermore, the plan was
                    stipulated as being retrospectively effective from 1 May 2003. These
                    factors are consistent with there being assent or agreement between NJS and all
                    other directors and shareholders of the Company, <em>ie</em>, the Family Defendants, to the Remuneration
                Plan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     I next look at the terms of the Remuneration
                    Plan itself which is cast in a four-page tabulation. Page one is as

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The tabulated Remuneration Plan reveals
                    several critical features. Page 1 provides that Ruling Members are
                    “automatically converted” if they qualify to be Founding Members.
                    The members classified here as Ruling Members describe the new controllers and
                    includes NJS (see Page 4). Critically, the Remuneration Plan expressly
                    states that for Founding Members, the Retirement age is “Not
                    Applicable” (see Page 2). What this means, <em>ex
                        facie</em>, is that NJS was to remain a Ruling Member and member of
                    the Board and Group until he reached the age of 70, following which, in
                    accordance with Page 1 [see 56 above], he would be automatically converted
                    to a Founding Member and would take on a non-executive role for which there was
                    no retirement age. NJS would have automatically qualified by virtue of his
                    having joined the Group for 30 years or before 1980. Whilst NJS is not here
                    classified as a Founding Member but rather as a Ruling Member, the retirement
                    age of Ruling Members is set out as 70 whereupon he is automatically
                    converted to a Founding Member and retains his personal life entitlements. All
                    other Ruling Members are to retire at 70 and do not become Founding Members
                    unless they qualify as having worked with the Group for 30 years or before
                    1980.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Notwithstanding the express language of the
                    Remuneration Plan to the contrary, Ng Ju Tian explained his view that
                    “Non-Executive” in the Remuneration Plan means that they are no
                    longer involved in any capacity (be it as director, employee or otherwise). He
                    is of this view because he notes that none of the members described as Founding
                    Members in the Remuneration Plan were currently directors of the Company. In
                    essence he is of the view that “Non-Executive” means no position,
                    whether executive or non-executive corporate position. However, his view is at
                    variance with what the Remuneration Plan sets out expressly.
                    “Non-Executive” as used in the Remuneration Plan has no meaning
                    save in relation to employment and remuneration arising out of executive or
                    non-executive corporate positions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     There was further evidence of an email from
                    Anta, the author of the Remuneration Plan, to Andrew and Edward Wong, prior
                    to his tabling of it on 27 April 2003, in which he states his draft
                    proposals for consideration in the following way:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As per last board meeting dated 11/3/03, the following is a draft
                        benefits, limits and guidelines proposal for member to consider:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A) Ruling members, maximum no 5 persons. Qualification minimum
                        10 years of working experience, minimum 33 years old. All members
                        above 70 years old must retire. Benefits, chairman (present
                        Mr Soon Sin$35,000.00 a month for life). Future chairman
                        Sin$5,000/month more than other non executive members and end when retire
                        non executive members Sin$11.000/month plus no more than Sin$1,000/month for
                        allowance on personal phone, car and others. Minimum one month bonus. This
                        will end when retire. Executive member (ceo) pay, profit sharing and others
                        as per board decision. All members will have full medical and insurance
                        cover during the term of office. Any change in benefits above mentioned will
                        need full board approval if the change is more than 3%. Otherwise a simple
                        majority will be sufficient.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">B) Working member. Qualification. More than 45 years old, work within
                        the group for more than 20 years, have served as board member for

                        and above. Benefits, Sin$6,000/month plus Sin$5,000/month for working full
                        time. The member will need to retire at 60 years old unless majority of
                        ruling member agree to further extension. When retire the benefits will be
                        Sin$6,000/month plus medical and insurance covers. Any change in above
                        mentioned benefits will need full board approval.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">C) Founding member Qualification Hv joined the group in before 1980 and
                        above 70 years old or work in the group for more than 30 years.
                        They will be paid Sin$2,000/month for life. Pls add your points. We need an
                        upper limits, as we do not want to make the same mistakes as Ming and Qing
                        Dynasties, the benefits for royal members bankrupted the countries as the
                        number of offspring grows. Allison, pls print for Mr Soon, Aik and Tian
                        to comments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The primary intention of Anta in this email
                    appears to be to avoid growing numbers of family members “bankrupting the
                    countries [<em>sic</em> company] as the number of offspring
                    grows” and so the key concepts focus on capping benefits and remuneration
                    for all except for NJS, who was expressly intended to receive payments personal
                    to him. However, Anta’s email does indicate that he thought that all
                    Ruling Members would retire as Ruling Members upon reaching 70 years. There
                    is nothing, however, in his email to suggest that NJS would not only cease to be
                    a Ruling Member but would also have to retire as a non-executive board member
                    upon reaching 70 and, contrary to the Remuneration Plan, not become a
                    Founding Member. Anta’s email did not comprise an integral part of the
                    Remuneration Plan. Whilst Anta had requested that the email be printed for NJS
                    for comment, no evidence was produced that this had in fact been done or that
                    NJS had agreed or signified his agreement by any signature to this email
                    background to Anta’s thinking. For this reason, I am unable to conclude
                    that Anta’s email proposal was an integral part of the Remuneration Plan,
                    and even if it were to be so regarded, by its terms it does not purport to
                    contradict the express terms of the Remuneration Plan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     NJS’s construction of the Remuneration
                    Plan was that, whatever it provided, he, as the founder of the Group, was to be
                    an exception and accordingly had not assented to retiring as a director
                    at 70. In his own words:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A. Well, let me recall. At that time what was said was that our directors
                        would not retire -- or, sorry, our shareholders -- sorry, our shareholders
                        would not retire, but then for those employed directors, there would be
                        retirement. Well, what was discussed was that for the remuneration plan for
                        employed directors they would retire at 70, but then for me, as a
                        founding member, it was not possible for me to retire. Why is it so? It is
                        because I have lent a big sum of money to the company. Furthermore, the
                        company had to pay me each month a sum of US$20,000, which is equivalent to
                        Singapore currency S$35,000 per month. That's for the conversion rates of
                        1.75. And also they had to pay me interest because I had mortgaged my house
                        for $6 to $7 million for the company. And that was why it was not possible
                        for me to retire. What was going to happen if I retire?<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In the light of the provisions of
                    Restructuring Agreement 2002, in which he had a right to be a director or to
                    nominate a replacement, the terms of the Remuneration Plan would be consistent
                    with his agreeing to step down from an executive role into a non-executive
                    chairman role. In the circumstances, I find that nothing in the Remuneration
                    Plan, as authenticated and assented to by all parties, by its express content
                    provided that NJS was to retire as a non-executive director of the Company upon
                    reaching 70. Accordingly NJS remains a director of the Company and he had a
                    statutory right to request to inspect the accounts of the Company as a director
                    under s 199 of the Companies Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">(V)   The Company’s Obligations in respect of the Repayment
                Claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     I now turn to the payment claims by NJS from
                    the Company. Those claims (collectively “the Repayment Claims”)
                    are as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the Monthly Interest Reimbursement of

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the Monthly Life Allowance of US$20,000.00 or

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     It was the Family Defendants’ evidence
                    in court that the Company had been paying the Repayment Claims, but they decided
                    and procured the Company to cease paying the Monthly Interest Reimbursement and
                    the Monthly Life Allowance to NJS after June 2008 because NJS had commenced
                    these legal actions against the Company and them. The Family Defendants denied
                    that the Company had to pay the Deduction Instalment Repayment and the Loan
                    Instalment Repayment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Under the Loan Repayment Agreement 2002
                    between NJS and the Family Defendants, to which the Company was not a party, the
                    parties had confirmed the following payables to NJS and agreed to conclude a
                    definitive agreement for the same, <em>viz</em> (i) the
                    repayment of NJS’s Loan of $5,050,001.55, (ii) the Monthly Life Allowance
                    in the event NJS resigned or retired as chairman of the board of Dovechem
                    Stolthaven Limited and (iii) the payment of interest on the Loan which took the
                    form of the Monthly Interest Reimbursement. The parties had also agreed that the
                    repayment of the Loan would commence after the completion of the schemes of
                    arrangement, <em>ie</em>, May 2007 and payments of interest
                    on the Loan were ongoing and would continue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     As mentioned above, no definitive agreements
                    were concluded between the parties as contemplated by the Loan Repayment

                        question of construction whether the execution of the further contract is a
                        condition or term of the bargain or whether it is a mere expression of the
                        desire of the parties as to the manner in which the transaction ... will in
                        fact go through.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although the Loan Repayment Agreement 2002 contemplated a further
                    agreement, in my view, it was not in itself conditional upon any further
                    agreement. It is capable of standing on its own, and it did so, when no further
                    definitive agreement materialised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     I would also add at this point that, as these
                    are the very same Meeting Notes that NJS relies on for the purposes of
                    establishing his Repayment Claims, they bear the same limitations and caveats
                    insofar as reliance is placed on them by either party for the purposes of
                    establishing a contract and its terms between the Company and NJS. The
                    plaintiff’s Repayment Claims in Suit 140 are premised on a contract
                    with the Company. It would be necessary to determine by what means there came to
                    be a contract between the Company and NJS, quite apart from the Meeting Notes
                    which do not have the legal effect that directors’ and shareholders’
                    resolutions or minutes or corporate agreements might have.</p>

                    that the Company agreed and paid the Monthly Life Allowance and the Monthly

                            for life, and you have stopped that payment simply because you claim
                            that this lawsuit was started? You're not entitled to stop the

                    NJS, paid the Monthly Interest Reimbursement aggregated at $25,000 per month as
                    reimbursement of the interest paid by NJS right up to the filing of these
                    actions. As the Company had contractually undertaken to repay the Loan and the
                    Monthly Interest Reimbursement, from the time the Company ceased to pay these
                    sums it was in breach of its contractual obligations. Similarly, I find that the
                    Company had contracted to pay the Monthly Life Allowance, and therefore, from
                    the time it ceased to pay this sum, it was in breach of contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(B)   The Deduction Instalment Repayment and the Loan Instalment
                Repayment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The basis of NJS’s claim for the
                    Deduction Instalment Repayment and the Loan Instalment Repayment has been
                    discussed above in <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>–<a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>. It was not disputed that the Mistaken
                    Deduction was made by mistake and agreed by all parties to be repayable. The
                    Company had paid NJS $100,000 on 1 November 2007 followed by five monthly
                    sums of $13,750 commencing in December 2007. I note also that on 7 November
                    2007, the plaintiff sent an email to Andrew confirming the terms of
                    agreement:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To: [the Company]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Attn: All Directors via Andrew Ng</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Reference to my individual Loan of S$5,050,001.l55 extended to [the
                        Company] since 1997, please arrange to pay me within 3 years period by
                        monthly instalments of S$140,278 per month.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Reference to the Balance Outstanding Interest of S$329,998.45 pertaining
                        to this said Individual Loan, please arrange to pay me within 2 years period
                        by monthly instalments of S$13,750 per month.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please arrange to make the first payments of these two monthly instalments
                        of S$140,278 &amp; S$13,750 respectively effective December 2007 to
                        me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There was no response from Andrew or any of the other directors on
                    behalf of the Company denying this agreement, or stating that any conditions had
                    to be fulfilled before the Loan Instalment Repayment would be
                paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     This email is contemporaneous with the Loan
                    Instalment Repayment described in <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>, and
                    the monthly payment of $13,750 described in it is consistent with repaying the
                    remaining $329,998.45 in 24 equal monthly instalments commencing in
                    December 2007. The Company had paid NJS $100,000.00 on 1 November 2007 and
                    five Deduction Instalment Repayments.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> I do not accept the defendants’
                    version that these payments were made purely out of goodwill and conditional on
                    NJS providing documentary evidence in support, and that the Loan Instalment
                    Repayments were conditional upon the agreement of the other parties and the
                    Company having available funds. In these circumstances I find that the Company
                    had contracted to make these payments and remains contractually bound to pay the
                    balance monthly instalments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     With respect to the Loan, the Loan Repayment
                    Agreement 2002 does not contain any provisions as to the repayment of the
                    outstanding loan save that clause 3 of the Loan Repayment Agreement 2002
                    provides that the repayment of the Loan shall commence after completion of the
                    “Loan Restructuring Exercise” which is defined to be the scheme of
                    arrangement. This scheme of arrangement was completed by the time of the email
                    of 7 November 2007 by NJS to Andrew. Consistent with the earlier email, the
                    Company issued the letter of 14 November 2007 from Andrew as the Group
                    Managing Director and copied to the Board of Directors, to the effect that the
                    Company contracted to repay the Loan by 36 monthly instalments of $140,278.
                    Upon cross examination in Court, both Andrew and Anta confirmed that the letter
                    on the Company’s letterhead signed by Andrew the Group Managing Director
                    was binding on the Company. Evidence was also adduced of a draft of this letter
                    which was headed “without prejudice” and contained a line stating
                    that “The company will endeavour to pay subject to available
                    funds”, but both of these were omitted on the final letter sent to NJS.
                    It is trite law that the letter of the Company signed by its managing director
                    and copied to all directors is binding on the Company (see <em>Koh Kia Hiong v Guo Enterprises Pte Ltd</em> [1999]
                    2 SLR(R) 673). It is undisputed that the Company paid NJS and six Loan
                        Instalments<em><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></em> from January 2008 to May 2008.
                    Accordingly I find the Company to have contracted to repay the Loan in
                    36 equal instalments and that it remains liable to pay the balance

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     For completeness I should dispose of the
                        <em>pro forma</em> defence of moneylending raised by
                    the defendants to resist the plaintiff’s claims of repayment of the loans
                    and interest. I can do no better than to refer to <em>City
                        Hardware Pte Ltd v Kenrich Electronics Pte Ltd</em> [2005]
                    1 SLR(R) 733 (“<em>City
                    Hardware</em>”), where VK Rajah J noted at [47]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The defence of moneylending is often invoked in Singapore by unmeritorious
                        defendants who are desperate to stave off their financial woes. Such
                        defendants should not regard the [Moneylenders Act] as a legal panacea. It
                        should be viewed as a scheme of social legislation designed to regulate
                        rapacious and predatory conduct by unscrupulous unlicensed moneylenders. Its
                        pro-consumer protection ethos was never intended to impede legitimate
                        commercial intercourse or to sterilise the flow of money. It is not meant to
                        curtail the legitimate financial activity of commercial entities that are
                        capable of making considered business decisions. The court has always taken
                        and will continue to take a pragmatic approach in assessing situations when
                        this defence is raised. The [Moneylenders Act] is not invariably contravened
                        in transactions where the object of the transaction is to raise money. In
                        the final analysis, the economic objective of an arrangement to provide
                        credit should not be confused with its legal nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(D)   Conspiracy and inducing breach of contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The plaintiff finally seeks damages against
                    the Family Defendants for inducing the Company to breach its contract with him
                    and for conspiracy. In the present case, the main issue relevant to the tort of
                    conspiracy and the main issue relevant to the tort of inducing breach of
                    contract are one and the same – can directors of a company be liable for
                    these torts when that company breaches a contract with a third
                party?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     
          <em>Said v Butt</em>
                    [1920] 3 KB 497 is the longstanding authority for the proposition that
                    a director is immune from liability for inducing the company’s breach of
                    contract because the director is the company’s <em>alter
                        ego</em> and his acts are in law those of the company. McCardie J
                    laid down the following rule at 506:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... if a servant acting <em>bona fide</em> within the
                        scope of his authority procures or causes the breach of a contract between
                        his employer and a third person, he does not thereby become liable to an
                        action of tort at the suit of the person whose contract has thereby been
                        broken.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The same position was adopted by Woo Bih Li J in <em>Chong Hon Kuan Ivan v Levy Maurice and others</em> [2004]
                    4 SLR(R) 801 (“<em>Chong Hon
                    Kuan</em>”) in relation to both the tort of inducing breach of
                    contract and the tort of conspiracy. In that case, Woo J considered and
                    rejected the wider position suggested by the Newfoundland Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Imperial Oil Ltd v C&amp;G</em> (1989) 62 DLR
                    (4th) 261 that a director is liable for a company’s contractual breach if
                    his predominant intention was to injure the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     I would adopt the same position taken by
                    Woo J in <em>Chong Hon Kuan</em>. NJS’s claims
                    in Suit 140 for repayment are all claims against the Company. Even if the
                    Company is in breach of its contractual obligations, the fact that the Family
                    Defendants are directors of the Company would not on its own give rise to a
                    separate personal cause of action of inducing breach of contract as they were
                    acting within the scope of their authority. It was within their authority as
                    directors to act on behalf of the Company in this regard. In the circumstances
                    of this case, whilst they may have been mistaken, I am not persuaded on the
                    evidence that the Family Defendants were acting without <em>bona
                        fides</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">(VI)   Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     For the reasons above, I give judgment for NJS
                    against the Company for Suit 59 and Suit 140 but do not allow the
                    further reliefs sought against the Family Defendants. NJS is entitled to his
                    costs, to be agreed or taxed.</p>
