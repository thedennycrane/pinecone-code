<strong>Judgment

                                                                                        

</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">        This was an appeal against

the decision of Mavis Chionh DJ. The appellant, Yeo Chiang Chew (‘Yeo’) was

convicted of a charge under s 57(1)(e) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133) (‘the

Act’). The charge alleged that between the end of September 2001 and 12 November

2001, Yeo had employed an illegal immigrant, one Lin Rui Chai (‘Lin’) at

"Yi Xin Shu Shi" Stall at Yishun Ring Road, with reasonable grounds to believe

that Lin was an immigration offender. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2        Under s 57(ii) of the Act,

Yeo was liable for a jail sentence between six months and two years as well as a fine not

exceeding $6,000. Yeo was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment and appealed against

both conviction and sentence.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The offence</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3        The <i>actus reus</i> of

employment in this case was not disputed. An agreed statement of facts which was admitted

agreed that Lin had entered Singapore illegally from Malaysia sometime at the end of

September 2001, without any valid entry or work permit. She had already been convicted of

a charge of entering Singapore without a valid pass and another charge of entering

Singapore whilst under a ban, without written permission from the Controller of

Immigration. It was also admitted that Lin was employed by Yeo at her stall from sometime

around the end of September 2001 to 12 November 2001 and was paid about $5 an hour for

washing dishes and cleaning the stall. She was paid by Yeo either daily or once every two

to three days.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4        Only the <i>mens rea</i> of

the offence was in dispute. Yeo claimed that she had believed Lin to be a Singapore

permanent resident because Lin had shown her a "blue IC" prior to starting work.

The district judge held, following <i>Assathamby s/o Karupiah v PP </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=46361&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 2 SLR 744</a>,

that if Yeo had genuinely believed in Lin’s permanent resident status, she would have

a complete defence to the charge.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The prosecution’s case</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5        The prosecution’s case

was that Lin did not show Yeo any "blue IC", so Yeo could not have believed Lin

to be a Singapore permanent resident on that ground. Lin herself denied having any blue IC

or having shown any such identity card to Yeo. She testified that it was Yeo who

approached her for the job and no one at the stall asked her for identification documents,

nor had she shown such documents to anyone. On the day she was arrested, she was only

permitted to bring along her purse. SSgt Abdul Halim, the investigation officer of the

case, testified that no identification documents were seized from or found on Lin. The

arresting officer, SSgt Cindy Yong Jong Hoi (‘SSgt Yong’) testified that she had

searched Lin and tried to ascertain whether Lin had identification documents elsewhere

other than on her person, but Lin did not have any such documents.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The case for the defence</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6        Yeo testified that Lin was

the one who approached her for a part-time job and she had accepted Lin only after being

shown a blue-coloured IC with a photograph of a person who "looked the same as"

Lin. She did not take note of the name shown on the IC and could not remember what Lin had

said her name was. She called Lin "Big-size" and her other workers addressed Lin

as "Xiao Mei". She also did not know Lin’s exact address. The other two

defence witnesses, Yeap Ah Yam (‘Yeap’) and Phang Kia Lau (‘Phang’),

both of whom were workers at Yeo’s stall, confirmed that it was Lin who approached

Yeo for a job and that Yeo had told Lin to bring her IC. They both testified to having

seen Lin show Yeo a blue IC with a photograph resembling Lin herself.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7        It was not disputed that in

her long statement of 12 November 2001 and in her cautioned statement, Yeo had mentioned

Lin showing her a blue IC.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify">The appeal</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8        The district judge found

that Yeo’s story about the "blue IC" was entirely fabricated. She was

satisfied that Yeo had failed to rebut the presumption of <i>mens rea</i>. In Yeo’s

appeal against conviction, it was submitted that the district judge erred in fact and in

law:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) when holding that she believed the assertion of Lin that no blue

    identity card was ever produced to Yeo;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) when holding that the evidence of Yeo was highly unsatisfactory

    and finding Yeo’s story of the blue IC a pure fabrication;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) by failing to place emphasis on the fact that Yeo had in her long

    statement mentioned the blue IC;</p>
<p align="justify">(iv) by not accepting the evidence of the two workers as corroboration;</p>
<p align="justify">(v) by holding that Yeo did not have any genuine belief that Lin was a

    permanent resident simply because she looked non-Singaporean and spoke strongly-accented

    Mandarin.</p>
<p align="justify">(vi) by concluding that Yeo had reasonable grounds to believe that Lin

    was a immigration offender.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9        The district judge’s

decision stemmed entirely from the fact that she did not believe any of the defence

witnesses. In paragraphs 30 and 31 of her grounds of decision, she clearly explained why

she did not believe Yeo:</p>
<font size="2" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote></blockquote></font><font size="3" xmlns=""><p align="justify">30 The accused, on the other hand, struck me as

    being a shifty and disingenuous witness. In the course of watching her in the witness

    stand, I formed the distinct impression that she was attempting to put on a show of being

    even more simple-minded than Lin. From time to time, when asked questions by the DPP and

    by me, she would shake her head and mutter loudly about her lack of comprehension. Yet,

    when it suited her, she was able to answer questions readily and even, on occasion, to

    prompt the court interpreter.</p>
<p align="justify">31 The accused also showed herself capable of giving ambiguous and

    evasive answers when it suited her, leading to questions having to be repeated numerous

    times by the DPP and finally by me. It became clear that she was most evasive when

    cross-examined about her account of Lin’s production of the "blue IC". It

    must have been obvious to her that there were various loopholes in this story. According

    to the accused, she only employed Lin after being convinced that Lin was a permanent

    resident. According to the accused, also, she would not have employed Lin if the latter

    had produced a forged IC. Having regard to these assertions, it was very odd that after

    taking the trouble to require proof of Lin’s PR-status, she should have taken only a

    "cursory glance" at the "blue IC". It was also extremely odd that

    whilst she apparently took care to ensure the photograph on the IC was Lin’s, she

    failed entirely to notice any of the personal particulars on the IC, not even the name or

    the address.</p>
</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10        As for the other two

defence witnesses Yeap and Phang, the district judge at paragraph 35 stated that she

"found their evidence equally disingenuous and glib". In fact, she found that

Phang was not working at the stall at all when Lin started work and so, could not have

seen Lin show Yeo any blue IC. There were also "strange inconsistencies" among

the testimonies of all three defence witnesses. In paragraph 40, the district judge held

that "both Yeap and Phang struck me as being overly eager and suspiciously rehearsed

in their accounts of the "blue IC" incident. On careful assessment, I found

their evidence to be of no credibility and thus no corroborative value." </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11        On the other hand, the

district judge found Lin to be an honest witness after observing her closely in the

witness stand. She considered Lin "simple-minded and guileless" (at paragraph

29) and believed her when she said that she did not show Yeo any blue IC.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12        I found it difficult to

accept any of the arguments raised by the defence counsel once the district judge lost

faith in the credibility of the defence witnesses, since it is trite law that an appellate

court will not disturb the findings of fact of the court below unless they are clearly

reached against the weight of the evidence: <i>Lim Ah Poh </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=6012&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1992] 1 SLR 713</a>. In

examining the evidence, the appellate court has to bear in mind that it has neither seen

nor heard the witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judge’s findings and

reasons therefor. Moreover, seldom does a district judge go this far in discrediting a

witness and detailing her reasons for doing so. It was quite clear that she had no doubts

about the lack of truth in what the defence witnesses were claiming. In the absence of

objective evidence, it was impossible to expect me to allow the appeal.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13        It must further be borne

in mind that this was a case where a statutory presumption had been placed on the accused

and the burden was on her to rebut it on a balance of probabilities. This is the policy

decision taken by Parliament. If the district judge did not believe her and her

witnesses’ story, and she had no further objective evidence to back her up (such as a

photocopy of the blue IC to say the least), I could only defer to the better judgment of

the district judge since I myself did not have the opportunity to observe the demeanour of

the witnesses. Once it was held that Yeo was not in fact shown a blue IC by Lin, there was

no need to consider any further questions on due diligence. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14        As for the sentence, I

found no reason to disturb it as it was not manifestly excessive. A 12-month imprisonment

is the benchmark in cases where an offender is convicted after trial of a s 57(1)(e)

Immigration Act offence: <i>Hameed Sultan Raffic v PP </i>(MA No 257 of 2000); <i>PP v

Chia Kang Meng </i>(MA No 71 of 2001).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15        For the reasons above, I

dismissed the appeal against conviction and sentence.</p>
