<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff HSBC Institutional Trust Services
                    (Singapore) Limited (“the Landlord”) was and is the landlord of a
                    unit at 3 Temasek Boulevard #01-104/106 Suntec City Mall Singapore 038983
                    (“the Unit”). The defendant Valuezy Pte Ltd (“the
                    Tenant”) had entered into a lease agreement with the Landlord dated
                    19 January 2009 for the Unit. However, the Tenant failed to pay the rent
                    for some months and eventually the Landlord took back possession of the Unit.
                    The Landlord commenced this action to claim outstanding rent and damages. It
                    obtained interlocutory judgment against the Tenant with damages to be assessed.
                    The damages (including outstanding rent) were assessed at $798,566.49. After
                    deducting a security deposit of $165,312.00, the balance was $633,254.49.
                    Interest at the rate of 4% above the prime lending rate of the United Overseas
                    Bank Limited was also allowed. The Tenant appealed against the assessment of
                    $798,566.49. I dismissed its appeal with costs. The Tenant has filed an appeal
                    to the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The court’s reasons</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The lease of the Unit was for a term of three
                    years from 15 July 2008 to 14 July 2011. The rent had two components:
                    the fixed rent and the percentage rent. The fixed rent per month was $26.60 per
                    square foot making a total of $39,261.60 (which worked out to $42,009.91 with 7%
                    goods and services tax (“GST”)). The monthly service charge was
                    $1.20 per square foot making a total of $1,771.20 (which worked out to $1,895.18
                    with GST). The monthly promotion fund contribution was $0.20 per square foot
                    making a total of $295.20 (which worked out to $315.86 with GST).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       A letter dated 20 December 2008 from the
                    Tenant’s solicitors Dilip Maran Partnership to the Landlord’s
                    solicitors, Robert Wang &amp; Woo LLC, stated that the Landlord was in breach of
                    the lease agreement for a reason which I need not elaborate on as this
                    contention is no longer in issue. It gave notice to terminate the
                    agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       An email dated 22 December 2008 from the
                    Tenant to the Landlord stated that the Tenant would vacate the Unit by
                    31 December 2008 (although the heading of that email inadvertently referred
                    to different premises).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       A letter dated 2 January 2009 from the
                    Tenant’s solicitors to the Landlord’s solicitors stated that the
                    Tenant had vacated the Unit on 31 December 2008 and as there was a
                    restoration period of ten days, this would commence from 1 to 10 January
                    2009 and the keys would be returned to the Landlord on 11 January
                    2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Landlord did not accept the Tenant’s
                    allegation about the Landlord’s breach. In a letter dated 15 January
                    2009, its solicitors informed the Tenant’s solicitors that its position
                    was that the lease was in full force and effect. However, should the Tenant
                    deliver the keys to the Unit to the Landlord, the Landlord would market the Unit
                    to prospective tenants to mitigate its damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Unfortunately, the Tenant did not hand over the
                    keys to the Landlord promptly. Instead, through its solicitors, it accused the
                    Landlord of causing its security guards to prevent the Tenant from commencing
                    reinstatement work. The Landlord’s solicitors did not address this
                    allegation directly until later (on 24 March 2009) to deny the same. In the
                    meantime, the Landlord’s solicitors repeatedly mentioned that if the keys
                    were delivered to them, the Landlord would market the Unit to mitigate its
                    damages. There was no demand by the Landlord that the Unit had to be restored to
                    its original state. However, the keys were not handed over by the Tenant.
                    Apparently it then took the position that the keys belonged to it as the Unit
                    was handed to it in a bare state before the commencement of the
                lease.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The correspondence between the two firms of
                    solicitors went along similar lines for about three months when eventually the
                    Landlord’s solicitors wrote on 9 April 2009 to say that it would
                    resume possession of the Unit on 14 April 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Unfortunately, the Tenant’s solicitors did
                    not see this letter until 15 April 2009. Hence, the Tenant did not turn up
                    for the handover of the Unit on 14 April 2009. Nevertheless, the Landlord
                    said that it had taken possession of the Unit in the afternoon of 14 April
                    2009 although it is not clear how it did so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Eventually, the Landlord secured a new lessee
                    Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited (“OCBC”) for the Unit
                    for three years from 1 September 2009. The fixed rent was $19.60 per square
                    foot. Including GST, the total for the fixed rent component was $30,954.67 per
                    month. The service charge and promotion fund contribution were for the same
                    amounts as in the Tenant’s lease. The Landlord secured OCBC by calling
                    OCBC in May 2009. Thereafter, a letter of offer dated 16 June 2009 was
                    given to OCBC. With a fitting out period of one month, the new lease commenced
                    on 1 September 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Landlord computed its claim as
                    follows:</p>

<p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">This sum was primarily for

<p class="Judg-1">The total for both periods was $798,566.49. After deducting a security
                    deposit of $165,312.00, the balance due to the Landlord was
                $633,254.49.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Tenant disputed liability for the arrears
                    of rent for the first period on the argument that the Landlord prevented it from
                    restoring the Unit to its original condition and hence it could not return the
                    Unit to the Landlord earlier. Had it returned the Unit to the Landlord earlier,
                    the Landlord would have commenced its efforts to look for another lessee
                    earlier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Yet, the Tenant’s counsel accepted that
                    the Landlord was not obliged in law to accept the return of the Unit earlier.
                    This concession undermined the Tenant’s objection to the claim for the
                    arrears of rent for the first period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     I would add that the Tenant could have simply
                    asked for an appointment with the Landlord to hand over the keys of the Unit to
                    the Landlord earlier as the Landlord had repeatedly intimated. The Landlord had
                    not insisted on restoration of the Unit then. However, for some reason unknown
                    to me, the Tenant did not do so. Instead, the solicitors for each side were
                    engaged in prolonged correspondence without achieving anything and it was only
                    on 9 April 2009 that the Landlord put an end to the stalemate by
                    stipulating 14 April 2009 as the date when the Landlord would take
                    possession of the Unit and in fact taking possession on that date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In my view, the Tenant remained liable for
                    rent until 13 April 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As for the period thereafter, the Tenant
                    challenged the quantum of damages claimed by the Landlord on various
                    grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     First, the Tenant alleged that it was not
                    enough for the Landlord to advertise the availability of units generally in the
                    development. It argued that the advertisements should have specifically
                    identified the Unit. I did not agree. There must be various units in the
                    development available for lease over time and the number of units and the
                    individual units available would vary from time to time. To identify the
                    specific units available would mean constant changes to the text of the
                    advertisements which was, in my view, unnecessary in the present case unless
                    there was some special feature of the Unit which should have been
                    highlighted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     There was no evidence to show that had the
                    Landlord taken any further step after 14 April 2009, beyond the steps it
                    had in fact taken, it would have secured another lessee earlier than
                    1 September 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Tenant also questioned the quantum of the
                    fixed rent to OCBC at $19.60 per square foot as compared with its own fixed rent
                    at $26.60 per square foot. The Tenant alleged that the rent to OCBC was too low
                    but it did not offer any evidence as to what a fair rent would be at that time.
                    It seemed to me that the Tenant was simply trying to find fault with whatever
                    the Landlord was able to achieve.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In the circumstances, I was of the view that
                    the Tenant was also liable for the sum claimed for the second
                period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Accordingly, I dismissed the Tenant’s
                    appeal.</p>
