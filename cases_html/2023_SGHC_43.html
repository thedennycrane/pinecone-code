</div>
</div> It is perhaps the approach a liquidator might take. Hence, appointing judicial managers will likely achieve the survival of the Companies or part of them as going concerns (perhaps together with a future scheme of compromise or arrangement) or a more advantageous realisation of their assets than a winding up. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The fundamental premise of their submission is that there is a real prospect of a “holistic” and achievable offer from GDPS (or others).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In my judgment, the evidence put before the court does not demonstrate any such real prospect. It does not rise above a possible, speculative, hoped for outcome, the likelihood of which, given the Companies’ experience of the past few years, is relatively low.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The most important reason for my conclusion is that there is insufficient evidence that GDPS is seriously interested in reaching a workable deal. Mr Koh’s counsel said that to the “best of Koh’s knowledge and belief, GDPS remains willing to negotiate their investment, and will do so with the JM if appointed”.

</div> This exchange concerned a possible deal between <span class="font-italic">LOGOS and GDPS</span>. Ms Zhang’s response to Mr Koh was that GDPS was interested to talk <span class="font-italic">to LOGOS</span>, but only concerning LOGOS’s 49.01% share in YK PropCo.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Letter from Providence Law Asia dated 22 February 2023.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I do not think that this belated update provides any assistance to Mr Koh’s case. If anything, its continued lack of clarity after all this time makes it less likely that further exploration with GDPS will lead to a deal, let alone a better one. Moreover, GDPS had the opportunity to participate in the sales process run by the Receivers, but did not make a clear, workable and acceptable proposal. Following the running of that process, LOGOS now holds accrued rights. The context for any assessment of what is in the best interests of creditors is necessarily dynamic, both in relation to market conditions and the steps taken by other potential buyers. Thus, the untimeliness of GDPS’s conduct weighed against the clock being turned back in its favour.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 It is also material that the Founders have had the opportunity to achieve a “holistic” solution but have not to date been able to. There is nothing to suggest that judicial managers will be able to achieve what the Founders could not. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Importantly, the making of the judicial management orders will only serve to displace the boards of YK HoldCo and YK PropCo. The Receivers will remain in place as receivers over the YK HoldCo Charged Shares. Mr Yap and Mr Koh accept that any “holistic” deal will likely involve the sale of the YK PropCo Charged Shares (already included in the LOGOS deal) as well as sale of the YK HoldCo Charged Shares. This means that any sale process following the making of judicial management orders will require prospective buyers to deal with <span class="font-italic">three</span> sets of insolvency professionals rather than just one. It is hard to see how this will be to the advantage of any potential sale process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 This brings me to the principal advocated advantage of making the judicial management orders, namely that the judicial managers will be independent of the bondholders and will more objectively evaluate the LOGOS deal. First, the evidence suggests that the Receivers have in fact been objective and professional, as well as diligent in their efforts. This is evident from Maybank’s support for the LOGOS deal. Indeed, neither Mr Yap nor Mr Koh (nor anyone else) has come out against the LOGOS deal. The support for the JM Applications is rooted in the hope that some better deal may eventuate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Second, that the Receivers are accountable to the bondholders is something that was built into the security arrangements for the bonds, arrangements which the Founders had obviously agreed to. The fact that the Receivers were appointed pursuant to such agreed arrangements undercuts the Founders’ complaint that the Receivers are accountable to the bondholders rather than to creditors generally. That was precisely the intent of the security arrangement. Here I find that Mr Koh, while ostensibly a creditor of YK LogCo (as of the week before the filing of OA 883), brought these proceedings because of his concerns stemming from his position as one of the Founders. I infer that Mr Koh sought to portray himself as a “creditor” for the purpose of filing OA 883. It is not surprising that he is concerned that his vision of an integrated end-to-end logistics solutions provider may not endure, but that eventuality is not the fault of the Receivers. Mr Koh became a creditor knowing full well that the Receivers were in place and proceeding with the LOGOS deal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35  In relation to OA 873, it bears emphasis that the bondholders are the largest creditors of YK HoldCo. In relation to OA 883, the bondholders are not creditors of YK LogCo, but it is nevertheless apparent that the LOGOS deal will bring benefit to the creditors generally, as confirmed by Maybank’s counsel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 For avoidance of doubt, I have not come to a concluded view that Mr Koh has standing as a creditor of YK LogCo. It is not necessary for me to do so given my conclusion on the merits of OA 883.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Thus, I conclude that there is no real prospect that the statutory purposes of judicial management will be achieved by the JM Applications in the case of either YK HoldCo or YK LogCo. Additionally, I hold that in all the circumstances of this matter, judicial management orders would not be in the best interests of the creditors considered as a whole. Consequently, I would not have exercised my discretion to make such orders in any event. Lastly, and for completeness, I hold that public interest does not require the making of judicial management orders in this case. There really was no basis for the submission that it did.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I dismiss both OA 873 and OA 883.
