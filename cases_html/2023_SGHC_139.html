Testing and detection of the virus were par for the course, and consequently, demand for rapid virus detection test kits surged. Correspondingly, there was much business to be made by manufacturers, middlemen and suppliers. This case concerns a transaction between the Government of the City of Buenos Aires and a Singapore company for the supply of Covid-19 test kits. The plaintiff government sought to acquire test kits for its people and the defendant company sought to make a profit. The subsequent non-delivery of the test kits gave rise to the present dispute.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The plaintiff is the Government of the City of Buenos Aires, Argentina.

A key pillar of this strategy was to acquire rapid virus detection test kits. As there was a global shortage of supplies, the plaintiff publicly sourced test kits by informally contacting manufacturers and distributors of these test kits, both nationally and internationally, and requested them to present their proposals for the supply of test kits. This Health Emergency framework was established by Urgent Necessity Decrees under Argentine law and termed the “[p]rocurement of rapid test kits for the identification of antibodies to the new coronavirus (COVID-19)”.

The estimated delay was up to seven days. On 16 May 2020, the plaintiff responded by expressing that it was very disappointed by the delay and that the plaintiff expected urgent communication of the official delivery date.

In particular, the plaintiff was kept informed by HN Singapore “of the progress of the production of the Test Kits”, “of fresh regulations in China”, and “of [Wondfo’s] efforts to expedite the export and delivery”. The plaintiff also liaised with HN Singapore for the provision of “a letter of commitment that … [Wondfo] had requested to enable the Test Kits to be exported”, “for the fresh delivery date of the Test Kits”, “on [Wondfo’s] request for the details of one technician/health professional from the [p]laintiff to implement the Test Kits”, “on the logistics of the delivery” and “on providing a guarantee for the fulfilment of the [Varied SPA]”.

Additionally, the plaintiff argues that Mr Eng has evinced a pattern of fraudulent conduct. This is illustrated by the alleged falsification of the Wondfo Invoice. Mr Eng received the Wondfo Invoice on 28 April 2020. The Wondfo Invoice was dated 20 April 2020, and stated a purchase price of US$821,137.50. However, when the Wondfo Invoice was forwarded to the plaintiff on 29 April 2020, the purchase price, date and other information had been removed. The invoice sent to the plaintiff also contained an endorsement of “HN Singapore Pte Ltd” at the corner of the page. The plaintiff argue that Mr Eng removed the purchase price and date from the Wondfo Invoice to mislead the plaintiff as to HN Singapore’s profit arising from the Varied SPA, as well as to obscure the fact that the invoice was only issued two days after the intended delivery date.

</div> The defendants argue that the defendants made no attempt to conceal the corporate structure of HN Singapore and that the plaintiff has provided no authority that such a structure is problematic under Singapore law. Additionally, given that the Covid-19 pandemic only began at the start of 2020, HN Singapore’s lack of experience in supplying test kits is expected. Further, the alleged “unusual features” of the Varied SPA were accepted by the plaintiff, and simply amount to “a difference in practice”.

In the absence of an express provision in the contract, one moves to the second stage, which is whether a common intention of the parties to choose a governing law can be inferred. If the court is faced with a multiplicity of factors, each pointing to a different governing law, one then moves to the third stage, which is to determine the law with the closest and most real connection with the contract. That law would be taken, objectively, as the governing law of the contract (<span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span> at [36], [37], [46] and [47]; <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore </span>vol 6(2) (LexisNexis, 2020 Reissue) at para 75.343).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The decision </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In this case, as there is no express provision in the Varied SPA for a governing law, the first stage is inapplicable. Therefore, I move to the second stage. In <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span> at [37], the Court of Appeal set out a non-exhaustive list of factors from which an inference of the parties’ intention can be drawn. These include the language or terminology used in the contract, the form of the documents involved in the transaction, the currency of the contract, the places of residence or business of the parties and the commercial purpose of the transaction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In my view, a factor of great significance in the present case is the commercial purpose underlying the Varied SPA. The case of <span class="font-italic">Recovery Vehicle 1 Pte Ltd v Industries </span><span class="font-italic">Chimiques Du Senegal and another appeal and another matter</span> [2021] 1 SLR 342 (“<span class="font-italic">Recovery Vehicle 1</span>”) provides some guidance. There, the Court of Appeal decided that six contracts for the sale of sulphur cargo (the “Sulphur Contracts”) were governed by Senegalese law. The Court of Appeal found that the common commercial purpose underpinning the Sulphur Contracts pointed to Senegal. This was because the respondent, a Senegal-incorporated company, had entered into the Sulphur Contracts to use the shipped sulphur for manufacturing fertiliser in Senegal. Further, approximately one-third of the respondent’s shares were held by the State of Senegal, the Government of India and the Indian Farmers Fertilisers Collective. Therefore, the Sulphur Contracts were not mere trading contracts (<span class="font-italic">Recovery Vehicle 1 </span>at [9] and [68]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 It is imperative to note that the Varied SPA was also not a mere trading contract (<span class="font-italic">Recovery Vehicle 1 </span>at [68]). Instead, there was a public dimension to the Varied SPA. HN Singapore contracted with the plaintiff, which was a public entity that had instituted a public procurement tendering process for the supply of Covid-19 test kits intended for the people of Buenos Aires. Through this process, the plaintiff would receive contracting proposals from distributors and manufacturers in and outside of Argentina, and award contracts to entities whose proposals met the necessary economic and technical requirements. These actions were taken by a government seeking to prevent the further spread of Covid-19 for the preservation of public health in its city.

</div> Therefore, it was not that the Varied SPA was intended, at the outset, to be between the plaintiff and HN Singapore. Instead, HN Singapore was awarded the Varied SPA because it simply happened to be the party that conformed to the requirements set by the plaintiff. The plaintiff may well have awarded the Varied SPA to any other tendering company. Thus, in so far as the contract was entered into by an Argentine authority with the intention of curbing the spread of Covid-19 in an Argentine city, and it was by chance that the counterparty was HN Singapore, it is more probable that parties intended for the contract to be governed by Argentine law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I also place weight on the fact that the plaintiff effected an Administrative Act in order to enter into the Varied SPA with HN Singapore.

</div> In other words, the plaintiff effected the resolution <span class="font-italic">in order </span>to contract with HN Singapore. But this was a necessary act for the plaintiff to award the contract to HN Singapore. On the other hand, I was not convinced by the defendants’ argument that the fact that “Mr Eng is a layperson with no understanding of Spanish and no prior dealings with Argentine public entities” meant that it would be improbable that he intended for Argentine law to govern the Varied SPA.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Another relevant factor is the place of performance. Under the Varied SPA, HN Singapore was obliged to deliver the Test Kits to the plaintiff in Buenos Aires, Argentina. This is another reason why the governing law should be Argentine law. To conclude the analysis, I find that the parties intended for Argentine law to apply to the Varied SPA, chiefly because this was a contract for the benefit of an Argentine city, entered into by an Argentine public authority and to be performed in Argentina. That HN Singapore is a Singapore company is not a relevant consideration to my assessment of the governing law of the contract because it was purely incidental that HN Singapore was a party to the contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Even if I am wrong on this and the governing law of the contract between the parties must be objectively determined under the third stage of the <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>analysis instead, I again find that this points to Argentine law as the governing law. Between the second and third stages, the court generally considers the same factors, but accords differing weight to those factors. At the third stage, “[e]qual weight ought to be placed on all factors, even those which would not, under the second stage, have been strongly inferential of any intention as to the governing law” (<span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation </span>at [48]). The court “look[s] at all the circumstances and seek[s] to find what just and reasonable persons ought to have intended if they had thought about the matter at the time when they made the contract” (<span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation </span>at [49]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 On an analysis of the factors discussed earlier (at [65]–[69]) above), I find that Argentine law has the closest and most real connection with the Varied SPA. The only relevant factors suggesting a connection to Singapore is that HN Singapore is a Singapore company and the Purchase Price was remitted to Mr Eng’s Singapore bank account. The Test Kits were of Chinese origin, manufactured in a factory in China, and of a Chinese brand. HN Singapore was effectively a middleman for the delivery of Test Kits from China to Buenos Aires. Therefore, if I were to place equal weight on all the factors, I find that the Varied SPA is governed by Argentine law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 For completeness, I will briefly comment on some other features of the Varied SPA. The language of the Varied SPA is English, but this is not strongly indicative of any choice of law, as English is the <span class="font-italic">lingua franca </span>of international business (<span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation </span>at [38]). In the present case, Mr Eng neither spoke nor understood Spanish, so the plaintiff’s employees frequently communicated with him in English. The use of English was a matter of convenience. In the same vein, that the Varied SPA used the currency of the US dollar was a neutral factor, as the “universality of the US dollar undermines any inferential value which one might obtain from it” (<span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation </span>at [44]). Additionally, the requirement for payment before delivery did not undermine my conclusion that the Varied SPA was governed by Argentine law. Even though the plaintiff’s usual practice was to make full payment after delivery, the plaintiff had received approval to depart from its usual practice and ostensibly did so in light of the emergency Covid-19 situation, where test kits had been in short supply.

Therefore, Mr Santiago’s request on 29 March 2020 for a formal offer from HN Singapore only amounted to an invitation to treat. The Proposed SPA that Mr Eng sent to the plaintiff subsequently on 29 March 2020 constituted an offer to contract. The plaintiff accepted this on 2 April 2020, when the plaintiff informed Mr Eng that HN Singapore had been awarded the procurement contract (<span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> (Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2022) (“<span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span>”) at para 03.150).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 On 2 April 2020, pursuant to the terms of the Proposed SPA, HN Singapore issued the Invoice stipulating the precise terms of the plaintiff’s intended order.

</div> A reasonable person would not conclude that HN Singapore no longer intended to be bound by the Varied SPA (<span class="font-italic">San International Pte Ltd (formerly known as San Ho </span><span class="font-italic">Huat Construction Pte Ltd) v Keppel Engineering Pte Ltd</span> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 447 at [20]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 I am also of the view that the delivery date of 20 days upon receipt of payment was not a condition of the Varied SPA.

</div>
</div> Therefore, although time was of the essence to the plaintiff for the delivery of the Test Kits, the plaintiff’s primary objective was to secure the Test Kits. It is implausible that the plaintiff would intend to terminate the Varied SPA just because the defendant delivered the Test Kits to the plaintiff one day late. Likewise, I find that HN Singapore did not intend that non-delivery of the Test Kits by 26 April 2020 would entitle the plaintiff to terminate the Varied SPA. Therefore, this was not a case of a Scenario 2 breach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Lastly, I consider whether HN Singapore’s breach of non-delivery was a Scenario 3 breach. The analytical approach comprises two steps. First, I must identify what exactly constituted the benefit that the parties intended the innocent party to derive from the contract. Second, I must examine the actual consequences of the breach that occurred at the time that the innocent party terminated the contract (<span class="font-italic">Sports Connection Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Deuter Sports GmbH</span> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 883 at [62]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In this case, the benefit intended by the parties under the Varied SPA was for the plaintiff to receive delivery of the Test Kits by 26 April 2020, in order for the plaintiff to use the Test Kits to prevent and treat Covid-19. HN Singapore’s breach as of the date of termination, 27 May 2020, caused the plaintiff to not receive any of the Test Kits promised under the Varied SPA. What the plaintiff expected to receive and what it actually received by the time it terminated the contract leads me to conclude that, as of 27 May 2020, the plaintiff was deprived of substantially the whole benefit it intended to obtain from the Varied SPA. In fact, I might say that it was deprived of <span class="font-italic">all</span> of the benefit it expected to receive under the Varied SPA (see <span class="font-italic">Aero-Gate Pte Ltd v Engen Marine Engineering Pte Ltd</span> [2013] 4 SLR 409 (“<span class="font-italic">Aero-Gate</span>”) at [56]). Therefore, I hold that HN Singapore committed a Scenario 3 breach, which would entitle the plaintiff to terminate the Varied SPA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Defence 1: Whether the plaintiff waived of its right to terminate the contract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The next issue is whether, even if HN Singapore was in repudiatory breach for non-delivery of the Test Kits on 26 April 2020, the plaintiff subsequently affirmed the Varied SPA and waived its right to terminate the Varied SPA.

If the plaintiff elects to affirm the contract, he abandons and thereby waives the right to later terminate the contract on the grounds of the same breach (<span class="font-italic">Aero-Gate </span>at [41]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 There are three requirements for the doctrine of waiver by election to operate (<span class="font-italic">Aero-Gate </span>at [42]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the innocent party must have acted in a manner consistent only with affirming the contract, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, treating the contract as still alive.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the innocent party must have communicated his election, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, his choice to affirm the contract, to the party in breach in clear and unequivocal terms.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, there must be sufficient knowledge on the part of the innocent party. At minimum, the innocent party must be aware of the facts giving rise to his right to terminate the contract.

</div>. Nonetheless, I find that the plaintiff did not waive HN Singapore’s repudiatory breach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In this regard, the case of <span class="font-italic">Aero-Gate </span>is instructive. The facts of <span class="font-italic">Aero-Gate </span>are as follows: the plaintiff had engaged the defendant to fabricate and deliver containerised diesel generators to the plaintiff under two purchase orders. Under the second purchase order (“PO 2”), the defendant was obliged to deliver four generators by two specific dates. The defendant failed to meet its delivery deadlines under PO2 but continued to work even after the lapse of those deadlines. Subsequently, the defendant delivered two completed generators, but made no further deliveries thereafter. The plaintiff persistently pressured the defendant to carry out its work on the third and fourth units and to fix dates for testing them. Eventually, the plaintiff terminated PO 2. At the time it did so, the defendant was still working on two generators (<span class="font-italic">Aero-Gate </span>at [19]–[20] and [122]). The High Court found that the defendant in that case had committed a Scenario 3 repudiatory breach in failing to meet the delivery deadlines, and that the plaintiff had not waived its right to terminate PO2 in so far as this arose by reason of it having been deprived of substantially the whole benefit of the contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 At [124], the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Aero-Gate</span> remarked:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Since determining whether a breach is a repudiatory breach necessitates an assessment of the actual consequences of the breach, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">parties must be entitled to wait and see what these</span><span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">consequences </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">actually are</span>: see <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span><span class="font-italic"> …</span> at [100]. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Hence, it is not at all inconsistent for the innocent party to treat the contract as alive post-breach and then to terminate it</span><span class="font-italic"> subsequently </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">when it transpires that the consequences of that breach operate to deprive him of </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">substantially the whole benefit of the contract.</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">In this case, the plaintiff’s conduct in treating PO 2 as alive can at best be an election to affirm the contract </span><span class="font-italic">for</span><span class="font-italic"> the time being. </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">It cannot be an election to affirm</span><span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the contract</span><span class="font-italic"> for all time, regardless of the consequences of the breach as they became apparent over time</span>. Therefore I hold that, however much the plaintiff’s conduct might amount to a waiver by election of its right to terminate PO 2 for breach of condition, assuming the term breached was indeed a condition, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">it did not amount to a waiver by election – or any other waiver – of its right to terminate PO 2 for repudiatory breach</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics, emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 This reasoning is apposite and in accordance with commercial reality. The plaintiff was entitled to treat the Varied SPA as alive to assess whether it had been deprived of substantially the whole benefit it intended to obtain from the Varied SPA. The fact that the plaintiff treated the Varied SPA as alive between 27 April 2020 and 27 May 2020 was, at best, an election to affirm the contract for the time being and not an election to affirm the contract for an indefinite period of time. Subsequently, when HN Singapore repeatedly postponed its estimated deadlines for delivery by a month, and given the climate of uncertainty and urgency, the plaintiff was entitled to terminate the Varied SPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101  This analysis is sufficient to dispose of the defendants’ defence of waiver by election.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Defence 2: Whether the Varied SPA was frustrated</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 The next issue is whether the Varied SPA was frustrated by a supervening event under the common law doctrine of frustration.

Subsequently, the Varied SPA was entered into on 12 April 2020.

</div>
</div> It is thus clear that the Varied SPA had been entered into <span class="font-italic">after</span> the 31 March Regulations came into effect. In fact, Mr Eng and/or HN Singapore were aware of the 31 March Regulations, and the Varied SPA was intended to accommodate its effects on the delivery of the Test Kits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Secondly, there is insufficient evidence that the Chinese Regulations amounted to supervening events. In support of the defendants’ defence of frustration, Mr Eng exhibited translated copies of Announcement No 5 of 2020 on the “Orderly Export of Medical Supplies”, Announcement No 12 of 2020 on “Further Strengthening the Quality Supervision on the Exported Pandemic Prevention Supplies” and the notice on the “Special Rectification Plan for Regulating the Quality of National Pandemic Control Supplies and the Market Order”, which brought into force each of the Chinese Regulations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The content of these Chinese Regulations is a question of fact which must be proved (<span class="font-italic">Kuvera</span><span class="font-italic"> Resources</span> at [144]) (as was elaborated above at [79]). In this case, the defendants have adduced only the raw sources of Chinese Regulations in evidence. However, the court is not obliged to accord raw sources of foreign law any evidentiary weight, as its content, when approached on its own, may mislead persons unfamiliar with the system of law (<span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span> at [60] and [78]). Therefore, in <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span>, the Court of Appeal opined that raw sources of foreign law should be accompanied by expert evidence on the foreign law. This will allow the court to obtain the expert’s opinion as to the law’s effect (at [78]). For instance, in this case, it is unclear how, pursuant to the 13 May Regulations, the Chinese government would “[c]omprehensively strengthen the supervision of pandemic prevention materials for export”. The defendants have failed to call an expert witness on Chinese law. Aside from the Chinese legislation, the defendants have failed to exhibit any further evidence of how the Chinese Regulations rendered the delivery impossible. The text of the 25 April Regulations suggests that manufacturers must have obtained “foreign standard certification” from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. Again, no documentation is provided regarding the approval process for Wondfo to acquire the necessary certifications, the actual steps taken by Wondfo to apply for this certification, and the response of the Chinese government to such an application. It is also not known when the 13 May Regulations came into effect. Therefore, I find that the defendants did not sufficiently prove that the Chinese Regulations have made it impossible to perform the Varied SPA and constituted a supervening event. Accordingly, the defendant’s defence of frustration must fail.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Furthermore, the plaintiff submits that HN Singapore’s offer to perform the contract by obtaining the Test Kits from Wondfo’s warehouse in Chicago confirms that the performance of the Varied SPA was not rendered impossible by the Chinese Regulations.

Whilst the standard of proof is one of a balance of probabilities, the more serious the allegation, the more evidence that might have to be adduced (<span class="font-italic">Liberty Sky Investments Ltd v Goh Seng Heng and another</span> [2020] 3 SLR 335 at [63]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Section 2(1) of the MA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Section 2(1) of the MA is premised on the representee entering into a contract with the representor.

If the plaintiff has established that, the defendant then bears the burden of proving that it had reasonable grounds to believe and did believe up to the time the contract was made that its representation was true.

Therefore, the plaintiff’s claim in statutory misrepresentation can be brought only against HN Singapore, with whom the plaintiff entered into the contract. I find that it is immaterial that any alleged misrepresentation was made by Mr Eng. This is because Mr Eng is the sole shareholder and director of HN Singapore and any alleged misrepresentation would have been made by Mr Eng, not on behalf of himself, but on behalf of HN Singapore. A party to a contract may be liable for damages under s 2(1) of the MA by the representations of his agent, acting within the scope of his authority and on behalf of the contracting party (<span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract </span>at para 11.217).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the defendants made a false representation of fact to the plaintiff </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In the letter of offer dated 27 March 2020, HN Singapore stated that the delivery time for the Test Kits would be “10(+10) days upon payment”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, HN Singapore would deliver the Test Kits within 20 days of receipt of payment. The Representation is therefore not one of present or past fact because it relates, at the time it was made, to a matter that would occur in the future.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The question, then, is whether it is possible to imply a representation of present fact (<span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand Perez</span> at [172]–[173]).

The plaintiff points to the fact that the Test Kits were ultimately not delivered on 26 April 2020 to show the falsity of the Representation.

</div> Given that the plaintiff specifically requested for the “time” (which most probably referred to the time of the delivery) to be included in the letter of offer that the plaintiff would consider in deciding whether to contract with HN Singapore, I find that the timing of delivery played a causative role in the plaintiff contracting with HN Singapore.

The plaintiff has not provided any evidence to show that at the time when the parties entered into the contract, Mr Eng and/or HN Singapore did not genuinely believe that HN Singapore could deliver the Test Kits 20 days upon payment. Additionally, the allegedly fraudulent Wondfo Invoice was sent to the plaintiff on 29 April 2020, long after parties had contracted with each other.

Mr Seward then passed on the Business Representation to the plaintiff. This representation created the expectation that HN Singapore was a reliable or suitable business partner and had relevant experience dealing with similar orders, thereby inducing the plaintiff to contract with HN Singapore. However, under cross-examination, Mr Eng conceded that HN Singapore never successfully exported any goods, and that HN Singapore had no experience dealing with medical supplies prior to the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.

In its Statement of Claim, the plaintiff’s pleaded case for the claim of misrepresentation was only that the defendants, knowing that time was of the essence to the plaintiff for the delivery of the Test Kits, represented to the plaintiff that they would be able to deliver the Test Kits within 15(+5) days of receipt of payment from the plaintiff. No reference is made to Mr Eng’s alleged participation in the G20 Leaders’ Summit or the representation that HN Singapore was in the business of exporting medical supplies. The plaintiff should have made its case clearly and unambiguous in its pleadings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 In any case, even if the plaintiff had sufficiently pleaded its case, I do not find that the G20 Representation and Business Representation amount to actionable misrepresentations. First, the plaintiff has not proven that Mr Eng made either of the representations. The plaintiff could not point to a specific occasion where Mr Eng made the G20 Representation and Business Representation. The plaintiff relies on the email sent to the plaintiff on 23 March 2020, where Mr Eng is introduced as “from the G20 Chinese/Singaporean delegation” and “working with commodities and supplies (Medicine, is one of them) [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]”. However, this email was sent by Mr Seward, and Mr Eng was not copied. There is also no evidence that Mr Seward sent the email on behalf of Mr Eng or on Mr Eng’s instructions. The plaintiff also relies on another email sent by Mr Eng on 29 April 2020, but this email post-dates the date that parties entered into contract. Second, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to show the falsity of the G20 Representation, but the plaintiff has failed to adduce any evidence to show that Mr Eng did not attend the 2018 G20 Leaders’ Summit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 Therefore, I dismiss the plaintiff’s claim of misrepresentation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 4: Lifting the corporate veil</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Having found HN Singapore liable for breach of the Varied SPA, I turn now to consider the plaintiff’s argument that the corporate veil should be lifted so as to hold Mr Eng liable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The position under Argentine law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 On the basis that the Varied SPA is governed by Argentine law, I find that, on the balance of probabilities, the corporate veil should be lifted, and Mr Eng should be liable for HN Singapore’s breach of contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 According to Dr Cassagne, under Argentine law, where a corporation is “being undercapitali[s]ed and the partners [are] not being responsible for social obligations beyond their contribution ”, the “corporation’s limited liability ceases to exist and shareholders shall be subject to joint and unlimited liability for the obligations of the company”, which consists of “piercing the corporate veil”.

</div> The underlying principle appears to be that if a company is undercapitalised and the transaction is for a large sum, the plaintiff can have recourse to the shareholders if the defendant is in breach of contract. Given that Mr Eng, the shareholder, has failed to capitalise HN Singapore adequately, in Dr Cassagne’s expert opinion, “Argentine judges shall allow piercing the corporate veil, so as to assure the decision to be rendered being effective against [HN] Singapore or whoever hold shares in said corporation”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 In my judgment, it is significant that the expert opinion of Dr Cassagne was unchallenged by any other expert evidence. As mentioned, the defendants did not elect to call an expert to testify on its behalf. While this does not mean that I am obliged to accept Dr Cassagne’s evidence without more, the Court of Appeal has held that the court should be slow to reject expert evidence which is unopposed (<span class="font-italic">Saeng</span><span class="font-italic">-Un Udom v Public Prosecutor</span> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 1 at [26] (“<span class="font-italic">Saeng</span><span class="font-italic">-Un Udom</span>”), affirmed in <span class="font-italic">Sudha </span><span class="font-italic">Natrajan v The Bank of East Asia Ltd </span>[2017] 1 SLR 141 at [46]). Given that the evidence is based on sound grounds and supported by the basic facts, I accept the evidence given by Dr Cassagne and find that the corporate veil may be lifted under Argentine law.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The position under Singapore law </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Having found that the Varied SPA is governed by Argentine law, it is not necessary for me to consider whether HN Singapore’s corporate veil ought to be pierced under Singapore law to hold Mr Eng personally liable. Nevertheless, on the basis that I have erred and the governing law of the Varied SPA is instead Singapore law, I find the corporate veil should not be pierced under Singapore law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 The separate legal personality of a company forms the cornerstone of company law (<span class="font-italic">Salomon v Salomon</span> [1897] AC 22). Exceptionally, however, the law will go behind the separate legal personality of a company and pierce the corporate veil (<span class="font-italic">Simgood</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v MLC Shipbuilding Sdn Bhd and others </span>[2016] 1 SLR 1129 (“<span class="font-italic">Simgood</span>”) at [196]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 In its pleadings (see above at [49]), the plaintiff has relied on various grounds for lifting the corporate veil. However, in its written submissions, the plaintiff failed to cite the relevant case law for the different grounds and did not descend into detail as to how each ground was made out on the facts of this case. Instead, the plaintiff listed various factors to support its unitary proposition that the corporate veil should be lifted. In my analysis, the plaintiff has raised three distinct grounds in its pleadings: (a) HN Singapore was set up with the intention to commit fraud; (b) HN Singapore was a mere sham or façade; and (c) Mr Eng was the alter ego of HN Singapore. It bears noting that the ground of alter ego is distinct from the ground of façade or sham (<span class="font-italic">Alwie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [96]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 The plaintiff relies on the following factors in support of these claims: (a) Mr Eng is the sole director and sole shareholder of HN Singapore; (b) HN Singapore has a nominal paid-up capital of S$1; (c) HN Singapore has no employees; (d) HN Singapore’s registered address is the address of a residential property owned by Mr Eng’s mother; (e) HN Singapore had no prior experience providing test kits and no track record in the subject matter of the Varied SPA; (f) the Varied SPA required the Purchase Price to be paid in full before delivery was made (which was an “unusual feature”); and (g) the Letter of Proposal included an “unusual feature” that HN Singapore would provide an insurance policy as a guarantee for the Varied SPA, which was never provided.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Alter ego</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 I go first to the ground of “alter ego”. This ground was upheld by the Court of Appeal on the facts of <span class="font-italic">Alwie</span>. Where the alter ego ground is relied on, the key question that must be asked is “whether the company is carrying on the business of its controller” (<span class="font-italic">Alwie</span> at [96]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 In this case, the plaintiff heavily relies on the fact that Mr Eng is the sole director, shareholder, and employee of HN Singapore. However, evidence of sole shareholding and control of a company, without more, would not move the court to intervene and lift the corporate veil (<span class="font-italic">NEC Asia Pte Ltd (now known as NEC Asia Pacific Pte Ltd) v Picket &amp; Rail Asia Pacific Pte Ltd and others</span> [2011] 2 SLR 565 at [36]; <span class="font-italic">Tjong Very </span><span class="font-italic">Sumito and others v Chan Sing En and others </span>[2012] SGHC 125 at [76]). As noted by the Honourable Judge of the High Court Judith Prakash J (as she then was) in <span class="font-italic">Sitt</span><span class="font-italic"> Tatt Bhd v Goh Tai Hock</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 44 at [79], it is a general proposition of law that parties are entitled to protect themselves by creating companies even if these are effectively one-man companies. The rationale for this is clear – “one-man” companies would otherwise be unfairly prejudiced. As was succinctly stated in <span class="font-italic">Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Shiyam v Tuff Offshore Engineering Services Pte Ltd </span>[2021] 5 SLR 188 at [71]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In the case of “one-man” companies, the sole shareholder would almost always be the controlling mind and will of the company. Yet, it cannot be the case that every one-man company would have its corporate veil lifted as it would defeat the point of incorporation for many small, closely held companies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 However, this then begs the question – what more is required to lift the corporate veil? In <span class="font-italic">Alwie</span>, the Court of Appeal found several other factual <span class="font-italic">indicia</span> relevant. First, the appellant in that case incorporated the company for the sole purpose of receiving payment under the relevant agreement. Second, the appellant operated the company’s bank account as if it was his own and admitted this. In particular, the appellant procured payments that were due to the company and directed that the payment of such dues be made to his personal account (<span class="font-italic">Alwie</span> at [97]–[100]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 Conversely, similarly probative <span class="font-italic">indicia </span>are not present in this case. Firstly, HN Singapore was not incorporated solely to trade with the plaintiff. HN Singapore was incorporated on 9 September 2016, approximately three and a half years before its one transaction with the plaintiff.

</div> Secondly, there is no evidence that Mr Eng operated HN Singapore’s bank account as if it was his own or treated its dues as his own. Mr Eng did not deposit any of the Purchase Price into his personal bank account. Instead, Mr Eng gave evidence that on 7 April 2020, one day after the plaintiff made payment, HN Singapore transferred a sum of US$1,525,286 to one Mr Li Chong, for him to handle the payments to Wondfo, Nuodong and the intended shipping company.

I agree with the defendants’ submission that the inclusion of the performance guarantee term in the Varied SPA was based on the plaintiff’s request for a performance guarantee and has no bearing on whether Mr Eng was the alter ego of HN Singapore. The same goes for the requirement that advance payment be made for the Varied SPA.

In short, a sham refers to acts done or executed by parties to the sham that were intended by them to give to third parties or to the court, an appearance of creating between the parties legal rights and obligations different from the actual rights and obligations which the parties intended to create (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Tourism Board v Children’s Media Ltd and others </span>[2008] 3 SLR(R) 981 at [99] affirmed in <span class="font-italic">Children’s Media Ltd and others v Singapore Tourism Board</span> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 524 (“<span class="font-italic">Children’s Media (CA decision)</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 In this case, the plaintiff failed to substantiate how HN Singapore was a sham or façade.

</div> Further, the fact that HN Singapore had no prior experience providing test kits did not necessarily mean that the company was a sham. At the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, there was a spike in demand for critical supplies, such as surgical masks and test kits. This created business opportunities for manufacturers, middlemen and suppliers. Therefore, it is unsurprising for businessmen to have branched out into supplying test kits as a new revenue source.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Fraud</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 The courts in Singapore appear to have established fraud as a ground for lifting the corporate veil (see <span class="font-italic">Jhaveri</span><span class="font-italic"> Darsan Jitendra and others v Salgaocar Anil Vassudeva and others</span> [2018] 5 SLR 689 (“<span class="font-italic">Jhaveri</span>”) at [79]; <span class="font-italic">Epoch Minerals Pte Ltd v Raffles Asset Management (S) Pte Ltd and others</span> [2021] SGHC 288 at [20]).

</div> To recapitulate, the plaintiff alleges that Mr Eng did this to mislead the plaintiffs regarding HN Singapore’s profit arising from the Varied SPA and to obscure that the invoice was only issued two days after the intended delivery date. Under cross-examination, Mr Eng denied editing the Wondfo Invoice before forwarding it to the plaintiff. He claimed that he “probably received it from [Mr Li Chong] like this”.

</div>
</div> Without more, I make no finding that Mr Eng was the one that removed the information from the Wondfo Invoice. In any event, even if Mr Eng had amended the Wondfo Invoice, I hesitate to describe these redactions as fraudulent. It is understandable that a middleman such as Mr Eng would not want to disclose the price HN Singapore paid for the Test Kits, and, therefore, the markup made on the Test Kits. The plaintiff has not shown that the redaction of the delivery date had any bearing on its actions either. I therefore hold that the plaintiff has not established that the corporate veil should be lifted on the ground of fraud.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Evasion of obligations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 As a final point, I note that the plaintiff has also pleaded that HN Singapore was set up with the intention of allowing Mr Eng to evade his legal obligations. In its closing submissions, the plaintiff submits that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Children’s Media (CA decision)</span> acknowledged that if a person were under an existing legal obligation which he deliberately evaded or the enforcement of which he deliberately frustrated by interposing a company under his control, a court could pierce the corporate veil for this purpose. The plaintiff argues that this can be explained under the “evasion principle”, espoused in the seminal decision of <span class="font-italic">Prest</span><span class="font-italic"> v Petrodel Resources Ltd</span> <span class="font-italic">and others</span> [2013] 2 AC 415 (“<span class="font-italic">Prest</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 In <span class="font-italic">Prest</span>, the UK Supreme Court appeared to approach the corporate veil piercing principle in a more unified manner. Lord Sumption, delivering the leading judgment, held that the “evasion principle” and “concealment principle” were the two bases for the piercing doctrine (at [28]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The concealment principle is legally banal and does not involve piercing the corporate veil at all. It is that the interposition of a company or perhaps several companies so as to conceal the identity of the real actors will not deter the courts from identifying them, assuming that their identity is legally relevant. In these cases the court is not disregarding the “façade", but only looking behind it to discover the facts which the corporate structure is concealing. The evasion principle is different. It is that the court may disregard the corporate veil if there is a legal right against the person in control of it which exists independently of the company’s involvement, and a company is interposed so that the separate legal personality of the company will defeat the right or frustrate its enforcement. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">According to Lord Sumption, only the evasion principle amounts in the strict sense to the court piercing the corporate veil.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 Even within the UK Supreme Court, not all members accepted Lord Sumption’s analysis without qualification (see <span class="font-italic">Simgood</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [201]). In Singapore, as I previously explained in <span class="font-italic">Commodities Intelligence Centre Pte Ltd v Mako International </span><span class="font-italic">Trd Pte Ltd and others </span>[2022] 5 SLR 837 at [142], <span class="font-italic">Prest</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>has yet to be considered by the Court of Appeal, much less accepted here. Thus, it is unclear whether the piercing doctrine in Singapore should be framed by the “evasion principle” espoused by Lord Sumption, or some other narrower, wider or alternative legal principle. In any event, it is not necessary for me to decide on the merits of Lord Sumption’s approach in <span class="font-italic">Prest</span>, which attempts to limit the doctrine of piercing to cases falling within the evasion principle, given that no arguments were canvassed before me on the authorities I have cited above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 Lastly, for the avoidance of doubt, the decision in <span class="font-italic">Children’s Media (CA </span><span class="font-italic">decision)</span>  was made on the basis of the “sham or façade ground” (at [4]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The crucial issue in this matter, for our assessment, was the intention of the third appellant when he entered into the Third Agreement (as well as the Side Letter) with the respondent. <span class="font-italic">Was this a sham transaction procured by fraudulent misrepresentation(s) made by him?</span><span class="font-italic"> …</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 For all the above reasons, I do not find that under Singapore law, HN Singapore’s corporate veil should be lifted to hold Mr Eng personally liable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 5: Unlawful termination</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 Having considered the merits of the plaintiff’s claims, I turn now to Mr Eng’s counterclaim.

</div> According to Dr Cassagne, the effect of both provisions was that if HN Singapore had provided a performance guarantee, the plaintiff would have directly retained the sum amounting to 10% of the Purchase Price. However, because no guarantee was provided, the “plaintiff is forced to claim that penalty, [which is always 10%,] through judicial means”. The fact that there was no performance guarantee “[does not] mean that the sanction of the penalty cannot or will not be applied”.

However, neither provision mentions the seller’s entitlement to such costs. Further, there is no evidence of any loss that the plaintiff has suffered arising from the delay in the reimbursement of the Purchase Price.

It is trite that a plaintiff bears the burden of proving its loss and, in order to do so, must provide cogent evidence of the damages claimed (<span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto Emporium Pte Ltd and others v Yeo </span><span class="font-italic">Boong Hua and others and another appeal </span>[2019] 1 SLR 214 at [16]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 Apart from the Balance Purchase Price, the plaintiff has not proven any other loss arising from the breach of the Varied SPA.

I dismiss its claim in misrepresentation, as well as HN Singapore’s counterclaim in unlawful termination. Having found that the Varied SPA is governed by Argentine law, I order that HN Singapore’s corporate veil be lifted, such that Mr Eng is also liable for the Balance Purchase Price of US$237,619.35 to the plaintiff. I also order the defendants to pay interest on the judgment sum at the rate of 5.33% from the date of the writ until date of payment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 Unless there is any reason for a different order for which the parties have liberty to apply, I order the first and second defendants to pay costs to the plaintiff on the standard scale.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Lee Seiu Kin <br/>Judge of the High Court </div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Sean Francois La’Brooy, Luis Inaki Duhart Gonzalez and Faustina Joyce Fernando (Selvam LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Loo Choon Chiaw, Goh Shu Quan Leon, Chia Foon Yeow, and Lim Jun Wei (Loo &amp; Partners LLP) for the first and second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
