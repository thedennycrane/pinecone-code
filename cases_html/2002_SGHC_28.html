The appellant pleaded guilty in the district court to the following two charges:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">First Charge</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">That you, Sivakumar s/o Rajoo NRIC No.

    S7525422I are charged that you, on or about the 8<sup>th</sup> day of July 2001, at about

    1.55 am, along Ang Mo Kio Ave 5, Singapore, when driving motor car SBT 5831G, did have so

    much alcohol in your body that the proportion of it in your breath exceeded the prescribed

    limit and you have thereby committed an offence under section 67 (1) (b) of the Road

    Traffic Act, Cap 276.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Second Charge</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">That you, Sivakumar s/o Rajoo NRIC No.

    S7525422I are charged that you, on or about the 8<sup>th</sup> day of July 2001, at about

    1.55 am, along Ang Mo Kio Ave 5 Singapore, did drive motor car SBT 5831G at a speed of 133

    kmph, in excess of the authorised speed limit of 60 kmph of the road, and you have thereby

    committed an offence under section 63 (4) of the Road Traffic Act, Cap 276 and punishable

    under section 131 (1) (a) of the same Act. </font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2 As the appellant had no prior

convictions of a similar nature, the first offence was punishable under the Road Traffic

Act ("the Act") with a fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000, or

to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, and in the absence of ‘special

reasons’, to an order disqualifying the offender from holding or obtaining a driving

licence for a period of not less than 12 months from the date of his conviction. The

second offence is punishable under s 131(1A) of the Act with a fine not exceeding $1,000

or with imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months. Further, under s 42 of the

Act, the court has discretion to order a convicted person to be disqualified from holding

or obtaining a driving licence for life or for such period as the court may think fit. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3 On the first charge, the judge below

imposed a $2,000 fine, in default 20 days imprisonment, and ordered that the appellant be

disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes of vehicles for

12 months. On the second charge, the judge imposed a $800 fine, in default eight days

imprisonment, and ordered that the appellant be disqualified from holding or obtaining a

driving licence for all classes of vehicles for three months. The periods of

disqualification were to run concurrently, making for a total fine of $2,800 and 12

months’ disqualification. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4 The defendant appealed against sentence,

in particular, the order disqualifying him from holding or obtaining a driving licence for

the 12 months’ period from the date of his conviction. At the end of the hearing

before me, I dismissed the appeal. I now give my reasons.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><br/>

The facts</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5 On the night of 7 July 2001, the

appellant received a call from his brother-in-law informing him that his estranged wife

was about to commence divorce proceedings against him. This news saddened him and the

appellant consumed some beer. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6 Soon after, the appellant’s close

friend who was facing similar marital problems, Ms Rajee, telephoned the appellant and

informed him that she had received several threatening phone calls from loan sharks. She

told the appellant that she could no longer handle her problems and was thinking of taking

the lives of her children and then ending her own life. The appellant pleaded with her not

to do anything foolish but she hung up abruptly. Thereafter the appellant tried several

times to contact Ms Rajee but the latter refused to answer the telephone. The appellant

started to worry that Ms Rajee was serious about carrying out her threat and he became

frantic. He got into his car and drove towards Ms Rajee’s house. En-route, however,

the appellant was stopped by the Traffic Police along Ang Mo Kio Ave 5 for speeding.

Smelling alcohol in his breath, the appellant was made to undergo a breathalyser test by

the police officer. He failed. Following a Breath Evidential Analyser ("BEA") at

Traffic Police Headquarters, it was revealed that the proportion of alcohol in his breath

was 64 micrograms per 100 millilitres of breath, exceeding the prescribed limit which is

35 micrograms per 100 millilitres of breath. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7 At the court below, the appellant

pleaded guilty to the above-stated charges. </font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><br/>

The decision below</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8 In his written judgment, the trial judge

found that there was no real threat to Ms Rajee from the loan sharks. He noted from <i>Wilkinson’s

Road Traffic Offences</i> (18<sup>th</sup> ed, volume 1 at page 1119 paragraph 21.49) that

before the English High Court would recognise that an emergency is capable of amounting to

a ‘special reason’, the defendant must first show that there was no other

alternative but for him to drive, and that he had explored every reasonable alternative

before driving. The judge held that there were no extenuating or pressing circumstances in

this case. He also held that the appellant had not considered other forms of transport,

nor did he attempt to resolve the emergency by other means such as by contacting the

police or emergency services. As such, he concluded that there were no ‘special

reasons’ that should excuse the appellant from an order of disqualification. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9 Even though it was unnecessary for him

to go on, the judge noted the words of Lord Widgery CJ in <i>Taylor v Rajan</i> [1974] RTR

304: </font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">… the discretion where special

  reasons are found should only be exercised in clear and compelling circumstances, that in

  deciding whether to exercise their discretion, the justices should have regard to the way

  in which the car was driven, and that they should have regard to the defendant’s

  level of alcohol.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10 As such, he held that, even if

‘special reasons’ existed, he would not have been minded to exercise his

discretion not to disqualify the appellant for 12 months.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><br/>

Appeal against sentence</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11 In his petition of appeal, the

appellant contended that the judge erred in holding that his driving whilst under the

influence of drink in the attempt to save Ms Rajee and her children did not amount to

extenuating or pressing circumstances which constituted ‘special reasons’ for

the purposes of s 67 (2) of the Act. Also, the appellant contended that the judge erred in

holding that, even if there were ‘special reasons’, he would not have exercised

his discretion not to disqualify him. The appellant argued that the judge ought to have

exercised discretion in his favour in view of the extenuating or pressing circumstances.

He appealed to set aside the disqualification order. </font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><br/>

Special reasons</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12 The first question arising in the

appeal was whether the facts surrounding the commission of the s 67(1)(b) offence were

extenuating or pressing circumstances that amounted to ‘special reasons’. It was

thus necessary to examine the provisions of s 67(2) of the Act, which states: </font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">A person convicted of an offence under

  this section shall, unless the court for special reasons thinks fit to order otherwise and

  without prejudice to the power of the court to order a longer period of disqualification,

  be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for a period of not less than

  12 months from the date of his conviction or, where he is sentenced to imprisonment, from

  the date of his release from prison. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13 It is therefore clear that s 67 (2) of

the Act requires the existence of ‘special reasons’ before the court has power

not to make the minimum mandatory disqualification order of a period of 12 months as

provided under the Act. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14 In <i>R v Crossen </i>[1939] 1 NI 106,

it was held that a ‘special reason’ may comprise: </font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">… a mitigating or extenuating

  circumstance, not amounting in law to a defence to the charge, yet directly connected with

  the commission of the offence and one which the court ought properly to take into

  consideration when imposing punishment … </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15 This passage was quoted and approved by

Lord Goddard in <i>Whittall v Kirby</i> [1946] 2 All ER 552 and subsequently followed in

local decisions including <i>PP v Balasubramaniam </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=6056&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1992] 1 SLR 822</a> and <i>Joseph

Roland v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=9791&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">(1996) 1 SLR 179</a>. It is clear that whether the facts of the case amount to

‘special reasons’ is a question of law and should be decided in view of the

circumstances surrounding the offender’s commission of the offence. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16 In the instant case, the prosecution

never disputed the facts alleged by the appellant. As such, I was prepared to accept the

appellant’s version of events, in particular, his reason for driving whilst under the

influence of drink. He had no reason to doubt Ms Rajee’s determination to carry out

her threat to take the lives of her children and herself. With the magnitude of risk, that

is, the three lives at stake and the fact that he was the only person who was aware of Ms

Rajee’s threats and resolve, the appellant must have felt compelled to take drastic

action, including driving in his inebriated state. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17 While the factual matrix of this case

would certainly weigh heavily on a trial judge’s mind in support of a finding of

‘special reasons’, unfortunately for the appellant, this did not dispose of the

matter. Before an emergency is capable of amounting to a special reason under law, a

crucial prerequisite is for the offender to show that there was no alternative but for him

to drive, and that he had explored every reasonable alternative before driving (See e.g. <i>Evans

v Bray</i> [1977] RTR 24, <i>R v Baines</i> [1970] Crim LR 590). </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18 At the time of the commission of the

offence, the appellant was clearly depressed and upset over his marital problems. In the

circumstances, he had probably overreacted when he could not contact Ms Rajee after she

hung up abruptly. As the judge noted, he did not attempt to notify the police or any of

the other emergency services. Before me, he tried to explain that, even though he knew how

to get to Ms Rajee’s residence, he could not remember her exact unit number. However,

I rejected his explanation. A cool and sober mind would have deduced that volunteering

information such as Ms Rajee’s telephone number to the police and/or emergency

services would have enabled them to trace her exact address and take necessary action to

abate the threat, if any. In fact, the appellant did not even stop to consider or attempt

to procure other means of transport. By his own admission, the thought of taking a taxi

over to her house did not even cross his mind. Clearly, he could have done a great deal

more before getting into his car on impulse and driving to Ms Rajee’s house.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19 Next, the prosecution submitted that

the facts of the present case were different from the example I gave in <i>Joseph Roland, </i>where

I considered that rushing a seriously ill wife to the hospital were urgent and critical

circumstances constituting ‘special reasons’. Their argument was that firstly,

Ms Rajee was merely a friend of the appellant. Also, Ms Rajee had unduly felt threatened

after merely receiving verbal threats over the telephone from loan sharks. They submitted

that there was no credible evidence to show that the threats would actually be carried out

and that such circumstances cannot be so extenuating and pressing as to warrant the

appellant to drive whilst inebriated. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20 In my opinion, it was irrelevant that

Ms Rajee was only the appellant’s friend. Section 67 (2) of the Act does not require

a special relationship nor does it require an imminent threat of physical harm to an

offender’s kin. While I agreed with the prosecution that there was no threat of

physical harm emanating from the loan sharks, the material threat that motivated the

appellant to drive was not from the loan sharks, but from Ms Rajee’s threat to take

her own life and the lives of her children. The legislature’s aim of granting a

discretion to the trial judge is to tamper the rigidity of a mandatory disqualification by

allowing the judge to take into account relevant factors which appeared to demonstrate

whether a situation was extenuating or pressing enough to amount to ‘special

reasons’. I did not think that it was necessary to limit a judge’s discretion by

confining it to certain factors.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21 Taking into account the circumstances

of the case, I was not satisfied that the facts were sufficient to amount to ‘special

reasons’ under law.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman"><br/>

Discretion</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22 In any case, even if ‘special

reasons’ were established, it did not automatically follow that the appellant would

not be disqualified. There must be a separate process of considering whether the

discretion must be exercised in favour of the offender (See <i>PP v Balasubramaniam</i>, <i>supra</i>

at 827). This view is also supported by the wording of s 67(2) of the Act and has always

been the approach of the English courts in similar cases (See for example <i>DPP v

O’Connor</i> (1992) 96 Cr App R 135 at 146). </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23 In <i>PP v Balasubramaniam, supra</i>,<i>
</i>Karthigesu J emphasised that the judge, in deliberating over whether to exercise

discretion in an offender’s favour, must pay special regard to the legislative intent

on s 67(2) of the Act. He stated at 829:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">… It seems clear to me that the

  legislative intent is that those who choose to drink and drive must be prepared to suffer

  a minimum period of a disqualification of 12 months should they exceed the prescribed

  limit of alcohol in their blood …, but at the same time the legislature has

  recognised that there may exist certain extenuating or pressing circumstances which may

  prevail upon the driver to take the risk of driving knowing that he was not fit to drive

  due to the presence of alcohol in his body. It is in this kind of situation when the

  offence is committed under some extenuating or pressing circumstances that the court is

  given the discretion not to disqualify or to disqualify for a lesser period than 12

  months.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24 It is clear that Parliament regards

drink driving offences so seriously as to warrant an almost mandatory minimum period of 12

months’ disqualification. However, in order to properly exercise the discretion

bestowed by act of Parliament, it is helpful to refer to<i> MV Balakrishnan v PP</i>
<a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=46970&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 3 SLR 586</a> at 590, where I quoted from <i>Re Kanapathipillai</i> [1960] MLJ 243 H:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Magistrates must appreciate that where

  there is a duty to disqualify a convicted person from holding a licence to drive a motor

  vehicle … such duty falls not within the discretion of the convicting court but is

  imposed by the act of the legislature. This duty is not identified with the maximum

  punishment to be mitigated according to established principles. The duty is mandatory but

  the act of the legislature has given a limited discretion to a convicting court, to be

  exercised judicially, to refrain from implementing the law’s clearly expressed

  requirement for a reason which is special to the offence but not for a reason special to

  the offender…</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25 In my opinion, the limited discretion

not to disqualify can only be made in very exceptional circumstances, having regard to the

special circumstances as well as to the whole of the circumstances surrounding the

commission of the offence. In the English case of <i>Taylor v Rajan</i> (1974) RTR 304,

340, Lord Widgery CJ stated that, in considering the whole of the circumstances of the

case, a sentencing court was required to: </font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">… <i>have regard to the manner in

  which the defendant drove, because if he committed traffic offences, such as excessive

  speed or driving without due care and attention, this again is a consideration which tells

  against his having the discretion exercised in his favour, and they should generally have

  regard to whether the defendant acted responsibly or otherwise….Last, but by no means

  least, if the alcohol content in the defendant’s body is very high, that is a very

  powerful reason for saying that the discretion should not be exercised in his favour…</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">26 In the instant case, the judge noted

the high concentration of alcohol in the appellant’s blood. At 64 micrograms per 100

millilitres of breath, this was more than 1.8 times above the prescribed limit of 35

micrograms per 100 millilitres of breath. The appellant was caught speeding at 133 kmph

along Ang Mo Kio Ave 5, which is a residential area with a speed limit of 60 kmph. The

offences were also committed on a late Saturday night when the likelihood of people

returning home from a night out was much higher. Undoubtedly, he posed a serious danger

not only to himself but also to other road users and pedestrians. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">27 While the appellant’s conduct was

probably indicative of his anxiety to ensure the safety of Ms Rajee and her two children,

this should not detract one from the fact that he was speeding whilst under the influence

of drink. Even if an inebriated person faces an emergency which is so extenuating or

pressing as to warrant the taking of a calculated risk by driving, it cannot be

overemphasised that that person must do so responsibly, keeping well within the speed

limits and making an extra effort to drive safely. The appellant not only failed to

appreciate that he was in no position to drive, but went so far as to speed at 133 kmph in

a 60 kmph residential zone in his inebriated state. This was clearly inexcusable. Hence,

even if there was a finding of ‘special reasons’ in this case, the whole of the

circumstances did not merit a judge exercising his discretion in the appellant’s

favour.</font></p>

safe as possible for law-abiding road users and pedestrians. In cases of drink driving,

the courts are always mindful that a motor car in the hands of an inebriated person is a

potentially devastating weapon. In <i>PP v Mohd Isa</i> [1963] MLJ 135, Thomson CJ stated

that the most satisfactory penalty for most motoring offences is disqualification because

a fine is paid once and then forgotten. In this case, the 12 months’ disqualification

order would mean that for the entire year in which the order is in effect, the appellant

is reminded every day of his offence and the unwarranted risks in which he had placed

ordinary members of the public. I believe that a lengthy period of disqualification from

driving would be the most appropriate sentence for such offenders. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">29 In coming to the appropriate period of

disqualification that was to be imposed, the judge was entitled to take relevant factors

in the appellant’s mitigation plea into account. The appellant had no antecedents,

and had pleaded guilty and co-operated fully with the police. These are recognised

mitigating factors. Further, regardless of whether ‘special reasons’ were found,

the court should also have regard to the motivation leading to the commission of the

offence, which, in this case arose out of the appellant’s concern and anxiety for the

lives of a close friend and her two children. As such, I felt that the combined punitive

effect of the fine as well as the 12 months’ disqualification period was an

appropriate sentence.</font></p>
