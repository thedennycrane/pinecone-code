<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The accused is Kester Ng Wei Ren, now 49 years
                    old. Of the seven charges against the accused, the prosecution stood down six
                    charges and proceeded only with the second charge which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[O]n 12 August 2008, at about 9.30 pm., at 8 Lorong 42, Room 188,
                        Geylang, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class
                        “A” of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter
                        185, to wit, by having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking,
                        thirty-one (31) packets of granular substance containing 23.38 grams of
                        diamorphine without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations
                        made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section
                        5(1)(a) read with section 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act and punishable
                        under section 33 of the said Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(a)   Events leading up to the arrest </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 12 August 2008 at about 3 pm, officers
                    from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) were deployed near a
                    coffee shop at Lorong 40 of Geylang, Singapore, to look out for a Malaysian
                    Chinese, one Tan Kim Looi (“Tan”). CNB intelligence received
                    information that Tan would be making a delivery of drugs to an unidentified man
                    in that area. At about 4.35 pm, the CNB officers identified Tan at the coffee
                    shop. The accused was then seen entering the coffee shop and sitting down at the
                    same table as Tan. The accused and Tan subsequently left the coffee shop and
                    they were spotted walking towards Tan’s motorcycle bearing license number
                    JLC 3645. A while later at about 5.00 pm, the accused was seen carrying a while
                    plastic bag along Lorong 40 Geylang. Instructions were given to arrest the
                    accused. The accused was eventually arrested near the rear gate of Aston
                    Mansion, which is a residential property located between Lorong 40 and Lorong 42
                    of Geylang.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The accused put up a violent struggle and he
                    threw the white plastic bag into the air causing two black bundles and one brown
                    envelope to fall out of the plastic bag. After the accused was subdued, the CNB
                    officers retrieved the white plastic bag and its contents, <em>viz</em> the two black bundles and one brown envelope. The two black
                    bundles and the brown envelope contained controlled drugs that formed the
                    subject matter of the first and fifth charges. Although these charges have been
                    stood down, I will for the sake of completeness as well as to provide a clearer
                    context to the present charge (<em>viz</em> the second
                    charge), set out the drugs uncovered in the white plastic bag in the following

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       When the accused was escorted back to the CNB,
                    the accused revealed that his place of residence was at Summer View # 03-01,
                    No. 5 Lorong 12 Geylang (“the Summer View apartment”). The
                    police searched the Summer View apartment but nothing incriminating was found.
                    Thereafter, the accused was brought back to the CNB. An instant urine test was
                    performed on him. His urine was tested positive for amphetamine, benzodiazepines
                    and opiates. A further two samples of the accused’s urine were also sealed
                    and deposited into a metal box in the accused’s presence, for the purposes
                    of further testing and analysis. Further analysis of the accused’s urine
                    confirmed that the accused had consumed morphine and
                methamphetamine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       A body search of the accused was also performed
                    at the CNB, and the police found a bunch of three keys in the back pocket of the
                    accused. It was then discovered that the accused had another two residential
                    addresses at room 188 of No. 8 Lorong 42 Geylang (“the room 188
                    apartment”) as well as at # 09-48 of Block 16, Marine Terrace
                    (“the marine terrace apartment”). A search of the room 188
                    apartment uncovered some drugs, two weighing scales and cash (amounting to
                    $6,539.20) whereas a search of the marine terrace apartment did not turn up
                    anything.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The drugs found in the room 188 apartment made
                    up the second, third and fourth charges. The drugs uncovered for the third and

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(b)   The various drug consignments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Further investigations revealed another actor
                    named ‘Ah Man’, who was a middle aged Singaporean man who had
                    connections with Tan and who would also facilitate drug deliveries between Tan
                    and several drug traffickers in Singapore. Statements recorded from the accused
                    also revealed that there were six other consignments of drugs received by the
                    accused and facilitated by Ah Man prior to the one leading to the
                    accused’s arrest on 12 August 2008. At the outset, I should point out
                    that the accused did not challenge the voluntariness of all his statements.
                    There were in total, five statements recorded from the accused under s 121
                    of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed)
                    (“CPC”), set out as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Before elaborating on the various drug
                    consignments, some background on the accused’s initiation into the drug
                    business would be useful. The accused was originally in charge of a few
                    prostitutes in Geylang and he provided these prostitutes with lodging as well as
                    ensured that their clients would pay them for their services. The prostitutes
                    would charge the client about $80 for half an hour of service and the accused
                    would take a commission of about $10. Sometime in June 2008, the accused’s
                    business in providing lodging to prostitutes deteriorated and a Chinese friend
                    offered to introduce the accused to some contacts who could provide him with
                    drugs for sale. The accused was introduced to ‘Ah Man’ and
                    arrangements were made for the first consignment of heroin.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(i)   The first consignment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The first consignment of drugs arrived
                    sometime in June 2008 and in the first consignment, the accused was given 30
                    packets of heroin for sale. Of the 30 packets of heroin, the accused passed 15
                    packets back to ‘Ah Man’; he sold 12 packets and consumed the
                    remaining 3 packets himself. One week after the first consignment, the accused
                    informed ‘Ah Man’ that he needed more heroin and one day after this
                    conversation, ‘Ah Man’ informed the accused that someone would
                    deliver the second consignment of heroin to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(ii)   The second consignment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In the second consignment, the accused
                    received 30 packets worth of heroin. He again passed 15 packets of heroin back
                    to ‘Ah Man’. Of the 15 remaining packets, the accused sold 12
                    packets, and kept 3 packets for self-consumption. When the accused finished
                    selling the second consignment of drugs, he ordered a third consignment of
                    drugs, which consisted of the same amount of heroin as per the first and second
                    consignments.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(iii)   The third consignment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The third consignment arrived in July 2008.
                    However, the heroin came in 2 large bundles which required the accused to repack
                    them into smaller packets for sale. The accused then purchased small plastic
                    packets for this purpose as well as an electronic weighing scale to weigh the
                    heroin. The accused repacked the heroin received into about 30 packets of about
                    8 g each. For the third consignment, ‘Ah Man’ only took 10
                    packets of heroin from the accused. Of the remaining 20 packets, the accused
                    sold about 15 to 16 packets and he consumed the rest of them. In mid July 2008,
                    ‘Ah Man’ contacted the accused asking him if he needed to replenish
                    his supply of heroin. The accused then ordered more heroin as well as some
                    ‘Ice’ (street name for crystal methamphetamine) for his own
                    consumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(iv)   The fourth consignment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The fourth consignment arrived sometime
                    towards the end of July 2008 and consisted of two big bundles of heroin, one
                    bundle being white in colour and another bundle being brown in colour. The
                    accused repacked the two big bundles of heroin into about 30 small packets, of
                    which 10 packets were passed to ‘Ah Man’. After setting aside about
                    4 to 5 packets for consumption, the accused tried to sell the remaining 15 to 16
                    packets. However, he managed to sell only 6 to 7 packets of heroin leaving a
                    balance of about 9 packets unsold. In the fourth consignment, the accused also
                    purchased for the first time, 25 grams of ‘Ice’ from ‘Ah
                    Man’.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(v)   The fifth consignment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Sometime in early August 2008, ‘Ah
                    Man’ called the accused and asked the accused if he wanted to replenish
                    his supply of heroin. The accused ordered more heroin and on about 5 or
                    6 August 2008, the accused received the fifth consignment of heroin. The
                    fifth consignment consisted of two black taped bundles and the accused then
                    repacked the drugs into 30 smaller packets of about 8 g each. ‘Ah
                    Man’ did not take any packets of heroin from the accused for this
                    consignment and the accused consumed about 2 packets, while intending to sell
                    the rest. The accused sold about 9 packets of heroin with about 19 packets
                    remaining. Before the accused could sell off all the packets of heroin,
                    ‘Ah Man’ called again on about 8 or 9 August 2008 and asked if
                    the accused wanted to order more heroin. Although the accused still had unsold
                    packets of heroin, he agreed to take the sixth consignment of heroin first and
                    see how many packets he could repack them into.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(vi)   The sixth consignment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     After speaking to ‘Ah Man’, the
                    sixth consignment arrived on the same day in the evening of 8 or 9 August
                    2008. The sixth consignment consisted of 3 bundles, and like the fifth
                    consignment, they were sealed with black tape. These were the 3 bundles marked
                    A4A1, A4B1 and A4C1 (see table at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above).
                    Like the 5<sup>th</sup> consignment, the accused did not pass
                    any packets of heroin to ‘Ah Man’. On 12 August 2008, ‘Ah
                    Man’ called again and the accused ordered more ‘Ice’. The
                    accused was informed that the seventh consignment would arrive on the same day
                    and that he would be notified of its arrival.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(vii)   Seventh Assignment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Although the accused only ordered
                    ‘Ice’, he agreed nonetheless to take another 30 packets of heroin as
                    well when the seventh consignment arrived. After taking the drugs, the accused
                    was subsequently arrested by CNB officers (see “Events leading up to the
                    arrest” at <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> to <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Case for the prosecution</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     It was the prosecution’s case that
                    unless otherwise rebutted, s 17(c) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185,
                    2008 Rev Ed)(“MDA”) presumes that the 28 packets (containing 9.92
                    grams of diamorphine) together with the 3 bundles of heroin (containing 13.46
                    grams of diamorphine) found in the room 188 apartment were in the possession of
                    the accused for the purpose of trafficking. The defence tried to rebut the
                    presumption by claiming that the 3 bundles of heroin were for his own
                    consumption, thereby bringing the quantity of drugs for trafficking below the 15
                    g threshold. Essentially, the accused’s defence was that the accused was
                    only trafficking in the 28 packets containing 9.92 grams of diamorphine and the
                    prosecution should not have included the 3 bundles of heroin containing 13.46
                    grams of diamorphine into the amount trafficked by the accused as these were for
                    his own consumption. The prosecution argued that the presumption was not
                    rebutted for two main reasons. First, the prosecution relied on the
                    accused’s statements to prove that the accused had always intended to sell
                    the heroin in his possession <em>i.e</em>. both the 28
                    packets and the 3 bundles of heroin. Second, the prosecution also argued that it
                    was not believable that the accused would set aside or purchase such a large
                    quantity of drugs (i.e. containing 13.46 grams of diamorphine) for his
                    consumption. Not only did the accused not have the financial means of doing so,
                    but his account of self-consumption was also unbelievable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     I will set out the first argument before
                    turning to the second argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(a)   28 packets and 3 bundles of heroin were for sale</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The prosecution’s first argument was
                    straightforward. The prosecution argued that it was apparent from the second
                    statement that the accused had always intended to sell the 28 packets and 3
                    bundles of heroin:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The 4 plastic bags (blue, white, black and
                    red) referred to in Q11 of the second statement were with reference to the drugs
                    found in the room 188 apartment and they included exhibits A4A1, A4B1 and A4C1,
                        <em>viz</em>, the 3 bundles of granular substance
                    alleged by the accused to be for his own consumption. During cross-examination,
                    the accused’s explanation for his answer to Q13 was that despite having
                    told the recorder of the second statement (<em>i.e</em>.
                    Staff Sergeant Wong Kum San Malvern (“Staff Sergeant Wong”) that
                    the drugs found in the room 188 apartment were <em>partly for
                        sale and partly for consumption</em>, this was not accurately recorded
                    down. In reply, the prosecution argued that had this been true, “given
                    the materiality of this… [argument to]…the accused’s
                    defence, one would expect that this would have been put to SSgt
                    Malvern…when he took the stand”. Since no such allegations were
                    put to SSgt Wong on cross-examination, this must therefore mean that such
                    allegations were merely a defence created as an afterthought by the accused. The
                    prosecution further asserted that one could arrive at the same conclusion by
                    looking at the fifth statement – recorded by Assistant Superintendent Gary
                    Chan (“ASP Chan”) – which clearly stated that the three
                    bundles of granular substance (A4A1, A4B1 and A4C1) found under the bed were
                    meant for sale:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27    On 8 or 9 of August this year in the afternoon,
                            ‘Ah Man’ called me again and told me that someone will be
                            bringing things to me. I knew that ‘Ah Man’ is referring to
                            heroin…After meeting up with this man, he handed over to me a
                            plastic bag. I then left the coffee shop for my room at 8 Geylang Lorong

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    When I reached my room, when I open up the plastic

                            three bundles are also white in colour. After that, I then taped them
                            back and put them back in the plastic bag and left it under my bed.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I will now turn to the prosecution’s
                    second argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(b)   The accused could not have intended to consume the
                heroin</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Given the accused’s evidence that each
                    packet of heroin he sold weighed about 8 g and cost him about $180 to $200, the
                    3 bundles of heroin (with a gross weight of 277.29 g) would be equivalent to
                    about 35 packets with a total cost of about $ 6300 to $7000. Since the accused
                    consumed about 4 g of heroin a day, the 3 bundles of heroin would last him for
                    about 70 days in total. Taking into account the total cost and total amount of
                    heroin in the 3 bundles, the prosecution argued that the accused – an odd
                    job worker – could not afford these drugs for his own consumption. The
                    accused’s change in position during cross-examination further undermined
                    the accused’s defence of consumption. Prior to being cross-examined, the
                    accused apparently had instructed his own counsel that he was able to afford the
                    3 bundles of heroin because he had already made some money from selling previous
                    consignments of drugs:</p>

                    changed his position when he was being shown a few tables produced by the
                    prosecution (Exhibits P 197 to P 198) to illustrate the breakdown of
                        <em>inter alia</em>, (i) the cost of the drugs which

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The prosecution asserted that this change in
                    position strongly suggested that the accused’s defence – that the 3
                    bundles of heroin were for self-consumption – was “nothing more
                    than an afterthought and cannot [therefore] be believed”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Further, the prosecution also argued that the
                    accused’s account of having consumed the heroin from A4A1 was unconvincing
                    and unpersuasive. A4A1 was one of 3 black bundles found in a red plastic bag in
                    the room 188 apartment. The black bundle was held together with black tape and
                    newspaper wrapping and to consume heroin from the black bundle, the accused had
                    to undo the tape and wrapping before removing a Ziploc bag and then use a straw
                    to scoop the desired amount that he wished to consume. The accused would go
                    through this process of “<em>accessing and
                        rewrapping</em> A4A1” (emphasis added) whenever he needed to
                    consume the drugs. The prosecution argued that the accused’s account
                    defied logic because it did not seem physically possible for the accused to
                    reuse the newspaper and black tape repeatedly and it was more likely that both
                    the black tape and newspaper would not have been usable for the purposes of
                    rewrapping, once they have been undone. A more logical process suggested by the
                    prosecution was for the accused to ensure that the Ziploc bag in A4A1 was zipped
                    up properly after use rather than going through the cumbersome process of
                    rewrapping.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Case for the defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The case for the defence was also a
                    straightforward one. As I have already alluded to earlier, the defence’s
                    case was that the 3 bundles of heroin (marked A4A, A4B and A4C) were meant for
                    self-consumption <em>i.e</em>. the accused was only guilty
                    of trafficking 9.92 grams of diamorphine, and hence, the mandatory death penalty
                    for trafficking in amounts above 15 grams was inapplicable. I will now set out
                        <em>in extenso</em> the material arguments for the
                    defence of consumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     The 3 bundles of heroin were not
                        packed for sale in smaller packets and the fact that the bundles were
                        “opened and restored in a rough and ready” paper and black
                        tape manner suggested that the bundles were not meant for trafficking. It
                        was the “modus operandi” of the accused to “reduce the
                        bundles into sachets whenever he received them from Ah
                    Man”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     Unlike
                        previous consignments, where the accused would pass a certain quantity of
                        heroin back to ‘Ah Man’ for the latter’s use, there was no
                        such agreement for the 6<sup>th</sup> consignment. This
                        “lack of a record of any agreement” reflected that the
                            6<sup>th</sup> consignment was made in a
                        “cavalier” fashion “for the simple reason that [the
                        accused] had not intended to traffic the 3 bundles…but rather [had
                        intended] to consume it”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_c"></a>(c)     Neither the accused nor ‘Ah Man’ was aware of
                        the actual weight of the heroin in the three bundles. This suggested that
                        the drugs were indeed intended for self-consumption. Further, the police did
                        not find any empty packets in the room 188 apartment and the absence of
                        packing materials further supported the defence of
                    consumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_d"></a>(d)     There
                        were packets of heroin found on the white tray of the dressing table in the
                        room 188 apartment. Since the accused had quantities of heroin left
                            <em>unsold</em>, there was therefore no need for
                        the accused to purchase additionally the 3 bundles of heroin for the purpose
                        of trafficking. The fact that the accused only went to see Tan on
                        12 August 2008 for the purpose of obtaining ‘Ice’ was
                        further reflective of the accused’s intention to stop trafficking in
                        heroin.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_e"></a>(e)     The
                        accused was also a heavy addict and took 4 g of heroin a day and he would
                        suffer from withdrawal symptoms whenever he did not consume heroin. It was
                        therefore believable that the 3 bundles of heroin were purchased for the
                        sole purpose of consumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_f"></a>(f)     There were consumption utensils, which were not recovered
                        by the CNB officers from the room 188 apartment during their search and
                        seizure of the flat. Had the consumption utensils been recovered, they would
                        have provided credible support to the accused’s claim that he was a
                        heavy addict and that the 3 bundles were intended for his own
                        consumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_g"></a>(g)     As
                        for the prosecution’s case that the accused was in financial distress
                        and had therefore no means to afford the 3 bundles of heroin, this was
                        equally characteristic of a “haphazard [drug] user” who would
                        accept delivery of the drugs without “considering the financial
                        implication[s]”. In any case, the prosecution did not take into
                        account any revenue that was made by the accused in selling
                        ‘Ice’, which could have otherwise financed the accused’s
                        own consumption. Further, the accused had more than $6,500 in his possession
                        and was therefore not in real financial desperation.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     After considering the submissions of the
                    prosecution and the defence, I find that the accused has not, on a balance of
                    probabilities, rebutted the s 17 presumption. In rejecting the defence of
                    consumption, I have taken into account the following considerations, <em>viz</em>, (i) the financial means of the accused; (ii) the
                    accused’s account of self-consumption; (iii) the accused’s failure
                    to raise the defence of consumption in his statements to CNB; (iv) the
                    accused’s ready access to heroin; and (v) the accused’s change of
                    position during the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Financial means of the accused</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     First, I did not think that the accused had
                    sufficient financial resources to purchase such a large amount of heroin
                    contained in the 3 bundles for his self-consumption. In ascertaining his
                    financial means, I looked at (i) the amount of money the accused owed ‘Ah
                    Man’; (ii) the accused’s savings and assets; and (iii) the
                    accused’s earnings and expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(i)   Money owed to ‘Ah Man’</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The heroin purchased from ‘Ah Man’
                    would cost the accused about $180 to $200 per packet and in return, the accused
                    sold them for a price of $230 to $250 per packet. As submitted by the
                    prosecution, the evidence showed that the accused owed ‘Ah Man’ a
                    lot of money, making it less likely for him to have been able to afford the 3
                    bundles of heroin for his own consumption. The following table (P 198) was
                    collated from the accused’s fifth statement as well as his evidence in

                    ‘Ah Man’ of which the accused had managed to sell only $14,000 worth
                    of heroin (see column ‘C’ below). This meant that the accused was
                    operating at a cash deficit of $10,000 (see column ‘E’ below),
                    despite him having some $7,000 worth of unsold heroin at the point of arrest
                    (see column ‘G below).The contents of Exhibit P 197 were also accepted by
                    the accused:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     While the accused might have had earnings from
                    selling ‘Ice’, I placed less weight on this considering the fact
                    that there was only one consignment (<em>i.e</em>. the
                    fourth consignment) where the accused had purchased ‘Ice’. Although
                    the accused also purchased ‘Ice’ in the seventh consignment, this
                    did not factor into my assessment because the drugs for the seventh consignment
                    were seized when the accused was arrested on the 12<sup>th</sup>
                    August 2008. While the accused claimed to have had made profits from selling
                    ‘Ice’ and he agreed that the profits could amount to some $2,000 to
                    $2,200, he was somewhat reticent and evasive in replying to the
                    prosecution’s queries on these profits. In particular, the accused was
                    unable to answer why if selling ‘Ice’ was so profitable, he had
                    failed to mention this to the CNB officer who had seized the $6,539.20 from the

                    his daily expenses on meals and cigarettes came to about $80 to $90 and his
                    heroin addiction cost him about $100 a day. The accused therefore spent quite a
                    substantial amount of at least $180 to $190 daily.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(iv)   Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Taking into account the large sum of money the
                    accused owed ‘Ah Man’, the accused’s minimal savings, as well
                    as his high expenses and irregular earnings, I concluded that the accused did
                    not have the financial resources to purchase the 3 bundles of heroin for his own
                    consumption. The accused intended to repack the heroin in the 3 bundles into
                    smaller satchets and thereafter sell them. It did not appear logical for
                    someone, as heavily in debt as the accused, to incur greater debt by purchasing
                    3 additional bundles of heroin for his self-consumption when he already had
                    other unsold sachets of heroin that he could have easily taken for his own use.
                    Therefore, despite the purported earnings from the accused’s sale of
                    ‘Ice’, I believed that the accused’s <em>overall</em> financial situation made it very unlikely for him to buy
                    the 3 bundles of heroin for his own consumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Accused’s account of consumption</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Second, I accepted the prosecution’s
                    submission that the accused’s account of his consumption was not
                    believable. Of the 3 bundles, the accused claimed that he only consumed from the
                    bundle marked A4A and he would re-tape the bundle each time after removing a
                    desired quantity of heroin from the bundle with a straw. As I have earlier
                    already described, the heroin was packed in a Ziploc bag, wrapped in newspaper
                    and held together by black tape. In explaining his process of consuming heroin
                    from A4A, the accused said he would not use fresh black tape or newspaper, but
                    old tape and old newspaper from the original packaging of the bundle. I found
                    this explanation hard to accept. The accused gave evidence that in the two days
                    prior to him being arrested, he had opened and repacked A4A about eight times.
                    If the accused’s account was to be believed, it was not possible for A4A
                    to be repacked and reopened that many times without using new tapes or fresh
                    newspapers because each time the bundle was opened, the packaging would be
                    ruined as the newspaper stuck to the tape would have to be torn apart. The
                    accused was unable to provide a satisfactory answer to this:</p>

                                            closing of the big bag. But that was not the system you
                                            used, you see. So I’m trying to understand why
                                            not.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In essence, the accused’s account of how
                    he went about consuming heroin from one of the 3 bundles did not appear to me to
                    be a sensible or genuine one. If the accused truly wanted to consume the heroin
                    from A4A, it would not be practical nor convenient for him to reseal the heroin
                    every time. It would be much easier to take from the other packed heroin
                    satchets he had with him. For the above reasons, I rejected the accused’s
                    account that the heroin in the 3 bundles were meant exclusively for his own
                    consumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Failure to raise defence of consumption in statements to CNB </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Third, the accused never once raised the

                    statements to CNB. Similarly, the accused had nothing to say or add in his
                    s 122(6) cautioned statement. The defence of consumption was only mentioned
                    during the cross-examination of ASP Chan. It was raised by counsel for the
                    accused, on the latter’s instructions:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Under s 123(1) of the CPC, I may draw an
                    adverse inference from the accused’s failure to mention his defence in his
                    s 122(6) statement. The purpose of s 123 is really to compel the
                    accused to outline his defence immediately upon being charged to guard against
                    defences raised at trial as afterthoughts (see <em>Yap Giau Beng
                        Terrence v Public Prosecutor</em> [1998] 2 SLR(R) 855
                        (“<em>Yap Giau Beng Terrence”)</em>).
                    Similarly, adverse inferences may also be drawn for s 121 statements (see
                        <em>Lim Lye Huat Benny v Public Prosecutor</em> [1995]
                    3 SLR(R) 689) (“<em>Lim Lye Huat
                    Benny</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Whether an adverse inference should be drawn
                    depends on the totality of the evidence and it really is a matter of judgment
                    for the trial judge (see <em>Lau Lee Peng v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 448). However, as was noted by
                    Yong CJ in <em>Yap Giau Beng Terrence</em>, it is not
                    in every case that an adverse inference should be drawn. Be that as it may,
                    there would be legitimate explanations which would be so evident to even lay
                    persons facing a criminal charge that the omission to mention such defences
                    would warrant the drawing of an adverse inference (at [38]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]t is not in every case that an adverse inference is drawn against an
                        accused who keeps silent upon being charged. <em>An adverse
                            inference will be drawn only if he fails to mention facts which he could
                            reasonably have been expected to mention upon being charged</em>.
                        In the instant case, the appellant had failed to mention in his cautioned
                        statement that he had thought Susan Goh was one of the victims of the
                        accident, that he had offered her compensation and that he had later asked
                        her to negotiate with the victims of the accident on his behalf. <em>It must have been evident to the appellant, even without the
                            benefit of consultation with a lawyer, that these facts afforded a
                            legitimate explanation for the offers of money he allegedly made, and
                            that it would be in his interest to mention them. These were thus facts
                            which the appellant could reasonably have been expected to mention upon
                            being charged, and the trial judge was perfectly entitled to draw an
                            adverse inference against the appellant under s 123 for failing to
                            mention these material aspects of his defence in his cautioned
                            statements</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Whether it is reasonable for an accused person
                    to omit his defence would therefore ultimately depend on the facts of the case.
                    In <em>Lim Lye Huat Benny</em>, the Court of Appeal placed
                    little weight on the accused’s omission to mention his defence in his
                    s 122(6) statement because the s 122(6) statement was recorded
                    “at the <em>unearthly time</em> between 4.25 am and
                    4.55 am and the [accused had] said that at that time he was too tired and hungry
                    to think of his defence” (at [24]; emphasis added). In this case, while
                    the s 122 (6) statement was recorded at 5.06 am on 13 August 2008,
                    there were otherwise no recorded complaints made by the accused along the lines
                    that he was unwell or that he was suffering from any withdrawal symptoms which
                    might affect his ability to mention his defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In fact, the medical examination conducted by
                    Dr Gavin Ong (“Dr Ong”) at 2.42 am on 13 August
                    2008 – as part of pre-statement examination – recorded nothing apart
                    from minor abrasions over the accused’s right elbow, which the accused
                    explained was sustained during a recent fall. The accused did not complain to
                    Dr Ong that he was sick or unwell. The post-statement examination conducted
                    also by Dr Ong at about 5.22 am on 13 August 2008 was similarly
                    unremarkable, and once again the accused did not complain of any physical
                    illness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     While I might add that the accused was
                    referred to a doctor for withdrawal symptoms, this only took place in the
                        <em>afternoon</em> of 13 August 2008 at 5.46 pm.
                    The s 122(6) statement was therefore recorded <em>before</em> this at 5.06 am in the <em>morning</em> of 13 August 2008. The accused was admitted into
                    the Complex Medical Centre at Changi Prison for medical treatment and only
                    discharged on 17<sup>th</sup> August 2008. On his
                    discharge, he was seen by Dr Choo Shiao Hoe, and it was noted that the
                    accused “had no more medical complaints” and that there was also
                    “no [further] signs of drug withdrawal”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     As for the s 121 statements, they were
                    recorded on 12 August 2008, 18 August 2008 and 19 August 2008.
                    These statements, like the s 122 (6) cautioned statement, were therefore
                    also not tainted by the accused’s withdrawal symptoms in any
                way.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The accused was well aware that he was being
                    charged for trafficking and it was evident to me that any reasonable lay person
                    would be able to ascertain that a defence of consumption would be relevant
                    information to such a charge. Even if I were to give the accused the benefit of
                    a doubt for the s 122(6) cautioned statement because it was recorded in the
                    early hours of the morning, the absence of any reference to the defence of
                    consumption in <em>all</em> his s 121 statements was
                    rather puzzling. Unlike the case of <em>Lim Lye Huat
                        Benny</em>, the s 121 statements were all recorded in the
                    afternoon and since the accused was in a healthy state of mind on these
                    occasions, I drew an adverse inference against the accused for failing to
                    mention the defence of consumption in any of these statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     While the accused did explain in court that
                    his s 121 statements were not recorded accurately by the CNB, I rejected
                    this argument and I would now turn to analyse this allegation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Misrecording of statements and inconsistencies in evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Fourth, the accused was inconsistent in the
                    evidence given in both his recorded statements and in court. When SSgt Ng from
                    the CNB asked the accused about the 3 bundles of heroin under his bed, the
                    accused said in his second statement that he intended to sell the heroin to his
                    customers:</p>

                            already packed Heroin which is lying in my room. <em>After I packed the Heroin from the bundles, I will sell them

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     I did not accept the accused’s version
                    that the CNB officers had misrecorded the accused’s statements
                    deliberately or otherwise. Given the fact that the CNB recording officers would
                    not have known the exact quantity of diamorphine in the 3 bundles under the bed
                    at the time of the recording, there was therefore no basis or logic for me to
                    accept the accused’s version of events, which tended to suggest that the
                    CNB officers had an incentive to amalgamate the heroin exhibits meant for sale
                    so that the total quantity of diamorphine for trafficking would exceed 15 grams
                    and the accused would then face a capital charge. The defence did not adduce
                    anything during the course of the trial, which could remotely even suggest or
                    explain the presence of such alleged misbehaviour.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Indeed, the allegations of misbehaviour by the
                    accused was an incredible one not against one, but two separate CNB officers,
                    committed in the course of recording the second and fifth statements. In the
                    case of the fifth statement, I would further note that there was also an
                    interpreter – Mr Wu Nan Yong – who acted as a translator. To
                    allege that the fifth statement was wrongly recorded was to allege that not only
                    the CNB officer – ASP Chan – was guilty of misbehaviour, but that
                    the interpreter was similarly guilty of such collusion. In the absence of any
                    credible evidence, I rejected this argument completely. In coming to my
                    conclusion, I was supported by the fact that counsel for the accused did not
                    challenge the accuracy of the records or put such misbehaviour to both SSgt Ng
                    and ASP Chan when they took the stand. This was despite the accused’s
                    admission that he had known of these “errors” when he came to
                    court. The irresistible conclusion must be that the statements were accurately
                    recorded and interpreted to the accused. In my opinion, they reflected the
                    truth, <em>viz</em>, the accused had intended to sell the 3
                    bundles of heroin found under his bed:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     If ‘Ah Man’ was a ready source of
                    heroin, I found it curious that the accused would feel the need to stockpile
                    about two month’s worth of heroin for his own consumption. The accused was
                    unable to provide any credible reason as to why he had to stockpile such a large
                    quantify of drugs and in the absence of a persuasive explanation, this was a
                    further pointer that the accused’s defence of consumption was false.
                    Indeed, I should also note that the accused admitted that he had never informed
                    ‘Ah Man’ or Tan that he was not selling the 3 bundles of heroin, but
                    was keeping them instead for his own consumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Change of position during trial</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Sixth, as submitted by the prosecution, the
                    accused’s change of position during the trial strongly suggested that his
                    defence of consumption was an afterthought. Prior to being cross-examined, the
                    accused’s position, as expressed through his counsel, was that he was able
                    to afford the 3 bundles of heroin because he had already made some money from
                    selling previous consignments of drugs. On cross-examination, the accused said
                    that he was unable to afford the drugs but was nonetheless allowed to take the
                    drugs on credit, and if the need arose, he could pawn his valuables for
                    repayment as well. In explaining the discrepancy, the accused suggested that his
                    counsel could have misheard his instructions:</p>

                                            investigating officer that you had earned enough money

                                            bundles in the sixth consignments to which Gary Chan,
                                            the investigating officer, said that is not what you as
                                            the accused had told him. And today, this afternoon,
                                            your evidence is to the contrary. That is you cannot

                                            jewellery…that is the…gold chain. So
                                            basically you can’t afford to pay and I’m

                                            half of it. So what the counsel had told---what your
                                            counsel had told Gary Chan is diametrically opposite
                                            from what you tell us now. Have you got any

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     I found this explanation a strained and
                    unconvincing one; and I therefore agreed with the prosecution that the
                    accused’s sudden change of position was an indication that his version of
                    events was untrue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Other arguments raised by the defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     For all the above five reasons (see <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> to <a href="#p1_61">[61]</a>),
                    I did not accept the accused’s defence of consumption. These five areas
                    aside, counsel for the accused also raised several other arguments, which I
                    rejected as well. The arguments have been set out above (see <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above) and I will now give my
                reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     First, I did not think that there was anything
                    remarkable with the unpacked state that the 3 bundles of heroin were found in. I
                    did not agree with the defence (see [26(a)] above) that this necessarily
                    suggested that the accused had intended to consume the 3 bundles of heroin by
                    himself. While it might be the accused’s usual practice to reduce heroin
                    into smaller packets, there were still <em>unsold</em>
                    packets of heroin found in the accused’s apartment, and one could equally
                    infer that there was no pressing need for him to repack the 3 bundles of heroin
                    for sale, unless a large purchase order for heroin had been received by the
                    accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Second, I would also not read too much into
                    the fact that ‘Ah Man’ did not arrange for the accused to pass him
                    heroin from the sixth consignment. The lack of an arrangement, the defence
                    suggested, meant that the 3 bundles of heroin were purchased in a
                    “cavalier fashion” for the accused’s own consumption (see
                    [26(b)] above). In my view, this is mere speculation and I need only refer to
                    the fifth consignment to show that the absence of such an arrangement is neither
                    peculiar nor unique (see <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above). In the
                    fifth consignment, ‘Ah Man’ may not have asked the accused to pass
                    him heroin, but it is not disputed that the accused had intended to sell away
                    all the drugs from the fifth consignment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Third, even if the accused was unaware of how
                    heavy the 3 bundles of heroin weighed, this did not necessarily mean that they
                    were not for sale (see [26(c)] above). In fact, only the first consignment of
                    heroin was delivered in ready packed portions that were sellable (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above). The third, fourth and fifth
                    consignments were all delivered in rough amounts, after which the accused would
                    try to repack them into smaller quantities of 8 g each (see <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> to <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>
                    above). The accused was therefore accustomed to the taking of a rough amount of
                    heroin without knowing its weight and then repacking them into smaller packets
                    subsequently. While the CNB officers might not have found empty packets in the
                    room, I did not agree with the defence that this implied that there were no
                    packing materials, and that the 3 bundles were therefore for the accused’s
                    consumption. To the contrary, I need only point to the two weighing scales that
                    were found in the room 188 apartment, the only discernible purpose of which I
                    could see was for the accused to weigh the amount of heroin for repacking into
                    smaller packets for sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Fourth, just because the accused had unsold
                    packets of heroin did not necessarily preclude him from obtaining more heroin
                    for sale (see [26(d)] above). I would not agree with the defence that the
                    accused must wait until he had depleted his supply of heroin before procuring
                    more from ‘Ah Man’. On at least two occasions, the accused had
                    procured more drugs when he had yet to sell off his existing supply of heroin.
                    In the first instance, the accused was unable to sell off the fifth consignment
                    but had agreed nonetheless to take on the sixth consignment. In the second
                    instance, the accused was also unable to sell off his fifth and sixth
                    consignments but had nonetheless agreed to take on the 30 extra packets of
                    heroin in the seventh consignment. Looking at the evidence collectively, the
                    accused was not adverse to the taking on of more drugs for sale even if he had
                    an outstanding supply of heroin unsold. For the same reasons, just because the
                    accused went to see Tan on 12 August 2008 for the sole purpose of obtaining
                    ‘Ice’, I did not think that this was necessarily reflective of his
                    intention to stop trafficking in heroin (see [26(d)] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Fifth, I did not agree with the suggestion
                    that the accused’s heavy usage of heroin would necessarily make the
                    defence of consumption a more believable one (see [26(e)] above). While the
                    accused had suffered from withdrawal symptoms, the defence did not call on any
                    expert witness to establish any possible correlation between the quantity of
                    heroin consumed and the severity of withdrawal symptoms. Even if one assumed
                    that there was indeed a correlation, I would note that a physical examination
                    conducted on 13 August 2008 (one day after the accused’s arrest)
                    clearly showed that he only suffered from <em>mild</em>
                    withdrawal symptoms. In the absence of any expert evidence to the contrary, I
                    was not persuaded that the accused was so severe a drug addict that he would
                    have ordered 3 <em>entire</em> bundles of heroin for the
                    sole purpose of consumption. The relevant excerpts to the medical report dated
                    13 October 2008 by Dr Norkhalim Dalil is reproduced below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1) The [accused] was seen by me on the
                        13<sup>th</sup> August 2008 at around 1746 hrs in
                        Complex Medical Centre (CMC), Cluster A, Changi Prison Complex. He was
                        referred to us for suspected drug trafficking and for observation of drug
                        withdrawal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3) At CMC, he claimed that he was currently
                        “gian”, had “chased” heroin for months, last
                        puff was on the 12<sup>th</sup> August 2008. On clinical
                        examination, he was found to be conscious. He was tired looking and yawning
                        occasionally. His vital signs:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Blood pressure of 148/104 mmHg</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Pulse rate of 85 per min</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Temperature 36.8 degree Celsius</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Pupils equal and reactive to lights. Piloerection and mild tremors of his
                        upper limbs noted. Heart and lung examination unremarkable. Abdomen soft and
                        non tender. Gait and straight line walking normal. There was no alcoholic
                        breath or slurring of speech. There was no obvious injury seen.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4) He was admitted to CMC and stayed from
                        13<sup>th</sup> August 2008 until
                            17<sup>th</sup> August 2008. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5) On the 17<sup>th</sup> August 2008, he was seen by
                        Dr Choo Shiao Hoe. He had no more medical complaints, no signs of drug
                        withdrawal and Dr Choo ordered him to be discharged from CMC the next
                        day.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7) In summary, final diagnosis:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<b>-</b>
<em>Mild drug withdrawal to heroin</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In any case, it was noted by Yong CJ in
                        <em>Fung Choon Kay v PP</em> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 547,
                    that just because an accused was an addict was not in itself conclusive of the
                    defence of consumption and much still depended on the totality of the evidence
                    (at [17]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>…Although the fact that the [accused] was an
                            addict lent support to [his] defence of consumption that fact by itself
                            was</em> not conclusive. The trial judge had to look at the
                        totality of the evidence and decide whether he was satisfied, on a balance
                        of probabilities, that part of the heroin was for the [accused’s] own
                        consumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added.]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Having considered the totality of the evidence (see <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> to <a href="#p1_61">[61]</a>),
                    I was not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the defence of
                    consumption was a genuine one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Sixth, the defence’s suggestion that
                    there could be consumption utensils not recovered by the CNB officers was an
                    incredible one (see [26(f)] above). There was absolutely nothing to suggest that
                    the CNB officers were negligent in processing the crime scene or that they had
                    acted in bad faith. I placed no weight at all on this line of argument and
                    rejected it completely.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     For all the above reasons, I found that the
                    accused had not rebutted the s 17 presumption on a balance of
                    probabilities. I found that the accused was in financial distress and did not
                    have the financial means to afford 3 bundles of heroin for his consumption.
                    Moreover, the accused’s account of consumption was an illogical and
                    baffling one. His failure to mention the defence of consumption in all his
                    statements to the CNB strongly suggested that the defence was an afterthought.
                    Moreover, the accused’s ready access to heroin from ‘Ah Man’
                    meant that there was simply no reason for him to stockpile on the drug. In fact,
                    what was most damning to the accused were his voluntary statements to the CNB
                    officers which indicated that the 3 bundles of heroin were for
                sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     I also found that the accused’s change
                    of position during the trial and his replies in court did not lend themselves to
                    establishing an impression that he was a credible witness. He was often evasive
                    in his answers and was often not forthright to even some very straightforward
                    questions. In all, the prosecution has therefore proven its case beyond a
                    reasonable doubt that the accused had in his possession not less than 23.38
                    grams of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking, thus committing an offence
                    under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA. I therefore convict the
                    accused and sentence him according to the law as stated in s 33 of the
                    MDA.</p>
