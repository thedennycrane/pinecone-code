<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff obtained a worldwide Mareva
                    injunction against the defendants in England. Thereafter, the plaintiff
                    commenced simultaneous proceedings in Singapore and Hong Kong against the
                    defendants. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants were involved in an
                    unlawful conspiracy to defraud the plaintiff through what is known as missing
                    trader intra-community fraud (“MTIC fraud”). The plaintiff
                    (alternatively referred to as “HMRC”) is, amongst other things,
                    responsible for collecting, accounting for, and otherwise managing, the revenue
                    of customs and excise; and the collection and management of value added tax
                    (“VAT”) in the United Kingdom (“UK”). The defendants
                    are Singapore residents and are the alleged officers and agents of an Indonesian
                    incorporated company known as “PT Naina Exim Indo”
                    (“PT Naina”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The <em>modus operandi</em>
                    of MTIC fraud is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     a trader registered in the UK for VAT
                        imports goods into the UK from a supplier in a member state of the European
                        Union (“EU supplier”). Under Art 28c(A)(a) of Council
                        Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the
                        member states relating to turnover taxes and s 30 of the Value Added Tax Act
                        1994 (c 23) (UK), the importer is not required to pay VAT as such
                        imports are zero-rated;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     the UK registered importer (“UK importer”)
                        sells the goods to another party registered for VAT in the UK, known as a
                        “Buffer”. The UK importer charges VAT on the consideration for
                        these sales but the UK importer directs the Buffer to pay the purchase price
                        of the goods together with VAT to a third party (“third party
                        recipient”) outside of the UK’s
                    jurisdiction;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_c"></a>(c)     the UK
                        importer then fails to account to the plaintiff for VAT properly payable
                        (“output VAT”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_d"></a>(d)     the Buffer sells the goods directly or via a chain of
                        traders to an exporter (“Exporter”) who pays VAT
                        (“input VAT”) thereon and then exports the goods out of the
                        UK; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_e"></a>(e)     the
                        Exporter claims reimbursement of the input VAT which he paid on the exported
                        goods from the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff claimed to have suffered loss in
                    the sum of £40,391,100.01, taking into account the amount of input tax paid
                    by the plaintiff on the reimbursement claims made by the Exporter and the output
                    tax that the UK importer failed to account for. For a substantial number of
                    these transaction chains, the plaintiff admitted that it was not able to
                    identify the full transaction chain connecting the Broker to the UK
                    importer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The relevant third party recipient in the
                    present case is a company incorporated in Denmark, known as “Sunico
                    A/S” (“Sunico”). The plaintiff alleged that several EU
                    suppliers sold to the UK importer goods which they had purchased from Sunico.
                    The UK importer in turn sold the goods to Buffers situated in the UK. Although
                    accountable for output VAT charged for these sales, the UK importer directed the
                    Buffers to make payment for the goods, <em>together with
                        VAT</em> to Sunico. The UK importer then defaulted in making payment
                    of output VAT properly payable to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       A company incorporated in Indonesia, PT Naina,
                    introduced some of the EU suppliers to Sunico and was paid commission in
                    consideration. The defendants negotiated the commission agreement between Sunico
                    and PT Naina, under which Sunico agreed to pay PT Naina a percentage of
                    Sunico’s profits as commission. The plaintiff alleged that the commission
                    payments to PT Naina between October 2002 and July 2006 totalled US$14,764,612.
                    The plaintiff claimed that the commission payments were a “mechanism for
                    the division of the proceeds of MTIC fraud amongst co-conspirators” and
                    that the defendants are jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff in damages
                    for the tort of conspiracy. Seen in its totality, the plaintiff’s claim is
                    that the fraudulent conspiracy was to “unlawfully divert monies properly
                    payable to the Plaintiff principally to Sunico and thereafter distributed to its
                    co-conspirators”. The plaintiff obtained a Mareva injunction in Singapore
                    against the defendants (“the Mareva injunction”). The defendants
                    applied to strike out the plaintiff’s claim under O 18 r 19 of the Rules
                    of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed) and the inherent jurisdiction of
                    the court. The defendants also applied to discharge the Mareva
                    injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The defendants contended that the
                    plaintiff’s claim for conspiracy was in effect an enforcement of UK
                    revenue law in Singapore and ought therefore to be struck out under one or more
                    of the grounds in O 18 r 19 or under the inherent jurisdiction of the court. The
                    plaintiff argued that its claim was not an enforcement of UK revenue law,
                    whether directly or indirectly but one based on the tort of conspiracy. As such,
                    the issue between the parties was whether the plaintiff’s claim was
                    directly or indirectly an enforcement of UK revenue law in
                Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The “revenue rule”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       There is no dispute that the revenue rule
                    applies if the plaintiff’s claim is an enforcement of UK revenue law. The
                    dispute, principally, is as to the <em>characterisation</em> of the plaintiff’s claim. As such, a
                    short discussion on the revenue rule will suffice. <em>Dicey,
                        Morris and Collins on The Conflict of Laws</em>, vol 1 (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 14th Ed, 2006) (“<em>Dicey</em>”) at
                    para 5-029 quoted Tomlin J’s observation in <em>In re
                        Visser</em> [1928] 1 Ch 877 at 884 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [T]here is a well recognised rule, which has been enforced for at
                        least 200 years or thereabouts, under which these courts will not collect
                        the taxes of foreign States for the benefit of the sovereigns of those
                        foreign States.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Lord Keith of Avonholm gave the following widely quoted explanation
                    for the revenue rule in <em>Government of India v
                        Taylor</em> [1955] AC 491 (“<em>The
                        Government of India</em>”) (at 511):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">One explanation of the rule thus illustrated may be thought
                        to be that enforcement of a claim for taxes is but an extension of the
                        sovereign power which imposed the taxes, and that an <b><em>assertion of sovereign authority by one State within the territory of
                            another</em></b>, as distinct from a patrimonial claim by a foreign
                        sovereign, is (treaty or convention apart) contrary to all <b><em>concepts of independent sovereignties</em></b>. Another
                        explanation has been given by an eminent American judge, Judge Learned Hand,
                        in the case of <em>Moore v. Mitchell</em> [(1929) 30 F
                        (2d) 600, 604], in a passage, quoted also by Kingsmill Moore J. in the
                        case of <em>Peter Buchanan Ld</em>.
                        [[1955] AC 516] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“While the origin of the exception in the case of penal
                            liabilities does not appear in the books, a sound basis for it exists,
                            in my judgment, which includes liabilities for taxes as well. Even in
                            the case of ordinary municipal liabilities, a court will not recognize
                            those arising in a foreign State, if they run counter to the
                            ‘settled public policy’ of its own. Thus a scrutiny of the
                            liability is necessarily always in reserve, and the possibility that it
                            will be found not to accord with the policy of the domestic State. This
                            is not a troublesome or delicate inquiry when the question arises
                            between private persons, but it takes on quite another face when it
                            concerns the relations between the foreign State and its own citizens or
                            even those who may be temporarily within its borders. <b><em>To pass upon the provisions for the public order of
                                another State is, or at any rate should be, beyond the powers of the
                                court; it involves the relations between the States themselves, with
                                which courts are incompetent to deal, and which are intrusted to
                                other authorities</em></b>. It may commit the domestic State to a
                            position which would seriously embarrass its neighbour. Revenue laws
                            fall within the same reasoning; they affect a State in matters as vital
                            to its existence as its criminal laws. No court ought to undertake an
                            inquiry which it cannot prosecute without determining whether those laws
                            are consonant with its own notions of what is proper.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Lord Somervell of Harrow enunciates the rationale very clearly at
                    514:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Tax gathering is an administrative act, though in settling the quantum as
                        well as in the final act of collection judicial process may be involved. Our
                        courts will apply foreign law if it is the proper law of a contract, the
                        subject of a suit. Tax gathering is not a matter of contract but of
                        authority and administration as between the State and those within its
                        jurisdiction. ... it would be remarkable comity if State B allowed the time
                        of its courts to be expended in assisting in this regard the tax gatherers
                        of State A. Once a judgment has been obtained and it is a question only of
                        its enforcement the factor of time and expense will normally have
                        disappeared. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Lord Keith’s explanation of the rationale of the revenue rule
                    was endorsed more recently in the English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Mbasogo and another v Logo Ltd and others</em>
                    [2007] QB 846 at [40], where it was observed at [41] and [50]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">41    ... the courts will not enforce or otherwise lend
                            their aid to the assertion of sovereign authority by one state in the
                            territory of another. The assertion of such authority may take different
                            forms. Claims to enforce penal or revenue laws are good examples of acts
                            done by a sovereign by virtue of his sovereign authority (‘jure
                            imperii’). In each case, it is necessary to see whether the
                            relevant act is of a sovereign character. Penal and revenue laws are
                            assumed to be of a sovereign character.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">50    ... The critical question is whether in bringing a
                            claim, a claimant is doing an act which is of a sovereign character or
                            which is done by virtue of sovereign authority; and whether the claim
                            involves the exercise or assertion of a sovereign right. If so, then the
                            court will not determine or enforce the claim. On the other hand, if in
                            bringing the claim the claimant is not doing an act which is of a
                            sovereign character or by virtue of sovereign authority and the claim
                            does not involve the exercise or assertion of a sovereign right and the
                            claim does not seek to vindicate a sovereign act or acts, then the court
                            will both determine and enforce it. As we see it, that was the broad
                            distinction of principle which the court was seeking to draw in the

                        (“<em>Relfo</em>”), a decision upheld by
                    the Court of Appeal, Judith Prakash J observed at [55]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... both direct and indirect enforcement of a foreign state’s
                        revenue laws are prohibited. Indirect enforcement occurs where the foreign
                        state (or its nominee) <b><em>in form seeks a remedy, not based
                            on the foreign rule in question, but which in substance is designed to
                            give it extra-territorial effect</em></b>. Thus, the court must not
                        look at the form alone but also at the substance and the effect of the claim
                        to determine if it is an indirect enforcement of a foreign state’s
                        revenue claim. [emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is necessary therefore properly to characterise the
                    plaintiff’s claim. However, before doing so, it is also necessary to
                    consider which system of law is applicable for this purpose.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The characterisation of the plaintiff’s
                    claim is a question for the <em>lex fori</em>. Several
                    distinguished commentaries have opined that it is <em>irrelevant</em> that a foreign law has regarded a claim as one based
                    on the foreign revenue law. As observed by <em>Dicey</em> ([7] <em>supra</em>) at para
                    5-020:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Whether a foreign law falls within the categories of those laws which
                        the English court will not enforce is a matter for English law. Thus whether
                        the foreign law regards the law in question as a penal law or a revenue law
                        or a public law is irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It has been observed in Cheshire, North &amp; Fawcett, <em>Private International Law</em>, (Oxford University Press,
                    14th Ed, 2008) at pp 122–123 that:</p>

                        determined according to the criteria of English law. It is irrelevant
                        whether a foreign law so regards it. ...</p>

                    was an attempt to enforce the revenue laws of a foreign state. Lord Cameron held
                    that the characterisation of the claim was to be made in accordance to the
                        <em>lex fori</em> (at 116):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... in determining whether these [heads of claim] are in fact attempts to
                        enforce revenue law, they have to be considered in light of the <em>lex fori</em>, and it is <b><em>irrelevant</em></b> to consider whether these contributions are
                        regarded by French law as fiscal. ... It is a general rule of law that no
                        state will act as a tax gatherer for another or permit its courts to be used
                        for that purpose, and it is a corollary of that rule that what is a revenue
                        or fiscal claim is to be determined by the Courts of the country where the
                        claim is sought to be enforced and in accordance with the <em>lex fori</em>. Now what is fiscal and what would be regarded as

                        foreign law seems to me to depend, not so much upon the form which the
                        imposition takes or the object upon or in respect of which it is levied, but
                        upon the substance of the claim as viewed by a Scottish Court applying Scots

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     It is clear therefore that the
                    characterisation of the plaintiff’s claim is a matter for the <em>lex fori</em>, <em>ie</em>, this court.
                    Nevertheless, the court may, where appropriate, <em>have
                        regard</em> to the characterisation of the claim made in accordance
                    with the foreign law. In so doing, the court should be mindful of the purpose
                    for which the foreign law was applied to the characterisation process; it may be
                    that the characterisation of the claim was made in the context of the
                    interpretation of domestic legislation unique to the foreign forum. In those
                    circumstances, the foreign characterisation of the claim may be of little
                    assistance or relevance to the matter before the <em>lex
                        fori</em>. Bearing these principles in mind, it is appropriate to
                    consider the plaintiff’s argument that the facts of the present case are
                    the same as those in the House of Lords’ decision of <em>Revenue Commissioners v Total Network SL</em> [2008]
                    1 AC 1174 (“<em>Total
                    Network</em>”) and that this court should reach the same conclusion
                    as to characterisation as that made by the House of Lords.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The House of Lords’ decision of Revenue and Customs
                Commissioners v Total Network SL [2008] 1 AC 1174 (“Total

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In <em>Total
                    Network</em>, the “carousel frauds” were similar to the
                    alleged MTIC fraud in the present case. Total Network, a company incorporated in
                    Spain, sold goods to a UK importer, Redlaw Ltd (“Redlaw”). Redlaw
                    paid no input VAT as the imports were zero-rated, Spain being part of the
                    European Union. In turn, Redlaw sold goods to another UK company but failed to
                    account for VAT (“the output tax”) to HMRC. The goods were sold
                    down a chain of traders in the UK to an Exporter (Alldech) which sold and
                    exported the goods back to Total Network, thus completing one full circle.
                    Alldech obtained reimbursement of VAT (“input VAT”) from HMRC.
                    HMRC brought a claim against Total Network for unlawful means conspiracy in sums
                    equivalent to the amounts of VAT which they claimed to have lost as a result of
                    the carousel frauds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The plaintiff submitted that the House of
                    Lords in <em>Total Network</em> decided that a carousel
                    fraud claim (a specific type of MTIC fraud) is not a claim for tax. However, in
                    my view, the assistance offered by <em>Total Network</em>,
                    if any, is limited. There is no doubt that the House of Lords in <em>Total Network</em> faced the task of <em>characterising</em> the substance of the plaintiff’s claim.
                    However, the question faced by the House of Lords was of a much more precise
                    nature. Their Lordships had to characterise the substance of the
                    plaintiff’s claim <em>for the specific purpose</em>
                    of determining whether it contravened the fundamental constitutional principle
                    enshrined in Art 4 of the Bill of Rights (1689) (c 2) (UK) in England. The
                    discussion of the issue in <em>Total Network</em> was first
                    laid out by Lord Hope of Craighead. The issue was whether the plaintiff’s
                    claim, presented in the form of a claim for damages, was contrary to Art 4 of
                    the Bill of Rights (per Lord Hope at [21]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Total submits that it is a fundamental constitutional
                        principle that no money shall be levied for or to the use of the Crown
                        except by grant of Parliament, and that this in substance is what the
                        commissioners are seeking to do in this case without Parliamentary
                        authority. Although their claim is presented as one for the award of
                        damages, what they are really seeking to do is to recover by indirect means
                        sums due as tax. Their action was ultra vires of the statute, from which
                        alone they derive their powers. It was also contrary to article 4 of the
                        Bill of Rights (1689) which declares:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">‘That levying money for or to the use of the Crown, by pretence
                            of prerogative without grant of Parliament for longer time, or in other
                            manner then the same is or shall be granted, is illegal.’</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Lord Scott of Foscote defined the issue similarly where it
                    was observed that (at [58]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The ... issue is whether the commissioners can bring a private law action
                        to recover the loss they have been caused by the fraudulent conspiracy. It
                        is said that the damages claim is, in substance, a claim to recover the tax
                        that Redlaw has failed to pay. The action constitutes, it is said, an
                        attempt to make Total liable to pay the tax, an attempt that is <b><em>barred by article 4 of the Bill of Rights</em></b>:
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the same vein, Lord Mance observed (at [111]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The questions to which they give rise are (a) whether the pursuit of
                        any claim by the commissioners against Total Network SL in conspiracy is
                        precluded by (i) the Bill of Rights and/or (ii) the statutory scheme of the
                        Value Added Tax Act 1994 and (b) whether, if it is not, it can as pleaded
                        exist in law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Indeed, Lord Mance emphasised that the appeal
                    was brought <em>only</em> on the question whether the
                    plaintiff’s claim was precluded by the Bill of Rights. This was the case
                    even during oral argument before the House of Lords. Holding that the claim did
                    not fall within Art 4 of the Bill of Rights, Lord Mance stated at
                    [126]–[127]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">126    ... It is a curious feature that the appeal was in
                            terms <b><em>brought only</em></b> on part (i) of issue
                            (a), that is the Bill of Rights point. Part (ii), the inconsistent
                            statutory scheme point, was taken below, but not in either the
                            cross-notice of appeal or the statement of issues. Total’s case
                            only mentions the statutory scheme as a background factor to its
                            submissions on issue (b) and to the Bill of Rights. <b><em>Even during oral argument before the House</em></b>, Mr Charles
                            Flint for Total did no more than say that issue (a) could also be put on
                            a pure ‘ultra vires/statutory’ basis, but that article 4 of
                            the Bill of Rights was how they had formulated it. However, as all
                            aspects of issue (a) involve pure questions of law and raise questions
                            of general importance, I agree that they need deciding.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">127    ... I agree with Lord Scott (para 59) and Lord
                            Neuberger (paras 168–172) in rejecting Total’s submission
                            that the commissioners’ claim infringes article 4 of the Bill of
                            Rights (issue (a), part (i)). For the reasons they give the
                            commissioners’ claim is a damages claim for being wrongfully
                            cheated of moneys or revenue with the management or collection of which
                            the commissioners were entrusted, <b><em>rather than a
                                claim to levy money for or to the use of the Crown within the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury observed (at [168]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Article 4 of the Bill of Rights (1689) renders ‘illegal’
                        ‘levying money for or to the use of the Crown’ if it is
                        ‘by pretence of prerogative, without grant of Parliament’. It
                        appears to me that, in order to decide whether this provision bars the
                        present claim, it is necessary to identify the proper characterisation of
                        the commissioners’ claim. In particular, is their claim for damages in
                        tort, or for recovery of tax, or indeed should it be characterised in some
                        other way? ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It is clear that the issue in <em>Total Network</em> (<a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> <em>supra</em>) was whether the plaintiff’s claim was
                    a levying of money for or to the use of the Crown without grant of Parliament.
                    If it was, the claim would be struck out. It did not matter that the words
                    “levying” or “recovery” of taxes were at times used
                    interchangeably by the Law Lords; that did not detract from the fact that the
                    characterisation made by the House of Lords was for a specific purpose, which
                    was to determine whether the claim fell <em>within the
                        meaning</em> of Art 4 of the Bill of Rights (1689).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In my view, the fact that the English court
                    found that a claim presented as one for damages upon the tort of conspiracy in
                    the factual context of an alleged MTIC fraud, was not a levying of money for or
                    to the use of the Crown within the meaning of Art 4 of the Bill of Rights (1689)
                    does not preclude a Singapore court from determining, after a process of
                    characterisation of the substance of the claim for the purposes of the revenue
                    rule, that such a claim is in effect an indirect (if not direct) enforcement of
                    UK revenue law to recover VAT. The revenue rule encompassses a much broader test
                    with especial regard to <em>indirect attempts</em> to
                    recover tax than the determination of whether such a similar claim fell within
                    the scope of Art 4 of the Bill of Rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Characterisation of the plaintiff’s claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In the characterisation of the
                    plaintiff’s claim to determine if it is in substance, either directly or
                    indirectly, a claim to enforce a foreign revenue law or an attempt to recover
                    tax for another sovereign, the court has to take into account all relevant
                    facts. It is important to consider the facts set out in the pleaded case, as
                    well as the measure of loss claimed by the plaintiff. As will be seen below, the
                    identity of the plaintiff may also go some way towards suggesting the nature of
                    the plaintiff’s claim.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Lord Scott (in <em>Total
                        Network</em>) found that the plaintiff’s claim was a claim for
                    damages for loss caused by the fraudulent conspiracy; it was not a claim for
                    tax. However, His Lordship made this finding because the sum claimed by the
                    plaintiff in <em>Total Network</em> was the amount of input
                    tax that Alldech (the Exporter) had claimed by way of reimbursement from HMRC.
                    The plaintiff’s claim was not against Redlaw (the UK importer) for the
                    amount of unaccounted output tax properly payable to the HMRC (per Lord Scott at
                    [59]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... It is true that Total are not taxable under the statutory VAT scheme
                        in respect of any of the pleaded transactions, but the claim against Total
                        is not a claim for tax. It is a claim for damages, for loss, caused by the
                        fraudulent conspiracy. The consolidated and amended particulars of claim
                        claim from Total damages (for the first conspiracy) of ‘not less than
                        £253,345.50’. <b><em>That was the sum paid by the
                            revenue to Alldech in response to Alldech’s claim for repayment of
                            the VAT Alldech had paid as input tax to The Accessory People. It was
                            not the amount of the VAT in respect of which Redlaw, the missing
                            trader, should have accounted to the revenue</em></b>. ... [emphasis
                        added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In the present case, there is no allegation
                    that the claims by the Exporter for reimbursement were illegitimate and not
                    genuine. Indeed, the plaintiff’s counsel conceded that, as pleaded, the
                    alleged conspiracy <em>did not</em> involve the Exporter. I
                    must add that the decision to omit the Exporter from the statement of claim was
                    a conscious decision made, even after the plaintiff had amended its claim, and
                    the same position was maintained by counsel even at the very last hearing before
                    me. It is undisputed that based on the plaintiff’s claim, the <em>only</em> party that could have wrongfully obtained
                    reimbursements of input tax from HMRC in the whole factual matrix of MTIC fraud
                    would have been the Exporter. If the claim was indeed against the Exporter, or
                    had at least implicated the Exporter, it might have been arguable that HMRC was
                    in essence making a civil claim for recovery of <em>input
                        tax</em> which it had previously collected but had been deceived into
                    reimbursing to the Exporter. Unlike a claim for recovery of unpaid output VAT,
                    such a civil claim might arguably be distinguishable from a sovereign claim for
                    recovery of a revenue debt. In the present case however, by omitting the
                    Exporter from the alleged conspiracy (“the material omission”),
                    the plaintiff’s claim <em>is not in respect of</em>
                    the reimbursements paid out by HMRC. It was common ground before me that in the
                    absence of conspiracy involving the Exporter as co-conspirator, the UK
                    importer’s failure or default in payment of VAT does not affect the
                    eligibility of the Exporter to make a <em>bona fide</em>
                    reimbursement claim from HMRC. Equally, the failure (intentional or otherwise)
                    on the part of the Exporter to make a claim for reimbursement does not absolve
                    the UK importer from liability to pay any outstanding output VAT. It follows
                    from the material omission that the losses were suffered by HMRC <em>because of the UK importer’s failure to pay output
                        tax</em>, regardless of whether the reimbursements of input tax were
                    wrongly paid out. The present claim is therefore essentially for the recovery of
                    output tax properly payable (but not paid) by the UK importer to HMRC. As such,
                    the present claim is <em>different in a significant
                        respect</em> from the claim in <em>Total
                        Network</em> where, as highlighted by Lord Scott (see above), the
                    claim was against Alldech (the Exporter) for recovery of reimbursements wrongly
                    paid out by HMRC. Where, as in <em>Total Network</em>, the
                    Exporter was complicit in the carousel fraud, it did not matter whether
                    HMRC’s claim was for recovery of the reimbursements which HMRC had been
                    induced to pay out or for payment of the output tax.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Turning now to the specific facts alleged in
                    the statement of claim, the plaintiff averred that:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">14.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Harm was
                            inflicted on the Plaintiff and/or the Plaintiff was injured by (inter
                            alia):</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">(a)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">payment by the Plaintiff to the [Exporter] of
                                the sums referred to in paragraph 5 above ...</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Without doubt, in such circumstance HMRC
                    suffered a loss in that while it did not receive output tax from the UK
                    importer, it paid out to the Exporter, by way of reimbursement, input tax
                    previously paid by the latter. However, the pleading stopped short of alleging
                    that the Exporter was a co-conspirator. In the absence of such an averment, the
                    Exporter’s claim for reimbursement could well be legitimate. As earlier
                    observed, the UK importer’s failure to pay output VAT does not affect the
                    eligibility of the Exporter to make a <em>bona fide</em>
                    claim for reimbursement of input VAT from HMRC. Therefore, the plaintiff’s
                    claim remains essentially one for recovery of output VAT which the UK importer
                    defaulted in paying and instead caused to be diverted to Sunico. The plaintiff
                    pleaded that:</p>

                    plaintiff that had been diverted from the UK importer to Sunico. First, the UK
                    importer directed the Buffer to pay the purchase price of the goods together
                    with VAT to Sunico. Part of the output tax was then diverted to PT Naina with
                    the alleged help of the defendants under the guise of a commission agreement.
                    Based on the pleadings, the essence of the claim was for output tax properly
                    payable to the plaintiff but diverted to Sunico. Unlike the factual matrix in
                        <em>Total Network</em>, there was <em>no
                        allegation</em>that the input tax reimbursed by the plaintiff to the

                    of a claim for the purposes of the revenue rule. Obviously, the House of Lords
                    was not required to characterise the claim for the purpose of determining
                    whether it was in substance an attempt to enforce foreign revenue law. In this
                    respect, I find more of assistance the decision of <em>Peter
                        Buchanan Ld and Macharg v McVey</em> [1955] AC 516
                        (“<em>Peter Buchanan</em>”) and the local
                    decision of <em>Relfo</em> (<a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> <em>supra</em>). In <em>Relfo</em>, a
                    decision upheld by the Court of Appeal, a company became liable to pay a
                    substantial amount of income tax to the United Kingdom Inland Revenue
                    (“UKIR”) as a result of a highly profitable property transaction.
                    The directors of the company diverted to different entities moneys which would
                    otherwise have been available to pay the tax. When the company became insolvent,
                    a liquidator was appointed to recover the moneys. The liquidator caused an
                    action to be brought by the company against the defendant for knowing receipt of
                    moneys wrongfully disposed of by the directors of the company. The defendant
                    argued that the liquidator’s claim on behalf of the company was brought
                    for the purpose of enforcing a foreign revenue debt in Singapore. The plaintiff
                    disagreed, arguing that it was not a claim brought by the UKIR and that the UKIR
                    did not fund the plaintiff’s claim nor direct the liquidation proceedings.
                    The court rejected this argument and found that the claim was one to enforce a
                    foreign revenue debt in Singapore (at [70]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The plaintiff argued that this was not a claim by the UKIR because it
                        was not funding the liquidator and was not directing this action or the
                        liquidation proceedings. In my view, these differences are only superficial.
                        It must be remembered that Mr Bramston was not the Gorecias’ choice of
                        liquidator. They appointed someone else and it was the UKIR that decided to
                        replace the original liquidator with Mr Bramston. Secondly, Mr Bramston is
                        not the standard type of liquidator who is appointed to administer the
                        assets of the company in liquidation. He is a liquidator who is appointed to
                        pursue claims. This is his main area of practice and the UKIR is his main
                        client. UKIR appointed him as liquidator because it considered that there
                        were claims that could be pursued by the plaintiff to recover funds which
                        funds could be used to repay the outstanding taxes. The fact that Mr
                        Bramston works on a no-win no-fee basis should not be allowed to obscure the
                        prime purpose of his appointment, <em>ie</em>, to
                        recover funds for the creditors. Since the only creditor of the plaintiff is
                        the UKIR, the funds will go to the UKIR as Mr Bramston agreed in court.
                        There is no need for the UKIR to direct the liquidation since it knows that
                        Mr Bramston will have to pursue the plaintiff's claims if he is to receive
                        any payment for his work. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the result, although the court was satisfied that on the facts a
                        <em>prima facie</em> case of knowing receipt had been
                    made out against the defendant, it disallowed the claim as having been brought
                    for the purpose of indirectly enforcing a foreign revenue debt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In <em>Peter
                        Buchanan</em> (<a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> <em>supra</em>), the plaintiff company was a company which
                    had been put into liquidation by the revenue authorities of Scotland in respect
                    of a very large claim for excess profits tax and income tax. The liquidator was
                    essentially a nominee of the revenue. The defendant was the majority shareholder
                    and managing director of the plaintiff company who had set up a series of
                    transactions with the purpose of transferring the funds of the plaintiff company
                    to Ireland and then decamped to Ireland so as to avoid paying taxes. The
                    liquidator caused the plaintiff to sue the defendant to recover the moneys
                    transferred. The summons claimed an account of all moneys due to the company by
                    the defendant as director, trustee and agent and payment of all sums so found
                    due. The Irish court considered the various cases on the enforcement of foreign
                    revenue and penal laws and held that although the transaction was a dishonest
                    transaction designed to defeat the claim of the revenue in Scotland, the claim
                    had to be rejected because the proceedings were in substance an attempt to
                    enforce the Scottish revenue laws in Ireland and the Irish court would not lend
                    its aid for this purpose. As such, the claim was dismissed even though the court
                    was clear that the defendant had been the perpetrator of a dishonest scheme to
                    defraud the revenue authorities. Lord Keith of Avonholm in <em>Government of India</em> (<a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> <em>supra</em>) (at 510) made the following observations of
                    the decision in <em>Peter Buchanan</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The defendant having realized the whole assets of the company in his
                        capacity as a director and having satisfied substantially the whole of the
                        company's indebtedness, other than that due to the revenue, <b><em>by a variety of devices had the balance transferred to himself
                            to his credit with an Irish bank and decamped to Ireland</em></b>. The
                        action was in form an action to recover this balance from the defendant at
                        the instance of the company directed by the liquidator. ... The judge held
                        that the transaction was a <b><em>dishonest
                            transaction</em></b> designed to defeat the claim of the revenue in
                        Scotland as a creditor and was ultra vires of the company and accordingly
                        rejected the defendant’s submission. On the other hand, he held that
                        although the action was in form an action by the company to recover these
                        assets <b>it was in substance an attempt to enforce
                            indirectly a claim to tax by the revenue authorities of another
                            State</b>. He accordingly dismissed the action. ... [emphasis
                        added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The court in <em>Peter
                        Buchanan</em> found that the revenue authority knew that it would not
                    have any chance of success if it brought proceedings in its own capacity, and
                    had therefore attempted to recover the revenue debt through <em>bankruptcy proceedings</em> (at [529]–[530]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… it is clear that its enforcement must not depend merely on the
                        form in which the claim is made. <b><em>It is not a question
                            whether the plaintiff is a foreign State or the representative of a
                            foreign State or its revenue authority</em></b>. In every case
                            <b><em>the substance of the claim must be
                            scrutinized</em></b>, and if it then appears that it is really a suit
                        brought for the purpose of collecting the debts of a foreign revenue it must
                        be rejected. Mr. Wilson has pressed upon me the difficulty of deciding such
                        a <b><em>question of fact</em></b> …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The <b><em>foreign revenue instead of courting

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I hold that the sole object of the present proceedings before me
                        is also to collect a Scottish revenue debt, and that if I were to decide for
                        the plaintiff <b><em>the only result of those proceedings would
                            be that every penny recovered after paying certain costs and
                            liquidator’s remuneration could be claimed by the Scottish
                            Revenue</em></b>. That, in my opinion, is the substance of the suit
                        – to collect the revenue claim of a foreign State. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As can be seen from <em>Relfo</em> and <em>Peter Buchanan</em>, the
                    intervening liquidation proceedings did not prevent the court from finding that
                    the liquidator’s claim was in substance one to enforce a foreign revenue
                    debt. In my view, the argument for the application of the revenue rule is even
                    stronger in the present case. The present claim was brought by the authority
                    conferred by the UK Parliament with the power and responsibility to recover VAT,
                    under the Value Added Tax Act 1994 (c 23) (UK) and the Commissioners for Revenue
                    and Customs Act 2005 (c 11) (UK). Any moneys recovered by the present claim
                    would <em>restore</em> the HMRC’s tax coffers to the
                    position <em>they would have been</em> in if VAT output tax
                    had been collected. I should add, however, that I am not suggesting that
                        <em>any</em> claim brought by a tax authority <em>ipso facto</em> amounts to a claim to enforce revenue law.
                    The relevance of the plaintiff’s identity must necessarily be determined
                    within the factual context of the claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Having considered the above factors in
                    totality, and based on the reasons given, I found that the plaintiff’s
                    claim to be in substance and in effect an attempt to recover the uncollected VAT
                    (output tax) properly payable to the plaintiff. The cause of action pleaded as a
                    claim based on the tort of conspiracy for which a remedy in damages is sought is
                    in substance an attempt to recover UK Value Added Tax extra-territorially. Such
                    a claim is contrary to considerations of public policy. The claim was thus
                    struck out pursuant to O 18 r 19 (with emphasis on O 18
                        r 19(1)(<em>d)</em>) as well as in the exercise of
                    the inherent jurisdiction of the court. In consequence, the Mareva Injunction
                    was also discharged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The plaintiff argued in the alternative that,
                    “even if [its claim] were in any way an enforcement of foreign revenue
                    law to pursue substantive relief in Singapore, that [was] not being
                    done”. The plaintiff argued that it “[did] not seek to have the
                    substantive dispute between the parties determined in Singapore”, since
                    it had stayed its own proceedings in Singapore. As such, the plaintiff argued
                    that the Mareva injunction was simply the rendering of assistance to the ongoing
                    proceedings in the UK.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     There were no authorities provided to support
                    the plaintiff’s arguments. Furthermore, the plaintiff could not explain
                    how the existence of a Mareva injunction in Singapore could render <em>assistance</em> to the UK proceedings other than the
                    subsequent <em>enforcement</em> and satisfaction of the UK
                    judgment in Singapore, in the event that the plaintiff succeeded in the UK
                    proceedings. The plaintiff’s argument was therefore a mere attempt to
                        <em>delay the application of the revenue rule</em> at
                    the expense of the defendants. I therefore rejected the plaintiff’s
                    alternative argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     After I allowed the defendant’s
                    application to strike out the plaintiff’s claim, a Recorder in the High
                    Court of Hong Kong dismissed a similar application by the same defendants in
                        <em>Her Majesty’s Revenue &amp; Customs v Hashu
                        Dhalomal Shahdadpuri and another</em>, High Court of Hong Kong, Court
                    of First Instance, Miscellaneous Proceedings No 938 of 2010. In the course of
                    further arguments before me, the plaintiff’s counsel referred me to the
                    Hong Kong decision and argued that it was of persuasive value. I was of the view
                    that the decision offered little assistance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The learned Recorder had at first observed,
                    from counsel’s submissions, that some of the Brokers might be wholly
                    innocent and uninvolved in any alleged conspiracy. At [13] in the judgment, he
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13.    Mr Pun also relies on what he submits is a
                            ‘concession’ on the part of Mr Johnny Ma, counsel for HMRC,
                            in his Skeleton Submissions to the effect that <b><em>the
                                Brokers involved in the carousel fraud are not necessarily parties
                                to the conspiracy, including some who may be wholly innocent. Mr Pun
                                submits that because some of the Brokers (recipients of refund from
                                HMRC) may be innocent</em></b>, the only viable claim can only be
                            for loss resulting from failure by the Defaulters to pay the VAT.
                            [emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">If the Brokers were innocent, there would be no basis for the
                    plaintiff to seek to recover from them the input tax reimbursed to them. If the
                    learned Recorder did allow that some of the Brokers might have been innocent, it
                    is surprising that further on in the judgment the learned Recorder regarded the
                    refund of input tax to the Brokers to be part of the “whole fraudulent
                    chain”. In this regard, he appeared to have been misled by Mr Ma, counsel
                    for HMRC whose submission was captured in [15] of the judgment as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15.    As to the ‘concession’, Mr Ma contends
                            that the fact that some of the Brokers may have been innocent does not
                            in any way affect the true nature of HMRC’s claim, which is to
                            recover the losses suffered by HMRC as a result of the unlawful
                            conspiracy. <b><em>The refund to the Brokers was the means
                                by way of which money was extracted from HMRC, which was then used
                                to fund the ‘carousel’</em></b>. [emphasis added in
                            italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is patently clear that if the refund was extracted from HMRC to
                    fund the carousel, the Brokers could not have been innocent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     It would appear that, in the learned
                    Recorder’s mind, the entire chain, including the claim by the Brokers for
                    refund, was fraudulent. This can be seen from [20] and [24] of his
                    judgment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20.    In my view, <b><em>HMRC is not
                                seeking to recover any tax properly payable or seeking to enforce

                                damages the out of pocket losses</em></b> which it has suffered
                                <b><em>as a result of the alleged fraud</em></b>
                            perpetuated by the conspirators. Mr Pun, in focusing his case on the
                            failure on the part of the Defaulters to pay VAT, is only looking at
                            half the story – and, for that matter, perhaps not the important
                            half. ... <b><em>the whole fraudulent chain must be
                                considered</em></b> and the inevitable view one comes to when
                            taking into account the entire ‘carousel’ is that the scheme
                            was a fraudulent one engineered to deceive HMRC by exploiting a loophole
                            in the VAT legislation. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24.    ... The plain fact as raised by HMRC in its
                            pleaded case is that <b><em>it has suffered monetary loss
                                by having paid out on VAT refund claims which are not

                            pursuant to the conspiracy.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">If the refund claims tax were <em>not
                        genuine</em> and were used to <em>fund the carousel
                        fraud</em>, this would necessarily mean the Brokers were part of the
                    conspiracy. The decision in Hong Kong is, therefore, significantly different

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Striking out in “plain and obvious” cases</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     At a late stage of the proceedings, I raised
                    the question whether the requirement that it be “plain and
                    obvious” applied to each of the grounds for striking out in O 18 r 19.
                    Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the statement of claim should only be
                    struck out if it was plain and obvious that it disclosed no reasonable cause of
                    action, pursuant to O 18 r 19(1)(<em>a</em>), or that it
                    was a plain and obvious case of an abuse of process, pursuant to O 18 r
                        19(1)(<em>d</em>). Counsel for the defendants submitted
                    that the courts are stricter in this requirement with respect to the first limb
                    (under O 18 r 19(1)(<em>a</em>), that the claim discloses
                    no reasonable cause of action) and adopts a slightly more flexible view to
                    striking out claims under the fourth limb (under O 18 r 19(1)(<em>d</em>) that the claim is an abuse of court
                process).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Upon further reflection, I came to the view
                    that for purposes of the application before me, it was not necessary to reach a
                    definitive conclusion. Suffice it to say that I was satisfied that the
                    plaintiff’s claim was a plain and obvious attempt to recover unpaid output
                    tax for a foreign sovereign. The fact that the parties’ detailed
                    submissions took several sessions did not necessarily mean that there was no
                    plain and obvious case for striking out. As L P Thean JA held in <em>Bank of China v Asiaweek Ltd</em> [1991]
                    1 SLR(R) 230 (“<em>Bank of
                    China</em>”) at [6]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The present case is, in my opinion, a plain and obvious case, <b><em>though counsel for the plaintiff and the defendant each
                            developed prolonged and serious arguments before me – both counsel
                            took more than a day on their arguments</em></b>. But, in the words of
                        Sir Gordon Willmer in <em>Drummond-Jackson</em>
                            (<a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> <em>supra</em>) at 700, the question whether a point is
                        plain and obvious <b><em>does not depend upon the length of
                            time it takes to argue. Rather the question is whether, when the point
                            has been argued, it has become plain and obvious that there can be but
                            one result</em></b>. [emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The court in <em>Bank of
                        China</em> endorsed with approval the observations made by the English
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Drummond-Jackson v British Medical
                        Association and others</em> [1970] 1 WLR 688, (Lord Pearson
                    at 695–696):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Over a long period of years it has been firmly established by many
                        authorities that the power to strike out a statement of claim as disclosing
                        no reasonable cause of action is a summary power which should be exercised
                        only in plain and obvious cases. The authorities are collected in <em>The Supreme Court Practice, 1970</em>, under the heading
                        ‘Exercise of powers under this rule’ in the notes under R.S.C.,
                        Ord. 18 r. 19, p. 284. One which might be added is <em>Nagle
                            v. Feilden</em> [1966] 2 Q.B. 633, 648, 651. Reference has been
                        made to four recent cases: <em>Rondel v. Worsley</em>
                        [1969] 1 A.C. 191; <em>Wiseman v. Borneman</em> [1969]
                        3 W.L.R. 706; <em>Roy v. Prior</em> [1970] 1 Q.B. 283;
                        and <em>Schmidt v. Home Office</em> [1969] 2 Ch. 149.
                            <b><em>In each of these cases there was an important
                            question of principle involved, and the hearing of the application under
                            R.S.C., Ord. 18, r. 19 was much longer and more elaborate than is usual,
                            but the final decision was that the alleged cause of action was clearly
                            unsustainable</em></b>, and so the statement of claim disclosed no
                        reasonable cause of action and was ordered to be struck out. There was no
                        departure from the principle that the order for striking out should only be
                        made if it becomes plain and obvious that the claim or defence cannot
                        succeed, but the <b><em>procedural method was unusual in that
                            there was a relatively long and elaborate instead of a short and summary
                            hearing</em></b>. ... [emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Consider for the moment, if the striking out
                    application was dismissed on the basis that it was not plain and obvious, what
                    would the result be? The same question of characterisation would still have to
                    be decided either at trial or by way of a preliminary hearing (pursuant to O 33
                    r 2) in the same way as had taken place before me. Counsel would still be
                    submitting the same arguments based on the same facts found in the same set of
                    pleadings. <em>This was not a case where new evidence was
                        required</em> (for none was relied on in the process of
                    characterisation) <em>or that new facts had to be
                        pleaded</em> (for the plaintiff had already amended its pleadings).
                    The sole dispute was as to the characterisation of the claim. Even if the trial
                    judge was to take the plaintiff’s case at its best, where all the facts
                    set out in the statement of claim were accepted as true, the same question of
                    characterisation of the claim would still have to be answered before the
                    judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Indeed, in <em>Relfo</em>
                        (<a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> <em>supra</em>), although the court found from the evidence
                    gathered during the trial that there was a <em>prima
                        facie</em> case of knowing receipt made out against the defendant, the
                    court had to deal with the inescapable question of characterisation, and the
                    claim was in the end found to be an indirect enforcement of foreign revenue law
                    and therefore dismissed on that basis. In this regard, the observation made by
                    the Court of Appeal in <em>Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners (suing as
                        a firm) v Wee Chong Jin</em> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 649 is
                    particularly apposite (at [18]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The practice of the courts has been that, where an application
                        for striking out involves a lengthy and serious argument, the court should
                        decline to proceed with the argument unless, not only does it <b>have doubts as to the soundness of the pleading but, in
                            addition, it is satisfied that striking out will obviate the necessity
                            for a trial or reduce the burden of preparing for a trial</b>.
                        [emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     For the reasons above, I affirmed my decision
                    that the plaintiff’s claim be struck out pursuant to O 18 r 19
                    (with emphasis on O 18 r 19(1)(<em>d</em>)) and in the
                    exercise of the inherent jurisdiction of the court and that the Mareva
                    injunction be discharged. Nevertheless, the defendants undertook to observe the
                    terms of the injunction until the final disposal of the appeal provided that the
                    plaintiff filed the notice of appeal within a stipulated period of time (which,
                    in the event, it has done).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     At the hearing on 28 September 2010, I had
                    ordered that the costs of and incidental to the applications in Summons Nos 2437
                    and 2559 (both of 2010) and the costs in the suit be to the respective
                    defendants, such costs to be taxed unless agreed. It remains for me to add to
                    these the costs in favour of the defendants in respect of further arguments,
                    such costs similarly to be taxed unless agreed.</p>
