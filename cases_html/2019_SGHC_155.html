This was for onward transmission to Imran’s customers. Tamil then arranged with his supplier for the necessary, and asked Pragas to assist him with the delivery. The delivery on that morning was the culmination of their plan. Tamil’s plan required two persons in order to effect delivery. He would first meet Imran to check that the location and the payment was secure. Thereafter he would telephone Pragas, who would go to the assigned location and deliver the heroin. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Imran accepted that there was a delivery of heroin to himself, and that he was engaged in a conspiracy to have heroin so delivered. His defence was that he only intended to traffic in one pound of heroin, which brought his offence below the capital punishment threshold. Tamil was his “boss”. Imran contended he was Tamil’s courier. Tamil, contrary to his promise to deliver him a single pound of heroin for onward distribution, gave him two pounds, contrary to their prior agreement and his intention.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Pragas and Tamil, on the other hand, testified that their common intention was to deliver contraband cigarettes to Imran. In keeping with their plan, they contended, they delivered two cartons of cigarettes – and not heroin – to Imran that morning. Pragas highlighted that he had minimal interaction with Imran, and had been paid to assist Tamil with deliveries of contraband cigarettes. They would travel from Malaysia to Singapore to meet a contact who would hand over the cigarettes. On that morning, a Malay man went into a toilet in Tuas to put the white plastic bag into Pragas’s haversack, which Pragas then transported to the venue and handed over to Imran, thinking that the bag contained cigarettes. Tamil, similarly, contended that cigarettes were delivered that morning. The $6,700 found on his person at the time of arrest was a loan he sought from Imran because they had a plan to buy 400 cartons of contraband cigarettes. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Imran</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Imran gave a total of seven statements. The Prosecution relied on the first six statements, recorded on 8–11 and 14 February 2017. Imran contended at trial that only his last and seventh statement, recorded on 18 December 2017, was accurate. His counsel asked for an ancillary hearing in respect of the first six statements, to which Prosecution agreed, and I therefore conducted. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The ancillary hearing</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Imran’s basis for his allegation of threat, inducement or promise was that on the morning of 8 February 2017, when the CNB officers were raiding the Unit, he heard a CNB officer tell his colleague in English the following statement, which I refer to in these grounds as “the Disputed Statement”:

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Section 258(3) of the CPC states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The court shall refuse to admit the statement of an accused or allow it to be used in the manner referred to in subsection (1) if the making of the statement appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against the accused, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient, in the opinion of the court, to give the accused grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making the statement he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Section 258(3) comprises two limbs: an objective limb requiring that there was in fact, a threat, inducement or promise; and a subjective limb requiring that the threat, inducement or promise operated on the mind of the accused through hope of escape or fear of punishment connected with the charge (see <span class="font-italic">Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v Public Prosecutor</span> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 619 at [53]; <span class="font-italic">Ismail bin Abdul Rahman v Public Prosecutor</span> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 74 (“<span class="font-italic">Ismail</span>”) at [36]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 First, there was no evidence of the Disputed Statement having been made by anyone. Imran’s contention was a bare assertion. He was unable to recall which officer made the statement. He did not follow up with any of them to verify that he had heard the statement correctly, or that it had any veracity. The fact that Imran failed to seek clarification from anyone regarding the meaning of such a nebulous statement suggests that the Disputed Statement was raised as an afterthought. The Prosecution argued that there was no reason for the CNB officers to threaten to arrest Imran’s elderly parents, who were not involved in Imran’s activities. The 12 CNB officers who were on duty that morning were called to give evidence, and each affirmed that no such statement was made by any of them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Second, even assuming that the statement was made, it could not objectively amount to a threat, inducement or promise. Bringing Imran’s parents to the police station did not amount to a threat. No danger arose therefrom. There was nothing to suggest that they were involved in Imran’s dealings, nor did the officers question them at any point. The raid was targeted at Imran alone. Regarding the “good chance” that was purportedly offered to Imran, this was too vague and uncertain to amount to an inducement. As stated in <span class="font-italic">Ismail</span> at [41], it is important for the court to consider the degree of assurance offered in any given case. The mere offer of a “good chance”, without more, could not serve as an inducement. Much less an inducement that operated on Imran’s mind throughout the course of seven days between 8 February, when he gave his first statement, to 14 February 2017, the date of his sixth statement. The corollary is that any inducement arising from the Disputed Statement, even if genuinely heard by Imran, would be self-induced. Self-perceived threats are insufficient to render a statement involuntary; the existence of a threat, inducement or promise from a person in authority must be established (<span class="font-italic">Lu Lai Heng v Public Prosecutor</span> [1994] 1 SLR(R) 1037 at [19]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I held, therefore, that it was proved beyond reasonable doubt that the six statements were voluntarily made. They were duly admitted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Abetment by conspiracy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Coming then to the elements of Imran’s offence, the Prosecution’s case was that Imran knowingly conspired with Pragas and Tamil to deliver two pounds of heroin for $6,700, for onward sale and distribution, and this plan was successfully carried out on 8 February 2017. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Act of delivery of heroin</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 While SSSgt Chew and W/SSgt Lee observed the transfer of the white plastic bag from Pragas and Tamil to Imran, they did so from the Parc Vista condominium unit, which was approximately 50m to 60m away from the Unit.

He said he received the heroin in the white plastic bag, then transferred the heroin he received from the white plastic bag into a black plastic bag and thereafter stored the black plastic bag with the two bundles within it in the storeroom. When cross-examined on the reason for transferring the bundles from the white bag into a black bag, he explained that he took the bundles out and put them into an opaque black plastic bag before putting them away in the storeroom because the original white bag was very thin and he did not want his parents to see the contents. The white bag D1 was shown to the court by Home Team Specialist Toh Sin Ee and I would mention that it was an almost translucent bag, consistent with Imran’s testimony.

Each time, Imran would hand the money to Tamil, and Pragas would subsequently deliver the heroin.

A few minutes later, Pragas returned the call from a different number, informing Imran that Tamil was busy and would return his call.

</div> Imran stated that Tamil had instructed him to hold on to the bundles of heroin, and to wait for a phone call by a Singaporean Indian known as “55”. “55” was a Singaporean Indian who was about 30 years old, skinny, and without any tattoos. After delivering the drugs to “55”, Imran would purportedly collect money on Tamil’s behalf. He would then be paid a sum of $300 by Tamil. This was the position Imran maintained at trial.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I note here that even if I were to accept Imran’s defence, his actions would nevertheless fall within the definition of trafficking, which includes the sending or delivering of unauthorised drugs (see above at [17]). His defence would simply serve to reduce the weight of drugs trafficked to below the threshold for attracting capital punishment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In any case, I rejected this defence. First, it was evidently raised as an afterthought, and did not square with other aspects of the evidence. Imran’s previous statements contained clear admissions of his awareness of how much heroin he had agreed to traffic. He appears to have begun regretting this on 22 February 2017 when he saw Dr Cheow, and therefore told Dr Cheow he ordered one bundle. I note that this is inconsistent with his evidence at trial that he expected two small bundles, although in both scenarios the amount to be received would likely be under the capital punishment threshold for diamorphine. Imran’s account in his December 2017 statement (that he worked for Tamil as a courier and expected to deliver drugs to “55”) was even more difficult to believe. “55” was clearly a figment of his imagination, as were the allegations that he worked for Tamil for a $300 commission. Imran’s new contention would also require him to explain the $6,700 paid to Tamil, which was otherwise a clear nexus to the sale of two pounds of heroin because it reflected the market price for the same. Imran tried to explain this away by claiming that $3,700 was received from “55” and the remainder was a $3,000 loan he was making to “his boss” Tamil, who would pay him after “55” collected the drugs.

</div> This explanation was illogical. If Imran were truly working for Tamil, and being paid $300 per delivery to “55”, why would Tamil require $3,000 from him? In any case, this explanation was not only unsupported by evidence but also contradicted by Tamil, who instead claimed that the entire sum of $6,700 was a loan from Imran for the purchase of cigarettes.

Acceptance of Imran’s version of events at trial would require acceptance that Imran could not tell the difference in weight between one and two pounds of heroin.

Imran’s excuse must further be weighed against another piece of his own evidence, to the effect that there was a previous delivery just immediately before the 8 February 2017 delivery, either on 2 or 3 February 2017, where he had been given “four small bundles but what was promised were [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]<span class="font-italic"> </span>two small bundles”.

</div> If so, on 8 February, he ought to have been more cautious about the number of bundles he was given. This is a wholly different situation from past cases such as <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Farid bin Mohd Yusop</span> [2015] 3 SLR 16 (“<span class="font-italic">Farid</span>”), where the accused had similarly alleged that he had entered into an agreement with his supplier to traffic in a non-capital quantity of drugs. There, at [25]–[33], the Court of Appeal accepted the accused’s assertion that he did not know he was carrying more than 250g of Ice. In reaching this decision, the court placed emphasis on the fact that there was no “inherent contradiction” between the accused’s statements and his defence, as well as the fact that the weight of Ice delivered on three prior occasions was 250g or less (see <span class="font-italic">Farid</span> at [28] and [32]). In contrast, in this case, Imran has no basis for such sanguinity. Indeed, by Imran’s own admission, Tamil had previously delivered to him an excessive amount of heroin. This being the case, he must surely have been cognisant of the possibility of a misdelivery occurring yet again on 8 February 2017.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on charge against Imran</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I found therefore that the charge against Imran for abetment by conspiracy to traffic in not less than 19.42g of diamorphine was made out beyond reasonable doubt.

Here, element (a) would be the act of delivery of the two bundles of heroin to Imran. Element (b) would refer to their joint intention to effect that act of delivery.

[emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In <span class="font-italic">Norasharee</span><span class="font-italic"> bin Gous v Public Prosecutor and another appeal and another matter</span> [2017] 1 SLR 830 (“<span class="font-italic">Norasharee</span>”), the Court of Appeal gave guidance where a conviction was sought solely on the basis of a co-accused’s confession. <span class="font-italic">Norasharee</span> was decided prior to the passing of the Criminal Justice Reform Act 2018 (No 19 of 2018) (“CJRA”), which added subsections (<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) to s 258(5) of the CPC, as well as new subsections 258(5A) and 258(5B). In <span class="font-italic">Norasharee</span>, the question of Norasharee’s conviction turned on evidence given by his co-accused, Yazid, who claimed that he had been instructed by Norasharee to traffic in drugs (see <span class="font-italic">Norasharee</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [4]). Norasharee, on the other hand, claimed that Yazid was trying to frame him as he possessed a personal vendetta against him due to a long-term gang rivalry. As the Court of Appeal noted, the case against Norasharee rested almost entirely on Yazid’s statement (see <span class="font-italic">Norasharee</span> at [53]). In deciding that Norasharee’s guilt had indeed been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the court stated at [54] that a conviction based solely on a co-accused’s confession could be sustained “provided that the evidence emanating from [the co-accused’s] confession satisfied the court beyond reasonable doubt of [the accused’s] guilt”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In the present case, Pragas’s conviction was not based solely on Imran’s confession. However, because of the importance of Imran’s statements to Pragas’s conviction, I was mindful of the guidance in <span class="font-italic">Norash</span><span class="font-italic">aree</span> that the court should consider, in deciding how much weight to accord to a co-accused’s confession, the state of mind and any incentive that such a co-accused might have in giving evidence against the accused (see <span class="font-italic">Norasharee</span> at [59]). This is even more so in the light of the new s 258(5A). While Parliament did not discuss the scope of s 258(5A) when the new subsection was introduced, the court has nevertheless long possessed a common law discretion to exclude evidence that would otherwise be admissible where its prejudicial effect exceeds its probative value (see <span class="font-italic">Muhammad bin Kadar and another v Public Prosecutor</span> [2011] 3 SLR 1205 (“<span class="font-italic">Kadar</span>”) at [51]–[53]). This is because the very reliability of the evidence sought to be admitted is questionable where the evidence’s prejudicial effect exceeds the probative value (<span class="font-italic">see</span> <span class="font-italic">Kadar </span>at [55]). The inclusion of s 258(5A), in my view, affirms the application of the court’s discretion. In particular, <span class="font-italic">Norash</span><span class="font-italic">aree</span>’s guidance (at [59]) to take into consideration the state of mind and the incentive that said co-accused might have in giving evidence against the accused is still instructive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I was satisfied that ss 258(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CPC applied. Imran, Pragas and Tamil were, as determined by s 258(5B), charged with the same offence as mandated by s 258(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). Section 258(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) also applied in respect of the act of delivery of the heroin because proving that Imran had received two pounds of heroin from Pragas and Imran on 8 February 2017 was a necessary step in proving that Pragas had indeed delivered the same two pounds of heroin. At the same time, there was no reason to exclude it under s 258(5A) of the CPC. When assessing the potential prejudicial effect and probative value of a piece of evidence, the court must consider factors such as the presence of procedural irregularities and the conditions under which one’s evidence had been obtained, such as whether the accused had given statements while under the powerful effects of drugs: <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> at [53] and [55]. No such factors were present. Further, in each case where reliance was placed on Imran’s statement, it was not the sole piece of evidence, as had been the case in <span class="font-italic">Norash</span><span class="font-italic">aree</span>. There were other pieces of evidence, as detailed in the relevant sections below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The criminal act element</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In convicting Imran for abetment by conspiracy, I made a finding of fact that two bundles of heroin were delivered to him (at [4141] above). The act of delivery is supported not only by Imran’s statement but also his oral testimony and the context of what transpired.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Turning to the charge against Pragas, I found that the criminal act element, being the delivery of the two bundles of heroin to Imran, was made out on the basis of this same factual finding. I did not accept Pragas’s account that the bag contained only contraband cigarettes. None of the surrounding evidence supported Pragas’s narrative – only eight packets of contraband Marlboro Red cigarettes were found following a search of the Unit that lasted for more than three hours.

The narrative maintained after the third statement, however, was too starkly different to be explained by translation inaccuracy. Pragas also contended that Sgt Nasrulhaq failed to record what he told him, and instead concocted the evidence.

In the present case, the presumption under s 18(1) is not necessary, because it has been proved that the white plastic bag with two bundles of heroin was in Pragas’s possession and delivered by Pragas to Imran. The issue relates to Pragas’s knowledge, or wilful blindness, of what he handed over. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Adili</span> noted at [45] that the term “wilful blindness” has been used in two distinct senses. First, when “the accused person’s suspicion and deliberate refusal to inquire are treated as evidence which, together with all the other relevant evidence, might sustain a factual finding or inference that the accused person had actual knowledge”. Second, the term “wilful blindness” has also been used to “describe a mental state which falls short of actual knowledge, but nevertheless is held to satisfy the <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> of knowledge because it is the legal equivalent of actual knowledge. Having established the differing ways in which wilful blindness had been used in the past, the court affirmed that wilful blindness, in its true sense, referred to a mental state falling short of actual knowledge (see <span class="font-italic">Adili</span> at [50]). Where the circumstances are such that “a person in the accused’s shoes ought to make further inquiries” but failed to do so, he would be considered to be wilfully blind. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In this case, which was heard prior to the release of the judgment in <span class="font-italic">Adili</span>, the Prosecution took the view, reflected in their closing submissions, that wilful blindness was used in the first sense, relying on <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam v Public Prosecutor</span> [2011] 4 SLR 1156 (“<span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span>”).

</div> On the facts of this case, and in view of the Prosecution’s stance, I did not make an inferential finding that Pragas in fact knew that the parcel contained heroin. I was of the view, beyond reasonable doubt, that Pragas was wilfully blind, in the second sense adopted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Adili</span>, to the fact that the white plastic bag he delivered contained two bundles of heroin. My reasons for this finding follow.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Adili</span> set out, at [51] and [83], the elements of wilful blindness, which are the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The accused must have had a clear, grounded and targeted suspicion of the fact to which he is said to have been wilfully blind;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) There must have been reasonable means of inquiry available to the accused, which, if taken, would have led him to discovery of the truth; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The accused must have deliberately refused to pursue the reasonable means of inquiry available so as to avoid such negative legal consequences as might arise in connection with his knowing that fact.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In setting out these elements, the Court of Appeal stated at [52] that the concept of wilful blindness must be considered in the context of the accused person’s knowledge of a specific fact, whether that be knowledge as to the existence within his possession, custody or control, of the thing later found to be a drug, or knowledge of the nature of the drug. In particular, the second element might vary if the fact in question were knowledge of the nature of the drug. I deal with this in the context of the second element in the discussion below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Coming to the first element, the facts were such that Pragas would have had a clear, grounded and targeted suspicion of what he was to deliver. Pragas had confirmed at trial that he was paid RM500 for three previous deliveries of contraband cigarettes.

</div> This would be considered a gross overpayment for help with contraband cigarettes, even by the numbers that Tamil provided. At trial, Tamil claimed that he purchased his contraband cigarettes for approximately $50 per carton, and sold them to Imran at $70 per carton.

</div> This meant that Tamil’s profit would be $20 per carton of cigarettes, which amounts to approximately RM60. The payment of RM500 to Pragas for his three deliveries of two cartons each would wholly outstrip the profit for the same deliveries, which would amount to RM360. The surreptitious and elaborate system of delivery was wholly out of keeping with the delivery of contraband cigarettes, and the weight of the drugs in his backpack was not that of two cartons of cigarettes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In this context, and as mentioned above, the present case was heard prior to the release of the judgment in <span class="font-italic">Adili</span>, where the Court of Appeal stated that “it must be put to him that he had<span class="font-italic"> in fact </span>suspected the truth<span class="font-italic"> of the particular material fact </span>at <span class="font-italic">the material time</span>” (<span class="font-italic">Adili </span>at [90], emphasis in original).

</div> when he alighted after parking in the motorcycle lot at Block 518A in Jurong; before and while going up the four flights of stairs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In this regard, the facts are quite different from <span class="font-italic">Adili</span>, where the drugs were hidden in the inner lining of a suitcase. In <span class="font-italic">Adili</span>, the Court of Appeal explained at [62] that when dealing (as this case is) with the element of knowledge, rather than possession, “it would generally not be sufficient for the accused person simply to say that he did not know what he was carrying, or worse, that he had been <span class="font-italic">indifferent</span> to what he was carrying”. This was because, by this stage of the inquiry, the accused person has already been found to have been in possession of the thing that turns out to be a drug. Where his suspicions are sufficiently aroused but he nonetheless deliberately refused to check, the Court of Appeal formed a provisional view that such a person would likely to be found to be wilfully blind to the nature of the drug. The logic and good sense in this provisional view is illustrated by the facts of this case. Such an approach is also consistent with earlier Court of Appeal authority, <span class="font-italic">Tan Kiam Peng v Public Prosecutor</span> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 1, which used wilful blindness in the second sense, the approach adopted in <span class="font-italic">Adili</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> At [129], the Court of Appeal there stated as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Nevertheless, one obvious situation is where the accused takes no steps whatsoever to investigate his or her suspicions. The court would naturally find that there was wilful blindness in such a situation. <span class="font-weight-bold">Where, for example, an accused is given a wrapped package and is told that it contains counterfeit currency when it actually contains controlled drugs, we would have thought that, absent unusual circumstances, the accused should at least ask to </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">actually view</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> what is in the package.</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>[emphasis in italics in original; emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Similarly, in this case, Pragas knew the parcel was put in his backpack and chose not to check despite the many signs that alerted him to the nature of its contents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Third, I find that Pragas deliberately refused to pursue the above-mentioned reasonable means of inquiry. The weight of two pounds of heroin and two cartons of cigarettes are totally different. This would have been obvious to him each time he handled the backpack, either in his hands or on his back as he walked up the staircase towards the Unit. Further, as mentioned at [38], the white plastic bag D1, as shown at trial via photograph P53 that was adduced by Home Team Specialist Toh Sin Ee, is a very thin white plastic bag.

</div>
</div> C2A and C2B would have been obvious from an exterior view of the package. His taking no steps to investigate or even to look closely at the bag before he handed it over – all the while in pursuance of a plan to deliver cigarettes - was plainly not out of indolence, negligence or embarrassment but a deliberate desire to avoid legal liability (see <span class="font-italic">Adili</span> at [94]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I should mention, for clarity, that the Prosecution concurrently relied on s 18(2) of the MDA, on the basis that the facts were sufficient to establish wilful blindness, and the presumption of actual knowledge under s 18(2) could not be rebutted.  Again, these arguments were made prior to the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Adili</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> where the Court of Appeal, at [68]–[69], was of the view that there may be difficulties with this approach. In the present case, in view of my finding that wilful blindness was proved beyond a reasonable doubt, it followed that the aid of a presumption was not necessary. I therefore do not deal with this presumption in these grounds of decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 As for common intention, this may be inferred from the accused persons’ conduct and circumstances (see <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay</span> at [97]). In the Indian Privy Council decision of <span class="font-italic">Mahbub Shah v Emperor</span> AIR (32) 1945 PC 118, Sir Madhavan Nair, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, stated as follows (at 120):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… common intention within the meaning of the section implies a pre-arranged plan, and to convict the accused of an offence applying the section it should be proved that the criminal act was done in concert pursuant to the pre-arranged plan. As has been often observed, it is difficult if not impossible to procure direct evidence to prove the intention of an individual; in most cases it has to be inferred from his act or conduct or other relevant circumstances of the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In the present case, I inferred from the manner in which the delivery took place that there was a plan for one. Pragas and Tamil effected a coordinated system where Tamil would first seek out Imran and ascertain payment. Pragas would thereafter be summoned to deliver the package. I found it incredible that the persons involved would go to such lengths to concoct an elaborate two-man delivery system simply to deliver two cartons of contraband cigarettes. Imran’s statements were, in addition, clear as to the purpose of their visit, which had been arranged in advance with Imran by Tamil and had been preceded by other similar deliveries. I was therefore satisfied that the delivery to Imran was pursuant to the common intention of Pragas and Tamil to jointly deliver the two bundles of heroin to Imran. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In this context, so long as the pre-arranged plan is clear, I am of the view that common intention may encompass actual knowledge on the part of Tamil and wilful blindness on the part of Pragas. In <span class="font-italic">Adili</span>, at [47]-[49] and [93], the Court of Appeal explained that wilful blindness is treated as the legal equivalent of actual knowledge because it is a highly culpable state of ignorance, where an accused person’s careful skirting of actual knowledge undermines the administration of justice. At [49], Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon quoted Prof Glanville Williams, <span class="font-italic">Criminal Law: The General Part</span> (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1961) at p. 159: “He suspected the fact; he realised its probability; but he refrained from obtaining the final confirmation because he wanted in the event to be able to deny knowledge. This, and this alone, is wilful blindness. It requires in effect a finding that the defendant intended to cheat the administration of justice.” The same rationale compels the conclusion that common intention may be premised on the actual knowledge of one accomplice and the wilful blindness of another. An analogy of sorts may be drawn with the scenario explained in <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay</span> at [168](d). In this scenario, A, B and C have a common intention to rob D and if necessary, to kill him to facilitate the robbery. If D is then killed by A in the course of the robbery, B and C would be constructively liable. This scenario echoes <span class="font-italic">Barendra</span><span class="font-italic"> Kumar Ghosh v Emperor </span>AIR 1925 PC 1, cited in the same judgment at [103], where the Privy Council stated: “even if [BKG] did nothing as he stood outside the door, it is to be remembered that in crimes as in other things ‘they also serve who only stand and wait’.” The reason, as elucidated by Khundkar J in <span class="font-italic">Ibra Akandar</span><span class="font-italic"> v Emperor </span>AIR 1944 Cal 339<span class="font-italic">,</span> is that despite what was described by the learned judge as a “fractional act” on the part of [BKG], the common intention of [BKG] and his accomplices was a wide one, embracing both robbery and murder (see <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay</span>, at [104]). Where an accomplice is wilfully blind, he is affixed with the very knowledge which he has refused to investigate. It follows, then, that his shared intention must be sufficiently wide to include the actual knowledge that the law imputes to him. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The participation element</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In this case, the act of participation was plain even on the defence’s case. On Pragas’s evidence, Tamil and Pragas entered Singapore together and met with a contact to obtain a package which he retained in his backpack and brought to the venue. Pursuant to a call from Tamil received through a mobile telephone on loan from Tamil, Pragas received his instructions from Tamil to walk up the stairs to the fourth storey to make delivery. Delivery was duly made when Pragas handed over the white plastic bag. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 For completeness, I mention Pragas’s evidence that he did not deal directly with Imran. In his seventh statement (fourth investigative statement) recorded on 13th February 2017 at about 10.23am, Pragas stated that he did not know Imran’s name or number, and that he had never spoken to Imran. Tamil would communicate with Imran, and would always accompany Pragas when he made deliveries. In court, Pragas maintained that he was not involved in the communications between Tamil and Imran.

In this case, such primary liability for trafficking is made out. Two elements must be established to make out an offence under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA: <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Ranjit Singh Gill Menjeet Singh</span> <span class="font-italic">and another </span>[2017] 3 SLR 66 at [34].

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 These submissions were not apposite, for two reasons. First, s 18 was not a live issue because the presumptions were not necessary to my analysis. As is clear from the above, wilful blindness was evident on the facts of Pragas’s case and that was sufficient. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Nevertheless, as the s 18(2) MDA presumption formed part of the Prosecution arguments against Pragas, I explain further the second reason, which is that the issue dealt with in <span class="font-italic">Alma </span>does not arise in the context of the MDA. <span class="font-italic">Alma </span>struck down as unconstitutional the <span class="font-italic">double</span> presumptions of “trafficking” and “possession and knowledge” in the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 (No 234 of 1952) (M’sia). But in Singapore, such presumptions cannot be invoked together. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Zainal bin Hamad v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</span> [2018] 2 SLR 1119 (“<span class="font-italic">Zainal</span>”) has determinatively pronounced on the interaction between the presumptions under s 17 of the MDA, the local provision that relates to trafficking, and s 18, the local provision that relates to possession and knowledge. To summarise, where the Prosecution seeks to rely on the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the MDA, it must prove the facts of both possession and knowledge. Conversely, where the Prosecution intends to rely on either or both of the presumptions under s 18 of the MDA, it must prove the fact of trafficking, and where trafficking is proved, both the presumptions in ss 18(1) and (2) may be used together (see <span class="font-italic">Zainal</span> at [46] and [52]). In the present case, arising from the circumstances of Pragas’s delivery, the Prosecution was of the view that trafficking and possession were proved, and sought to rely only on the presumption in s 18(2) of the MDA, coupled with their submissions on wilful blindness.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 I was thus of the opinion that counsel for Pragas’s arguments on <span class="font-italic">Alma</span> were of little merit.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on charge against Pragas</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Hence, I found that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt against Pragas.

They were there to deliver cigarettes, and cigarettes were indeed what they delivered on 8 February 2017.

Tamil sought to argue that Imran was an unreliable witness, and that his testimony as to his receipt of heroin from Pragas was a lie. He raised the following key points: first, that Imran had changed his evidence regarding the provenance of certain drugs that were seized; second, that Imran had initially claimed that he had repacked drugs for sale to one “Apai” before later claiming that he was actually working for Tamil to deliver drugs to “55”; and finally, that Imran possessed strong reasons to lie to the CNB officers and the court due to his perception that he would be given a lighter sentence if he were to provide the CNB with fabricated statements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In contrast to Pragas, Imran possessed an incentive to minimise his role in his dealings with Tamil, in view of his attempt to explain that he only ordered one pound of heroin, and the existence of “Apai” and “55” In this context, I earlier rejected these claims that he had been working for Tamil: see above at [48]. Nevertheless, these spurious claims did not detract from the admission that heroin was delivered. Imran’s evidence on the delivery remained consistent in court. This heroin delivery was supported by the $6,700 found on Tamil and the absence of external evidence with regard to the two cartons of contraband cigarettes that were purportedly delivered, as highlighted above at [40] and [63].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The common intention element</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 On the issue of common intention, Imran’s statements and evidence in court were clear that the intention of Tamil was to deliver heroin. My findings above, at [81], in the context of the common intention of Pragas and Tamil are also relevant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In addition, as far as the charge against Tamil was concerned, while Tamil sought to argue that his intention was to deliver cigarettes, his own account of events was inconsistent. Tamil did not challenge the voluntariness of his six statements although at trial he sought to disown them at various junctures by contending that he had been stressed, shocked, confused, afraid or did not want to implicate others.

Tamil claimed that he was only able to smuggle two cartons of cigarettes in his bag at a time, and that he required Pragas’s assistance to smuggle an additional two cartons. He also stated that he had previously instructed Imran to call Pragas directly to arrange for the delivery of cigarettes when he had personal matters to attend to. On 7 February 2017, Imran had offered to lend a sum of $6,700 to $6,800 to Tamil for the latter to purchase cigarette cartons. That same night, Pragas had called Tamil to inform him that he was delivering two cartons of cigarettes to Imran the next morning. On 8 February 2017, Tamil had met Imran at his lift lobby on the fourth storey, where he received a stack of money from Imran that was wrapped in a rubber band. When Tamil was about to leave, Pragas appeared. Tamil parted ways with Imran then, and did not notice what Pragas and Imran were doing. Afterwards, when Tamil was walking to his motorcycle, he noticed that Pragas was walking behind him.

On average, Tamil would purchase 100 cartons of cigarettes at a time, which would cost him RM15,000. Tamil stated that that was the reason he needed to borrow so much money from Imran. He claimed that he would borrow a sum of $4,000 to $7,000 from Imran once every two weeks to buy his stock of cigarettes. Tamil said that he did not have the handphone number of “Prakash” stored in any of his handphones that were seized from him. He also stressed that both Imran and Pragas did not know about the existence of “Prakash”.

Tamil, in his first two statements on 8 February 2017, initially denied that he was involved in delivering any goods to Imran on 8 February 2017 and claimed ignorance of Pragas’s purpose in meeting Imran. From his third statement on 9 February 2017, he changed his account of events, stating that he had introduced Pragas and Imran to each other in order for Pragas to deliver cigarettes to Imran; he claimed that Pragas had informed him on 7 February 2017 that he would be delivering cigarettes to Imran on 8 February 2017. Tamil nevertheless insisted that he was not involved in any delivery of goods to Imran on 8 February 2017. Subsequently, at trial, Tamil changed his evidence yet again to align himself with Pragas. When he was brought through his statements by his counsel, he requested to make amendments to all six of them, in order to reflect that he and Pragas had, together, handed two cartons of cigarettes to Imran.

</div> This contention was raised for the first time during Tamil’s examination-in-chief at trial, and his counsel conceded at closing arguments that the fresh allegation was not put to Imran, who testified first. Further, on Tamil’s own evidence, past transactions ranged from one to four cartons per delivery. The 400 cartons were a wholly anomalous amount that was necessitated by the mathematics of dividing $6,700 by the price of a carton of cigarettes.

In further contradiction of Tamil’s account, the officers found the empty white plastic bag, consistent with Imran’s evidence that he put the contents of the white bag into C2, the black plastic bag, in order to evade detection from his parents (because the storeroom was a common use area).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 I was therefore satisfied that the common intention of Tamil and Pragas were clearly that of delivery of two bundles of heroin.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Participation element</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Tamil’s evidence alluded to his role as the person who planned the delivery with Imran, albeit of cigarettes which I did not accept.

This provision reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where one of 2 or more persons with the <span class="font-italic">knowledge and consent</span> of the rest has any controlled drug in his possession, it shall be deemed to be in the possession of each and all of them.

In <span class="font-italic">Ridzuan</span>, the court found that the accused had been instrumental in putting his co-accused in actual physical possession of the drugs; he had made the necessary arrangements for his co-accused to receive the drugs from their supplier (see [65] of <span class="font-italic">Ridzuan</span>). The element of consent, as well as knowledge, was thus readily satisfied. Similarly here, Tamil had orchestrated the sale of heroin to Imran and recruited Pragas to assist him. As Pragas had the heroin in his possession with the knowledge and consent of Tamil, Tamil would also be deemed to be in possession of the heroin. Tamil’s participation element would in that case be characterised as a delivery to Imran made jointly by Pragas and himself.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Alternative analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 I also considered the alternative analysis for Tamil’s primary liability under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA.

The second element would be knowledge of the nature of the drug. From my findings as to Tamil’s role and the chain of events which culminated in Tamil’s receipt of $6,700, it is clear that Tamil possessed actual knowledge of the drugs for which he coordinated the delivery. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on charge against Tamil</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 I found that Tamil’s charge was proved beyond a reasonable doubt and convicted him. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sentence for Imran, Pragas and Tamil</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Under s 33B(1) of the MDA, an alternative sentencing regime is available where the requirements under s 33B(2) are satisfied.
