of Appeal — Civil Appeals No 194 of 2018 and 105 of 2019<br/>Steven Chong JA and Belinda Ang Saw Ean J<br/>9 September 2019, 12 September 2019 </div><div class="Judg-Date-Reserved text-left">27 November 2019</div><div class="Judg-Author text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Steven Chong JA (delivering the grounds of decision of the court):</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">1 The pursuit of foreign proceedings can, in limited circumstances, be restrained by different <span class="font-italic">types </span>of injunctive relief. However, not all injunctions which have the <span class="font-italic">effect</span> of restraining the pursuit of or participation in foreign proceedings can be classified as anti-suit injunctions. The difference in classification is not just a matter of form but a distinction which carries crucial significance. A proper classification of the precise nature of the injunction bears on the correct appreciation of the issues before the court which in turn impacts on the correct application of the governing legal principles. The converse is equally true.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In the court below, the converse in fact occurred. The High Court Judge (“the Judge”), was persuaded by the respondents to examine the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte</span> interim injunctions on the basis that they were in substance anti-suit injunctions to restrain the commencement and continuation of insolvency proceedings (“the <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> proceedings”) purportedly commenced on behalf of the appellants, all Singapore incorporated companies, before the insolvency court in Mexico. However, in truth, the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte </span>interim injunctions were not obtained to restrain the <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> proceedings <span class="font-italic">per se</span> but to enforce a negative covenant in the appellants’ constitutions. Each of the appellants’ constitutions expressly provided that its directors were not to carry into effect any petition to initiate <span class="font-italic">concurso </span>proceedings unless this was <span class="font-italic">approved</span> by an independent director. It was common ground that no such approval was procured. In fact, the independent director was not even notified of the resolution prior to the commencement of the <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> proceedings. Under these circumstances, the injunctions sought by the appellants were to restrain the respondents from purporting to represent them in the <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> proceedings in light of the breach of this negative covenant. As such, comity considerations which typically take centre stage in deciding whether to grant an anti-suit injunction were strictly not engaged. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Once the precise nature of the relief was properly identified, it became self-evident that the crucial issue was whether the appellants had a good arguable case against the respondents as regards the breach of the negative covenant. In that respect, the importance of Singapore law to determine the capacity of and issues relating to the internal governance of the appellants, as Singapore incorporated companies, to commence the <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> proceedings would have been apparent for the purposes of determining whether service outside jurisdiction should have been granted and in particular, whether Singapore was clearly the most appropriate forum to hear the dispute. As the Judge did not attach sufficient weight to the importance of Singapore law in determining the key issue in the action and Singapore as the appellants’ place of incorporation, the Judge had misdirected herself. She found that the appellants’ reliance on their being Singapore incorporated companies and the application of Singapore law for the purposes of Originating Summons No 126 of 2018 (“OS 126”) were “contrived”, “an afterthought” and “tactical” when in fact, it was as a matter of law and right.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 These appeals concerned the Judge’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Oro Negro Drilling Pte Ltd and others v Integradora de Servicios Petroleros Oro Negro, SAPI de CV and others </span>[2019] SGHC 35 (“the GD”) to set aside: (a) an order granting the appellants leave to serve OS 126 out of Singapore (“the Overseas Service Order”); and (b) <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> interim injunctions granted in the appellants’ favour against the first to third respondents (“the Interim<span class="font-italic"> </span>Injunctions”). After hearing the parties on 9 September 2019, we allowed Civil Appeals No 194 of 2018 and 105 of 2019 (“the appeals”) on 12 September 2019 with brief oral grounds. We now elaborate on the grounds for our decision. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The appellants were a group of Singapore-incorporated companies which comprised of: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Oro Negro Drilling Pte Ltd (“Oro Negro”)</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Oro Negro Primus Pte Ltd (“Primus”)</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Oro Negro Laurus Pte Ltd (“Laurus”)</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) Oro Negro Fortius Pte Ltd (“Fortius”)</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) Oro Negro Decus Pte Ltd (“Decus”)</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(f) Oro Negro Impetus Pte Ltd (“Impetus”)</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Oro Negro was the holding company and sole shareholder of all the other appellants. It was in turn solely owned by the first respondent, Integradora de Servicios Petroleros Oro Negro, SAPI de CV (“Integradora”). Oro Negro had no business activities of its own and had no employees. It paid its taxes in Mexico and its sole purpose was to serve as a holding company for the second to sixth appellants, and to receive funds from those companies.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In our view, the central question on this issue was whether the former directors’ acceptance of their appointments as the appellants’ directors was sufficient to cause them to be bound by the appellants’ constitutional provisions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Both parties agreed that Singapore law was the applicable law for the resolution of this issue. In any case, it was well-established that issues relating to the duties owed by an officer to a company was to be determined by the law of the company’s place of incorporation, or the <span class="font-italic">le</span><span class="font-italic">x incorporationis</span> (<span class="font-italic">Base Metal Trading Ltd v Shamurin </span>[2005] 1 WLR 1157 (“<span class="font-italic">Base Metal</span>”) <span class="font-italic">per </span>Tuckey LJ at [56], <span class="font-italic">per</span> Arden LJ at [69]; <span class="font-italic">Focus Energy Ltd v Aye Aye Soe </span>[2009] 1 SLR(R) 1086 (“<span class="font-italic">Focus Energy</span>”) at [31]–[33]; Adrian Briggs, <span class="font-italic">Private International Law in English Courts </span>(Oxford University Press, 1st Ed, 2014) at para 10.22). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 We were satisfied that the appellants had a good arguable case that the former directors were bound to observe the appellants’ constitutions. In our view, the former directors’ consent to being appointed as the appellants’ directors on the facts of this case, gave rise to an agreement that they would serve the appellants based on the terms of their constitutions.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 As Lord Esher MR observed in <span class="font-italic">Swabey v Port Darwin Gold Mining Co</span> (1889) 1 Megone 385 (“<span class="font-italic">Swabey</span>”) at 387, “[t]he articles [of a company] do not themselves form a contract, but from them you get the terms upon which the directors are serving”. That case involved a dispute between a director and his company over the director’s fees. The plaintiff director had been appointed as a director of the defendant company at a time when the company’s articles contained a provision which provided that its directors were to be paid a particular annual sum. After the plaintiff’s appointment, however, a special resolution was passed to amend that provision in such a way as to reduce its directors’ fees. The special resolution also purported to apply this amendment retroactively from a date prior to the plaintiff’s appointment. The plaintiff resigned his directorship and sued for three months’ worth of his outstanding fees based on the pre-amendment rate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The claim was dismissed at first instance but was allowed on appeal. The English Court of Appeal’s leading judgment was delivered by Lord Halsbury LC, who held that although the articles <span class="font-italic">per se</span> did not constitute a contract between the company and the plaintiff director, a person who accepts an appointment as a director with notice of the company’s articles would be taken to have entered into a contract with the company to serve on the terms of its articles (at 386). Lord Halsbury LC further held that a director in this position would also be taken to have agreed that it is possible for the company to alter the director’s terms of service, in which case the director would have the option to continue serving based on the new terms or resigning. Those terms, however, could only be altered prospectively, and the director in that case was therefore entitled to his fees based on the old rate up to the point the articles were altered. Lord Esher MR concurred with this analysis and delivered a short concurring judgment in which he made the observation cited above at [61]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 We noted that <span class="font-italic">Swabey</span> concerned a situation where the director was seeking to enforce his rights under the articles against the company, whereas here, it was the appellants that were seeking to enforce the articles against the former directors. In our view, the contractual effect of the company’s articles vis-à-vis its directors should work both ways. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In <span class="font-italic">Isaacs’ Case</span>, the company’s articles provided that its first director would be deemed to have agreed to subscribe to qualification shares from the company and that the shares would be allotted to him if he failed to acquire them within a month of his appointment. Sir Henry Isaacs was eventually appointed as its first director. He had signed a copy of the company’s constitution at the time of his appointment and also attended various board meetings but never acquired the requisite qualification shares. When the company was wound up, Sir Henry applied for his name to be struck off its list of contributories. His application was refused and the court held that Sir Henry was liable to be placed on the list of contributories as he was bound by the company’s articles to acquire the qualification shares. Citing Lord Esher MR’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Swabey</span>, Stirling J observed that (at 164): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… <span class="font-weight-bold">[W]here a man has accepted the office of director, and acted as such, there ought to be inferred an agreement between him and the company, on his part that he will serve the company on the terms as to qualification and otherwise contained in the articles of association</span>, and on the part of the company that he shall receive the remuneration, and all the benefits which the articles provide for directors. To use the language of the present Master of the Rolls in <span class="font-italic">Swabey v Port Darwin Gold </span><span class="font-italic">Mining Company</span>, “the articles do not themselves form a contract, but from them you get the terms upon which the directors are serving. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Stirling J’s decision was upheld on appeal and was subsequently cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">In re T N Farrer Ltd </span>[1937] 1 Ch 352 (at 358) and <span class="font-italic">Molineaux v </span><span class="font-italic">The London, Birmingham and Manchester Insurance Company, Limited</span> [1902] 2 KB 589 (at 596).   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 We now turn to this court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Chaly Chee</span>. That case concerned the question of whether provisions in a company’s constitution had been incorporated into a contract of appointment between a company and its former auditors, who we shall refer to as D&amp;T. D&amp;T’s appointment originated from a relatively short letter of offer from the company with no written terms of appointment. The letter, however, referred to and enclosed, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the company’s memorandum and articles of association (at [9]). D&amp;T accepted the appointment and eventually served as the company’s auditors during a period in which a rogue trader’s activities caused the company to suffer significant losses. The company was subsequently placed in liquidation and the liquidators sued D&amp;T for negligence. D&amp;T eventually took out a motion in the Singapore court seeking a determination that it was entitled to costs on an indemnity basis if the liquidator was unsuccessful in the negligence claim against it. It based this application on a provision in the company’s articles which it alleged had been incorporated into its contract of appointment (at [6]). The High Court found that the company’s articles had not been incorporated into D&amp;T’s contract of appointment. However, that decision was reversed on appeal and in doing so, this court held that the question of whether the provisions in a company’s articles had been incorporated into a contract of appointment was ultimately to be inferred from all the circumstances (at [24]). On this basis, this court observed that D&amp;T could only have been appointed on the footing of the company’s articles since there were no written terms of appointment other than what was set out in the company’s articles, a copy of which was enclosed with the company’s letter of offer (at [22]). Additionally, it also observed that the company’s articles did provide for the appointment and duties of, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, directors and auditors (at [24]). Thus, this brought the case within the principle laid down by Warrington LJ in <span class="font-italic">In re City Equitable Fire Insurance Company Limited </span>[1925] Ch 407 at 521 (cited in <span class="font-italic">Chaly Chee</span> at [16]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Where] auditors are engaged without any special terms of engagement … then if the articles contain provisions relating to the performance by them of their duties and to the obligations imposed upon them by the acceptance of the office, I think it is quite plain that the articles must be taken to express the terms upon which the auditors accept their position. Of course, if the terms of their employment are expressed in a separate document, then that document must be taken to define the conditions of their engagement, and it would not be proper to assume any implied terms either from the provisions of the articles or elsewhere.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 For completeness, we should add that this court in <span class="font-italic">Chaly Chee</span> at [18] and [24] also observed, albeit in <span class="font-italic">obiter</span><span class="font-italic"> dicta</span>, that incorporation of the company’s articles into D&amp;T’s contract of appointment might still have been possible even if their appointment contract had contained more express terms than what was stated in D&amp;T’s letter of acceptance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In <span class="font-italic">Tengku Dato’ Ibrahim</span>, a company’s former directors sought a declaration that the company was liable to indemnify them for their costs in defending an action by a minority shareholder against them for breach of their directors’ duties. Those former directors based this application on a provision in the company’s articles which, they contended, had been incorporated into their contract of service with the company. Mohamad Ariff J found that the articles had indeed been incorporated into their contract of service even though at least one of them had a written contract with the company though that contract made no reference to the company’s articles (at [22]). In so finding, he held (at [27]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The issue is to what extent the terms of the articles of association can be imported or incorporated into this contractual relationship? The cases suggest the incorporation depends on whether the director’s appointment is done ‘on the footing of the articles’. In this connection again, a healthy dose of commercial reality will assist in understanding and formulating a rational basis for the law. I am tempted to ask: in these days of sophisticated corporate affairs and detailed company law provisions, how else can directors be appointed to the board except on ‘the footing of the articles’? It is an obvious necessary pre condition for a valid board appointment. In this sense, the view that ‘it takes very little’ to incorporate the articles into the director’s contract can be more readily and realistically understood. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 We agreed with these principles and found that on the evidence before us, there was a good arguable case that Mr Alonso and Mr Gonzalo had agreed to serve as the appellants’ directors on the footing of the appellants’ constitutions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 As this court observed in <span class="font-italic">Chaly Chee</span> (at [18]), it would be sensible for the court to infer that the parties intended to contract “on the footing of the articles” (or constitution) if there was no written or express terms of appointment. If relatively little would be required to incorporate a company’s constitution into a contract of appointment between a company and its auditor (see <span class="font-italic">Chaly Chee </span>at [22]), even less should be required where directors were concerned. This was especially so when the constitutions in question contained provisions relating to the appointment, duties, and powers of the company’s directors. In such circumstances, the only reasonable inference that the court could draw was that Mr Alonso and Mr Gonzalo must have agreed with the appellants that their terms of service were to include the appellants’ constitutions. It did not matter that there was no evidence as to whether Mr Alonso and Mr Gonzalo were familiar with the appellants’ constitutional provisions at the time of their appointment. In our view, it would be extraordinary for directors to claim that they were not familiar with constitution of a company that they have agreed to serve. All directors were expected to conduct and manage the company’s affairs in accordance with the powers granted to them by the company’s constitution (<span class="font-italic">In re John Fulton &amp; Co Ltd</span> [1931] Ch 35 at 55) and to “follow the appropriate procedures in the company’s constitution” (<span class="font-italic">Clark v Cutland</span> [2004] 1 WLR 783 <span class="font-italic">per </span>Arden LJ at [21]).    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 It also made no difference that Art 115A was inserted after the former directors were appointed since directors are taken to agree to abide by the company’s constitution as it stood from time to time. As Lord Halsbury LC held in <span class="font-italic">Swabey</span>, a director who served on the footing of the company’s articles has “as one of the stipulations of [his] contract, that it shall be possible for [the company] to alter the terms upon which he is to serve, in which case he would have the option of continuing to serve” (at 386). Thus, the fact that Mr Alonso and Mr Gonzalo had continued serving as the appellants’ directors <span class="font-italic">after</span> Art 115A was inserted into the appellants’ constitutions meant that they must be taken to have agreed to serve on the terms of the amended constitutions. Both of them clearly knew about the insertion of Art 115A. Mr Alonso had signed all but one of the shareholder’s special resolutions on behalf of Integradora and Oro Negro respectively which amended the appellants’ constitutions to include Art 115A.

It was clear to us that this provision was meant to safeguard the bondholders’ interests by making sure that the appellants would not cease operations and commence liquidation without the approval of an independent director nominated by the bond trustee. This was an important safeguard, given that Integradora was Oro Negro’s sole shareholder and that two of the appellants’ directors were office holders of Integradora.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 We were satisfied that there was a good arguable case that Mr Alonso and Mr Gonzalo had breached Art 115A by granting the wide-ranging POAs to Guerra without the Independent Director’s approval.

</div> We were not persuaded by either of these submissions.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 First, there was a good arguable case that the former directors directly facilitated the filing of the Oro Negro <span class="font-italic">Concurso</span> Petition without the Independent Director’s approval. Article 115A provided that the appellants’ directors shall not “carry into effect” the filing of any petition to place the appellants in <span class="font-italic">concurso</span>, unless its two requirements had been met (see above at [72]). The term “carry into effect” would, in our view, encompass situations where the acts of the directors had directly facilitated the commencement of any insolvency matter listed in Art 115A(a) to (c), which included a petition to place the appellants in <span class="font-italic">concurso</span>.

</div>
</div>
</div> In this case, the filing of the Oro Negro <span class="font-italic">Concurso </span>Petition was achieved through the Guerra POAs granted by the former directors. In our view, the former directors could not have granted powers to Guerra which they themselves could not have validly exercised. In fact, this would be consistent with Art 116(B) which provided that “[d]irectors may from time to time … by power of attorney under the Seal appoint any company, firm or person or any fluctuating body of persons whether nominated directly or indirectly by the Directors to be the attorney or attorneys of the Company for such purposes and with such powers, authorities and discretions <span class="font-weight-bold">(</span><span class="font-italic">not exceeding those vested in or exercisable by the Directors under these Articles</span>)” [emphasis added].

</div> To hold otherwise would mean that the former directors could essentially bypass the Art 115A safeguards by granting wide powers of attorney to non-directors. This was simply untenable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In any case, we were also of the view that there was a good arguable case that the Guerra POAs had been granted by the former directors with the intention of bypassing the safeguards in Art 115A. As mentioned above, Guerra was granted more powers than that available to the former directors at the material time despite the former directors’ knowledge of Art 115A’s requirements. Further, the Guerra POAs were granted shortly after negotiations between Integradora and the <span class="font-italic">ad hoc </span>group<span class="font-italic"> </span>broke down.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The practical effect of the Guerra POAs was to enable IAG to pre-empt any attempt by NT to obtain total control of the Oro Negro Group after the Perforadora <span class="font-italic">Concurso</span> Petition was filed. IAG would have known that NT was likely to declare an event of default under the Bond Agreement and to thereafter replace the former directors with their own board appointees. The granting of the POAs would thus have enabled IAG to retain some control of or influence over the appellants’ affairs through Guerra. The fact that Mr Alonso was in fact involved with the preparation of the Oro Negro<span class="font-italic"> Concurso</span> Petition before it was filed by Guerra supported such an inference (see above at [27]). Mr Alonso’s participation in the preparation of the Oro Negro <span class="font-italic">Concurso </span>Petition <span class="font-italic">despite</span> his knowledge that it was going to be filed without the Independent Director’s approval indicated that that was his intention all along. These facts, when taken together, provided a reasonable basis for this court to infer that the Guerra POAs were granted in order to bypass the requirements of Art 115A. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 We were also not persuaded by IAG’s submission that Mr Alonso and Mr Gonzalo were entitled to bypass Art 115A because the Independent Director would have voted in a capricious manner anyway on account of a conflict of interest. The fact remained that the Independent Director had to approve of any <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> petition filed on the appellants’ behalf. This was a <span class="font-italic">mandatory</span> requirement under Art 115A. We were not aware of any provision in the appellants’ constitution or any legal principle that entitled the former directors to bypass mandatory requirements in the companies’ constitutions even in such circumstances. We also noted that Mr Alonso did not state on affidavit that the former directors acted on this consideration when they granted the Guerra POAs. Instead, this point only emerged in their submissions.

</div> Finally, and in any case, IAG’s contention that the Independent Director would have acted in a capricious manner was speculative at best.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The appellants had a good arguable case against Integradora for inducing breach of contract and unlawful means conspiracy, but not for breaching Art 115A </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 We turn now to Integradora. We agreed with the Judge and IAG that Art 115A was, strictly speaking, a provision that only prohibited the appellants’ directors from carrying into effect any petition to place the appellants in <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> without the Independent Director’s approval. As such, it did not apply to prohibit Integradora, as a shareholder of Oro Negro, from voting in favour of the September 2017 Resolutions authorising the filing of the Oro Negro <span class="font-italic">Concurso</span> Petition. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 However, we were of the view that the appellants had raised good arguable cases against Integradora for unlawful means conspiracy and for inducing the breach of Art 115A. Indeed, IAG did not contend that the appellants had no good arguable case against Integradora for these two causes of action. As we mentioned above at [55], their only contention in this regard was that Singapore was <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span>. In any case, we were satisfied that the evidence before us disclosed a good arguable case against Integradora for unlawful means conspiracy against the appellants and for inducing a breach of the appellants’ constitutions. In this regard, it was relevant to note that all but one of the September 2017 resolutions to appoint Guerra to file <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> proceedings on the appellants’ behalf was signed by Mr Alonso on Integradora’s behalf just nine days before the filing of the Oro Negro <span class="font-italic">Concurso</span> Petition (see above at [24]–[25]).

Although counsel for IAG accepted at the hearing before us that the main issue in OS 126 was governed by Singapore law, he contended that Singapore was nevertheless <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span> given the nature and extent of the insolvency proceedings in Mexico. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The applicable legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The applicable legal principles for determining whether Singapore was the more appropriate forum for the purposes of service out were well-established, and could be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The question whether Singapore was the more appropriate forum for the action only arises for determination if the court was first satisfied that there was at least another available forum (Richard Fentiman, <span class="font-italic">International Commercial Litigation</span> (Oxford University Press, 1st Ed, 2010) (“<span class="font-italic">Fentiman</span>”) at para 12.63). As this court observed in <span class="font-italic">Siemens AG v Holdrich Investment Ltd </span>[2010] 3 SLR 1007 (“<span class="font-italic">Siemens</span><span class="font-italic"> AG</span>”) at [4], Singapore could only be <span class="font-italic">forum </span><span class="font-italic">non conveniens</span> if there was a <span class="font-italic">more appropriate</span> forum other than Singapore. Here, the other <span class="font-italic">available</span> forum was Mexico. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The appellants (as the plaintiffs in OS 126) bore the burden of demonstrating that Singapore was, on balance, the <span class="font-italic">more </span><span class="font-italic">appropriate</span> forum to decide on the issues raised in OS 126. In this regard, it was strictly irrelevant whether Singapore was the more appropriate forum “by a hair or by a mile” (<span class="font-italic">Siemens</span><span class="font-italic"> AG </span>at [8]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The inquiry for determining whether Singapore was the more appropriate forum in the context of service out applications was the same as that undertaken at the <span class="font-italic">first</span> stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>test<span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">Zoom </span><span class="font-italic">Communications </span>at [70]). Consequently, Singapore would be the more appropriate forum if it had the most real and substantial connection with the disputes raised (<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals FZC</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Mineral Enterprises Ltd </span>[2011] 1 SLR 391 (“<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span>”) at [38]). The court would weigh the connecting factors that had the most relevant and substantial associations with the dispute rather than undertake a mechanical application of established connecting factors. It would also be primarily concerned with the <span class="font-italic">quality</span> of the connecting factors rather than the quantity of factors on each side of the scale (<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span> at [41];<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Rappo, Tania v Accent Delight International Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[2017] 2 SLR 265<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [70], <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi Anil Salgaocar v Jhaveri Darsan Jitendra </span>[2019] 2 SLR 372 (“<span class="font-italic">Lakshmi Anil Salgaocar</span>”) at [54]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) In the event that Singapore was not the more appropriate forum, it was an open question whether the second stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>test was applicable in the context of leave applications for service outside jurisdiction (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether the Singapore court can nevertheless grant leave for service out if the plaintiff can show that substantial justice cannot be done in the otherwise appropriate foreign forum). There appeared to be authorities pointing both ways (see<span class="font-italic"> Lewis v King </span>[2005] ILPr 16; <span class="font-italic">Metall und Rohstoff GmbH v Donalson Lufkin &amp; Kenrette </span>[1990] 1 QB 391 at 488 which considered the second stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> enquiry; <span class="font-italic">cf</span>, <span class="font-italic">Konamaneni and others v Rolls Royce Industrial Power (India) Ltd and others</span> [2002] 1 WLR 1269 (“<span class="font-italic">Konamaneni</span>”) at [175]–[176]; <span class="font-italic">Fentiman</span> at 12.27–12.28 which suggest that the plaintiff has no cause to complain that it would be a denial of justice to refuse permission to serve out). However, given our determination that Singapore was clearly the more appropriate forum in this case, and since this point was not argued before us, it was not necessary for us to express any views on it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Although the facts may have appeared complicated and complex, the main issue raised in OS 126 was whether, as a matter of Singapore law, the Oro Negro <span class="font-italic">C</span><span class="font-italic">oncurso </span>Petition was filed in breach of Art 115A. For choice of law purposes, this was an issue concerning the appellants’ corporate governance and internal management. Additionally, we also found it significant that the key dispute was legal in nature since the material facts were not disputed. Seen in this light, it became clear to us that Singapore was the more appropriate forum for the determination of OS 126 and that the Judge had erred in holding otherwise.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Singapore was </span>prima facie<span class="font-italic"> the</span><span class="font-italic"> more appropriate forum as OS 126 involved claims concerning the appellants’ corporate governance and internal management </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The Judge did not attach sufficient weight to the fact that Singapore was the appellants’ place of incorporation and that the Bond Agreement expressly stipulated that it should <span class="font-italic">remain</span> as such.

Additionally, Integradora had expressly agreed that the appellants were to maintain their place of incorporation in Singapore pursuant to cl 13.5(g) of the Bond Agreement (see above at [14]). Consequently, and contrary to the Judge’s holdings (GD at [122] and [126]), the fact that Singapore was the appellants’ place of incorporation was not fortuitous and the appellants’ links to Singapore were not contrived.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> IAG accepted at the hearing before us that the appellants’ actions in the Mexican proceedings were entirely reactive in nature. In our view, it was reasonable for the new directors to have attempted to put a quick end to the Mexican proceedings after gaining control of the appellants. Although OS 126 was not commenced immediately after the appellants learnt about the Oro Negro <span class="font-italic">Concurso</span> Petition, we did not think that this delay was inordinate or of such length as to render Singapore <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span>. Additionally, this delay did not result in any final determination of the substantive issues raised in OS 126 by the Mexican courts.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Governing law of the issues in OS 126 </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Finally, the fact that that the main issue in OS 126 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether the Oro Negro <span class="font-italic">Concurso</span> Petition was filed in breach of Art 115A) was governed by Singapore law pointed in favour of Singapore as the more appropriate forum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 As mentioned above at [81] the main issue in OS 126 concerned the appellants’ corporate governance and internal management. It was well established that such issues were governed by the <span class="font-italic">lex incorporationis</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see, <span class="font-italic">Dicey, Morris &amp; Collins on The Conflict of Laws </span>vol 1 (Lord Collins of Mapesbury gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 15th Ed, 2012) (“<span class="font-italic">Dicey, Morris &amp; </span><span class="font-italic">Collins</span>”)at para 30–028; <span class="font-italic">Base Metal</span><span class="font-italic"> per </span>Tuckey LJ at [56] and Arden LJ at [67]–[69]; <span class="font-italic">Konamaneni</span> at [55]; <span class="font-italic">Focus Energy</span> (at [31]–[33] and [36])). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi Anil Salgaocar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [56]–[57]), this court observed that the weight to be accorded to the governing law of a dispute would ultimately depend on the nature of the dispute (citing <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>vol 6(2)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(LexisNexis Singapore, 2016) at para 75.093 and <span class="font-italic">Dicey, Morris &amp; Collins</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 12-034)). Here, the central issue of OS 126 concerned the internal governance and management of Singapore incorporated companies, an issue uniquely governed by Singapore law. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Mexico was the place of alleged torts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The starting presumption in relation to tortious claims was that the place where the tort occurred was <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> the natural forum for determining that tortious claim, though this was only one of the factors in the overall <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens </span>analysis (<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments Ltd and another v Nicolai Baron von Uexkull</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 377 at [37]–[40]; <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span> at [106]). In this case, it was clear that the unlawful means conspiracy and inducement of breach of contract claims which were alleged against IAG occurred in Mexico. Hence, Mexico would, <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>, be the more appropriate forum for determining the appellants’ tortious claims against Integradora.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 However, that presumption was displaced here because the underlying acts that allegedly attracted tortious liability arose from the breaches of the appellants’ constitutions. The alleged unlawful means that the appellants asserted was the breach of their constitutions, while the contracts that were allegedly breached were also their constitutions. The tortious claims were therefore <span class="font-italic">parasitic</span> on the non-tortious claims. In such circumstances, it would have been incongruous to have held that these two inextricably linked issues should be determined in two different fora. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Other factors </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 For completeness, we also found the following factors irrelevant or neutral in our analysis of the appropriate forum requirement. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) While IAG was correct that most of the witnesses were likely to be located in Mexico,

</div>
</div> we gave this factor relatively little weight since the determination of OS 126 was not likely to require witness testimonies. After all, it was common ground that the approval of the Independent Director was not procured. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The fact that the appellants had brought criminal complaints against the former directors was strictly irrelevant for the purposes of OS 126. The criminal proceedings involved questions on whether any Mexican penal laws had been violated, whereas OS 126 involved questions relating to the corporate governance of the appellants under Singapore law. While there might have been some overlap in the factual issues involved, we were not convinced that the extent of overlap was likely to be significant. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The appellants’ commencement of civil proceedings against DB Mexico and Perforadora in Mexico was also irrelevant because those proceedings neither concerned IAG’s capacity to represent the appellants nor their conduct in procuring the Guerra POAs. Instead, those civil proceedings related to the provision of information by DB Mexico as well as Perforadora, and were brought pursuant to the Mexican Trust which was expressly stated to be governed by Mexican law and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Mexican courts.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 In the circumstances, we did not find any persuasive reason to displace the starting point that Singapore was the more appropriate forum to determine the issues raised in OS 126.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The unnecessary expert affidavits </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Before turning to the next section, we noted that multiple expert affidavits were filed in the court below by the appellants, IAG, and Mr Mendez on issues relating to Mexican law. At [79]–[98] of the GD, the Judge set out a fairly lengthy summary of how these affidavits came to be filed and the purposes for which they were filed. We do not propose to repeat that summary here, save to observe that most of the experts’ evidence related to <span class="font-italic">procedural</span> issues under Mexican law. Eventually, it became clear that none of these experts’ evidence were material for the determination of the issues raised in these appeals or the setting aside application from which they arose. Indeed, save for the applicability of Art 87 of the LCM, the Judge did not refer to any of the experts’ evidence in her GD, nor did we derive any assistance from their evidence in reaching our conclusions. Additionally, the parties’ reliance on their experts’ evidence had evaporated by the time these appeals came before us and none of them placed much reliance on the experts’ evidence. While it may have been useful for the parties to provide some brief <span class="font-italic">factual</span> explanation of the various proceedings in Mexico, there was no need for them to have adduced expert evidence on Mexican law. This unnecessary filing of expert evidence, in our view, led to significant wasted costs and should be discouraged. We would therefore like to take this opportunity to remind counsel not to rush into filing expert evidence without first addressing their mind to the relevance <span class="font-italic">and</span> materiality of expert evidence on foreign law to the issues at hand. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The full and frank disclosure requirement </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Finally, we turn to address the question of full and frank disclosure. It was well-established that the duty to make full and frank disclosure in the context of interlocutory applications did not “require the plaintiff to disclose every relevant document, as it must on discovery” (<span class="font-italic">The “Vasiliy Golovnin”</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 994 at [88]). Instead, a plaintiff only bore the burden of disclosing facts that were <span class="font-italic">material</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, facts that the court should take into consideration in making an informed decision on the <span class="font-italic">issues</span> before it (<span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">“Vasily Golovnin”</span> at [86]–[87]). The question of whether full and frank disclosure had been made obviously depended on the issues raised in each case.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The Judge was of the view that the appellants had failed to disclose the following facts: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The potential applicability of Art 87 of the LCM, as well as a December 2017 ruling by the Mexican court that a provision in the Pemex charters that was similar to the EOD Clause in the Bond Agreement was invalid for contravening Art 87 (GD at [92], [116]–[118]), as it would have indicated that all of NT’s actions taken pursuant to the EOD Clause under the Bond Agreement would have been invalid, including the appellants’ commencement of OS 126 by the new directors (GD at [117]–[118]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The fact that the Rig Owners had filed criminal complaints and lawsuits in Mexico in April 2018 against Mr Alonso and three lawyers from Guerra, as well as suits against DB Mexico and Perforadora between June to July 2018 (GD at [120]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The fact that the appellants were incorporated in Singapore pursuant to the requirement of lenders who had underwritten the purchase of two of the rigs owned by the appellants, whose loans have since been paid off (GD at [122]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The fact that the appellants’ bank accounts in Singapore were closed before OS 126 was filed, contrary to the appellants’ claim that they maintained bank accounts in Singapore (GD at [123]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In our view, the Judge had erred in finding that this amounted to a lack of full and frank disclosure as none of these facts were material to the issues before the court: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Article 87 was not relevant for the purposes of determining whether Art 115A had been breached in this case. Art 87 was only relevant for the purposes of determining whether, under <span class="font-italic">Mexican</span> law the bondholders were entitled to treat the commencement of Perforadora’s <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> petition as an event of default under the Bond Agreement and it could not cure any breach of Art 115A. There was also no suggestion that the Singapore court was required to apply Mexican law and find that Art 87 invalidated the EOD Clause in the Bond Agreement. In any event, this point became moot because the <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> court in Mexico had since decided on 11 October 2018 that it did not have the authority to rule on the applicability of Art 87 to the Bond Agreement as the latter was subject to Norwegian law and the Norwegian courts’ exclusive jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The criminal complaints and separate civil proceedings concerned entirely different issues and parties. They also did not have any material bearing on the main issue raised in OS 126 for the reasons we have explained above at [92(b)]–[92(c)].   </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) It was immaterial whether the appellants had bank accounts or business activities in Singapore or that their incorporation in Singapore was required by a separate group of former-lenders. It was an undeniable fact that the appellants remained Singapore-incorporated companies and were therefore governed by Singapore law. Additionally, we noted that the appellants did not rely on the presence of bank accounts to establish that Singapore was <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens </span>at the <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>hearing. Instead, this fact was only raised in response to IAG’s allegation that the applicants did not do any business in Singapore.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 For the above reasons, we held that the Judge was wrong to have set aside the Overseas Service Order and we therefore ordered its reinstatement.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Whether the Judge erred in setting aside the Interim Injunctions  </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Interim</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">I</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">njunctions were anti-suit injunctions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 As mentioned above, we disagreed with the Judge’s (and IAG’s) characterisation of the Interim Injunctions as anti-suit injunctions. Steven Gee QC, in <span class="font-italic">Commercial Injunctions</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2016) defined an anti-suit injunction as “an injunction against a person enjoining him from commencing or continuing with proceedings in a court or tribunal abroad” (at para 14-001). In a similar vein, Thomas Raphael described an anti-suit injunction as “an order of the court requiring the injunction defendant not to commence, or cease to pursue, or not to advance particular claims within or to take steps to terminate or suspend, court or arbitration proceedings in a foreign country, or court proceedings elsewhere in England” (<span class="font-italic">The Anti-Suit Injunction</span> (Oxford University Press, 2008) at para 1.08).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The Interim Injunctions in this case did not specifically restrain IAG from commencing or continuing any proceedings against the appellants. They did not stop IAG from pursuing any personal claims that they may have had against the appellants in their own names. Instead, all that the Interim Injunctions did was to restrain IAG from purporting to act on the appellants’ behalf because the Oro Negro <span class="font-italic">C</span><span class="font-italic">oncurso</span> Petition was plainly filed in direct contravention of Art 115A. If the Interim Injunctions had the practical effect of putting an end to the <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> proceedings, that would only have been a result of IAG having no causes of action in their own names against the appellants. As such, considerations of comity were not engaged and we were not persuaded that the Interim Injunctions would have the effect of interfering with justice in Mexico.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Art 115A was a negative covenant and whether it was breached  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 In <span class="font-italic">RGA Holdings</span><span class="font-italic"> International Inc v Loh Choon Phing Robin and another </span>[2017] 2 SLR 997 (“<span class="font-italic">RGA Holdings</span>”), this court held that an interim prohibitory injunction would readily be granted where a defendant was about to breach, or had already breached, a negative covenant and that the balance of convenience test did not apply in such cases (at [32]–[33] and [47]). A negative covenant is a promise not do so something or to abstain from acting in a particular manner (Tham Chee Ho, “Non-compensatory Remedies” in <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> (Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) at paras 23.155 and 23.159). Art 115A was clearly a negative covenant since it required the appellants’ directors to abstain from “carry[ing] into effect” any petition to place the appellants in <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> or any “Insolvency Matter[s]” under Art 115(a) to (c) without the Independent Director’s approval. Before us, IAG did not contend that Art 115A was not a negative covenant should the former directors be found to be bound by it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 As we have held at [73]–[76] above, there was a good arguable case that the former directors had breached Art 115A by granting the Guerra POAs. Based on the principle in <span class="font-italic">RGA Holdings</span>, the Interim Injunctions should have been maintained to restrain the former directors from continuing to breach this negative covenant, absent any hardship or special circumstances over and above compliance with the contract (<span class="font-italic">RGA Holdings </span>at [32]–[33] and [48]). The former directors did not show any hardship or special circumstances that militated against granting the Interim Injunctions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Although Integradora was not directly bound by Art 115A, we were of the view that the balance of convenience test was equally inapplicable in relation to the appellants’ tortious claims against it. After all, the tortious claims were <span class="font-italic">premised </span>on the breach of the <span class="font-italic">same</span> negative covenant. In our judgment, the court should be equally ready to grant a prohibitory injunction to restrain that third party where there was a good arguable case that the breach of a negative covenant was <span class="font-italic">procured</span> by that third party. It would have been incongruous for us to have adopted a different standard <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> Integradora when the claims against it involved the <span class="font-italic">same</span> breaches of the <span class="font-italic">same</span> negative covenant and which resulted in the <span class="font-italic">same </span>consequences, albeit it was not the direct party that had acted in breach. We were also not persuaded that there were any hardship or special circumstances that militated against the granting of the Interim Injunctions to restrain Integradora’s procurement of the breach of Art 115A.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Even if the balance of convenience test were applicable, we would have found that the balance lay in favour of preserving the Interim Injunctions: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The appellants would have suffered substantial and irreparable harm if IAG were allowed to continue purporting to act on the appellants’ behalf. IAG did not dispute that the practical effect of the Interim Injunctions, if granted, would be to put a stop to the <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> proceedings. Indeed, they placed significant emphasis on this fact in contending that the balance of convenience lay against the granting of the Interim Injunctions.

</div> If so, the converse must be true, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> proceedings were likely to continue and could proceed to more advanced stages if the Interim Injunctions were discharged. As mentioned above at [23], the appellants could have lost management control to a <span class="font-italic">conciliador</span> if the proceedings should proceed to the second stage, and they may even have been forced into liquidation if the matter proceeded to the third stage. This would certainly have caused irreparable harm to the appellants that could not be compensated by any order for costs. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) We were unpersuaded that IAG would have suffered any irreparable prejudice if the Interim Injunctions were granted. We did not think that the loss of any opportunity by IAG to “regain ownership and control” of the appellants under a <span class="font-italic">concurso</span> framework was in any way prejudicial to IAG.

</div> This was because they had no right to do so in the first place since ownership of the appellants was properly transferred to NT, who exercised its right to remove the former directors and appoint new ones. We were also not persuaded that IAG would necessarily be deprived of a chance to challenge the validity of the EOD Clause and the actions taken pursuant to that clause. As mentioned above at [100], they were perfectly entitled to do so in the Mexican courts if they had causes of action in their own right against the appellants. What they could not be allowed to do was to mount such a challenge by purporting to act on the appellants’ behalf when they had no such authority to begin with. In other words, they could not legitimately ask this court to refrain from granting an injunction in order to allow them to take advantage of an opportunity that only arose as a consequence of their own wrongs.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) We were also of the view that relatively little weight ought to have been placed on the slight delay by the appellants in commencing OS 126 for the same reasons expressed above at [86]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 For these reasons, we were of the view that the Judge had erred in setting aside the Interim Injunctions and we therefore ordered that they be restored.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Whether Mr Mendez should have been added as a defendant to OS 126  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The Judge made no order on Mr Mendez’s variation application in light of her order that the Overseas Service Order be set aside and the Interim Injunctions discharged. The appellants sought to persuade us to add Mr Mendez as a defendant in OS 126 in the event that the appeals were allowed. Their case was that Mr Mendez’s participation was necessary for the purposes of enforcing any order in the event that they succeeded in OS 126. They relied on the English High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">T.S.B Bank International v Chabra</span><span class="font-italic"> and another </span>[1992] 1 WLR 231 (“<span class="font-italic">Chabra</span>”) to contend that a person against whom no cause of action was being asserted can be added as a defendant in anticipation of eventual enforcement proceedings against that party. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Pursuant to O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC, the court could, even on its own motion, join the following persons as defendants: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) any person who ought to have been joined as a party or whose presence before the Court is necessary to ensure that all matters in the cause or matter may be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) any person between whom and any party to the cause or matter there may exist a question or issue arising out of or relating to or connected with any relief or remedy claimed in the cause or matter which in the opinion of the Court it would be just and convenient to determine as between him and that party as well as between the parties to the cause or matter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 However, we declined to make any such order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 At the outset, we noted that there was no formal application to this effect before us or in the court below (see GD at [100]). Instead, the appellants sought to advance such an application by way of submissions in these appeals and before the Judge and we were content to dismiss this application on this basis alone. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In any case, we were not persuaded that Mr Mendez fell within either limb of O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). In particular, we did not think that <span class="font-italic">Chabra</span> stood for the broad proposition that the appellants sought to advance. In <span class="font-italic">Chabra</span>, the English High Court made an order on its own motion for the joinder of a company on the basis that there was a good arguable case that the company was holding assets that were beneficially the property of the first defendant and therefore available to satisfy the plaintiff’s claims against the first defendant if successful. This was despite the fact that the plaintiff had no substantive cause of action against the company at the time of the application. The principal basis for Mummery J’s (as he then was) decision to join the company was expressed as follows (at 238F–G): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In brief, in the light of the plaintiff’s evidence and the absence of any detailed evidence on the part of the defendants, I am of the view that there is a good arguable case that there are assets, apparently vested in the company, which may be beneficially the property of [the first defendant] and therefore available to satisfy the plaintiff’s claims against him if established at trial. I am also of the view that it is arguable that the company was, in fact, at relevant times the alter ego of [the first defendant] and that its assets, or at least some of its assets, may be available to meet the plaintiff’s claims against him if established. … In my view, the company is a proper party to these proceedings, even though there is no cause of action against it on the guarantee.        </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 <span class="font-italic">Chabra </span>was cited with approval by this court in <span class="font-italic">Teo Siew Har v Lee Kuan Yew </span>[1999] 3 SLR(R) 410 (“<span class="font-italic">Teo Siew Har</span>”). That case concerned, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, an appeal against the Singapore High Court’s decision to: (a) join the defendant’s wife as a defendant to a defamation claim against her husband on the basis that the wife held some of her assets as a nominee for the defendant husband; and (b) grant a <span class="font-italic">Mareva </span>injunction against the wife. In dismissing the appeal against these two orders, and having made reference to the English Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">SCF Finance Co Ltd v Masri</span> [1985] 1 WLR 876 and <span class="font-italic">Chabra</span>, this court observed that (at [19]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">On these authorities and in the light of the provisions in O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii), it seems to us clear that a third party against whom a plaintiff has no cause of action may be joined as a defendant, and a <span class="font-italic">Mareva</span> injunction issued against him, <span class="font-italic">if a good arguable case can be shown that the third party is holding assets belonging to the defendant</span>. Accordingly, based on the evidence before the court in this case, we hold that it was in order to add the appellant as the second defendant to the action. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In our view, <span class="font-italic">Chabra</span> stood for the narrower principle that a third party against whom no cause of action is being asserted can be added as a defendant where there is good reason to suppose that the <span class="font-italic">assets</span> held by that third party are, in truth, the assets of the defendant against whom a cause of action is being asserted. The anticipated eventual enforcement must have been against assets rather than against persons for breaching a court order. We did not accept that the principle in <span class="font-italic">Chabra</span> could be extended to <span class="font-italic">any</span> situation in which eventual enforcement against a third party was contemplated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 In <span class="font-italic">Chabra </span>and <span class="font-italic">Teo Siew Har</span>, the third parties were joined because it was found to be arguable that they held assets belonging to the defendant and in that sense, “there may exist a question or issue arising out of or relating to or <span class="font-italic">connected with any relief or remedy claimed in the cause or matter</span> which in the opinion of the Court it would be just and convenient to determine as between him and that party as well as between the parties to the cause or matter”. [emphasis added]. In this case, however, there was no dispute that the terms of the Interim Injunctions extended to IAG’s servants and agents. Neither was there any question of Mr Mendez holding any disputed assets belonging to IAG. The dispute was simply whether Mr Mendez was IAG’s servant or agent for the purposes of the Interim Injunctions. If the appellants were eventually successful in OS 126 and Mr Mendez should breach any orders of court made therefrom, the appellants would be entitled to take out enforcement proceedings against Mr Mendez even without his participation as a party in OS 126, <span class="font-italic">provided</span> he is found to be a servant or agent of IAG. Indeed, the appellants have taken the position that Mr Mendez was already bound by the Interim Injunctions by virtue of him being the servant or agent of IAG under the express terms of the Interim Injunctions.

</div> That being the case, the addition of Mr Mendez as a defendant in OS 126 would have changed nothing. Additionally, the fact that Mr Mendez had actively participated in the proceedings below cannot, in and of itself, satisfy the requirements under O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). It appeared that his participation in the proceedings below was not seriously resisted even though the status of his participation was not properly explained. The proper response to this unsatisfactory state of affairs was to prevent Mr Mendez from further participating in these proceedings unless he applied to add himself as a party at which time, the court will consider the propriety of his application. For this reason, it was also strictly incorrect for Mr Mendez to have been described as the “fourth respondent” for these appeals.

However, the question whether Mr Mendez was a servant or agent for the purposes of the Interim Injunctions was intrinsically an issue governed by Singapore law. Mr Mendez should have sought legal advice on whether he was bound by them under Singapore law, and it was not this court’s role to clarify the position for him especially since he had already taken the position that he was not bound by the Interim Injunctions.

Civil Appeals No 194 of 2018 and 105 of 2019<em></em>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>
Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Steven Chong JA):
</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Outcome: Court of Appeal overturns High Court’s decision to set aside order
granting leave to serve an originating summons out of Singapore, grants
injunction against former directors and shareholder of
Singapore-incorporated companies for breaches of negative covenants.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Background to the appeal</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
1. The appellants were a group of Singapore-incorporated companies that
owned and operated oil rigs in Mexico with the first appellant, Oro Negro
Drilling Pte Ltd (“Oro Negro”), being the group’s holding company while
each of the second to sixth respondents (“the Rig Owners”) owned an oil rig
each (“the Rigs”). The Rigs were chartered to Perforadora Oro Negro S de RL
de CV (“Perforadora”), which in turn sub-chartered the Rigs to a subsidiary
of a Mexican state-owned company (“the Pemex charters”). Perforadora was
almost wholly owned by the first respondent, which was also Oro Negro’s
sole shareholder. The second and third respondents were the appellants’
former directors.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>The material facts</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
2. The Rigs’ purchase and operation was financed by bonds issued by Oro
Negro to various bondholders pursuant to a bond agreement (“the Bond
Agreement”) between Integradora and a Norwegian company called Nordic
Trustee ASA (“NT”) which acted as the bond trustee on the bondholders’
behalf. Pursuant to the Bond Agreement, the appellants’ constitutions were
amended in 2016 to provide NT with a right to appoint an independent
director and for that independent director to have the power to veto any
attempt by the appellants to place themselves in insolvency-related
proceedings. An independent director was also eventually appointed pursuant
to NT’s directions (“the Independent Director”).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
3. Between 2015 and 2017, Perforadora faced difficulties with the Pemex
Charters as the Mexican state-owned company sought various amendments to
the charters which were unfavourable to Perforadora.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
4. In August 2017, the second and third respondents granted wide-ranging
powers of attorney to lawyers from a Mexican firm called Guerra (“the
Guerra POAs”), including the non-party, Mr Jesus Angel Guerra Mendez (“Mr
Mendez”). The Guerra POAs were wide-ranging and included powers to file
“all kinds of proceedings”, and they were also executed without the
Independent Director’s knowledge and approval.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
5. On 20 September 2017 the first respondent passed a shareholder’s
resolution authorising: (a) the engagement of Guerra as Oro Negro’s lawyers
for the purposes of filing a <em>concurso </em>petition (insolvency
proceedings) on its behalf; and (b) the granting of powers of attorney to
Guerra to seek or desist proceedings on Oro Negro’s behalf. Oro Negro in
turn passed various shareholder’s resolutions to the same effect in respect
of the Rig Owners. Thereafter, and due to a <em>concurso </em>petition
filed by Perforadora, NT declared an event of default under the Bond
Agreement. It took over control of the appellants and replaced the second
and third respondents with its own appointees (“the new directors”).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
6. On 29 September 2017, Guerra filed a <em>concurso </em>petition on the
appellants’ behalf in Mexico without the Independent Director’s approval.
The appellants’ new directors only learnt of this petition on 6 October
2017, and they eventually passed board resolutions to rescind any powers of
attorney granted on the appellants’ behalf. The new directors also
instructed new lawyers to file various motions to try and put a halt to the    <em>concurso </em>proceedings involving the appellants. Subsequently, the
appellants also commenced Originating Summons No 126 of 2018 (“OS 126”) in
Singapore, seeking, <em>inter alia</em>, declarations that the respondents
had no authority to represent the appellants, and various permanent
injunctions against them from doing so. They also applied for leave to
serve OS 126 out of Singapore, as well as for interim injunctions mirroring
the permanent injunctions.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
7. The High Court Judge initially granted the appellants leave to serve OS
126 out of Singapore (“the Overseas Service Order”), as well as the interim
injunctions sought (“the Interim Injunctions”). However, she later granted
an application by the respondents for them to be set aside.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>The Court of Appeal’s grounds of decision</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
8. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and restored both the Overseas
Service Order and the Interim Injunctions.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
9. It held that the appellants had satisfied the requirements for leave to
serve OS 126 out of Singapore as:
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
a. They had raised good arguable cases against the second and third
respondents for breaches of negative covenants not to carry into effect any
petition to place the appellants in <em>concurso</em> and against the first
respondent for unlawful means conspiracy and/or inducing the appellants to
breach their constitutions (at [56]–[78]).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
b. Singapore was the more appropriate forum to determine OS 126 as: (a) it
was the appellants’ place of incorporation; (b) the extent of proceedings
in Mexico was not relevant for the purposes of OS 126 and in any case did
not result in a substantive determination of the issues raised in OS 126;
(c) Singapore law governed the main issue raised in OS 126; and (d) the
presumption that Mexico was the appropriate forum to determine the tortious
claims was displaced since those claims were parasitic on the non-tortious
claims (at [82]–[92]).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
10. It also held that the Judge was wrong to have discharged the interim
injunctions as:
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
a. The second and third respondents had breached negative covenants that
they were bound by (at [102]); and
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
b. Although the first respondent had not directly breached any negative
covenants, it had nevertheless procured the breaches of negative covenants
in this case (at [103]).
