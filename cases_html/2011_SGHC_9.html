        Kan Ting Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is the concluding chapter of a long
                    marriage which ended in an acrimonious divorce with the division of matrimonial
                    assets and the maintenance for the plaintiff/wife to be dealt
                with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The parties are 62 years old and have been
                    married for 36 years. The defendant/husband came from a wealthy family and was
                    self-employed. The plaintiff was a teacher until she retired. They have two
                    sons, Darren and Daniel, both in their 30s, for whom no provisions have to be
                    made in the divorce.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On the division of matrimonial assets, there was
                    a sub-issue whether shares registered in the plaintiff’s name in three
                    companies, Hawick Property Investment Pte Ltd (‘Hawick”), Kelso
                    Property Investment Ptd Ltd (“Kelso”) and Skeve Investment Pte Ltd
                    (“Skeve”) belonged to her beneficially, or were held by her on
                    trust for the defendant. This was a significant issue because the plaintiff is
                    the registered owner of the 40% of the shares in Hawick and Kelso, and 10% of
                    the shares of Skeve, and each of these companies owned a unit of valuable
                    residential property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On the division of the matrimonial assets, the
                    parties agreed that the division of the matrimonial home at No. 2 Draycott
                    Park #03-01 Hampton Court, Singapore was to be dealt with separately from the
                    division of the rest of the matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The shares in Hawick, Kelso and Skeve</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       These three companies are family companies of
                    the parties and were under the control of the defendant. The plaintiff became a
                    shareholder and director of Kelso and Hawick in 1992 and of Skeve in
                        1983.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The defendant deposed that that was done
                    on the advice of consultants,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> but he was reticent about the advice
                    he received. He did not disclose the content of the advice or the person who
                    rendered it. Indirectly, there was some information on this because an affidavit
                    was deposed by Wong Cecil Vivian Richard (“Cecil Wong”) who was a
                    partner of the accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young (“E&amp;Y”) till
                    his retirement in 1985 stating that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.    ... The Defendant approached E&amp;Y for <em>corporate structuring and financial planning
                                advice</em>. I was personally involved in providing such
                            advice along with a Mr Graham Clark, who was the tax principal at the
                            material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.    It was decided amongst the Defendant and his family
                            members that a number of apartments to be built at Hampton Court were to
                            be shared out between the Defendant and his 2 younger brothers. The
                            remaining units were to be held by the holding company, Hampton Property
                            Investment Pte Ltd.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    One specific aspect of the corporate structuring
                            and <em>financial planning advice</em> sought by
                            the Defendant concerned <em>estate duty
                                planning</em> for him and his brothers. The Defendant and his
                            brothers were advised to set up individual companies to hold each of
                            their allotted units in Hampton Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       As the Kelso and Hawick shares were issued to
                    the plaintiff in 1992, and Cecil Wong retired from E&amp;Y in 1985, the extent
                    of his input and knowledge of the advice was not clear, but this was the best
                    evidence of the advice there was. He only deposed that the defendant and his
                    brothers were advised to set up individual companies to hold each of their
                    allotted units in Hampton Court. While there was no reference to any advice
                    about issuing shares in the company to the wives as part of the corporate
                    structuring, financial planning advice and estate duty planning advice, there
                    was no issue that such advice would come within that ambit. The plaintiff also
                    recalled that shares were issued to her under professional advice, although she
                    remembered it as solicitors’ advice. She may have made the mistake as the
                    advice was rendered to the defendant and not to her directly and she may also
                    have confused this with the subsequent wealth plan proposed by solicitors, which
                    will be dealt with in a later part of this judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Accepting that the defendant issued the shares
                    to the plaintiff on the basis that the shares were issued on E&amp;Y’s
                    advice for estate duty planning purposes, the question still remained whether
                    those shares were to be held by the plaintiff beneficially, or as a trustee for
                    the defendant as he contended. I raised this with counsel during the hearing. I
                    pointed out that the court should be slow to find that Cecil Wong or E&amp;Y had
                    advised the defendant to evade estate duty by arranging for shares to appear as
                    the plaintiff’s shares when he was the beneficial owner, under a secret
                    trust. I made the point because if the advice was the disputed shares in the
                    family companies were to fully held by the plaintiff, that would result in a
                    legitimate reduction in the estate duty payable on the defendant’s estate.
                    However, if the advice was to issue the shares to the plaintiff without
                    transferring the beneficial ownership of the shares a question arises over the
                    probity of the advice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The plaintiff’s solicitors had captured
                    the issue and stated the plaintiff’s position when it submitted
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The question is whether the Defendant acted on such advice by creating a
                            <em>sham shareholding</em> in favour of the
                        Plaintiff, to maintain his hold on assets during his lifetime, or that he
                        truly intended to effect a gift to the Plaintiff of the Disputed Shares. The
                        Defendant respectfully submits that <em>the former position
                            was the true situation</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">(The sham shareholding-or-gift analysis is apt and relevant to the
                    question whether these shares are matrimonial assets).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       It was plain that the critical issue was not
                    over the creation of the shareholding, but the shareholding created was a sham
                    shareholding. When Cecil Wong was asked to depose on the advice given to the
                    defendant and his brothers, that would be an important point of his evidence,
                    but Cecil Wong made no mention of that, and the defendant did not follow up on
                    that with him or Graham Clark who was also involved in giving the advice, or
                    E&amp;Y to confirm or comment on the sham shareholding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     There is more on this issue. The ownership of
                    the shares was the subject of serious discussion again. In March 2007, the
                    defendant wanted to create a wealth plan for the family to save on estate duty.
                    His lawyer, Tan Hin Tat, proposed a plan which involved the setting up of the
                    Wen-Ping Trust and for all shares in Hawick, Kelso and Skeve to be owned by a
                    new company, Great Hampton Pte Ltd. At that time, the marriage between the
                    parties was already strained. The plaintiff believed that the defendant was
                    having an extra-marital affair, and was suspicious of his motives. When Tan Hin
                    Tat and his colleagues explained the wealth plan to the plaintiff, she declined
                    to put her shares in the companies into the proposed trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Tan Hin Tat confirmed in an affidavit that
                    when he explained the wealth plan to the plaintiff, he was not aware that she
                    was holding the shares on trust for the defendant; neither the defendant nor the
                    plaintiff had informed him of that. It would have been reasonable for the
                    defendant to have informed Tan Hin Tat of the circumstances and manner under
                    which the plaintiff came to own the shares, and of the alleged advice of E&amp;Y
                    on the “sham shareholding” when he instructed Tan Hin Tat on the
                    wealth plan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     When the defendant came to know that the
                    plaintiff and their sons had reservations over the wealth plan, he did not take
                    it kindly. His anger and frustration was luminous in his email to them of 16
                    April 2007 –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I Do Not Know, What to Do any more???.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">DARREN AND DANIEL</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Your Trust is at Stake, I may go my Way and Do Nothing!!</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My Last Warning to Those ARE Against Me,, WatchOUT!!</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I Am NO FOOL!!</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">SO NO MORE NONSENSE OR MOVE ON !!</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">THAT IS FINAL !!!</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">THAT INCLUDES YOU, ... AND ALL THE WANS,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">DO YOU THINK YOU CAN ... AROUND MY DOORSTEPS&lt;WHEN I GET BACK&lt;THERE
                        WILL BE CHANGES, BETTER MOVE OUT NOW!!</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     But while he was unhappy with the plaintiff he
                    did not remind her that she was only holding the shares in trust for him, and
                    that she should do at his bidding. Although he gave notice that there will be
                    changes, he did not follow that up by revoking the trusts and having the shares
                    returned to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Subsequently, he cooled down and the parties
                    were able to communicate over the wealth plan more calmly. On 9 July 2007,
                    the plaintiff wrote to the defendant:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I refer to your lawyers’ letters dated 13 June 2007 which I received
                        from Darren on 18 June 2007 after I returned from China.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Early this year you arranged for me to meet your lawyer, Mr Tan Hin Tat
                        (“Mr Tan”) at his office. During the meeting at Mr Tan’s
                        office which you also attended, Mr Tan informed me that his plan was for us
                        to transfer each of our respective shares to a New Zealand trustee.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I had informed you previously that I was not satisfied with Mr Tan Hin
                        Tat’s explanation of the wealth plan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There were not enough details. I do not understand why you want both of us
                        to transfer each of our shares to a trust or 3<sup>rd</sup>
                        party.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Tan then sent me an email telling me to meet his other colleagues who
                        would explain the wealth plan again. After meeting with his colleagues, I
                        was still not satisfied with the explanation of the wealth plan and I told
                        Mr Tan’s colleagues that I would not want to sign away my
                        shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You subsequently informed Darren that you were extremely angry at my
                        refusal to sign away my shares. You also told Darren that I was no match for
                        you and that you would issue more shares in the Companies to dilute my stake
                        in each of the Companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am saddened by your actions. You may recall that these shares were given
                        to me in 1992. You told me then that the shares were mine and that
                            “<b>you owned 40% of my
                        companies</b>”. You had assured me that Darren, Daniel &amp;
                        myself were precious to you and that we were a family.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Until today, I have not been provided good reason why I should transfer my
                        shares. Why do you hate me so much? I will hold on to what is mine.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have asked Jamie, the Companies’ auditor for the bank statements
                        of the Companies as well as other documents. Jamie has however informed me
                        that you have instructed her that such documents may not be handed to me and
                        that I have to request them from you.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not understand your actions. Why do you forbid me from looking at
                        those documents? I have a right to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whatever you dislike about me should be confined between us. Please do not
                        drag Darren or Daniel into the picture.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and the defendant responded on 18 July 2007 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am very sad reading your letter. You, Darren and Daniel are precious to
                        me and I have always, and will always, have your interests in my
                        heart.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You have misunderstood my wealth plan maybe because of all the legal mumbo
                        jumbo. If I die with the shares of Kelso, Hawick, and Skeve in my name (plus
                        the shares in the company with my brothers), the estate duty payable will be
                        in the millions. You will also have to pay a huge estate duty. All this
                        estate duty will reduce the value of the property we give to our
                        sons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Tan Hin Tat is not only my lawyer, he is also a friend. I went to him for
                        help to lower our estate duty, and to allow smooth passing of our property
                        to our sons. Hin Tat will also help our sons to deal with their uncles, if
                        necessary. THE RESULT OF HIN TAT’S ADVICE IS THE WEALTH PLAN, with you
                        and me as equal participants, for the sake and benefit of you and our two
                        sons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">So you see, I never had bad intentions and <em>I never
                            wanted to TAKE away anything from you</em>. This wealth plan is
                        for the family. From what I heard from Hin Tat and his colleagues, you
                        decided, already, that you will not participate, and you did not care what I
                        do.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That said, the initial wealth plan had you as a beneficiary as well. And
                        it is only after you told Hin Tat’s colleagues that you will NOT
                        participate in the wealth plan, and will make provisions for your sons in
                        your own way, that the revised wealth plan will not include you.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If you need more explanation, all you have to do is ask. But you should
                        have an open mind and not think I am trying to take anything away from you.
                        Wealth planning is legitimate, and all it does is help keep more of the
                        wealth of the family instead of paying to the government upon our
                        demise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in bold in original, emphasis in italics added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The defendant did not dispute the
                    plaintiff’s plain assertion that he told her that the shares given to her
                    in 1992 (the shares in Kelso and Hawick) were hers and that she owned 40% of the
                    companies. He was not uneducated, inarticulate nor diffident, and was the
                    dominant spouse. If the plaintiff was mistaken over her ownership of the shares,
                    his passivity is hard to understand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My finding</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It is common ground that (i) the defendant
                    controlled the companies and had managed them to the exclusion of the plaintiff,
                    (ii) that the plaintiff did not pay for the shares, and was never in physical
                    possession of the share certificates, and (iii) it was also not disputed that
                    when dividends were paid by Hawick and Kelso, the payments were paid to the
                    defendant (probably on his instructions).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Insofar as the shares were issued to the
                    plaintiff at the initiative of the defendant without any payment from the
                    plaintiff, a resulting trust can subsist over the shares in his favour, but all
                    the relevant circumstances must be considered. If it is assumed that Cecil Wong
                    and E&amp;Y had acted properly, they would have advised the defendant to make
                    genuine transfers of the shares to the plaintiff. In the absence of clear and
                    credible evidence, a court will be slow to find that reputable and established
                    professionals and firms like Cecil Wong and E&amp;Y would advise their clients
                    to create sham shareholdings, particularly when Cecil Wong and E&amp;Y had not
                    been notified of the defendant’s allegation, and had not been given the
                    opportunity to respond to it. Independent of the professional advice, the
                    defendant’s conduct was inconsistent with his claim that the disputed
                    shares were his shares held by the plaintiff as his trustee. He did not inform
                    Tan Hin Tat of that when he engaged him to put up the wealth plan, and he did
                    not assert his beneficial ownership when the plaintiff rejected the plan. He
                    also did not deny that he had told her that the shares were hers, and did
                    nothing to assert his ownership till he was confronted with the division of
                    matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On the conclusion of a review of the facts, I
                    find that the defendant had transferred the disputed shares to the plaintiff as
                    gifts upon professional advice as part of a financial and estate duty planning
                    exercise, and not as a sham transaction. In the circumstances, the presumption
                    of a resulting trust is displaced by the presumption of advancement in favour of
                    the plaintiff/wife, and my finding of fact that the shares were transferred to
                    the plaintiff absolutely.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“matrimonial asset” means —</p>

                        both parties to the marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On a plain reading of the provision, the disputed shares are the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     However, there is a view that inter-spousal
                    gifts are matrimonial assets. Professor Leong Wai Kum’s <em>Elements of Family Law in Singapore</em> (LexisNexis 2007) states at
                    p 602:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Gift between spouses</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Court of Appeal in <em>Yeo Gim Tong Michael v
                        Tianzon Lolita</em> [[1996] 1 SLR(R) 633 (“<em>Tianzon</em>”)], even under the former section 106
                        of the Women’s Charter, decided that when a property is given by one
                        spouse to the other <em>it should not be regarded as a
                            gift</em> but should be liable to division, unless it were given
                        to the spouse as a highly personal gift or its value were so low as to be
                            <em>de minimis</em>. This decision is rational
                        because a gift between the spouses depletes the wealth of the marital
                        partnership so that in fairness significant gifts ought to be returned to
                        the pool and be liable to be divided.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     
          <em>Tianzon</em> was
                    commenced in 1993, and the judgment of the Court of Appeal was delivered on 26
                    March 1996. The former s 106 which applied over the division of matrimonial
                    assets made no reference to gifts. The Court of Appeal in <em>Tianzon</em> referred to a <em>dicta</em> in
                        <em>Soon Geok Hong v Ong Yeow Tiong</em>
                    [1995] SGHC 78 that when a gift is made between spouses, it must be
                    implied that the donor will not seek to be entitled to any share in them if the
                    marriage is dissolved. The Court of Appeal held at [12] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whatever might be the intention of the spouses as regards a gift between
                        them at the time the gift was made, upon their divorce the criteria for
                        division of their assets including the gift under s 106 do not depend on or
                        take into account their intention, express or implied: Wang Shi Huah Karen v
                        Wong King Cheung Kevin [1992] 2 SLR(R) 172 at [13]. In considering
                        the issue of a gift in the division of matrimonial assets under s 106,
                        the starting point is whether the subject matter of the gift is property
                        originally acquired during the marriage through the sole effort of the donor
                        or the joint efforts of the donor and his or her spouse, the recipient. If
                        the property was so acquired during the marriage, it falls within sub-s (1)
                        or (3) (as the case may be) of s 106, and depending on the circumstances
                        would be taken into account in the division of matrimonial assets,
                        notwithstanding that it was a gift from one spouse to the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     From a reading of this passage, the Court of
                    Appeal did not rule that the property involved should not be regarded as a gift.
                    The Court’s ruling was that although the asset was a gift, it was also a
                    matrimonial asset. The importance of this distinction can be seen in the next
                    paragraphs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The provisions on the division of matrimonial
                    assets have been amended after the decision in <em>Tianzon</em>. The former s 106 has been replaced by s 112
                    in 1996, and s 112(10) states specifically that “matrimonial
                    asset” –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... does not include any asset (not being a matrimonial home) that has
                        been acquired by one party at any time by gift or inheritance and that has
                        not been substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by
                        both parties to the marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">(There was a minor amendment in 2006 which did not affect the
                    definition).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     If an inter-spousal gift is not regarded as a
                    gift, then it falls outside the exemption under s 112(10), and it is a
                    matrimonial asset. But when it is regarded as a gift, then it comes under the
                    exemption, and it is not to be included as a matrimonial asset.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     When amendments to the Women’s Charter
                    were under consideration in 1996, Professor Leong presented a paper to the
                    Select Committee on the Women’s Charter (Amendment) Bill [Bill No.5/96]
                    dated 21 May 1996, after the delivery of the judgment in <em>Tianzon</em>. The paper advocated that inter-spousal gifts be
                    included as matrimonial assets. Professor Leong put forward a definition of
                    “matrimonial asset”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) “matrimonial asset” includes:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    the matrimonial home;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    an asset acquired by either party or both
                                parties during their marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    an asset acquired by either party or both
                                parties before marriage which has been used by both parties or the
                                parties and their children as an asset of the household or which has
                                been substantially improved during the marriage by the party who had
                                not acquired it or by both parties;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>d</em>)    
                <em>an asset which was acquired by one party as a gift from
                                    the other</em>; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(e)    an asset which was acquired by one party as a
                                gift or an inheritance which has been used by both parties or the
                                parties and their children as an asset of the household or which has
                                been substantially improved during the marriage by the party who had
                                not acquired it or by both parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">but her proposed definition was not adopted, and the
                    definition in its current form was enacted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Law Reform Committee of the Singapore
                    Academy of Law also presented its views to the Select Committee on the
                    definition of matrimonial asset. It also proposed that a distinction be made
                    between an inter-spousal gift and a third-party gift, and suggested that
                    matrimonial asset be defined to mean:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    any asset acquired
                            before the marriage by one party or both parties to the marriage and
                            which:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    has become the matrimonial home;
                            or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   has been substantially improved during the
                                marriage by the other party or by both parties to the marriage;
                                and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    any other asset of any nature acquired during the
                            marriage by one party or both parties to the marriage,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">but does not include any asset (not being a matrimonial home) that has
                        been acquired by one party at any time by gift <em>(other
                            than a gift by one party to the other during the marriage)</em> or
                        inheritance and that has not been substantially improved during the marriage
                        by the other party or by both parties to the marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">but the suggestion was not taken up.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In the result, it can be seen that attention
                    was drawn by Professor Leong and the Law Reform Committee to the possibility of
                    drawing a distinction between inter-spousal gifts and third-party gifts, but the
                    definition of matrimonial asset enacted did not reflect these views. It cannot
                    be supposed that the Select Committee or Parliament overlooked and did not
                    consider the views of authoritative parties as Professor Leong and the Law
                    Reform Committee. It is much more probable that the views were considered, but
                    were rejected. If that was the case, the rejected definitions should not be
                    applied to the enacted provision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In the circumstances, I do not think that
                    inter-spousal gifts are matrimonial assets under s 112(10). I come to this
                    conclusion because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_i"></a>(i)     the law before the enactment of the
                        amendment, as stated in <em>Tianzon</em>, was that
                        inter-spousal gifts are gifts and are matrimonial assets;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     the definition did not change the
                        Court of Appeal’s ruling that inter-spousal gifts are gifts;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     the
                        definition changed the Court of Appeal’s ruling that inter-spousal
                        gifts are matrimonial assets by stating that a gift (which would include an
                        inter-spousal gift) is not a matrimonial asset.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Should the definition be construed such that a
                    gift should be read as a gift other than an inter-spousal gift <em>ie</em> a third-party gift? I do not think that such a
                    construction is justified because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_i"></a>(i)     although a distinction between an
                        inter-spousal gift and a third-party gift was made in <em>Tianzon</em>, the definition enacted made no distinction between
                        such gifts;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     the proposed definitions of Professor Leong and the Law Reform Committee
                        were not adopted, and the enacted amendment excluded all gifts as
                        matrimonial assets; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     there is nothing in the parliamentary records and other
                        material within s 9A(3) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) which
                        suggests that the definition should not bear its clear and unambiguous
                        meaning, and should be given a restricted meaning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     As there was no claim or evidence that the
                    defendant or the parties had substantially improved the value of the shares, the
                    shares are not subject to division as matrimonial assets. This does not,
                    however, mean that the plaintiff will have the advantage of keeping the shares
                    for herself, without this being taken into account in the division of the
                    matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Section 112(2)(h) requires a court ordering a
                    division of matrimonial assets to have regard to, <em>inter
                        alia</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the matters referred to in section 114(1) so far as they are
                        relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and s 114(1)(a) provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which
                        each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the
                        foreseeable future;</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As the disputed shares are the plaintiff’s property, they are to
                    be taken into consideration in determining her share of the matrimonial
                    assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Division of the matrimonial home</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The matrimonial home is held in the name of
                    the defendant. This was a unit in Hampton Court, a high-end housing development
                    consisting of 12 units undertaken by the defendant, his mother and brothers on
                    land inherited from his father and his grandfather. The plaintiff acknowledged
                    that she made no financial contributions to the acquisition of the property, but
                    she relied on her contributions as the homemaker when the parties and their sons
                    resided in the property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     There is no agreement on the value of the
                    property. The plaintiff had obtained a valuation at $12.5m, but that was not
                    accepted by the defendant. In the written submissions in the hearings before me,
                    he argued that “not more than 35% of the market value of the matrimonial
                    home” should go to the plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff, on the other hand, claimed
                    40% share of the net asset value of the property as at 31 July 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> (The 31 July 2007 date was probably used
                    as it was the last day of the month following 27 July 2007, the date when
                    the divorce proceedings were filed.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     It was pointed out during the hearing that the
                    matrimonial home cannot be divided by reference to its market value because the
                    property was mortgaged to secure financial facilities. Counsel was quick to see
                    that, and revised the defendant’s offer to 35% of the net asset value of
                    the property, without identifying the point of time at which the net asset value
                    is to be taken. The time element is significant in this case because the
                    encumbrances on the property which stood at $533,428.18 on 31 July 2007 had
                    increased to about $4.1m at the time of the hearing.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Having regard to the facts, the plaintiff had
                    been content to let the defendant manage the matrimonial assets including the
                    matrimonial home in the normal course of the marriage. In the circumstances she
                    cannot complain over the encumbrances on the property created when the marriage
                    was running smoothly. However, once divorce proceedings are commenced and the
                    likelihood of the issue of the matrimonial assets arises, the single and
                    non-consultative control by the defendant cannot continue without justification,
                    and he cannot use his control to diminish the asset value of the property by
                    using it as security for facilities used for his own benefit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In the present circumstances, as the starting
                    point, the time of commencement of proceedings should be used to determine the
                    net asset value of the property, but if the defendant can show that the
                    encumbrances on the property had increased in value after that date which were
                    for the benefit of both parties, these additional subsequent amounts can be
                    taken into account. As there is no claim or evidence of that, the asset value of
                    the property should be taken as at 27 July 2007, or rounded off to 31 July
                    2007 if it does not prejudice the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     What should be the plaintiff’s share of
                    the matrimonial home? The plaintiff claims 40%, and the defendant offers 35%.
                    The plaintiff referred to one case –
                    <em>Chen Siew Hwee v Low Kee Guan</em> [2006]
                    4 SLR(R) 605 where Andrew Phang Boon Leong J awarded the wife 35% of
                    the matrimonial assets acquired with no financial contribution from her in a 17
                    year childless marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The defendant justified his 35% offer by
                    referring to two cases. In <em>Ong Chen Leng v Tan Sau
                        Poo</em> [1993] 2 SLR(R) 545, the Court of Appeal awarded a
                    wife 35% of the matrimonial property paid for by the husband in a 23-year
                    marriage with 3 children. In <em>Kwok Wai Leng v Chan Sooi
                        Hong</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 386, a wife was awarded 35% of the
                    matrimonial flat in a 37-year marriage during which the wife’s
                    contribution towards the acquisition amounted to 16.7%.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Taking into account the fact that the
                    plaintiff had not contributed financially in the acquisition of the matrimonial
                    home, I award her 35% of its net asset value.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The other matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The assets that are subject to division in a
                    divorce are set out in s 112(10). In the present case, after dealing with
                    the matrimonial home separately, the matrimonial assets would be the assets
                    acquired separately by each party, as there were no assets acquired by their
                    joint efforts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The plaintiff’s case was that she would
                    accept a 40% share of the most valuable of these assets, which was a residential
                    unit at 9 Rhu Cross #10-08 Costa Rhu (“the Costa Rhu property”)
                    which was acquired by the defendant, and forego any division of the other
                    matrimonial assets. The defendant offered the plaintiff a 20% share of the
                    matrimonial assets. Unfortunately there was insufficient information before me
                    to determine the composition and value of these assets although it was clear
                    that the majority of them in terms of value were acquired by the defendant. I
                    have to deal with the matter in terms of percentile division without setting
                    down specific amounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     There are omissions in the presentation of the
                    plaintiff’s proposal. When she took the position that she was restricting
                    the claim to a share of the Costa Rhu property and was waiving claims over the
                    defendant’s other assets, she overlooked that her assets were also
                    matrimonial assets, and were liable to division. Her waiver was not as simple as
                    she had put it; the defendant had not agreed to exclude her assets from
                    division.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Without the agreement of the defendant, the
                    plaintiff’s proposal to use the Costa Rhu property only for division
                    cannot be implemented. The assets to be divided will include all the matrimonial
                    assets, except the matrimonial home which has been dealt with
                separately.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     I took into account the effect of the divorce
                    proceedings on the financial position of the plaintiff. By these proceedings,
                    she has 35% of the asset value of the matrimonial home, and obtained
                    confirmation of her ownership of the 40% of the shares of Hawick and Kelso and
                    10% of the shares of Skeve, making her an effective part-owner of two other
                    units in Hampton Court and another property, 20 Upper Circuit Road #24-06 The
                    Riverwalk owned by Skeve, as well as the Costa Rhu property. As the plaintiff
                    has acquired property of considerable value as a result of the divorce
                    proceedings, I find that she should receive 25% of the other matrimonial
                    assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     As I have noted, there is insufficient
                    material before me to work out the actual amounts, and I direct that the amounts
                    be determined by a Registrar. For the purpose of clarity, I find that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_i"></a>(i)     the asset value of the Costa Rhu
                        property should be taken at the time of the division, deducting any amount
                        of any loan secured on the property as at the time of the commencement of
                        the divorce proceedings,</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     the bank balances of each party are also to be taken as
                        at that date,</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     the boat “Delightful Dream” registered in the name of
                        the defendant and held in trust for Skeve is not to be included in the
                        division, and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     the Renault car registered in the name of the defendant and given as a
                        wedding present to Daniel is not to be included in the
                    division.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     After the values of the plaintiff’s
                    assets and the defendant’s assets are ascertained, the amount due to the
                    plaintiff can be worked out. I will explain how this is to be done. I will refer
                    to the value of the defendant’s assets as <em>A</em>,
                    and the plaintiff’s assets as <em>B</em>, and the
                    total of <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> as
                        <em>C</em>. The defendant’s share is <em>D</em> (75% of <em>C</em>) and the
                    plaintiff’s share is <em>E</em> (25% of <em>C</em>). As the plaintiff is keeping her assets, a sum
                    representing <em>E</em> –
                    <em>B</em> is due from the defendant to her.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Follow-up matters</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     My findings on the division of the matrimonial
                    assets are only the start of the division process. The two properties affected,
                        <em>ie</em> the matrimonial home in Hampton Court and
                    the Costa Rhu property, have to be valued and there is the possibility of one
                    party buying out the share of the other party. The parties should try to work
                    these matters out between themselves. If they are unable to do that, then they
                    are to revert to me for directions to be given, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, on the valuers to be appointed, the conduct and manner of
                    sale or buy-out</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The process of working out the
                    plaintiff’s share could be painstaking and contentious. It would be in the
                    best interests of the parties to try to come to an agreement on the overall
                    amount, or on as many of the components thereof as possible, and I hope that
                    they will make a serious attempt to do that.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Maintenance for the plaintiff</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The plaintiff wanted a lump sum payment on the
                    ground of the defendant’s intention to make his future in China, and she
                    worked out $432,000 at $4500 a month for eight years. The defendant disagreed
                    with the monthly figure and contended that it should be $2668, and objected to
                    any lump sum payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The Court of Appeal have set out the
                    guidelines for lump sum maintenance payments in <em>Lee Puey Hwa
                        v Tay Cheow Seng</em> [1991] 2 SLR(R) 196 at [9]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he court's power to order a lump sum payment, as an alternative to
                        periodical payments, makes it possible for a husband, who has the means to
                        make a lump sum payment, to achieve a clean break, and is clearly a method
                        which should be taken advantage of whenever this is feasible. In deciding
                        whether to order a lump sum payment, the court should consider the
                        individual circumstances of the parties, particularly the needs of the wife
                        and the obligations and responsibilities of the husband, in addition to his
                        assets, his earning capacity and other available resources. In any case, an
                        order for a lump sum should not be made if the husband does not have
                        adequate cash or other capital assets which can be readily disposed of, or
                        if the lump sum payment or the disposal of assets will effectively cripple
                        his earning power.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">If the plaintiff can show that there is a reasonable risk that the
                    defendant would refuse to comply with an order to make periodic payments of
                    maintenance, a lump sum order may be made, but I am not persuaded on the
                    evidence that there is a real risk that the defendant will settle in China and
                    evade paying maintenance to the plaintiff. He is born and bred in Singapore and
                    has substantial links and properties here. It is unlikely and impractical for
                    him to uproot himself from Singapore to evade paying monthly maintenance which
                    is within his ability to pay. He should pay maintenance in the normal way, by
                    monthly payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Section 114 sets out the circumstances to be
                    considered in determining the amount of maintenance. The first two circumstances
                    are of particular relevance in the present case:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    the income, earning capacity, property and other
                            financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is
                            likely to have in the foreseeable future;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    the financial needs, obligations and
                            responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is
                            likely to have in the foreseeable future;</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Both parties are 62 years old, and have
                    considerable assets to live on. The plaintiff would have to pay for alternative
                    accommodation if the matrimonial home is sold or her share in it is bought over
                    by the defendant, and this is a financial need that should be taken into account
                    under s 114(1)(b). Nevertheless, the defendant should not have to pay for
                    all the plaintiff’s financial needs, and she should contribute towards
                    them out of her own assets. Taking all the matters into consideration, I order
                    the defendant to pay the plaintiff monthly maintenance of $2000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     As both parties have brought up real issues
                    that needed to be determined, and neither had been entirely correct on the
                    positions they took, each party shall bear its own costs.</p>
