Ram alleged that it was an embarrassing episode for him, as his guests saw for themselves how Ram and Mrs Ram were effectively restricted to living in their bedroom.

The 2015 Deed also purported to revoke and supersede all past agreements and understandings. Such a provision is commonly found in settlement agreements and I was of the view that there was nothing ambiguous or uncertain about the provision.

He also pleaded that he was dependent on Navin for the Annual Allowance, had nowhere else to stay in Singapore apart from the Poole Road property, was cash-strapped and could not maintain his and Mrs Ram’s then-standard of living. The 2015 Deed, according to Ram, was manifestly disadvantageous to him because it effectively meant that he waived all his claims to the moneys from the Bonds, which were his to begin with. Moreover, the US$2m he received under the 2015 Deed was highly disproportionate to the value of all the entitlements he had to relinquish in exchange, such as the proceeds of the Bonds, the Evergreen shares that Mrs Ram sold to Navin (which Ram claimed was held on trust for him by Mrs Ram), the payment of the arrears of the Annual Allowance and resumption of payment thereof.

</div> This put paid to any allegation of compulsion of will.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-italic">Undue influence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In <span class="font-italic">BOM v BOK and another appeal </span>[2019] 1 SLR 349 (“<span class="font-italic">BOM v BOK</span>”), the Court of Appeal provided a useful summary on the law of undue influence (at [101]). Essentially, there are two classes of undue influence:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) “Class 1” undue influence, also known as actual undue influence, requires the plaintiff to show that he entered into the impugned transaction because of the undue influence exerted upon him by the defendant. To do this, the plaintiff has to demonstrate that: (i) the defendant had the capacity to influence him; (ii) the influence was exercised; (iii) its exercise was undue; and (iv) its exercise brought about the transaction.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) “Class 2” undue influence, also known as presumed undue influence, does not require the plaintiff to prove actual undue influence. Instead, it suffices for the plaintiff to show (i) that there was a relationship of trust and confidence between him and the defendant; (ii) that the relationship was such that it could be presumed that the defendant abused the plaintiff’s trust and confidence in influencing the plaintiff to enter into the impugned transaction; and (iii) that the transaction was one that calls for an explanation. This class of undue influence is further divided into “Class 2A” and “Class 2B” undue influence. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Under “Class 2A” undue influence, there are relationships that the law irrebuttably presumes to give rise to a relationship of trust and confidence. Once the plaintiff shows that his relationship with the wrongdoer triggers the presumption and that the impugned transaction calls for an explanation, there is a <span class="font-italic">rebuttable</span> presumption that the wrongdoer has exerted undue influence.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Under “Class 2B” undue influence, the plaintiff must prove that there is a relationship of trust and confidence. If it is shown that there was such a relationship and that the transaction calls for an explanation, then there is a <span class="font-italic">rebuttable</span> presumption of undue influence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In my view, both Ram and Mrs Ram failed to prove undue influence (whether actual or presumed). The evidence simply did not support their case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 With respect to actual undue influence, Ram and Mrs Ram relied on the same allegations that they relied on for economic duress. For the same reasons discussed above, I concluded that they did not sign the 2015 Deed under any actual undue influence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 As for presumed undue influence, Ram relied on both Class 2A and Class 2B undue influence. As for Mrs Ram, it was not clear if she was relying on Class 2A undue influence but it was at least clear that she did rely on Class 2B undue influence. In any event, with respect to Class 2A undue influence, in a parent-child relationship, the presumption that the parent has influence over the child arises out of the authority that a parent inherently has over his/her child, in particular a young child. There is no presumption that a child has influence over the parent, merely by reason of the parent-child relationship. Indeed, even as between an adult child and elderly or senile parents, no presumption of influence over the parents arise: <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts </span>vol 1 (H G Beale gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 33rd Ed, 2018) at para 8-080.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Although Class 2A undue influence was not applicable, Ram and Mrs Ram could still rely on Class 2B undue influence if they could prove a relationship of trust and confidence reposed by them in Navin, and that the transaction called for an explanation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 However, in my judgment, the evidence showed that at the time the 2015 Deed was signed, the relationship between Ram/Mrs Ram and Navin was anything but one of trust and confidence. The MOU, signed in 2006, did not end the disputes between Ram and Navin. Instead, by the time the 2015 Deed was signed, there was palpable distrust between Ram and Navin as a result of, among other things, the disputes over the non-payment of the Annual Allowance after 2013, the Bonds and the SPA. As for Mrs Ram, there could not have been any relationship of trust and confidence between her and Navin either. By then, there were the disputes over the Annual Allowance and the SPA (in connection with which she had revoked the POA). Braj and Navin’s father-in-law had also been roped in to mediate the disputes. Even the 2015 Deed itself was stated to be a settlement of disagreements which “have created certain disharmony within the family or amongst the individual members”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 I therefore found that Ram and Mrs Ram failed to show that there was a relationship of trust and confidence reposed by them in Navin. Accordingly, the presumption of undue influence under Class 2B was not applicable.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-italic">Unconscionability</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Before me, Ram and Mrs Ram relied on the High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">BOK v BOL and another </span>[2017] SGHC 316 (“<span class="font-italic">BOK v BOL</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">BOK v BOL</span>, the High Court held that the doctrine of unconscionability forms part of the law of Singapore, and set out a three-stage test to determine whether a transaction is unconscionable (at [120]–[122]). First, there must be weakness on one side, which could arise from poverty, ignorance or other circumstances, like acute grief. Second, there must be exploitation of that weakness and a transaction at an undervalue would be a necessary component of this requirement. Third, upon the satisfaction of these two elements, it will be for the defendant to demonstrate that the transaction was fair, just and reasonable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I concluded that there was no reason to set aside the 2015 Deed for unconscionability. Ram and Mrs Ram relied on the same allegations that they relied on for economic duress and undue influence. In my view, they had not shown that they were suffering from such a weakness as to invoke the doctrine. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 <span class="font-italic">BOM v BOK </span>was the appeal against the High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">BOK v BOL. </span>The Court of Appeal’s decision was rendered after I had given my decision in the present case. In <span class="font-italic">BOM v BOK</span>, the Court of Appeal held (at [142]) that the narrow doctrine of unconscionability applies in Singapore. To invoke the doctrine, the plaintiff has to show that he was suffering from an infirmity that the other party exploited in procuring the transaction. Upon satisfaction of this requirement, the burden is on the defendant to demonstrate that the transaction was fair, just and reasonable. There is no requirement that the transaction was at an undervalue or that there was a lack of independent advice, but these are factors that the court will invariably consider. The Court of Appeal also clarified (at [141]) that the plaintiff’s infirmity must have been of sufficient gravity as to have acutely affected his ability to conserve his own interests. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In my view, there is nothing in the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">BOM v BOK</span> that changes my conclusion that Ram and Mrs Ram had not established unconscionability.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Mrs Ram could rely on </span><span class="font-weight-bold">non </span><span class="font-weight-bold">est factum </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Mrs Ram also relied on the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">non </span><span class="font-italic">est factum</span> to set aside the 2015 Deed. The doctrine of <span class="font-italic">non </span><span class="font-italic">est factum </span>operates as an exception to the general rule that a person is bound by his signature on a contractual document even if he did not fully understand its terms. Two elements need to be established for this doctrine to be invoked. First, there must be a radical difference between what was signed and what was thought to have been signed. Second, the party seeking to rely on the doctrine must prove that he took care in signing the document, that is, he must not have been negligent. See <span class="font-italic">Mahidon</span><span class="font-italic"> Nichiar bte Mohd Ali and others v Dawood Sultan Kamaldin </span>[2015] 5 SLR 62 at [119].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Navin brought Mr Mohan Singh, a lawyer, to the signing of the 2015 Deed. Mr Mohan Singh was the witness to the execution of the 2015 Deed by all the four parties. He also explained the 2015 Deed to Mrs Ram in Hindi. However, Mrs Ram claimed that nobody explained the deed to her.

I rejected Mrs Ram’s claim that she did not understand the nature of the 2015 Deed. First, the disputes between Ram and Navin had escalated and Braj and Navin’s father-in-law had been roped in to mediate. The 2015 Deed was signed shortly before the scheduled date for the meeting with Braj and Navin’s father-in-law. Ram, Mrs Ram, Navin and Mrs Navin signed the 2015 Deed. I found it unbelievable that under these circumstances, she had no inkling at all as to what she was signing. Second, Ram knew that the 2015 Deed was a settlement deed.

</div>  Navin claimed that the Bonds were a joint investment by Ram and him in “about equal shares” (see [21] above). As will be seen later, I found that Ram’s share of the sale proceeds was US$3,442,378.29. Navin did not disclose this to Ram. Instead, his position was that Ram’s share was less than US$1.5m. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Obviously, Ram’s share of the sale proceeds was material since the 2015 Deed purported to settle all the existing disputes for a sum of US$2m to be paid to Ram.

</div> In the circumstances, having set aside the 2015 Deed, I also set aside the September Agreement. In any event, in my view, the effect of the September Agreement was merely to confirm that a full and final settlement had been reached under the 2015 Deed. The statement that the parties would retain the assets held in their respective names added nothing of significance. I would only add that even if the September Agreement survived the setting aside of the 2015 Deed, it would not have provided Navin and Mrs Navin any defence to the claims for breaches of the MOU or for the payment of Ram’s share of the proceeds of sale of the Bonds.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 As Navin had paid US$2m to Ram pursuant to the 2015 Deed, I ordered Ram to return the sum of US$2m to Navin, subject to a set off against amounts that I ordered Navin to pay to Ram in this action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 I should add that even if the 2015 Deed were not set aside, it settled only disputes which had arisen at the time that it was signed. This was because the 2015 Deed settled only the “Issues” as defined in that document, and as defined, the term “Issues” was limited to disagreements which had created disharmony within the family or amongst the individual members. At the time the 2015 Deed was signed, there were no disputes over (a) Ram’s and Mrs Ram’s right under the MOU to stay at the Poole Road property, and (b) Mrs Ram’s claim under the MOU to payment of US$1m from Navin for the acquisition of a residential property.

As will be seen later, I concluded that it was Ram who wanted to buy and who paid for the Poole Road property. Navin became the registered owner only because Ram, not being a Singapore citizen, could not buy the property in his own name. The provision was proposed by Braj to protect Ram’s and Mrs Ram’s right to stay at the Poole Road property in express terms and Navin agreed. In my view, this showed that the MOU was intended to be legally binding; Ram and Mrs Ram would not be protected otherwise. I also accepted the testimony given by Braj (who mediated the dispute together with Kalpana) that the MOU was intended to be legally binding.

Both came about because of disputes between Ram/Mrs Ram and Navin. Both were entered into to resolve these disputes. Navin accepted that the 2015 Deed was legally binding but claimed that the MOU was not.

At the second step, the court considers whether it is necessary in the business or commercial sense to imply a term in order to give the contract efficacy. Finally, the court considers whether the specific term to be implied is one which the parties, having regard to the need for business efficacy, would have responded “Oh, of course!” had the proposed term been put to them at the time of the contract.

</div> However, that was no reason for Ram to walk around the house in his underwear when Mrs Navin was around.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) On 17 May 2016, Ram kicked at Navin’s car (which was parked in the driveway) and/or the domestic helper. According to Ram, his elder brother and sister-in-law could not leave after their visit, because neither Mrs Navin nor the domestic helpers wanted to unlock the main gate. One of the domestic helpers, one Ms Sunanda, subsequently “grudgingly unlocked the gate using a remote control”. Ram claimed that as he was walking out to apologise to his guests, Sunanda “inexplicably opened the door of one of the cars which blocked” Ram’s way.

</div> However, the CCTV recording merely showed Sunanda opening the car door and looking for something in the car. Ram was nowhere near at this time. Just as she was done, Ram walked up to the car and kicked the car and/or Sunanda. Suannda tried to move away but Ram continued behaving aggressively towards her. The CCTV recording was clear proof that Ram’s allegation was pure fabrication. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) On the same day, Ram kicked the door to Navin’s room. Navin was apparently not home at the time. Mrs Navin locked herself in the guestroom, with her son. Ram started banging and violently kicking the door to the guestroom, all the while hurling verbal abuse.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) On 31 July 2016, Ram reacted to something that Navin said by pulling down his pants and exposing himself to Navin in the presence of Navin’s wife and son. Ram claimed that Navin had told him “I will f--- you”. Navin denied this. There was no voice recording. However, Ram’s behaviour was simply inexcusable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The CCTV recordings confirmed Ram’s propensity towards violent behaviour and verbal abuse whilst living at the Poole Road property. It was clear to me that Ram had, by his conduct, breached the Implied Term and that Navin was fully entitled to revoke Ram’s licence to stay at the Poole Road property. Navin and his family cannot be expected to have to put up with Ram’s behaviour at the Poole Road property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 As for Mrs Ram, it was clear that she had not breached the Implied Term; neither was it alleged that she had breached the Implied Term. Navin had not prohibited her from staying at the Poole Road property either. Mrs Ram did not want to return to the Poole Road property after both Ram and she were arrested by the police on 1 August 2016. In her AEIC, she disowned Navin. It was Mrs Ram’s own decision not to continue staying at the Poole Road property. On the evidence before me, I was compelled to find that Navin did not breach the contractual licence where Mrs Ram was concerned.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Estoppel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Ram pleaded that Navin was estopped from denying the life interest or revoking Ram’s and Mrs Ram’s licence to reside at the Poole Road property.

</div> As pleaded, the estoppel was based on the common understanding as to the alleged life interest. Since I found that there was no common understanding, the estoppel plea failed. In any event, the estoppel plea did not assist Ram’s case. If Ram succeeded in establishing the common understanding, that would give rise to an irrevocable right to stay at the Poole Road property and the estoppel plea would have been unnecessary. On the other hand, if Ram failed to establish the common understanding, the estoppel plea would likewise fail.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Remedial constructive trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 I dismissed Ram’s and Mrs Ram’s claims for a declaration that Navin holds the Poole Road property on remedial constructive trust for them.

In fact, in his oral testimony, Ram confirmed that the only claim he was making with respect to the Poole Road property was a right to stay and nothing more.

</div> I did not think that the calls to the police showed a conspiracy to constructively evict Ram/Mrs Ram.

</div> According to Navin, Mrs Ram, being the dutiful wife, followed Ram to the police station. Ram and Mrs Ram disputed Navin’s evidence and produced evidence that showed that both of them were charged with criminal trespass. . The reason for the arrest was not clear and regardless of the reason, one might wonder how Navin could have left Ram, and in particular Mrs Ram, to spend the night in the police lock-up. It was one thing to call the police to tell Ram to leave the premises; it was altogether a different thing to let Ram and Mrs Ram spend the night in the police lock-up without trying to have them released on bail. Nevertheless, I did not think that this incident therefore meant that there was a conspiracy to constructively evict them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 I therefore dismissed the claim for conspiracy to injure. Ram/Mrs Ram had not proved that there was an agreement between Navin and Mrs Navin to carry out the alleged acts with a view to constructively evict them from the Poole Road property.

In the circumstances of this company, I did not think it mattered that much whether the shareholders received their returns by way of directors’ fees or dividends. In my view, Ram had no cause for complaint, at least while he remained a director. Following Ram’s removal as a director in 2016, payment of dividends would become more important.

I rejected Navin’s spurious claim. The meaning of the words in the email was plain. Rajesh was writing to Navin. If he had meant that the US$150,000 was for Navin’s account, he would surely have said “your account” or even “Navin’s account”. Navin could not give a credible explanation for his tortured interpretation which flew in the face of the plain meaning of the words used.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 Next, even if the US$1.04m came from the Rajesh Remittances, Navin still had to prove that only US$200,000 belonged to Ram.

</div> In my view, Navin’s submission involved an impossible leap in logic. The 4 November Email expressly state that US$200,000 was for Ram’s account because the same email had a reference to a second amount of US$150,000 that was for Rajesh’s own account.  The fact that other remittances to Ram’s account did not expressly state that they were for Ram’s account did not mean that therefore the moneys were not Ram’s. Further, the 4 November Email did not prove that US$840,000 belonged to Navin. The US$150,000 mentioned in that email belonged to Rajesh, not Navin. In any case, there was no reason why the funds had to be remitted to Ram’s account if they in fact belonged to Navin.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 At the end of the day, the fact remained that Navin bore the burden of proving his claim that some US$840,000 in fact belonged to him. Navin clearly failed to discharge his burden of proof. I concluded therefore that the whole amount of US$1.04m that was invested in the bonds was to count as Ram’s contribution.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Transfer of US$847,396.14 from Mrs Navin’s SBI accounts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 It was not disputed that the sum of US$847,396.14 transferred from Mrs Navin’ SBI account included US$450,000 and US$100,760.52 that were transferred from Ram’s account to Mrs Navin’s SBI account.

However, the payment of US$1.962m to Mrs Ram was more consistent with it being a sale than a mere power of attorney to vote. Mrs Ram’s pleaded case was that the payment was a transfer of half of the sale proceeds of the Bonds.
