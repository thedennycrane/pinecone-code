<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, Mr Ramalingam Ravinthran,
                    was convicted by Kan Ting Chiu J (“the trial judge”) of two
                    capital charges relating to drug trafficking under s 5(1)(a) read with
                    s 33 and the Second Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev
                    Ed). His appeal against the trial judge’s decision was dismissed by the
                    Court of Appeal. He instituted Originating Summons No 234 of 2011 (“the
                    OS”) under O 53 of the Rules of Court for leave to apply for the
                    following orders:</p>

                            order”).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 13 June 2006, the plaintiff, who had a sports
                    bag (“the bag”) in his car which contained eight blocks of
                    vegetable material wrapped in aluminium foil, was arrested by officers of the
                    Central Narcotics Bureau. An analysis of the eight blocks revealed that they
                    contained 5560.1g of cannabis and 2078.3g of cannabis mixture. One Sundar
                    Arujunan (“Sundar”), who had been in the car together with the
                    plaintiff just before the latter’s arrest, was arrested on the same
                    day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Initially, both Sundar and the plaintiff faced
                    capital charges in relation to the drugs found in the bag. Subsequently, the
                    charges against Sundar were reduced to non-capital charges and he pleaded guilty
                    to the non-capital charges. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 20 years and 24
                    strokes of the cane. On the other hand, the plaintiff, who continued to face
                    capital charges, was convicted by the trial judge. His appeal to the Court of
                    Appeal (in Criminal Appeal No 28 of 2009) was dismissed on 7 September
                    2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Following the dismissal of his appeal by the
                    Court of Appeal, the plaintiff instituted the present proceedings for judicial
                    review. Mr M Ravi, the plaintiff’s present counsel, argued that there
                    was room for judicial review because Arts 9 and 12 of the Constitution of the
                    Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (“the
                    Constitution”) were violated when capital charges were preferred against
                    the plaintiff but not against Sundar. The Attorney-General opposed the
                    plaintiff’s application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In <em>Chan Hiang Leng Colin
                        &amp; others v Minister for Information and the Arts</em> [1996]
                    1 SLR(R) 294, Karthigesu JA stated (at [25]) that what is required for leave to be
                    granted for judicial review “is not a <em>prima
                        facie</em> case, but a <em>prima facie</em> case
                    of reasonable suspicion”. When endorsing this relatively low threshold in
                        <em>Public Service Commission v Lai Swee Lin Linda</em>
                    [2001] 1 SLR(R) 133, the Court of Appeal stated (at [22]) that “leave would be granted if
                    there appears to be a point which might, on further consideration, turn out to
                    be an arguable case in favour of granting to the applicant the relief
                    claimed”. In appropriate cases, it may be preferable not to have a
                    hearing of the application for leave followed by another hearing regarding the
                    merits of the case should leave be granted: see, for instance, <em>Yong Vui Kong v Attorney-General</em> [2011]
                    1 SLR 1. In the present case, both parties agreed that the application
                    for leave as well as the merits of the application for the orders in question
                    should be heard together. This was a sensible approach to take as the main issue
                    before the court concerns the interpretation of provisions of the Constitution.
                    Apart from the fact that all the evidence was before the court, there was no
                    dispute of fact and only pure questions of law had to be
                considered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Withdrawal of the application for a quashing order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       At the outset, it ought to be noted that the OS
                    was misconceived as it sought to have a High Court judge quash a decision of
                    another High Court Judge. Furthermore, the OS made no reference whatsoever to
                    the decision of the Court of Appeal which affirmed the trial judge’s
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In <em>Re Racal Communications
                        Ltd</em> [1981] 1 AC 374 (“<em>Re
                        Racal</em>”), Lord Diplock reiterated (at p 384 F-G) that
                    judicial review is available as a remedy for mistakes of law made by inferior
                    courts and tribunals only, and added that mistakes of law made by judges of the
                    High Court acting in their capacity as such can be corrected only by means of an
                    appeal to an appellate court. Furthermore, as the trial judge’s decision
                    was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, what the plaintiff should have done was to
                    apply to the Court of Appeal for a hearing of his arguments on the alleged
                    breach of Arts 9 and 12(1) of the Constitution instead of instituting this OS in
                    the High Court. Relying on <em>Re Racal</em>, Mr Aedit
                    Abdullah, who appeared for the Attorney-General, submitted that the
                    plaintiff’s application was so fundamentally flawed that it must be
                    dismissed. After considering the Attorney-General’s submission, the
                    plaintiff’s counsel, Mr M Ravi, withdrew his client’s
                    application for an order to quash the trial judge’s decision at the
                    hearing of the OS on 13 May 2011. He then informed the court that his
                    client would only be applying for the prohibition order against the Director of
                    Prisons and the mandatory order against the Attorney-General.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The application for the other orders</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       By seeking a prohibition order against the
                    Director of Prisons and a mandatory order against the Attorney-General, the
                    plaintiff was in fact inviting the High Court to completely ignore the effect of
                    the decision of the trial judge as well as that of the Court of Appeal which
                    affirmed the trial judge’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Director of Prisons is required to enforce
                    the sentence meted out by the trial judge and upheld by the Court of Appeal
                    unless that sentence has been set aside. Indeed, the Director of Prisons does
                    not exercise any discretion that can be the subject matter of judicial review.
                    As the decisions of the trial judge and that of the Court of Appeal have not
                    been set aside, it follows that the application for the prohibition order
                    against the Director of Prisons was misconceived and cannot
                succeed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     As for the application for the mandatory order
                    against the Attorney-General, apart from the fact that the Attorney-General
                    cannot be ordered by the High Court to exercise his discretion in a particular
                    way (see paras <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>-<a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> <em>infra</em>), surely the Attorney-General cannot be
                    expected to prefer different charges against the plaintiff unless the
                    latter’s conviction and sentence have been set aside. As such, the
                    application for the mandatory order against the Attorney-General is also
                    misconceived and cannot succeed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     I thus hold that the plaintiff’s
                    application for the prohibition order against the Director of Prisons and the
                    mandatory order against the Attorney-General is so fundamentally flawed that it
                    must be dismissed. Mr Aedit Abdullah rightly pointed out that as the
                    plaintiff’s ultimate objective was to set aside his conviction and
                    sentence, both of which were upheld by the Court of Appeal, the latter should
                    have applied to the Court of Appeal for leave to file a motion to re-open the
                    case for his concerns to be considered: see <em>Koh Zhan Quan
                        Tony v PP and another motion</em> [2006]
                    2 SLR(R) 830.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Equal protection of the law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In view of the gravity of the issue before the
                    court, the plaintiff’s arguments regarding his constitutional rights will,
                    for the sake of completeness, also be considered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It is quite clear from previous decisions of
                    the Court of Appeal, which bind the High Court, that the plaintiff’s case
                    relating to the alleged breach of his constitutional rights cannot get off the
                    ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In the present proceedings, the plaintiff
                    relied on Arts 9 and 12(1) of the Constitution. Art 9 provides that no
                    person “shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in
                    accordance with law”. In attempting to establish that the preferring of
                    capital charges against him was not in accordance with the law as required by
                    Art 9, the plaintiff relied on Art 12(1), which provides that all
                    persons “are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of
                    the law”. He asserted that the decision to prefer capital charges against
                    him when Sundar was charged with non-capital offences is a denial of his right
                    to equality and the equal protection of the law. He added that this decision is
                    irrational and smacks of “<em>Wednesbury</em>
                    unreasonableness” (see <em>Associated Provincial Picture
                        Houses</em>, <em>Limited v Wednesbury
                        Corporation</em> [1948] 1 KB 223).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Art 12(1) of the Constitution must be read
                    together with Art 35(8) of the Constitution, which outlines the role of the
                    Attorney-General as the nation’s Public Prosecutor. Art 35(8)
                    provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Attorney-General shall have power, exercisable at his discretion, to
                        institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In <em>Law Society of Singapore
                        v Tan Guat Neo Phyllis</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 239
                        (“<em>Phyllis Tan</em>”), Chan Sek
                    Keong CJ explained the effect of Art 35(8) of the Constitution (at
                    [145]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In relation to public prosecutions, Art 35(8) makes it clear that the
                        institution, conduct or discontinuance of any criminal proceedings is a
                        matter for only the Attorney-General to decide. This means that <em>except for unconstitutionality</em>, the Attorney-General
                        has an <em>unfettered discretion</em> as to when and
                        how he exercises his prosecutorial powers.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[original emphasis omitted; emphasis added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     There are good reasons why, except in cases of
                    unconstitutionality, the courts should defer to the decision of the
                    Attorney-General on the institution, conduct or discontinuance of proceedings
                    for any offence. In <em>US v Christopher Lee Armstrong et
                        al</em> (1996) 517 US 456, the United States Supreme Court
                    explained:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Judicial deference to the decisions of these executive officers rests in
                        part on an assessment of the relative competence of prosecutors and courts.
                        Such factors as the strength of the case, the prosecution’s general
                        deterrence value, the Government’s enforcement priorities, and the
                        case’s relationship to the Government’s overall enforcement plan
                        are not readily susceptible to the kind of analysis the courts are competent
                        to undertake.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Admittedly, Chan CJ stated in <em>Phyllis Tan</em> (at [149]) that judicial review of the
                    Attorney-General’s exercise of prosecutorial discretion is not totally
                    excluded. However, it is crucial to note that Chan CJ added that the possibility
                    of judicial review only arises in two situations. First, there is room for
                    judicial review where prosecutorial discretion is abused in the sense that it is
                    exercised in bad faith for an extraneous purpose. The second situation is where
                    the exercise of prosecutorial discretion results in a contravention of
                    constitutional protection and rights, such as where an accused is deprived of
                    his right to equality under the law and the equal protection of the law under
                    Art 12(1) of the Constitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The plaintiff did not allege that
                    prosecutorial discretion was exercised in bad faith in the sense that it was
                    exercised for an extraneous purpose against him. As such, the first ground for
                    judicial review of the exercise of prosecutorial discretion need not be further
                    considered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In regard to the second ground for judicial
                    review of the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, namely a breach of
                    Art 12(1) of the Constitution, two decisions of the Court of Appeal which
                    considered the ambit of Art 12(1) in the context of Art 35(8) of the
                    Constitution may be referred to. To begin with, in <em>Sim Min
                        Teck v Public Prosecutor</em> [1987] SLR(R) 65
                        (“<em>Sim Min Teck</em>”), the appellant
                    was convicted on two charges that in furtherance of a common intention he, with
                    two other persons, committed murder by causing the deaths of two persons. He was
                    sentenced to death. However, his accomplice, Beh Meng Chai
                    (“Beh”), was only charged with culpable homicide not amounting to
                    murder. One of the grounds relied upon by the appellant in his appeal was that
                    he had been discriminated against in violation of Art 12(1) of the
                    Constitution because Beh had been charged with a lesser offence on the same
                    facts. The Court of Appeal accepted that there was overwhelming evidence that
                    the appellant, Beh and a third accomplice had fatally stabbed both deceased with
                    knives in circumstances which amounted to murder by one or more of them, and
                    that the stab wounds were inflicted in furtherance of their common intention to
                    commit armed robbery and if necessary to use the knives with which they were
                    armed. However, the court found that Art 12(1) had not been infringed. Wee
                    Chong Jin CJ endorsed the following words of Lord Diplock in <em>Teh Cheng Poh v Public Prosecutor</em> [1979] 1 MLJ 50 at
                    p 56 (‘<em>Teh Cheng Poh</em>”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There are many factors which a prosecuting authority may properly take
                        into account in exercising its discretion as to whether to charge a person
                        at all, or, where the information available to it discloses the ingredients
                        of a greater as well as a lesser offence, as to whether to charge the
                        accused with the greater or the lesser. The existence of those factors to
                        which the prosecuting authority may properly have regard and the relative
                        weight to be attached to each of them may vary enormously between one case
                        and another. All that equality before the law requires, is that the cases of
                        all potential defendants to criminal charges shall be given unbiased
                        consideration by the prosecuting authority and that decisions whether or not
                        to prosecute in a particular case for a particular offence should not be
                        dictated by some irrelevant consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Wee CJ explained (at [9]) why the Court of Appeal found that
                    Art 12(1) had not been infringed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]t was contended on behalf of the appellant that because Beh had been
                        charged on the same facts with the lesser offence, the appellant had been
                        discriminated against contrary to Art 12(1) of the Constitution of the
                        Republic of Singapore which states that "All persons are equal before the
                        law and entitled to the equal protection of the law". We rejected this
                        contention. The Attorney-General of Singapore is by Art 35(8) of the
                        Constitution given power, exercisable at his discretion to institute,
                        conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The decision in <em>Sim Min
                        Teck</em> was followed by the Court of Appeal in <em>Thiruselvam s/o Nagaratnam v Public Prosecutor</em> [2001]
                    1 SLR(R) 362 (“<em>Thiruselvam</em>”). In this case, the appellant was charged with
                    abetting one Katheraven s/o Gopal ("Katheraven") in committing the offence of
                    trafficking in 807.6g of cannabis. He was found guilty of this capital charge.
                    Katheraven was only charged with trafficking in a smaller quantity of drugs and
                    was convicted of this non-capital charge. The appellant contended that his right
                    of equality before the law had been infringed as the main offender had been
                    convicted of a lesser charge while he, who abetted the main offender, faced a
                    capital charge. This argument was rejected by the Court of Appeal. L P
                    Thean JA, who delivered the judgment of the court, explained (at
                    [32]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is true that in <em>Sim Min Teck …</em> the
                        accused was one of the main offenders and the accomplice played a lesser
                        role in the commission of the offence of murder. In the instant case, the
                        position is the reverse: the appellant was only an abettor of Katheraven,
                        the person who committed the main offence. To that extent, this case is
                        slightly different from <em>Sim Min Teck</em>. However,
                        this difference is immaterial and does not detract from the weight of that
                        authority. The principle remains the same. The Prosecution has a wide
                        discretion to determine what charge or charges should be preferred against
                        any particular offender, and to proceed on charges of different severity as
                        between different participants of the same criminal acts. In this case, it
                        has a discretion to choose between preferring a charge against the appellant
                        for abetment of trafficking in a quantity which carries the capital
                        punishment and preferring one for abetment of trafficking in a quantity
                        which does not. In our judgment, there was no breach of Art 12 of the
                        Constitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It is also worth noting that in <em>Sinniah Pillay v Public Prosecutor</em> [1991]
                    2 SLR(R) 704, the appellant was convicted of conspiracy and abetment
                    to commit grievous hurt by means of a corrosive substance under s 326 of
                    the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) while his co-conspirators were charged for
                    abetment and conspiracy to commit an offence under the Corrosive and Explosive
                    Substances and Offensive Weapons Act (Cap 65, 1985 Rev Ed). The Court of Appeal,
                    noting that the appellant and his co-conspirators had been charged under
                    different statutes, pointed out (at [24]) that it was not unusual to find that a given set of facts can
                    give rise to a number of different charges and that it was the prerogative of
                    the prosecution to decide which charge it would prefer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In <em>Mah Kah Yew v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1968-1970] SLR(R) 851, Wee Chong Jin CJ,
                    who stated that the doctrine of <em>stare decisis</em> is a
                    necessary and well established doctrine in our system of jurisprudence and of
                    our judicial system, reiterated (at [15]) that decisions of the Court of Appeal bind the High Court.
                    This view was also reiterated by the Court of Appeal in <em>Wong
                        Hong Toy and another v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [1987] SLR(R) 213 (at [27]-[28]). No attempt was made to distinguish the present case from
                        <em>Sim Min Teck</em> and <em>Thiruselvam</em>. Instead, Mr M Ravi argued that the Court of
                    Appeal had in those two cases misread Lord Diplock’s view in <em>Teh Cheng Poh</em> and that those two decisions can no longer
                    be considered good law in the light of <em>Phyllis
                    Tan</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Chan CJ’s observation in <em>Phyllis Tan</em> that the Attorney-General’s
                    prosecutorial discretion is subject to judicial review where Art 12(1) of
                    the Constitution has been breached does not conflict with the earlier decisions
                    of the Court of Appeal in <em>Sim Min Teck</em> and
                        <em>Thiruselvam</em>. What the Court of Appeal held in
                    those two earlier cases was that Art 12(1) had not been breached in the
                    circumstances of those cases. As the circumstances in the present case cannot be
                    distinguished from those in <em>Sim Min Teck</em> and
                        <em>Thiruselvam</em>, the issue of equal protection
                    under the law need not be further considered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion and costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     For the reasons stated, I dismiss the
                    plaintiff’s application for the prohibition order against the Director of
                    Prisons and the mandatory order against the Attorney-General. Indeed, had the
                    hearing been confined to the application for leave, I would not have granted the
                    leave sought.</p>
