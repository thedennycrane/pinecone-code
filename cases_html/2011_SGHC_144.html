<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case concerns a very bitter dispute between
                    employers and two of their former key employees, one in Singapore and the other
                    in Malaysia. According to the plaintiffs, this is a story of the
                    defendants’ pride, revenge, greed and conspiracy. The defendants readily
                    agreed that there was a conspiracy, but to them the conspirators were the
                    plaintiffs themselves and some of their senior employees who sought to use them
                    as scapegoats for the low morale of the plaintiffs’ staff and poor sales
                    in Malaysia caused by mismanagement. The dispute spawned numerous causes of
                    action, including solicitation of staff, unlawful interference with trade,
                    spreading of malicious falsehoods, defamation and breach of the duty of
                    confidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       A secret tape recording that revealed no
                    secrets, statutory declarations allegedly sworn before a Commissioner for Oaths
                    who was not present, astounding admissions by the plaintiffs’ top
                    management and unexpected withdrawals of very serious allegations made in
                    affidavits peppered a long trial that lasted more than 13 weeks. There were 55
                    witnesses, 16 volumes of affidavits of evidence-in-chief (“AEICs”)
                    and 9,772 pages of documents in the Agreed Bundles. The evidence could not have
                    been more contrasting. Whether a lunch that was crucial to the plaintiffs’
                    case on solicitation was a jolly and enjoyable occasion to celebrate a birthday
                    or a secret tense gathering with threats made to harm the attendees was the
                    subject of intense debate. Whether or not there was a birthday cake and a
                    “happy birthday” song at the said lunch was also disputed. This
                    led one counsel to accuse the other side’s witness of hallucinating at the
                    lunch.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The 1<sup>st</sup> to
                        4<sup>th</sup> plaintiffs are companies within the Walton
                    group. The 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiff, Walton International Group
                    (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Walton Singapore”), and the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> plaintiff, Walton International Group (M) Sdn
                    Bhd (“Walton Malaysia”), market Walton’s landbanking
                    products in Singapore and Malaysia respectively. The
                        3<sup>rd</sup> plaintiff, Walton International Group (USA)
                    Inc, markets Walton’s landbanking products in the USA. The
                        4<sup>th</sup> plaintiff, Walton International Group Inc, a
                    Canadian company (“Walton Canada”), serves as the headquarters of
                    the Walton group. The 5<sup>th</sup> plaintiff, Mr William
                    Kevin Doherty (“Mr Doherty”), is the President and Chief
                    Executive Officer of the Walton group.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant,
                    Mr Winston Yau Kwok Seng (“Mr Yau”), Walton
                    Singapore’s former Executive Vice-President, Asia, was responsible for the
                    operations of the Walton group in Asia before he resigned on 17 January 2008. He
                    was paid around US$5 million per annum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant,
                    Mr James Iseli (“Mr Iseli”), was Walton Malaysia’s
                    Vice-President, Sales before he left that company on 5 May 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The plaintiffs are in the business of
                    landbanking. Their business involves the purchase of large tracts of
                    strategically located agricultural or undeveloped land near or within the city
                    limits of various North American cities in anticipation of their future
                    development. The plaintiffs’ clients may purchase direct undivided
                    interests in the land and become tenants in common of the entire tract of land
                    with other purchasers. They may also purchase securities in the form of shares
                    in companies or limited partnerships formed to purchase and hold the land. When
                    urban development encroaches upon the said properties, the properties are sold,
                    usually to a developer, and clients who have invested in the said properties
                    receive a return on their investments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiffs’ sales and marketing
                    operations in Asia are carried out principally from offices in Singapore,
                    Malaysia and Hong Kong. Walton Singapore was incorporated in 1998 and it was
                    formerly the headquarters for Asian operations. However, since 2008, each of the
                    Walton subsidiaries in Asia has had its own Managing Director and administrative
                    infrastructure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The plaintiffs recruit individuals with the
                    requisite skills to build up and retain a clientele interested in their
                    landbanking products. Their staff are provided with education and training with
                    respect to the detailed characteristics and advantages of Walton’s
                    products as investments. The plaintiffs’ ability to successfully market
                    Walton’s products is thus largely dependent on the services and loyalty of
                    their sales staff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Mr Yau, a former real estate agent, joined
                    Walton Singapore as a junior landbanking consultant in May 1996. He rose quickly
                    from the ranks. By 1998, he had become the Regional Sales Manager.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In 2001, Mr Yau collaborated with a real
                    estate company, Multimatch Properties Pte Ltd (“Multimatch”),
                    which was helmed by his friend, Mr Dirk Foo. Multimatch, which was paid a
                    fee for selling Walton’s products, became the primary source of Walton
                    Singapore’s sales revenue. Mr Yau managed to persuade Mr Dirk
                    Foo to wind up Multimatch and bring his experienced sales team, including
                    Mr Iseli and Ms Sharon Loh Pui Pui (“Ms Loh”), to
                    Walton Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     According to Mr Doherty, Mr Dirk Foo
                    revolutionised the organisation of the Walton Singapore’s sales department
                    by implementing a four-tiered structure with Division Managers at the top,
                    followed by Group Managers, Team Managers and Consultants. While Consultants
                    were paid a commission on their sales, Team Managers earned commissions on the
                    sales of all the Consultants in their teams. Group Managers had an overriding
                    commission on the sales made by all the Team Managers and Consultants in their
                    group. Finally, Division Managers were entitled to a commission on their own
                    sales and an override on commissions earned by all the members of their teams.
                    At the material time, Walton Singapore had 5 Division Managers, 10 Group
                    Managers, 100 Team Managers and between 300 to 400 Consultants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In August 2002, Mr Yau was appointed a
                    director of Walton Singapore. He was also put in charge of Walton Hong Kong.
                    When Walton Malaysia was incorporated in 2002, he was appointed its director, a
                    post he retained until 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In 2003, Mr Yau became the Senior
                    Vice-President of Asia-Pacific and Mr Dirk Foo was appointed the
                    Vice-President, Sales.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Apart from being the President of Operations
                    in Walton Asia, Mr Yau was appointed a member of Walton Canada’s
                    executive management team. In his AEIC, Mr Yau explained (at paras 31
                    – 33) his various roles:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">31</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">As the EVP of Walton Asia, my scope of duties
                            included laying the foundation for the Walton entities in Asia,
                            networking and building up the Asian clientele and introducing the
                            concept of landbanking, which was new and foreign to the Asian market at
                            the material time.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">32</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">As the President of Operations in Walton Asia, I
                            was also in charge of the operations of the Walton companies including
                            the management of the Managers and sales staff in Walton Asia. However,
                            for each of the regional offices, they would have their own key
                            personnel to run the respective offices as separate
                        entities.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">33</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">As a member of the Executive Management team of
                            Walton Canada, I was part of the team responsible for formulating and
                            implementing the worldwide business and marketing plans and strategies
                            of the Walton Group. I am the only representative from the Asia Pacific
                            region on the Executive Management team.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     According to Mr Yau, he and his
                    right-hand man, Mr Dirk Foo, who became the Executive Vice-President of
                    Sales of Walton Asia in 2006, developed the plaintiffs’ Asian network and
                    clientele over the years. He pointed out that from a nominal turnover in 1996,
                    Walton Asia’s turnover reached CAD$200m in January 2008. He added that
                    sales in Asia accounted for more than 50% of the worldwide sales revenue of the
                    Walton group.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In 2005, a Corporate Sales Division was set up
                    in Walton Singapore and Walton Malaysia to cater for “corporate”
                    sales. According to Mr Doherty, one of the best ways to increase sales was
                    to obtain referrals from independent financial advisory companies
                        (“IFAs”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>
                    IFAs would introduce Walton’s products as a potential investment to their
                    own clients and refer interested clients to Walton Singapore or Walton Malaysia.
                    Such corporate sales through IFAs gave the plaintiffs’ staff access to a
                    larger pool of investors. Furthermore, manpower costs were reduced as much fewer
                    staff would be required to sell Walton’s products through
                IFAs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The sale of Walton’s products through
                    IFAs proved to be quite successful in Hong Kong but the strength of Walton Hong
                    Kong’s retail sales staff was significantly pared down. As such, the
                    thought of having more corporate sales through IFAs made some retail sales staff
                    in Singapore and Malaysia uneasy about their future. Mr Doherty alleged
                    that Mr Yau did not describe the benefits of the IFA channels to the retail
                    staff and that was why this new channel of sales was seen as a threat to them.
                    On the other hand, Mr Yau pointed out that the corporate and retail sales
                    teams were after the pie.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Apparently, the disquiet in the retail sales
                    divisions in Singapore and Malaysia about increasing the profile of corporate
                    sales may have been partly fuelled by the plaintiffs’ own policies. In
                    February 2007, a new commission structure for corporate sales favoured corporate
                    sales to such an extent that retail sales staff became unhappy. It did not help
                    that at a company retreat at Scottsdale, Arizona (the “Scottsdale
                    retreat”) from 30 April to 4 May 2007, a key expatriate in the Singapore
                    office, Mr Glen Pickard (“Mr Pickard”), who was in
                    charge of corporate sales, stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We have too many agents in Singapore and Malaysia and there is a need to
                        cut down the numbers to increase the commitment and calibre of
                        people.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">....</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Plan: Take the <em>Canadian
                                model</em> to Asia.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Canadian model involved corporate sales
                    and required substantially less manpower than the retail sales model in
                    Singapore and Malaysia. According to Mr Yau, Walton Canada had only around
                    40 personnel at the material time whereas Walton Singapore’s retail sales
                    force had more than 400 sales staff during the corresponding
                period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Both Mr Yau and Mr Dirk Foo urged
                    the plaintiffs to take steps to boost the morale of the retail sales staff.
                    However, in 2007, Mr Dirk Foo, who was previously in charge of both retail
                    and corporate sales, saw his corporate sales portfolio taken away from him.
                    Mr Yau was unhappy with what he perceived to be a demotion of his
                    right-hand man.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Mr Doherty, who became disenchanted with
                    Mr Dirk Foo’s performance, told Mr Yau in November 2007 that he
                    would fly to Singapore to personally sack Mr Dirk Foo if the latter did not
                    leave. Mr Dirk Foo agreed to resign in December 2007 and Mr Doherty
                    praised him for his contributions to the company when his resignation was
                    announced at “Walton Vision”, an event in Singapore on
                    18 January 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Mr Yau was rather shaken by the departure
                    of Mr Dirk Foo, whom some regarded as the “champion” of
                    retail sales. He claimed that the ousting of Mr Dirk Foo reinforced his
                    belief that Mr Doherty intended to corporatise the Asian operations and
                    implement the Canadian model of corporate sales. On 15 January 2008, he
                    tendered his resignation and his employment ceased on 17 January
                    2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Before leaving, Mr Yau sent the following
                    farewell e-mail to his staff to exhort them to do their best for the
                    company:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am no longer with Walton starting today, the reason is I need rest time.
                        Working for the [past] 12 years in the Company, and to be fair to me and my
                        family, I need to spend some time with them ….</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Look!!!! I don’t want things to stop, because of me. <em>I want you guys to give the best to Walton, and nothing will
                            stop you</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Guys, <em>this is the only Company will help you to reach
                            your Goals</em>. Unless you want to be the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Mr Doherty testified that
                    Mr Yau’s e-mail was “awesome”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and that the e-mail did not appear to
                    have been drafted by someone bent on destroying the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Despite Mr Yau’s advice to reassure
                    the retail sales staff, Mr Doherty focussed his attention on corporate
                    sales at “Walton Vision” on 18 January 2008, at which the audience
                    was primarily retail sales staff. It was announced that the retail and corporate
                    departments of Walton Singapore would be merged and that Ms Loh had been
                    promoted to Vice-President Sales in Walton Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In February 2008, the retail and corporate
                    sales departments of Walton Malaysia were merged. Mr Iseli was promoted to
                    Vice-President, Sales of Walton Malaysia. According to him, after the merger,
                    retail sales staff were told to bring in IFAs as clients and this indicated a
                    shift to corporate sales.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The plaintiffs asserted that Mr Yau, who
                    was paid more than US$5m per annum, regretted his decision to leave his job and
                    that the latter planned to return to the Walton group. Mr Doherty, who was
                    obviously not minded to have Mr Yau back, informed the latter on 23 January
                    2008 that if he returned to the company, he would not be offered his old post or
                    any senior executive position. The plaintiffs were convinced that this snub
                    caused Mr Yau to lose face and the latter plotted to harm the plaintiffs by
                    taking over the retail sales staff of Walton Singapore and Walton Malaysia to
                    show Mr Doherty that he was indispensable. Mr Yau denied this
                    allegation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Some two weeks after his resignation,
                    Mr Yau met Walton Singapore’s five top Division Managers (the
                    “Walton Singapore DMs”) at a lunch on 27 January 2008 and at a
                    dinner on 29 January 2008. According to nearly all the attendees at the lunch,
                    they gathered on 27 January 2008 to celebrate Mr Yau’s birthday.
                    Apparently, Mr Yau paid for the lunch and there was a follow-up dinner two
                    days later. At these meals, Mr Yau encouraged the DMs to work hard for
                    Walton Singapore but the other things that were allegedly said by him at the
                    lunch and dinner formed the basis of the plaintiffs’ claim that he
                    solicited the Walton Singapore DMs to leave Walton Singapore and join him
                    in a new business venture. It was not disputed that none of these DMs left
                    to work with Mr Yau.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In May 2008, five of Walton Singapore’s
                    finance staff resigned for personal reasons. None of them were employed by
                    Mr Yau. All the same, Walton Singapore claimed that Mr Yau had
                    solicited them to resign. To Mr Yau, this claim was absolutely
                    ludicrous.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In the meantime, Walton Malaysia’s
                    bosses claimed that they suspected that Mr Iseli, who had just been
                    promoted to the position of Vice-President Sales in February 2008, and some of
                    his associates were conspiring with Mr Yau to undermine the company’s
                    interests. On 3 April 2008, Walton Malaysia’s then Managing Director,
                    Mr Krishnan Murali (“Mr Murali”), e-mailed Walton
                    Asia’s Chief Operating Officer, Mr Kent Britton
                    (“Mr Britton”), stating that his staff had been solicited by
                    Mr Iseli to leave the company. The plaintiffs hastily assembled a
                    high-level team (the “Interborder team”) in early April 2008 to
                    find out what was going on in Walton Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The Interborder team interviewed many of the
                    persons named in Mr Murali’s e-mail, including Mr Iseli, and
                    concluded that there was nothing untoward in Walton Malaysia. Mr Murali was
                    demoted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In early May 2008, Mr Abdul Razak Ghani
                    (“Mr Razak”), who was Mr Iseli’s boss, made up his
                    mind that the latter had to go even though, by his own admission, he had no
                    concrete evidence that the latter had acted against the company’s
                    interest. Mr Iseli was offered a rather generous severance package but with
                    strings attached. He would be paid his full remuneration for 9 months and half
                    his remuneration for the following 9 months provided he agreed to assist the
                    plaintiffs in their suit against Mr Yau. It was made clear to Mr Iseli
                    that he would be sacked <em>and sued</em> if he did not
                    accept the package. Mr Iseli, who believed that Mr Yau had not acted
                    against the plaintiffs’ interests, stated that he could not testify
                    against Mr Yau. On 5 May 2008, Mr Iseli’s employment was
                    terminated. According to the plaintiffs, he resigned but Mr Iseli said that
                    he did not do so. On the very next day, Walton Malaysia commenced proceedings
                    against him in Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     On 13 May 2008, the plaintiffs commenced the
                    present proceedings against Mr Yau in Singapore. On the same day, the
                    plaintiffs applied for an interim order (“the injunction
                    application”) to restrain Mr Yau from, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, soliciting its employees, unlawfully interfering with their
                    trade, disclosing confidential information and defaming them. On 16 May
                    2008, Mr Yau gave an undertaking not to solicit the plaintiffs’ staff
                    and on 29 May 2008, Mr Iseli gave a similar undertaking in Kuala
                    Lumpur.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     On 20 October 2008, the plaintiffs’
                    injunction application was heard by Choo Han Teck J (“Choo J”). By
                    then the application to restrain the solicitation of its staff was irrelevant
                    because the period of restraint under Mr Yau’s contract had expired.
                    After hearing the parties on the other aspects of their injunction application,
                    Choo J dismissed the plaintiffs’ application on 3 November
                    2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In due course, the claims against
                    Mr Iseli in the Malaysian courts were incorporated into the Singapore
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Walton Singapore and Walton Malaysia proceeded
                    to sack or suspend many of their staff. According to the plaintiffs, the staff
                    had been sacked because they were disloyal or had performed poorly. However,
                    Mr Yau and Mr Iseli asserted that they had been sacked for refusing to
                    lie that they had been solicited to leave the plaintiffs. What is clear is that
                    many staff who had refused to file affidavits on behalf of the plaintiffs or who
                    had filed affidavits in favour of the defendants were sacked. On the other hand,
                    many staff who had initially said that there had been nothing untoward in their
                    interaction with Mr Yau and Mr Iseli but had subsequently changed
                    their minds and claimed that they had been solicited to leave the plaintiffs
                    retained their jobs or had their suspension from work removed. Furthermore,
                        <em>all</em> the Walton Singapore DMs who
                    contradicted or retracted much of what they had stated in their AEICs in support
                    of the plaintiffs’ case during the trial have since left the company for
                    reasons which were not disclosed to the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary of the Plaintiffs’ Claims against the
                Defendants</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The plaintiffs’ case is that Mr Yau
                    resigned when Mr Doherty laid the blame on him for causing the Walton group
                    to lose money and that he regretted his decision shortly thereafter. It was
                    alleged that Mr Yau wanted to set up a competing business and pull retail
                    sales staff away from Walton Singapore and Walton Malaysia in order to cripple
                    these companies so that he could negotiate with Mr Doherty from a position
                    of strength. The plaintiffs asserted that Mr Yau spread false malicious
                    rumours to scare their retail sales staff into joining him and that he enlisted
                    the help of Mr Iseli and Ms Loh for this purpose. According to the
                    plaintiffs, Mr Yau and Mr Iseli were cunning and clever and their
                    solicitation was indirect in the form of suggestions, inferences and
                    implications. It was averred that while they failed in Singapore, they succeeded
                    in Malaysia, if only because Walton Malaysia’s profits dipped massively in
                    2008 while Walton Singapore’s profits soared in that year.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In their opening statement, the plaintiffs
                    summarised their claims against Mr Yau as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The plaintiffs claimed that almost immediately
                    after his resignation, Mr Yau, with the assistance of Mr Iseli, met
                    staff of Walton Singapore and Walton Malaysia, either individually or in groups,
                    to solicit them to join a rival business which he had intended to set up. They
                    pointed out that this was in breach of the defendants’ employment
                    contracts, which contained a non-solicitation clause. In Mr Yau’s
                    case, the non-solicitation period was 9 months after leaving the company. In
                    Mr Iseli’s contract, the non-solicitation period was one
                year.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In <em>Hellmann Insurance
                        Brokers v Peterson</em> [2003] NSWSC 242, Campbell J
                    considered the meaning of “solicitation” in the context of a
                    clause prohibiting the solicitation of clients in the following helpful terms
                    (at [11] –
                    [12]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11 The meaning of 'solicitation' is elucidated by a decision
                        of Wood CJ at CL in <em>R v Laws</em> [2000] NSWSC 880
                        (2000) 50 NSWLR 96, at 98. His Honour, at [8] recorded the remarks of Spigelman CJ and Hidden J in
                            <em>R v Azzopardi</em>, 1 October 1998, unreported,
                        which in turn approved remarks of Stout CJ in <em>Sweeney v
                            Astle</em> [1923] NZLR 1198 at 1202 which I quote:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The word 'solicit' is a common English word and it means in a
                            simplified form, 'to ask'. In various English dictionaries this simple
                            meaning is given, but other simple words are also used to explain other
                            meanings it possesses, such as 'to call for', 'to make a request', 'to
                            petition', 'to entreat', 'to persuade', 'to prefer a request'.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading2">12 Whether an employee is soliciting a former
                            client is not something which depends upon whether it is the employee
                            who telephones or arranges to meet the former client, or the other way
                            around. Rather, whether solicitation occurs depends upon the substance
                            of what passes between them once they are in contact with each other.
                            There is solicitation of a client by a former employee if the former
                            employee in substance conveys the message that the former employee is
                            willing to deal with the client and, by whatever means, encourages the
                            client to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Campbell J’s view, which is relevant to
                    the issue of non-solicitation of staff, was endorsed by Belinda Ang J in

                    Ms Indranee Rajah SC (“Ms Rajah”), tried her best to
                    build up a case on solicitation against the defendants. However, her determined
                    effort was completely undermined by many of the plaintiffs’ witnesses,
                    including those who occupied top management positions, who eroded the foundation
                    of their case on solicitation in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Resignation of the five finance staff</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The plaintiffs’ allegation that
                    Mr Yau solicited five of Walton Singapore’s finance staff to resign
                    in May 2008 (“the resignations”) will be considered first, if only
                    to show how the plaintiffs’ own witnesses undermined Ms Rajah’s
                    efforts and demolished their case without any assistance from the defendants.
                    This allegation was pleaded in the Statement of Claim (at para 51):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In early May 2008, five members of [Walton Singapore’s] finance

                    to do with solicitation by Mr Yau. The relevant part of his damning
                    evidence was testified as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The five staff testified that they resigned
                    for personal reasons. Ms Grace Lim said that she was unhappy that her
                    department had not been as well treated as other departments. Ms Liu Zhirui
                    stated that she resigned to pursue a full-time accounting degree. Ms Tan Li
                    Ching testified that she resigned because she had not been promoted. Ms Loh
                    Yee Koon revealed that she resigned in order to babysit her nephews. Finally,
                    Ms Gian Swee Ying made it clear that she left Walton Singapore because of
                    stress.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The evidence of the five staff was not
                    challenged during cross-examination. In fact, three of them were cross-examined
                    for only two minutes while cross-examination of the remaining two staff took not
                    more than 12 minutes each. None of them was asked whether their resignations had
                    anything to do with Mr Yau’s alleged solicitation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Why Walton Singapore instructed its solicitors
                    that the resignations evidenced Mr Yau’s solicitation of its staff
                    when its then Managing Director knew all along that this was untrue cannot be
                    fathomed and this reflected very badly on the plaintiffs. I thus dismiss the
                    plaintiffs’ allegation that Mr Yau had solicited the five finance
                    staff to leave the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The lunch and dinner </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The plaintiffs alleged that at a lunch at Lei
                    Garden Restaurant on 27 January 2008 (“the lunch”) and at a dinner
                    at Tung Lok Seafood Restaurant on 29 January 2008 (“the dinner”),
                    Mr Yau, with the assistance of Mr Iseli and Ms Loh, attempted to
                    solicit Walton Singapore’s five DMs to join a new marketing company
                    that he intended to set up.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The five DMs who were present at the
                    lunch and dinner were ex-DM Chong, DM Yao, DM Ann, DM Ong and Ms Lusi.
                    Ex-DM Chong was sacked on 23 December 2008 for filing an AEIC in support of
                    Mr Yau. As for the other four DMs, Ms Lusi climbed the corporate
                    ladder rather quickly after the lunch and dinner and is now Walton
                    Singapore’s Chief Operating Officer. She was thus the boss of DM Yao, DM
                    Ann and DM Ong when they testified at the trial. However, to their credit, DM
                    Yao, DM Ann and DM Ong did not allow this fact to affect their testimony and
                    they boldly contradicted Ms Lusi on numerous occasions on quite a number of
                    important issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Although the plaintiffs portrayed the lunch as
                    having been organised by Ms Loh to enable Mr Yau to solicit the DMs,
                    it appeared that the lunch, which was intended to celebrate Mr Yau’s
                    birthday, had been a rather jolly affair. DM Ong described the lunch as a
                    “ha ha hee hee” event<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> and DM Yao agreed that it was a
                    “happy” occasion.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> There was ample evidence that
                    there was a birthday cake and a “happy birthday” song for
                    Mr Yau.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     During the lunch, Mr Yau, who was asked
                    about his reasons for resigning, stated his reasons and encouraged the
                    DMs to work hard for Walton Singapore. Ms Loh testified<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>[Mr Yau] wasn’t trying to solicit, he
                            wasn’t trying to market landbanking,

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[It]s a farewell, it’s a birthday lunch, ... and everybody [was]

                        let’s move on ….”
                        <em>And he even [told] to us to work hard [for] Walton and

                            maintained</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Ex-DM Chong also referred to
                    Mr Yau’s encouragement. She stated in her AEIC (at para 15):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Mr Yau] was truly concerned about us and I remember him telling us
                        words to the effect, “just continue to do what you are doing,
                        don’t be affected by my departure. Don’t worry, <em>you are all doing well, just continue and meet your sales
                            targets. Take good care of your team and make sure they get their sales
                            … income. Don’t embarrass me.” Such words of
                            encouragement were typical from [Mr Yau], who was always spurring
                            us … to do well for the Walton Group</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Two of the plaintiffs’ witnesses also
                    testified that Mr Yau encouraged them to work hard for Walton Singapore. DM
                    Yao said that Mr Yau’s message to them was “[w]hatever
                    happened, ... we should always not jeopardise the sales in

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     DM Ong testified that Mr Yau told them

                    Ms Loh and ex-DM Chong that Mr Yau had solicited the DMs at the
                    lunch and dinner, the plaintiffs might initially have been pleased that four of
                    the DMs at the lunch, namely DM Ann, DM Yao, DM Ong and Ms Lusi had
                    suggested a contrary position in their AEICs. However, when cross-examined, DM
                    Ann, DM Yao and DM Ong did not support the company’s case on solicitation
                    and they contradicted much of what Ms Lusi’s evidence on solicitation
                    at the lunch and dinner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     For a start, although DM Ann had stated in his
                    AEIC (at para 57) that Mr Yau “invited us to be part of this new
                    business”, he testified that the latter had merely made vague and casual
                    remarks about the future and had nothing specific to offer them. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     DM Ong, who had suggested in her AEIC (at
                    paras 51- 52) that Mr Yau had wanted to know if the DMs were going to
                    join him, clarified during cross-examination that the latter had <em>not</em> asked her to leave Walton Singapore to join

                    that she was not thinking of leaving Walton Singapore, she agreed that this was
                    not her response to the latter’s invitation to join his new business. She

                    told Mr Yau that she was happy “regardless of the invitation”
                    but when asked to elaborate, she made the following vague statement:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In my view, the above statement by DM Ong
                    during re-examination did not undermine her clear evidence during
                    cross-examination that she had not been solicited by Mr Yau to leave Walton
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     As for DM Yao, he had claimed in his AEIC (at

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">After dinner, I called Yau on the telephone and told him that there were
                        not enough details for me to make a decision. I said that I was unable to
                        commit to join him in his new venture until I had more information to make a
                        proper decision.</p>

                    Furthermore, when he was referred to DM Ann’s testimony, DM Yao reiterated
                    that Mr Yau did not solicit at the lunch<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> and testified as

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In their closing submissions, the plaintiffs
                    contended that their witnesses had testified that they had not been solicited
                    because they understood “solicitation” in the context of an
                    express offer. I believe that if their DMs had thought that they had been
                    impliedly solicited, they would have said so. After all, the cross-examination
                    of their DMs was not limited to express offers and they were asked about
                    “attempts to solicit”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Ms Lusi’s evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     As the plaintiffs’ case on solicitation
                    at the lunch and dinner was not supported by four of the five DMs who were
                    present at these functions, their case hinged primarily on the evidence of
                    Ms Lusi, who was quite determined to paint a sinister picture of the lunch.
                    Unlike the others who attended the lunch, she said that she could not remember
                    that there had been a birthday cake and a “happy birthday” song
                    for Mr Yau, whose counsel, Mr Tan Chee Meng SC
                    (“Mr Tan”), suggested that she must have been hallucinating
                    at the lunch, a remark she understandably resented.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Unlike other DMs, who thought that the lunch
                    was a rather jolly occasion, Ms Lusi said that it was a
                    “tense” and “secret” lunch. Her evidence was
                    contradicted by her subordinates. DM Ong testified that no one told her to keep
                    the lunch a secret<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> and that it was a “very
                    light-hearted” event, at which they even took photographs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> She added
                    that there was nothing “sinister” about the dinner.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> DM Yao
                    also testified that there was nothing secretive about the occasion,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> and added
                    that the lunch agenda was “totally honourable”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>
                    He also testified that there was “no special agenda” for the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Ms Lusi made numerous allegations with
                    respect to what transpired at the lunch and dinner. The first<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> was that
                    Mr Yau had asked the DMs “who’s in, who’s
                    out” as he wanted to know who was going to leave Walton Singapore to join
                    his new company. Mr Yau did ask “who’s in, who’s
                    out” but, apparently, this was in the context of a joke. Ex-DM Chong
                    explained in her AEIC (at para 24):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I knew [Mr Yau] always had an interest in the entertainment industry
                        and that he knew the people at Fly Entertainment. I <em>jokingly asked</em> if I could invest in this new business idea
                        of his so that I can <em>go into early retirement</em>.
                        He said “of course” in jest to humour me. The banter continued
                        and I remember teasing him that if my “investment” pulled
                        through, he as my former boss, would then have to “work for
                        me”…. He said “Can, no problem, <em>so
                            who’s in who’s out”. It was an ongoing joke between
                            us …. I remember everyone having a good laugh over
                            this</em>.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Ms Loh corroborated ex-DM Chong’s
                    explanation of the context in which the remark “who’s in,
                    who’s out” was made by Mr Yau. The plaintiffs’ witness,
                    DM Yao, also corroborated ex-DM Chong’s version of events as he
                        testified<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> as follows:</p>

                    the incident, she recalled the joke that ex-DM Chong had made about investing in

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     I find that Mr Yau’s
                    “who’s in, who’s out” remark was made in the context
                    of a joke and that this remark did not advance the plaintiffs’ case on
                    solicitation in any way.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Ms Lusi’s next allegation was that
                    Mr Yau had said that he wanted the Walton Singapore’s retail sales
                    staff to join him so that Mr Doherty will be forced to ask him for help and
                    negotiate an agreement with him. She stated in her AEIC (at para 90):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[DM] Jovi Ong, asked [Mr Yau] why he was so confident that Bill would
                        be willing to negotiate with him. [Mr Yau’s] reply was that the
                        sales staff were the instant sales makers. Without the sales staff, Walton
                        Singapore would have problems with cash flow within 2 to 3 months.
                        [Mr Doherty] would have to agree with [Mr Yau’s] demands to
                        sell Walton Products through him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In her AEIC (at paras 55-57), DM Ong appeared
                    to have corroborated Ms Lusi’s allegation that Mr Yau stated
                    that he wanted to recruit Walton Singapore’s sales staff to force
                    Mr Doherty to ask for his help. However, she quickly withdrew these
                    paragraphs from her AEIC when she was cross-examined<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> and
                    testified that she could not remember whether she or anyone else had asked
                    Mr Yau about Mr Doherty’s willingness to negotiate with

                    quite possible that no one had asked Mr Yau this question and that this
                    matter could have been the subject of a private discussion between the Walton
                        DMs themselves.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> How then did such a serious allegation
                    against Mr Yau creep into DM Ong’s AEIC? DM Ong said that she had
                    been told that Ms Lusi remembered the events narrated in her (DM
                    Ong’s) AEIC. It was rather disturbing that her AEIC had been tailored to
                    fit Ms Lusi’s accusation against Mr Yau. Although DM Ong had not
                    been forced to sign her AEIC, she testified that she had “of
                    course” been “a little concerned” that if she refused to
                    file an affidavit for the plaintiffs, her employment contract might be
                        terminated.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> I find that the allegation that Mr Yau
                    had said that he wanted all the Walton Singapore sales staff to join him so that
                    he could negotiate with Mr Doherty was not proven.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Ms Lusi next alleged that Mr Yau
                    threatened the DMs that he would harm their families if they revealed his
                    plans. However, Ms Loh said that this allegation was nonsensical because
                    given the close professional and social relationship that Mr Yau had with
                    them, he would not have threatened them or made any such offensive

                    contradicted Ms Lusi’s allegation that Mr Yau had threatened
                    them. DM Yao testified that Mr Yau did not make such a threat<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> while DM
                    Ong testified that she could not recall an incident like this.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> When
                    re-examined, DM Yao explained<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> what Mr Yau had
                    meant by keeping things “confidential” in a manner which was
                    totally inconsistent with Ms Lusi’s evidence:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">And to keep … what was said during the meeting confidential, in a
                        way it’s also … to say, “<em>Well, I
                            haven’t had anything that is so solid and all that, so let’s
                            not start going out there and announce to the world what I have been

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     I thus dismiss the allegation that Mr Yau

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Mr Britton’s evidence on Ms Lusi’s

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Mr Britton’s evidence on
                    Ms Lusi’s allegations (the “allegations”) against
                    Mr Yau also undermined the plaintiffs’ case on solicitation. When
                    cross-examined, Mr Britton claimed that Ms Lusi had told him in April
                    2008 that at a secret lunch meeting, Mr Yau had said that:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Remarkably, none of these very serious
                    allegations by Ms Lusi were mentioned in Mr Britton’s AEIC.
                    Apart from this, there were far too many other flaws in Mr Britton’s
                    evidence. To begin with, he claimed that he must have informed the
                    plaintiffs’ solicitors about the allegations as early as April 2008. If
                    this is true, it is inexplicable that the allegations, which featured so
                    prominently in the plaintiffs’ case on solicitation, were not pleaded when
                    legal proceedings were commenced against Mr Yau in the following month in
                    May 2008. In fact, the allegations did not surface until the Statement of Claim
                    was amended more than 6 months later! Mr Yau’s counsel, Mr Tan,
                    submitted that the allegations appeared in the pleadings so late in the day
                    because the plaintiffs needed time to fabricate their evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     When questioned about the delayed appearance
                    of the allegations in the plaintiffs’ pleadings, Mr Britton replied
                    most unconvincingly as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Mr Britton finally admitted<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> that he might not have
                    informed his solicitors about the allegations in April 2008. This raises another
                    question as to why he did not do so as these allegations were crucial to the
                    plaintiffs’ case on solicitation in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Mr Britton’s credibility was
                    further dented by his claim in his AEIC and during cross-examination<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> that he
                    had informed Mr Doherty, Mr Knight, Mr Baukol and Mr Foo
                    about the allegations. Mr Doherty testified<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> that he could not recall
                    whether he had been told about Mr Yau’s solicitation at the said
                    lunch and dinner while Mr Baukol testified that he did not know about
                    Ms Lusi’s conversation with Mr Britton about the
                        allegations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> As for Mr Knight, Mr Britton
                    subsequently conceded that he might not have informed the former about the
                    allegations. Finally, Mr Foo testified that Mr Britton did not tell
                    him about the allegations and added that none of his DMs had brought up the
                    matter of solicitation with him in a way “where they could adduce
                    evidence” of this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     It is also noteworthy that the allegations
                    were not mentioned in the plaintiffs’ pleadings in the Malaysian
                    proceedings and in Mr Britton’s AEIC filed for those proceedings on
                    28 May 2008. When asked why he did not inform the Malaysian court about the
                    allegations, Mr Britton was at a total loss and said that he could not give
                    an explanation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Yet another inconsistency about the
                    allegations is that Mr Knight stated in his AEIC (at para 14) that
                    Ms Lusi’s allegations in April 2008 were “general” in
                    nature. However, when cross-examined, he agreed that if Ms Lusi had indeed
                    spoken to Mr Britton in April 2008, she had outlined very clear instances
                    of solicitation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> Furthermore, Mr Knight claimed that when
                    the action was commenced, Ms Lusi told Mr Britton that she was not
                    comfortable about filing an AEIC in support of the plaintiffs’ case.
                    However, she testified that she had been prepared to file an affidavit all along
                    but no one had asked her to do so until much later. Mr Tan suggested that
                    Ms Lusi’s version is closer to the truth as the plaintiffs’
                    former solicitors, Baker &amp; McKenzie (“B &amp; M”), had issued
                    a bill for time spent on preparing an affidavit by one “Luci” in
                    May 2008, long before she filed her AEIC for the present proceedings. He
                    suggested that Ms Lusi’s original AEIC was not filed as it was not
                    “meaty” enough to nail Mr Yau. Ms Lusi, who pointed out
                    that she is not “Luci”, conceded that there was no one called
                    “Luci” in Walton Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> Obviously, B &amp; M must
                    have mis-spelt her name in its bill but Ms Lusi denied having met any
                    lawyer from that law firm at the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Finally, if Ms Lusi had really told
                    Mr Britton about a forthcoming walkout by administrative staff, this did
                    not materialise. The company tried to blame Mr Yau for the resignations of
                    five of their finance staff but as has been mentioned, their boss, Mr Foo,
                    conceded that Mr Yau had nothing to do with their resignations. Besides,
                    this was hardly the walk-out Mr Britton had in mind. Only Ms Lusi
                    continued to doggedly insist without any basis whatsoever that Mr Yau had a
                    hand in the said resignations despite having been told of Mr Foo’s
                    evidence, a stand which eroded her credibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     After considering all the circumstances, I do
                    not believe that Ms Lusi had spoken to Mr Britton in April 2008 about
                    the allegations against Mr Yau regarding the alleged solicitation of Walton
                    Singapore’s DMs at the lunch and dinner. The non-existent
                    conversation undermined the plaintiffs’ case on solicitation in
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Mr Yau had no concrete plans in January 2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     When considering whether or not Mr Yau
                    had solicited Walton Singapore’s DMs at the lunch and dinner, it
                    cannot be overlooked that he had just left the company and had no concrete plans
                    to offer the Walton DMs. Mr Baukol testified<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> that he was informed by
                    DM Ong, DM Yao and DM Ang about Mr Yau’s lack of concrete plans
                    during investigations in June 2008 and that at the lunch and dinner, Mr Yau
                    had merely mentioned his interest in acquiring Fly Entertainment, a
                    comparatively small local artiste management company that represented Asian
                    actors and actresses in the local and regional entertainment scene. This is a
                    business far removed from landbanking. If Mr Yau had wanted to recruit
                    staff for Fly Entertainment, he would not be looking at the plaintiffs’
                    employees, who had no expertise in artiste management.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     In their closing submissions, the plaintiffs
                    claimed that Mr Yau intended to involve their DMs not in Fly
                    Entertainment but in other aspects of his plans. They asserted that his plan was
                    to use a company, Capital Alliance (Group) (“CAG”), which was
                    owned by his friend, Mr Richard Lim Cheong Boon
                    (“Mr Lim”), to market the landbanking products of the
                    plaintiffs’ rival, TSI. They added that Mr Yau had intended to use
                    CAG as his own business vehicle after his short restraint period expired.
                    Whatever may have been Mr Yau’s subsequent plans, we are here
                    concerned with whether or not he had solicited the DMs in January 2008 at
                    the lunch and dinner. There was no evidence that Mr Yau had any plans
                    regarding landbanking in January 2008. Even Ms Lusi agreed in her AEIC (at
                    para 42) that Mr Yau “did not reveal much information about his new
                    marketing company” and that he had been “quite vague” about
                    his plans. When cross-examined, DM Ann stated<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A]ll I recall was that [Mr Yau] mentioned about going to other
                        businesses like marketing opportunities and then he kind of <em>casually</em> said that if people are looking for
                        opportunities <em>in the future</em>, <em>can always look for him</em>. So that was what I
                        recall.</p>

                    Singapore’s then Managing Director, Mr Foo, testified that he had not

                    Mr Yau was in the coal mining business, Mr Foo claimed in his AEIC
                    filed on 23 July 2008 that Mr Yau had announced at the dinner that he
                    (Mr Yau) would be “starting a company essentially selling similar to
                    those offered by the Walton group”. When cross-examined on why he could

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The plaintiffs’ case on
                    Mr Yau’s alleged solicitation of their staff is also incredible
                    because Mr Britton testified that Ms Lusi told him that Mr Yau
                    “was concerned for everybody and as a result of that he wanted to create
                    an opportunity to save everybody”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> One Ms Norzita
                    binti Alpi, a Senior Team Manager of Walton Malaysia, also made a similar
                    allegation about Mr Yau’s desire to save all of Walton
                    Malaysia’s retail sales staff but she abandoned this allegation during
                    cross-examination and admitted that she had fabricated this evidence to advance
                    the plaintiffs’ case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Mr Baukol conceded that it would be very
                    “challenging” for Mr Yau to be able to guarantee the
                    DMs their existing remuneration at Walton Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> There was
                    no evidence that Mr Yau had jobs to offer to the hundreds of retail sales
                    staff in Walton Singapore and Walton Malaysia. Mr Baukol clutched at straws
                    by suggesting that people could join Mr Yau out of loyalty.
                    Mr Yau’s counsel, Mr Tan, submitted that it was preposterous to
                    think that his client could solicit the highly paid DMs with nothing more
                    than friendship. As Ms Loh aptly put it, only Walton Singapore could pay
                    her more than a million dollars every year and there was no reason for her to
                    bite the hand that fed her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     As Mr Yau lacked concrete plans in
                    January 2008 and did not say that he was going into the landbanking business at
                    the lunch and dinner, the plaintiffs ought to have realised that their case on
                    solicitation at the lunch and dinner, whether express or implied, did not rest
                    on solid ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on solicitation in Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     The plaintiffs’ case on solicitation in
                    Singapore rested on the alleged walkout by the five finance staff in May 2008
                    and on what had been allegedly said by Mr Yau at the lunch and dinner in
                    January 2008. Bearing in mind that the period of non-solicitation of staff and
                    non-competition was rather short, I had no doubt that Mr Yau might have had
                    some long-term plans that were at a rudimentary stage. However, it was quite
                    clear to me that he had nothing to do with the resignation of the five finance
                    staff and that he did not solicit the DMs at the lunch and dinner in
                    January 2008 because he then had no concrete business plans to offer
                    them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     If Mr Yau had intended to solicit the
                    DMs at the lunch or dinner, it was strange that the plaintiffs furnished no
                    evidence of any follow-up action by him to ensure the success of his
                    solicitation. The plaintiffs conveniently asserted that Mr Yau’s
                    efforts at soliciting the Singapore staff failed because of their remedial
                    action but the lack of proof of any follow-up action by Mr Yau after
                    January 2008 other than the ridiculously absurd claim that he orchestrated the
                    resignation of the five finance staff undermined their case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Ultimately, the plaintiffs’ case on
                    solicitation in Singapore could not succeed when four out of five of their top
                    Singapore DMs saw a birthday cake for Mr Yau at the lunch when their
                    main witness, Ms Lusi, did not, heard things said at the lunch and dinner
                    that Ms Lusi did not, and did not hear much of what Ms Lusi alone
                    claimed to have heard at the lunch and dinner. Interestingly, DM Ong and DM Yao
                    testified that they were concerned that if they did not support the
                    company’s case against Mr Yau, their future in Walton Singapore might
                    be affected. For unexplained reasons, the three Walton DMs who had
                    contradicted the extravagant claims of their boss, Ms Lusi, left Walton
                    Singapore before the trial was completed. When cross-examined, Mr Foo
                    claimed that he did not know why DM Yao, DM Ong and DM Ann had left the company
                    even though he must have been concerned that three of his top DMs were
                    leaving the company and would have looked into the matter. The court was thus
                    left in the dark as to why Walton Singapore’s top DMs had to resign
                    before the completion of the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    I dismiss the plaintiffs’ claim that
                    Mr Yau solicited the DMs to leave Walton Singapore at the lunch and
                    dinner or that he had a hand in the resignations of the five finance staff. It
                    follows that the allegation that Mr Iseli was involved in the solicitation
                    of Walton Singapore’s DMs must also be dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Alleged Solicitation in Malaysia</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The plaintiffs’ complaints about
                    solicitation by the defendants in Malaysia centred around events that occurred
                        <em>before</em> Mr Iseli was sacked on 5 May 2008.
                    Their case was severely undermined when Walton Malaysia’s Chief Operating
                    Officer and former Managing Director, Mr Razak, who was in the thick of
                    investigations into Mr Iseli’s conduct, shockingly conceded during
                    cross-examination that he had no “concrete” evidence of any
                    wrongdoing by Mr Iseli or Mr Yau when Mr Iseli was sacked on 5

                    what he meant by “concrete evidence”
                    <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> as

                    that he had “<em>no</em> evidence” at all

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    As Mr Razak testified that there were
                    no express offers and the <em>only</em> clear implied offer
                    by the defendants to his staff was that made to Ms Linnet Tan, it follows
                    that all other alleged instances of solicitation were <em>not</em> “clear” instances of implied offers. In view
                    of this, why the plaintiffs summoned so many of their Malaysian staff to testify
                    on these unclear instances of implied solicitation cannot be readily understood.
                    Regretfully, many of them undermined the work of the plaintiffs’ counsel,
                    Ms Rajah, because their story-lines wilted during
                cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    The plaintiffs’ most senior legal
                    staff in Singapore, Mr Knight, was absolutely flabbergasted by

                    testimony on the evidence against Mr Yau and Mr Iseli that the
                    plaintiffs had in their hands on 5 May 2008, his candid reply was “Boy, I

                            (“the TSI presentation”);</div>

                            office premises.</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The TSI presentation </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    According to the defendants, the idea of a
                    presentation by TSI was mooted at a lunch on 28 March 2008 when Mr Yau, who
                    was having a lunch in Kuala Lumpur with Mr Huggins, invited Mr Iseli
                    to join them. Mr Iseli explained that he had already arranged a lunch with
                    a number of Walton Malaysia’s staff and they all conveniently joined
                    Mr Yau for a free meal. The Walton Malaysia retail sales staff were
                    interested in TSI’s products and asked a number of questions.
                    Mr Huggins, who was then on vacation with his wife and daughter, offered to
                    do a presentation on his company for them in the following month.
                    Understandably, the plaintiffs’ counsel, Ms Rajah, submitted that
                    there was more than meets the eye but the fact remains that there was no
                    reference to this lunch in the pleadings. This was not surprising as the
                    plaintiffs’ witnesses did not assert that there was any solicitation at
                    the lunch with Mr Huggins. Indeed, Walton Malaysia’s witness,
                    Ms Shirley Wong, testified that nothing happened during the lunch that was
                    worth remembering and that was why she did not mention the lunch with
                    Mr Huggins in her AEIC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p>

                    the competition. Why then was there so much fuss over the TSI presentation?
                    Mr Razak admitted that at the material time, he was concerned that so many
                    of his staff attended the presentation because his job would be on the line if
                    many of them decided to leave Walton Malaysia. He testified<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> as

                    revealed that none of his staff had mentioned in their initial statements to the

                    had suggested to them that they should state in their <em>subsequent</em> statements to the company that they had an

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    What was disturbing was that after many of
                    Walton Malaysia’s employees had been persuaded to say in their subsequent

                    impliedly solicited at the TSI presentation, Mr Razak took these unsworn

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    None of the plaintiffs’ witnesses
                    could satisfactorily explain why they had an “impression” that
                    they had been <em>impliedly</em> solicited at the TSI
                    presentation. In fact, many of them stated that both Mr Yau and
                    Mr Iseli had told them at the said presentation that it was not a
                    recruitment exercise. Mr Iseli explained that as there were so many Walton
                    Malaysia retail sales staff at the presentation, it was best to make it clear
                    that recruitment of staff for TSI was not on the agenda. It is important to note
                    that nothing was stated at the presentation about what TSI paid its staff,
                    career prospects in TSI or when TSI intended to enter the Malaysian market. Most
                    importantly, there was no evidence whatsoever of any follow-up action by TSI to
                    find out whether anyone from Walton Malaysia was interested in joining that
                    company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Most of the plaintiffs’ witnesses who
                    testified on the TSI presentation were unconvincing witnesses who gave me the
                    distinct impression that they merely wanted to toe their company’s line
                    and leave the witness box as soon as possible. For instance, Ms Norzita,
                    who admitted that she had been concerned that anyone perceived as not
                    cooperating with Walton Malaysia could be sacked,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> agreed that the TSI
                    presentation was not different from other product presentations that she had
                    previously attended. She admitted that she had attended the TSI presentation
                    because she wanted to learn more about TSI’s landbanking products and
                    added that she had the <em>same</em>
                    “feeling” of being solicited when she attended previous product
                    presentations by the plaintiffs’ competitors. Surely, such evidence could
                    not advance the plaintiffs’ case. More injurious to her credibility was
                    her damning admission that she had fabricated evidence that Mr Yau had told
                    her that he had wanted to set up a company to take them all in just in case they
                    were thrown out by Walton Malaysia.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> I do not believe that
                    she had been impliedly solicited.</p>

                    (“Ms Geethadevi”), Walton Malaysia’s Group Manager, who
                    also claimed to have been “impliedly” solicited, testified that
                    her fear of Walton Malaysia’s corporatisation could have induced her to
                    leave Walton. However, she readily admitted that going to a new company, such as
                    TSI, of which she knew nothing about, was even more terrifying than
                    Walton’s alleged corporatisation. She was not a credible witness and I do
                    not believe that she had been impliedly solicited.</p>

                    Mr Nicholas Ong (“Mr Ong”), who claimed that he had been
                    impliedly solicited on two occasions, was another unreliable witness. The first
                    occasion concerned a meeting at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in February 2008 and the
                    second occasion was at the TSI presentation. Mr Ong admitted that he might
                    have tailored his evidence by claiming that he had the impression that he was
                    being solicited at an earlier meeting at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in February
                    2008. He testified<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">One might well ask whether Mr Ong had also agreed to say whatever
                    his bosses at Walton wanted to hear when he was questioned so as to “get
                    it over and done with as soon as possible”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    Mr Yau’s counsel, Mr Tan,
                    rightly pointed out that if his client had intended to solicit Walton
                    Malaysia’s retail sales staff to join TSI, he would also have arranged a
                    TSI presentation in Singapore, where his client had much more influence as he
                    was based in Singapore. It was not disputed that there was no TSI presentation
                    in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    After taking all the circumstances into
                    account, I find that the plaintiffs’ allegation that their Malaysian staff
                    had been impliedly solicited at the TSI product presentation was not
                    proven.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Implied solicitation of Ms Linnet Tan </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    The alleged solicitation of Ms Linnet
                    Tan was one of the main planks of the plaintiffs’ case on solicitation in
                    Malaysia. Surprisingly, this was also an implied solicitation and all that
                    Ms Linnet Tan could say was that she “<em>felt</em>” that the defendants were soliciting her to move
                    with her retail sales team to their new business venture.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    Ms Linnet Tan was one of the staff
                    interviewed by the Interborder investigation team in early April 2008. She gave
                    no indication then that there was anything untoward at Walton Malaysia. However,
                    Mr Foo, who was a member of the Interborder team, claimed that
                    Ms Linnet Tan had told him that Mr Iseli had approached various sales
                    staff and conducted “meetings, here, there and
                        everywhere”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> However, he could not tell the court
                    anything about what he had heard from Ms Linnet Tan. As such, his evidence
                    on solicitation in Malaysia cannot be taken seriously.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    Much emphasis was placed by the plaintiffs
                    on an e-mail that Ms Linnet Tan sent to Mr Razak on 29 April 2008. It
                    was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An event has occurred which I’d like you to be informed about. On
                        the 20<sup>th</sup> of April I attended a lunch at Concorde
                        Hotel with [Mr Iseli] and [Mr Yau], on [Mr Iseli’s]
                        invitation the week before [Mr Iseli] voiced that there’s some
                        urgent and important info that I should be aware of as a DM in Walton and
                        that [Mr Yau] has asked to speak to me personally, I was also informed
                        that he has already met 9 other DMs and GMs recently.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">After the exchange of pleasantries, [Mr Yau] proceeded to inform me
                        of the reasons he and [Dirk Foo] left Walton, mainly that this company will
                        be a full-fledged marketing setup, carrying multiple products, and the
                        landbanking component has already signed with TSI in Toronto.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Just for the LB component, [Mr Yau] drew up a commission
                        structure of:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">DM    13%</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">GM    11.5%</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">TM    10%</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">Cons   7%</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But as an existing DM, should I move my division over <em>(this is implicit)</em>, I will have an added benefit of annual
                        profit sharing of another 1%. Plus a voice at management levels to influence
                        the direction, training, strategy, and events for the entire company, with
                        the future of partnership and shareholding.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">After lunch, they invited me to view one of their potential office spaces
                        which I discovered (with acute irritation) that my own GM [Mr Solibun]
                        has been actively sourcing for them. This was in the MNI building next to
                        Concorde. From recent snippets of info <em>I now
                            believe</em> that their plan is to go with renting a functional
                        business centre to hasten the process to start in mid-May, with the official
                        office a later consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I spoke to [Mr Iseli] after that meeting, stating with crystal
                        clarity that what he does with his life and his people is his own business.
                        But under no circumstances is he to approach ANYONE with my division
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have now acknowledged that it’s not a situation that will get
                        itself solved quietly by natural selection …..</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Mr Yau contradicted Ms Linnet
                    Tan’s version of events. He explained that she had been asking
                    Mr Iseli about the reasons for his resignation and as he was going to be in
                    Kuala Lumpur on 20 April 2008, Mr Iseli suggested that she should have
                    lunch with him to discuss the reasons for his resignation. In his AEIC,
                    Mr Yau explained that when Ms Linnet Tan asked him whether he was
                    going into landbanking, he said that he had rejected offers of a job with two
                    Canadian landbanking companies but she continued to ask about the commission
                    structure of these other companies. He added (at para 158):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I thought that she was interested in joining these companies as she wanted
                        so many details about them. She specifically asked whether their commission
                        package at the Division Manager level was higher than that offered by the
                        Walton Group. I thought Linnet Tan was merely interested in gauging the
                        market rates for salaries offered by other competitor firms. I did not see
                        anything wrong with that. She then continued to ask about the package
                        offered to me and the remuneration offers made by these companies should I
                        choose to join them. As such, I jokingly said that if these other companies
                        really wanted me to join them, then they must give me a higher figure. At
                        that time, I had no information on this as my intention was not to pursue
                        the landbanking business. I plucked a random figure of 1% out of the air
                        during my conversation with Linnet Tan. This conversation must be seen in
                        the context of a casual lunch. There were no figure given, no portfolio or
                        products on landbanking discussed for Linnet Tan to misconstrue the
                        conversation as a solicitation attempt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    Ms Linnet Tan’s version of the
                    discussions at the lunch on 20 April 2008 had far too many flaws.
                    Mr Yau’s counsel, Mr Tan, rightly pointed out that if his client
                    had planned to solicit staff from Singapore and Malaysia by offering them an
                    improved commission structure, it was strange that Ms Linnet Tan was the
                    only one who had been informed about the commission structure. Although
                    Mr Yau was much closer to Walton Singapore’s retail sales staff, none
                    of plaintiffs’ Singapore witnesses had mentioned a commission structure of
                    the type allegedly revealed to Ms Linnet Tan. Mr Tan added that
                    Mr Yau would not have singled her out as the only one to talk to about
                    TSI’s commission structure as he would not have known whether she was on
                    his side, and especially so since she claimed that she had made her pro-Walton
                    stand quite evident to others from the very start. Furthermore, if Mr Yau
                    had furnished her with details of TSI’s commission structure, she would
                    not have had to try so hard in her subsequent e-mails to him after the lunch on
                    20 April 2008, which will be discussed below, to get more details on the
                    very topics that had allegedly already been discussed in great detail at the
                    said lunch. Mr Iseli, who was present at the lunch, stated in his AEIC (at
                    para 131) that the conversation at the lunch was clearly about
                    Mr Yau’s own employment opportunities and that he could not recall an
                    offer having been made by Mr Yau to Ms Linnet Tan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    Another point worth noting was that
                    Mr Baukol claimed that when he had dinner with Ms Linnet Tan on
                    22 May 2008, the latter told him about the contents of her e-mail to
                    Mr Razak. If Mr Baukol knew then that Mr Yau was setting up a
                    rival landbanking company, a question arises as to why the plaintiffs did not
                    rush to the courts to enforce the non-competition clause in his employment
                    contract. After all, the plaintiffs moved swiftly to obtain an injunction
                    against Mr Yau with respect to solicitation of its staff and Mr Baukol
                    agreed that setting up a landbanking company was, from the plaintiffs’
                    point of view, a more serious matter than general solicitation of its
                        staff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> The fact that no steps were taken to obtain
                    an injunction against the setting up of Mr Yau’s alleged competing
                    business could only mean that even the plaintiffs themselves did not take
                    Ms Linnet Tan’s allegation that Mr Yau was setting up a rival
                    landbanking business very seriously.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    The plaintiffs also claimed that
                    Ms Linnet Tan was impliedly solicited during an exchange of e-mails with
                    Mr Yau. On 22 April 2008, she e-mailed Mr Yau as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It was really great to see you again after all this time. You mentioned
                        you had some further info on your new company and products, would love to
                        have it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    On the same day, Mr Yau replied to her
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I can’t give you anything at this moment in Black and White, which I
                        like to keep PNC. I can show it to you, my next visit in KL, and you are
                        welcome to join the rest of the guys for my next meeting, if you want
                        to.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The reason for me not to give it out to anyone hard copy or through email
                        in detail information, is because I want to safeguard the future for the
                        people who are willing to join the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I hope you understand my situation at now, is not about myself. It’s
                        all about people.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Can I have your cell phone number? So that we can keep in touch.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    When cross-examined, Walton Malaysia’s
                    Mr Razak admitted<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> that no express offer had been made to
                    Ms Linnet Tan in the said emails. What was quite troubling was that she did
                    not disclose to the court another e-mail that she had sent to Mr Yau on
                    23 April 2008 until after she had given her testimony and returned to Kuala
                    Lumpur. In this important e-mail to Mr Yau, she stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I was hoping for more info on the landbanks region and projects only,
                            <em>to study the investment. You know how I like to pick
                            apart the details of everything</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    The undisclosed e-mail throws a different
                    light on the exchange of e-mails between Ms Linnet Tan and Mr Yau. She
                    had given the court the impression that it was Mr Yau who wanted to give
                    her details of his new company. However, the truth is that she had pestered
                    Mr Yau for more information about landbanking in order “to study the
                    investment” and to “pick apart the details of everything”.
                    By not disclosing her e-mail of 23 April 2008, Ms Linnet Tan avoided
                    being cross-examined on it when she was in the witness box. Admittedly, the
                    plaintiffs’ counsel, Ms Rajah, offered to recall Ms Linnet Tan
                    as a witness but Mr Tan declined the invitation and preferred to submit on
                    her failure to disclose the relevant e-mail. Admittedly, Mr Yau did say in
                    one of his e-mails to Ms Linnet Tan that he could not give her too many
                    details as he had to protect the interest of those who were joining him and his
                    answers to Ms Rajah’s rather probing questions on this statement were
                    not altogether satisfactory. However, the fact remains that there was
                    insufficient proof that Mr Yau had impliedly solicited Ms Linnet Tan
                    to join his new business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    As for Ms Linnet Tan’s claim that
                    she was disappointed that Mr Solibun, a Group Manager within her sales
                    team, had been solicited to leave Walton Malaysia, this must also have been an
                        <em>implied</em> solicitation. Mr Solibun stated
                    in his AEIC (at para 28) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not understand how Linnet Tan can claim that it was clear that I had
                        decided to join [Mr Yau’s] new company. <em>There
                            was no new company for me to join</em>. [Mr Yau] had also
                        never asked us to join any new company. In fact, as far as I was aware,
                        [Mr Yau] had not even decided whether he was going to set up a new
                        business, and what this business was to be used for, except that it may be a
                        marketing company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    I find Mr Solibun a more credible
                    witness than Ms Linnet Tan and accept his evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    In her eagerness to tarnish Mr Yau,
                    Ms Linnet Tan also alleged that she had been invited to see the office that
                    was intended to house the rival company that Mr Yau had intended to set up.
                    However, her recollection of events was so faulty that she even got the building
                    that they went to view wrong. Mr Yau explained that the property viewed on
                    that day was not intended for a landbanking company but for another business
                    that he was minded to be involved in. I find that in the light of Ms Linnet
                    Tan’s other unreliable evidence, I cannot, on the basis of her
                    uncorroborated evidence, hold that Mr Yau had intended to find an office
                    for a landbanking business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    Ms Linnet Tan’s former boss,
                    Mr Murali, claimed that it was possible that she had e-mailed Mr Razak
                    on 29 April 2008 and spoken ill of Mr Iseli because she “could see a
                    clear way to getting promoted or taking control of the sales
                        force”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> if Mr Iseli and senior members of his
                    team were removed from the company. He added derisively that she was “the
                    sort of person who would do this”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> I agree with Ms Rajah
                    that Ms Linnet Tan’s evidence should be evaluated without considering
                    the allegations of bribery or financial gain. Even so, while the evidence of
                    Mr Yau had flaws which were pointed out quite effectively by Ms Rajah,
                    I nonetheless prefer his overall evidence and that of Mr Iseli over the
                    tesitmony of Ms Linnet Tan and Mr Razak. As such, I find that the
                    plaintiffs did not prove that Ms Linnet Tan had been impliedly solicited to
                    leave Walton Malaysia by the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Mr Hernandez was solicited </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    The plaintiffs’ assertion that Walton
                    Malaysia’s Team Manager, Mr Hernandez, was solicited by Mr Iseli
                    to leave Walton Malaysia at a meeting in the latter’s house in Kota
                    Kinabalu on 26 April 2008 was contradicted by Mr Hernandez’s e-mail
                    to Mr Razak on 28 April 2008. In the said e-mail, Mr Hernandez
                    categorically stated that no offers had been made to him at the said meeting to
                    join the new venture although “the options were
                open”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    When cross-examined Mr Hernandez
                        conceded<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> that the allegation that he had been
                    solicited was inconsistent with his e-mail to Mr Razak. He testified as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">[F]irst, you are saying no offers were made by

                    material time. He testified<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> as follows:</p>

                    Mr Iseli’s house, Mr Hernandez attempted to obtain evidence of
                    the former’s solicitation by secretly taping a subsequent conversation
                    with Mr Iseli. However, the transcript of the taped conversation revealed
                    that Mr Iseli had stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">What I am doing, <em>I am not here to recruit
                            you</em>. No way I am not going to do that. <em>I

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    Walton Malaysia’s witness,

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    When referring to the Lodge meeting in his
                    AEIC, Mr Liew omitted important information that would have cast a
                    different light on the meeting. First, he did not refer to an e-mail that he had
                    sent to Mr Razak shortly after the Lodge meeting, in which he stated that
                    Mr Iseli had told him that he was not being poached or asked to “go
                    over”. When asked why he did not reveal this in his AEIC, Mr Liew
                    said that he had forgotten to do so.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    Secondly, Mr Liew did not mention that
                    a sales representative from YTL Tours had interrupted the meeting to discuss a
                    proposed incentive trip to Hanoi that was being planned by Mr Iseli. When
                    cross-examined, he admitted that in April 2008, as well during as the previous
                    months, Mr Iseli had tried to raise the morale of Walton Malaysia’s
                    retail sales staff and had continued to encourage the company’s Team
                    Managers to improve their performance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    Thirdly, Mr Liew did not disclose that
                    during the Lodge meeting, Mr Iseli had also been checking on the commission
                    structure of rival companies and had talked to Mr Razak on the phone about
                    this matter. Mr Yau’s counsel, Mr Tan, rightly pointed out that
                    if Mr Iseli had really wanted to solicit Walton Malaysia’s retail
                    sales staff to leave the company, he would not have fought so hard to increase
                    their commission as this would have made it harder for him to persuade them to
                    leave the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    I find that Mr Liew’s evidence
                    that he had been solicited by Mr Iseli to leave Walton Malaysia most
                    unreliable. As such, he failed to advance Walton Malaysia’s case on
                    solicitation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Ms Shanta Krishnan was solicited </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    Ms Shanta Krishnan
                    (“Ms Shanta”), the sister of the then Managing Director,
                    Mr Murali, also claimed to have been solicited by one Mr Robin on
                    Mr Iseli’s behalf to leave Walton Malaysia. Like other witnesses from
                    Walton Malaysia, she said that that it was only her own
                    “impression” that she was being solicited because nothing had been
                    openly said about joining Mr Iseli.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    Ms Shanta’s allegation that she
                    had been impliedly solicited to leave Walton Malaysia cannot be believed. She
                    readily agreed that it was “logical” that if Mr Iseli had
                    wanted to plot against the company, she would have been the last person to be
                    approached as everything disclosed to her would get back to her brother,
                        Mr Murali.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span> Hence, Mr Yau’s counsel,
                    Mr Tan, submitted that Ms Shanta’s impression of being solicited
                    by Mr Iseli through Mr Robin was “totally
                    skewed”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    Ms Shanta’s evidence was
                    unpersuasive. She was so keen to advance the company’s case that a
                    sub-section in her AEIC had a heading “Robin’s role in
                    Iseli’s and Yau’s plans”. When cross-examined on why she had
                    such a misleading heading when nothing in that sub-section had anything to do
                    with Mr Yau, she said that it was a mistake and that at no point in time
                    did she and Robin talk about Mr Yau.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span> I find that
                    Ms Shanta’s claim that she had been solicited to leave Walton
                    Malaysia was not proven.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Ms Jenme Hoh was solicited</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    As for the alleged solicitation of
                    Ms Jenme Hoh (“Ms Hoh”), Walton Malaysia’s Team
                    Manager, Mr Murali stated in his e-mail to Mr Britton on 3 April 2008
                    that Ms Hoh had told him that she had been approached at a company seminar
                    on 29 March 2008 by Mr Iseli, who told her about a new company that
                    had made offers to Walton Malaysia’s DMs regarding a better product
                    and better commissions. Mr Murali’s sister, Ms Shanta, stated in
                    her AEIC (at para 50) that Ms Hoh had also told her that Mr Iseli had
                    mentioned that another company had a “better product and better
                    commission”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    Ms Hoh’s version of her encounter
                    with Mr Iseli at the seminar was quite different from the version in
                    Mr Murali’s e-mail. In her AEIC Ms Hoh had merely stated (at
                    paras 12 and 13) that Mr Iseli had asked her at the seminar whether she had
                    “heard about a new company in town” and that she told him that she
                    was hungry and could not think of anything other than food. She added (at para
                    14) that after this, she was “never approached or spoken to by Iseli
                    again”. When cross-examined, Ms Shanta agreed that
                    Ms Hoh’s version of her encounter was different. The evidence of
                    Mr Murali and Ms Shanta on the solicitation of Ms Hoh was
                    unconvincing and I find that it was not proven that Ms Hoh had been
                    solicited by Mr Iseli at the seminar in question.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether Mr Patrick Ng was solicited</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    There were other retail sales staff from
                    Walton Malaysia who testified but I had the distinct impression that many of
                    them were far too concerned as to how their bosses might view their testimony in
                    court. I need only mention one more witness, Mr Patrick Ng Chee Weng
                    (“Mr Ng”), a Group Manager who had been suspended from his
                    duties because he was perceived to be close to Mr Iseli. Mr Ng was a
                    combative witness who had to be reminded not to use impolite language in court.
                    He stated in his AEIC that sometime in early 2008, a number of persons,
                    including Mr Medina and Mr Solibun, gathered at Mr Iseli’s
                    apartment and discussed plans about starting a new marketing company to sell
                    among other things, landbanking products. It is one thing to discuss the setting
                    up of a new company and another to actually do so. Furthermore, Mr Ng did
                    not reveal this “juicy” information to the Interborder
                    investigation team when he was interviewed in early April 2008. It was only
                    after his suspension had been lifted that he had a lot to say about
                    Mr Iseli, including what the latter had told him and others <em>before</em> and after the Interborder team was
                    assembled.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    Mr Ng also claimed in his AEIC at para
                    16 that Mr Iseli had asked him to join the new company to be set up and to
                    become one of its directors and shareholders. He added that he told
                    Mr Iseli that he needed to know more about the new company and the products
                    it intended to sell but Mr Iseli was unable to provide the requisite
                    information in writing. If Mr Ng’s evidence is to be believed,
                    Mr Iseli had clearly made him an <em>express</em>
                    offer to join the new company and become one its directors and shareholders.
                    However, Mr Razak testified that that the only <em>clear</em> instance of solicitation was the <em>implied</em> solicitation of Ms Linnet Tan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    Mr Yau’s counsel, Mr Tan,
                    suggested that Mr Ng had lied to keep his job. Mr Razak admitted that
                    the fact that Mr Ng had agreed to file an AEIC in support of the
                    plaintiffs’ case was a relevant factor when considering whether the
                    suspension of the latter from his duties should be lifted. Mr Razak
                        testified<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span> as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    I cannot, merely on Mr Ng’s
                    words, find that the defendants had solicited Walton Malaysia’s staff to
                    leave that company to join them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether a massive walk-out had been planned</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    As has been mentioned, Walton
                    Malaysia’s former Managing Director, Mr Murali, tried to alert the
                    company about Mr Iseli’s alleged solicitation of its staff in his
                    e-mail to Mr Britton on 3 April 2008. Part of his e-mail referred to a
                    planned massive walk-out as a result of the defendants’ solicitation
                    efforts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    Mr Murali’s information regarding
                    the proposed walk-out was plain hearsay. He said that Mr Liew informed him
                    that one Ms Sammi Lee (“Ms Lee”), a team manager at
                    Walton Malaysia, had found out from another team manager, Ms Clara Tan
                    (“Ms Tan”), that there would soon be a walkout from Walton.
                    Neither Ms Tan nor Ms Lee were called to testify on the alleged
                    walk-out. Furthermore, while Mr Murali said that he had been told that the
                    walkout from Walton Malaysia had been scheduled for 15 April 2008,
                    Mr Liew testified that he did not give Mr Murali any date for the
                    walk-out while Ms Hoh was unable to recall any date for the walkout. As
                    such, the question of the proposed walk-out, which did not materialise, need not
                    be further considered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Alleged solicitation in Malaysia after 5 May 2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    As for whether there was any solicitation of
                    Walton Malaysia’s staff <em>after</em> 5 May
                    2008, Mr Razak testified that the <em>only</em>
                    instance of solicitation after 5 May 2008 that he could recall was the so-called
                    “Penang incident”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    After Mr Iseli left Walton Malaysia on
                    5 May 2008, the company sent Mr Medina to Penang on 13 and 14 May 2008
                    to brief its Penang staff on the departure of Mr Iseli and the suspension
                    of four of Walton Malaysia’s senior retail sales staff. The briefing took
                    place at the Penang Club (“the Club”). What irked the plaintiffs
                    was that Mr Iseli, an associate member of the Club, was also at the Club at
                    the same time. According to Mr Razak, Mr Michael Ooi
                    (“Mr Ooi”), his Penang team manager, reported that before the
                    Walton Malaysia staff left for their meeting in another part of the Club,
                    Mr Iseli was seen seated with two other persons, namely Ms Sue How and
                    Mr Khoo Boo Yeang (“Mr Khoo”), a few tables away from
                    Mr Medina’s table.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    Surprisingly, Mr Ooi was not called by
                    the plaintiffs as a witness to testify on the Penang incident. It was not
                    disputed that Mr Iseli did not attend Mr Medina’s meeting and
                    none of the plaintiffs’ witnesses testified about solicitation at the
                    Club. When cross-examined by Mr Tan as to how he could, in these
                    circumstances, conclude that Mr Iseli had solicited his staff at the Club,
                    Mr Razak tied himself in knots<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span> before concluding
                    that the fact that Mr Iseli was at the Club at the same time as his staff

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Basically, after the [meeting at the Penang Club], Razak called me
                        …. He believed that [Mr Iseli] went to Penang to solicit support
                        from all the Penang Walton consultants. So I told him no because he
                        didn’t meet them, he was not at the meeting, but he insisted that the
                        company is suing [Mr Iseli], and he wants me to help the company to
                        prepare an affidavit to say that [Mr Iseli] went to Penang to solicit
                        consultants. So I said that is not true, and I cannot write that type of
                        statement….</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>So [Mr Razak] says, “well, … you

                            say, “if you insist on asking me to say something which is not
                            true, you can keep your business”…</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    Mr Khoo claimed that he paid a price
                    for refusing to lie on behalf of the plaintiffs. He said that after he refused
                    to accuse Mr Iseli of soliciting at the Club, Mr Razak stated in a
                    letter to him on 20 June 2008 that his resignation had been accepted. He
                    added that as he had not resigned from Walton Malaysia, his contract had been
                    terminated because he had refused to file an affidavit against Mr Iseli.
                    Walton Malaysia insisted that Mr Khoo had resigned but the latter’s
                    alleged letter of resignation was not shown to the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    I reject the plaintiffs’ claim that
                    the Penang incident proved that Mr Iseli had solicited Walton
                    Malaysia’s staff to leave that company with Mr Medina’s help.
                    There was thus no evidence of any solicitation in Malaysia after 5 May 2008

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    The alleged defamatory remark, if made,
                    understandably incensed Mr Doherty so much that on 6 May 2008, he
                    stated in an e-mail to his staff as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Another false statement concerning [Mr Yau] is that I allegedly
                        offered him money so that he would not disclose this alleged corporate

                        that was due to him under his employment contract. He received no additional
                        compensation, and was not offered a severance package. I challenge anyone to

                    had been offered such a bribe.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    Mr Hernandez, Mr Doherty’s
                    key witness, was an unreliable witness. He demolished Mr Doherty’s
                    case when he finally admitted that he could have been mistaken about what
                    Mr Iseli had said about the US$5 million payment to Mr Yau. His
                    initial position, as outlined in para 32 of his AEIC filed on 17 April
                    2009, was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Iseli said that when [Mr Yau] resigned, Bill Doherty had offered him
                        a sum of USD 5 million to keep him silent on this strategy and to prevent
                        from soliciting the sales force for a period of two years. [Mr Yau] had
                        refused this offer. Iseli said that [Mr Yau] was right not to take
                        it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    Mr Hernandez said that the defamatory
                    words were uttered by Mr Iseli at the latter’s house in Kota Kinabalu
                    on 26 April 2008. However, Mr Iseli stated in para 140 of his AEIC as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I did not at any time tell [Mr Hernandez] that [Mr Yau] had
                        refused an offer of US$5 million from Bill Doherty to silence him about the
                        issue of “corporatisation” or to obtain his agreement not to
                        solicit the sales force of the Walton Group. At the relevant time,
                        “corporatisation” was an open secret, and there was no reason
                        for me even to suspect that the Walton Group would consider it necessary to
                        offer [Mr Yau] such a significant bribe to keep quiet about it.
                            <em>I may have mentioned the figure of US$5 million in
                            the context of the package [Mr Yau] would have been earning a year

                        walk away from a job paying so much. <em>It is quite obvious
                            that [Mr Hernandez] has misconstrued what I have

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    Mr Solibun, who was present when
                    Mr Iseli spoke to Mr Hernandez on 26 April 2008, corroborated
                    Mr Iseli’s evidence. He stated in his AEIC (at para 39):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The figure of US$5 million was mentioned by [Mr Iseli] when he
                        wondered why [Mr Yau] would resign from Walton and walk away from an
                        estimated US$5 million a year salary. [Mr Iseli] never said that
                        [Mr Yau] had been offered US$5 million by Walton. These statements have
                        been taken out of context, and I believe that [Mr Hernandez] has
                        deliberately misunderstood what [Mr Iseli] said that day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    After the meeting in Mr Iseli’s
                    house on 26 April 2008, Mr Hernandez secretly taped a conversation with
                    Mr Iseli at a subsequent meeting in order to obtain incriminating evidence
                    against the latter on the package allegedly offered to Mr Yau.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span> However,
                    nothing in the transcript of the taped conversation concerned the alleged bribe.
                    Most damaging to Mr Doherty’s case on defamation was the fact that
                    Mr Hernandez agreed with Mr Yau’s counsel, Mr Tan, that he
                    could have misunderstood what Mr Iseli had said about the US$5 million

                    dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The 1<sup>st</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup>
                Plaintiffs’ Claim for Malicious Falsehood </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    In <em>Ratcliffe v
                        Evans</em> (1892) 2 QB 524, the English Court of Appeal held that the
                    tort of malicious falsehood was applicable to falsehoods calculated to cause
                    actual damage to a business. The essential ingredients of this tort, which is
                    intended to protect a plaintiff from economic harm caused by a defendant’s
                    falsehood, were elucidated in <em>Kaye v Robertson</em>
                    [1991] FSR 62 at 67 by Glidewell LJ, who said that it must be
                    shown “that the defendant has published about the [plaintiff] words which
                    are false, that they were published maliciously and that special damage has
                    followed as the direct and natural result of their
                publication”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    The plaintiffs’ case on malicious
                    falsehood was rather confusing. Mr Doherty testified that it concerned what
                    the defendants said about the plaintiffs’ corporate strategy. He
                        explained<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span> what the plaintiffs’ case on malicious
                    falsehood entailed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In … the simplest terms, … it is that we were going
                            <em>to cease</em> retail operations and we would
                        --- and there would be a redundancy in our staff and therefore <em>people were going to lose jobs within 24 months</em>.
                        Furthermore, what [Mr Yau] was providing was an opportunity for them to
                        go and work with him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    Mr Yau emphatically denied that he had
                    told anyone that the retail division would be closed down within twelve to
                    twenty-four months. He explained in his AEIC at para 97:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At no time did I tell anyone, in Walton or otherwise, that the entire
                        retail staff of Walton Singapore and Walton Malaysia would be removed within
                        the next 12 to 24 months. If indeed I made such a statement, I have no doubt
                        that there would have been mass resignations by now. In fact I sent an email
                        to the key personnel in Sales to encourage them so that they would not be
                        demoralised by my departure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    When cross-examined, Mr Doherty
                    conceded that his own witnesses understood that corporatisation would impact on
                    retail sales and not that it would result in the cessation of retail
                        sales.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span> Although DM Yao claimed in his AEIC (at para
                    73) that Mr Yau had said that management had “already made up their
                    minds to <em>remove</em> the retail sales force,” he
                    testified that this statement was inaccurate and the impression given was that
                    Walton Singapore intended to <em>focus</em> on corporate
                        sales.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_92" id="Ftn_92_1"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    In the rest of this judgment, references to
                    the “corporatisation” strategy or plans must be read in the
                    context of Ms Rajah’s explanation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    The plaintiffs claimed that there was no
                    plan to corporatise their operations in Singapore and Malaysia and that their
                    consistent business strategy between 2005 to 2008 was:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    The plaintiffs contended that Mr Yau
                    made the allegation about their corporate strategy in Singapore at the lunch and
                    dinner meetings and in Kuala Lumpur at a “lo hei” lunch and Red
                    Box karaoke session on 20 February 2008, a lunch with Ms Linnet Tan on
                    20 April 2009 and in his conversations with DM Ong and Mr Chua Kheng
                    Hian on 28 April 2008. As for Mr Iseli, it was alleged that he made
                    the allegations about corporatisation at a meeting at the Crowne Riverside
                    Kuching on 22 February 2008 or 30 March 2008, a Paradisso lunch on
                    7 April 2008, a Boardroom meeting on 7 April 2008, coffee sessions
                    with Mr Liew and Ms Linnet Tan on 17 April 2008, another coffee
                    session with Ms Heather Kong on 19 April 2008, a gathering at Kota
                    Kinabalu on 26 April 2008, a meeting with Ms Geethadevi and her
                    managers on 28 April 2008, and a drinks session with Mr Hernandez on
                    4 May 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    The defendants’ defence was two-fold.
                    First, they contended that corporatisation was a fact. Secondly, even if there
                    was no plan to corporatise their sales operations, the retail sales staff in
                    both countries could see for themselves the focus on corporatisation in
                    Singapore and Malaysia and thus have concerns about their future. In explaining,
                    as he was entitled to do, why he resigned, Mr Yau admitted having said that
                    he had been unhappy with the corporate strategy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    Mr Baukol accepted that it was
                    reasonable for the DMs to ask Mr Yau about his future plans and for
                    the latter to “express views on what his plans [were] although they may
                    not be concrete”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span> I do not, for one moment,
                    think that Mr Yau had only said complimentary things about the plaintiffs
                    whenever he met the latter’s staff and that he may well have been hatching
                    incomplete plans for his future, which could spell competition for the
                    plaintiffs after the expiry of the restrictions in his employment contract.
                    However, the issue here is whether or not he was guilty of having spread
                    malicious rumours at the material time which caused the loss allegedly suffered
                    primarily by Walton Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The plaintiffs’ own senior staff used corporatisation as a
                threat</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    While the plaintiffs complained that the
                    defendants made their retail sales staff fearful and anxious about the future by
                    talking about the corporatisation strategy, this was precisely what the top
                    echelon of Walton Malaysia’s management had been doing all along to ensure
                    that the retail sales staff worked harder to avoid being sidelined by corporate
                    sales.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    Witnesses of both parties to the action
                    testified that Walton Malaysia’s boss, Mr Razak, took advantage of
                    the fear of corporatisation to threaten his retail sales staff to work harder.
                    In his AEIC, Mr Medina, a former Walton Malaysia staff, stated (at
                    para 24):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Another cause for further concern was the statements
                            Razak repeatedly made about Walton Malaysia going corporate</em>.
                        One such occasion was at the General Sales Meeting that took place near the
                        end of 2007, where Razak had highlighted to us that retail sales were below
                        expectations and <em>he announced that unless our sales
                            improved, we would end up like Hong Kong, which was “going
                            corporate”. This aggravated fears. By this time, it was a known
                            fact that the Hong Kong office had reduced its retail sales team of
                            approximately 150-200 people to less than 50 people</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    Despite her staunch pro-Walton stand,
                    Mr Razak’s subordinate, Ms Linnet Tan, corroborated
                    Mr Medina’s evidence when she testified<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_95" id="Ftn_95_1"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span> as follows:</p>

                            Kong…. Razak did that.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Razak talks a lot, and <em>this one

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    Apparently, Ms Linnet Tan herself had
                    also used corporatisation as a scare tactic. Mr Solibun stated in his AEIC
                    at para 11:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subsequently, Linnet Tan, my Division Manager, began telling members of
                        her division … at several points over a period of two years that
                        Walton Malaysia was “going corporate” and that we would need
                        to “buck up” our performance or else we were going to be
                        removed because it was more expensive to operate retail sales than corporate
                        sales….</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We all began worrying about the threat that this new
                        “corporate” direction posed to our livelihoods …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    Mr Solibun’s assertion was
                    corroborated by Mr Christopher Xavier Dorairaj
                    (“Mr Dorairaj”), a former team manager of Walton Malaysia. He
                    stated in his AEIC at paras 10 and 12:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10    The issue of corporatisation had come up as early
                            as end 2005 or early 2006, when my Division Manager, Linnet Tan, in her
                            “motivational” speeches to her team at division meetings,
                            would tell us <em>that Walton Malaysia was moving towards
                                corporate and that we would need to “buck up” on our
                                performance or we would be
                        sidelined…</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12    On numerous occasions throughout 2006 and 2007,
                            Linnet Tan would repeat this point about Walton Malaysia going corporate
                            and use this fact to remind us that the retail sales team must pull
                            their weight and hit their targets. <em>[Mr Razak]</em>, then the Vice-President Sales of Walton
                            Malaysia, <em>had also mentioned this at several of the
                                General Sales Meetings. …. I cannot remember his exact words
                                but he did state something to the effect that “unless the
                                sales improved, we would end up like Hong Kong, which was
                                “going corporate”</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    Admittedly, the plaintiffs contended that
                    Mr Dorairaj’s employment with Walton Malaysia had been terminated
                    because of his poor performance and it is possible that he may be unhappy about
                    this. However, his evidence that both Mr Razak and Ms Linnet Tan had
                    been frightening their staff with the spectre of corporatisation was not
                    effectively challenged when he was cross-examined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    Mr Doherty admitted that if the
                    management of Walton Malaysia had told the retail sales staff that the company
                    was “going corporate”, the retail staff would have cause for
                        concern.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span> It is totally inappropriate for the plaintiffs,
                    whose top brass, including Mr Razak, were threatening their staff with
                    corporatisation to complain that the defendants were causing them harm by
                    spreading rumours of corporatisation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Rumours about corporatisation before the defendants’
                departure</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    There were other flaws in the
                    plaintiffs’ case on malicious falsehood. The plaintiffs’ assertion
                    that rumours of corporatisation became alive only after Mr Yau resigned in
                    January 2008 was not supported by their own witnesses. DM Yao testified that the
                    focus on corporatisation was “nothing new” and that “right
                    from 2006, there’s always been talk of this” by Walton
                    Singapore’s staff. Both DM Ong<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span> and DM Ann<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span> stated
                    in their AEICs that the retail sales staff teams were concerned that the
                    corporate sales division would “cannibalise” the retail sales
                    division. When re-examined, DM Ong said<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_99" id="Ftn_99_1"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span> that Mr Yau did
                    not raise “something new” when he talked about the
                    plaintiffs’ corporate strategy as there had been “nagging thoughts
                    about the possibility of the company heading in this direction”. Even
                    Ms Lusi agreed that there had been rumours of corporatisation for 2 years
                    before Mr Yau resigned. She did not suggest that the rumours about
                    corporatisation had been started by Mr Yau.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    Walton Malaysia’s retail staff also
                    had fears about the company’s corporate strategy. Its former Managing
                    Director, Mr Murali, testified<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span> that apart from his
                    staff, even he had concerns about the effect of corporatisation on retail sales
                    long before the defendants resigned in 2008. The relevant part of the
                    proceedings is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">[Y]our sister [Ms Shanta] said in her affidavit

                            corporatisation … would take over retail sales. Were you aware of

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    Other Walton Malaysia witnesses who
                    testified about their concerns about corporatisation included Mr Eddie
                    Chen, who stated in his AEIC at paras 11 and 15-16:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">11</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Since the time of inception of the corporate sales
                            division there have always been concerns amongst the retail sales staff
                            that the long term plan was for the corporate sales division to replace
                            the retail sales division.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">15</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The retail sales staff in the division that I was

                            division would be replaced by the corporate sales division. After Iseli
                            left, their concerns became more pronounced. The concerns with respect
                            of Iseli’s departure from Walton Malaysia affected not only the
                            division I was in but the other divisions of Walton Malaysia as
                            well.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    It follows that the allegation that the
                    rumours of corporatisation became alive only after the defendants left their
                    respective companies was unsubstantiated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Mr Doherty had assured the plaintiffs’ retail staff that
                their jobs were safe</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    While unaware that his own senior staff in
                    Malaysia had been threatening the retail staff with the consequences of
                    corporatisation, Mr Doherty e-mailed his staff on 6 May 2008 as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I] have been advised that false statements are being spread about Walton
                        and me personally. I would like to address the false statements in this open
                        letter to everyone....</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The first rumour I want to address concerns restructuring at Walton, and
                        Walton’s alleged strategy to shut down the Asian retail operations and
                        focus only on corporate sales. Apparently, the rumour is that retail sales
                        people will lose their jobs over the next 24 months. This is absolutely
                        untrue. The Asian operations generated sales of $213 million last year,
                        which were greater than our Canadian sales of $200 million. These results
                        were brilliant and I told you how proud I was of your efforts. I said on
                        video and I meant it. Walton would never shut down its most successful sales
                        operation in the world. <em>I want to let you know in no
                            uncertain terms that Walton remains committed to retail sales in Asia;
                            Walton is not winding up retail sales and, as a result, your jobs are
                            not in jeopardy…</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As I have told you many times, we are one family and we have a bright
                        future together….</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I look forward to continuing to work with you as we build our bright and
                        profitable future together.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Mr Doherty’s assurance should have assuaged fears and
                    clarified the plaintiffs’ position on corporatisation in Singapore and
                    Malaysia once and for all. It would be a rather sorry state of affairs for the
                    plaintiffs if their staff believed outsiders rather than their own CEO, who had
                    promised his staff a bright and profitable future and had stated in no uncertain
                    terms that he did not intend to get rid of the retail sales
                division.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_191"></a>191    What cannot be overlooked is that although
                    the same malicious rumours were allegedly spread in Singapore, where Mr Yau
                    resides and had much greater influence, the sales of Walton Singapore soared in
                    2008 while the sales of Walton Malaysia dipped drastically in that year. Of
                    course, the plaintiffs credited themselves by saying that they managed to
                    contain the damage in Singapore but not in Malaysia, but this is a self-serving
                    assertion that was not proven.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Why the retail sales staff had concerns about
                corporatisation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    Why did the retail sales staff of Walton
                    Singapore and Walton Malaysia have such marked concerns about the impact of
                    corporate sales on their future after the corporate sales division was set up in
                    2005? The defendants believed that the company was placing increasing emphasis
                    on the corporate sales department’s sales through IFAs as from 2007 and
                    that the inevitable consequence of this would be that corporate sales would
                    adversely affect retail sales and lead to a reduction of retail sales staff.
                    Mr Iseli told the plaintiffs’ management that if it was his own
                    company, he too would focus on corporate sales. He also informed Mr Baukol
                    that the company seemed to be heading in the direction of corporatisation
                    because of the discrepancy in commissions payable to corporate and retail staff.
                    No action was taken against him for making these remarks and the plaintiffs
                    finally addressed the discrepancy in the commissions payable to retail sales
                    staff shortly before Mr Iseli was asked to leave. Oddly, the plaintiffs now
                    accused him of misleading Mr Baukol by saying that people felt that the
                    company was on the road to corporatisation because of the said discrepancy in
                    commissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    According to the defendants, the influx of
                    several expatriate staff from the plaintiffs’ headquarters in Canada
                    helped to fuel rumours about the future direction of the company because the
                    expertise of these people was in securitised products and corporate sales. This
                    gave the impression that changes were afoot for the Singapore office to bring it
                    in line with the Canadian office. The expatriate staff from Canada included
                    Mr Britton, who was made Chief Operating Officer of Walton Asia in 2006,
                    Mr Rex McNally, who took charge of Customer Services in Walton Singapore in
                    2006, Mr Pickard, who joined the corporate sales division of Walton
                    Singapore in 2007, Mr Sean Maharaj, who became Executive Vice President of
                    Finance in 2007, and Mr Knight, who was appointed Executive Vice President,
                    Legal, Walton Asia, in early 2008. It did not help that one of these
                    expatriates, Mr Pickard, who presented the Singapore report at the
                    Scottsdale retreat, stated that there were too many agents in Singapore and
                    Malaysia and that there was a need to “cut their numbers” to
                    increase the commitment and calibre of people.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a>194    After the Scottsdale retreat, the portfolio
                    of corporate sales, which had been under the purview of Mr Dirk Foo, who
                    was regarded by some as a champion of retail sales, was taken away from him and
                    the position of Vice-President, Corporate Sales, was created. Mr Starvis,
                    the man who had taken charge of the corporate division in Hong Kong, was
                    appointed to this post.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_195"></a>195    At the Scottsdale retreat, Mr Razak
                    warned that “retail and corporate may be taking to the same potential
                    corporate clients in competing for business” and recommended that a
                    “well defined market for each department will best correct this
                    situation”. In due course, problems arose between the staff of the
                    corporate sales department and retail sales department. The poaching of retail
                    sales by the corporate sales department was also resented. In his AEIC,
                    Mr Medina explained (at paras 15-17):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Among the retail sales people, there is an honour system. We do not poach
                        one another’s customers…. However, with the new Corporate
                        Department, this code of honour was not followed…. In addition, the
                        company condoned such behaviour…. The clear preference for corporate
                        sales was undeniable and caused great unhappiness amongst the retail staff.
                        Although the concern was brought up to the management, specifically
                        [Mr Razak], … in or about 2005-2006, nothing was done about
                        it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196"></a>196    The perception that the corporate sales
                    department was favoured gained momentum when a new commission structure which
                    favoured those involved in corporate sales was introduced in November 2006.
                    Corporate sales staff were entitled to a commission of 10% while those in retail
                    sales were paid only 4%, with an additional 2% if sale targets were met. This
                    disparity was exacerbated in February 2007 when the commission on retail sales
                    was henceforth to be computed on 90% of the sales volume whereas the commission
                    for corporate sales continued to be based on 100% of the sales volume. The
                    result was that better discounts could be offered by those in corporate sales
                    and this gave them an edge over those in retail sales. Although the plaintiffs
                    explained that the change in retail commissions was to take their overheads into
                    account, some retail sales staff felt that the corporate sales department was
                    favoured.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a>197    Both Mr Yau and Mr Dirk Foo
                    realised that the fear of retail sales staff about corporatisation had to be
                    allayed. On 28 May 2007, some three weeks after the Scottsdale retreat,
                    Mr Dirk Foo e-mailed Mr Yau as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I know that morale is a little down throughout the retail department and
                        it is starting to show in our production.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Some of the feedback I am getting and this is also from senior managers is
                        that Management seems disinterested in their work and they feel unimportant.
                            <em>Some even feel that we are actually going to replace
                            Retail</em>???</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This is stupid but I am willing to give them the benefit of doubt. I
                        intend to correct this and everything else that might stand in the way of
                        retail hitting their goal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a>198    On 8 June 2007, Mr Yau e-mailed
                    Mr Doherty to urge the latter to boost the morale of retail sales
                    staff:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For tomorrow message to the team, is to tell them [that retail sales] very
                        important to the Company is our baby.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I already told them the good [news] about Dirk is 100% focus in this
                        department….</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If you can say something great about [the retail sales] team, this will
                        really help.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_199"></a>199    The trimming of retail staff was discussed
                    at a meeting that Mr Yau had with Mr Doherty, Mr Baukol,
                    Mr Knight and Mr Dirk Foo on 11 June 2007. The following is a
                    noteworthy part of the minutes of the said meeting, at which Mr Yau
                    expressed his concern about the morale of retail staff:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Confidentially, some points were discussed in terms of
                            cutting down the number of sales personnel</em>. [Mr Yau]
                        feels that we should not affect the morale of the Direct Sales Division in
                        Asia at this time. He further expressed that Corporate Sales Division should
                        be hiring external consultants at this moment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The said paragraph in the minutes was marked with the following note:
                    “For information only (some sensitive issues not mentioned here)”.
                    There was no doubt that plans for culling the retail staff were discussed and
                    the fact that sensitive issues were not reflected in the minutes although they
                    were debated is rather telling.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200"></a>200    Instead of dealing effectively with the
                    lowered morale of retail sales staff, Mr Doherty ensured that Mr Dirk
                    Foo resigned in December 2007. In January 2008, Mr Yau
                resigned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201"></a>201    According to the defendants, the resentment
                    against corporatisation was further fuelled in January 2008 when Mr Doherty
                    expounded the virtues of corporate sales to an audience of predominantly retail
                    sales people at “Walton Vision” events in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur
                    and Kuching without mentioning anything about retail sales.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_202"></a>202    On 5 May 2008, Mr Iseli left Walton
                    Malaysia. Subsequently, 4 DMs from Walton Malaysia were suspended in
                    May/June 2008 while two others were suspended in June and then sacked. In
                    Singapore, Ms Loh, the Vice-President, Sales, was sacked on 29 May
                    2008. A former Walton Singapore staff, Mr Gary Tan, who had worked for
                    Walton in Hong Kong and seen the corporatisation of the Hong Kong office, was
                    sceptical about Mr Doherty’s assurances. He stated in his AEIC (at
                    para 15):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Given the resignations of [Mr Yau] and Dirk Foo, there had been
                        increased speculation amongst us about the corporatisation of Walton
                        Singapore. This was because it did not make sense for Walton Singapore to
                        let both these bosses who built up the retail sales go unless Walton
                        Singapore was reducing its reliance on retail sales and refocusing on
                        corporate sales.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_203"></a>203    When Mr Gary Tan filed an affidavit in
                    support of Mr Yau on 3 July 2008 to “state the facts from [his]
                    perspective”, he was promptly booted out of the company by
                    Mr Doherty, who accused him of breaching the mutual trust and confidence
                    between him and Walton by filing an affidavit for Mr Yau. In the
                    company’s termination letter dated 23 July 2008, Gary was accused of
                    a “flagrant breach” of the relationship of trust and fidelity by
                    filing an affidavit against the company. It has never been the law that there is
                    a breach of mutual trust and confidence merely because an employee has decided
                    to say what he believes to be the truth in an AEIC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_204"></a>204    Mr Yau asserted in his AEIC at para 136
                    that given that Mr Gary Tan, ex-DM Chong and Ms Loh, who had all filed
                    affidavits on his behalf, had their employment contracts with Walton Singapore
                    terminated, the message from the plaintiffs was that anyone who dared to speak
                    the truth in support of his case would have their livelihood threatened. The
                    plaintiffs’ own witness, DM Ong, testified that the sacking of
                    Mr Gary Tan possibly added to her apprehension as to what was going on in
                    Walton Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_205"></a>205    In mid-2008, Walton Malaysia’s former
                    Managing Director, Mr Murali, who had been demoted, left the company. Apart
                    from this, some 300 retail sales staff in Walton Malaysia had their contracts
                    terminated. Mr Doherty admitted that he did not know how many of them had
                    been sacked because of the malicious rumours allegedly spread by the defendants
                    and how many of them were just plainly incompetent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span> The
                    evidence was that only 6 of the sacked staff joined Mr Iseli’s new
                    company, but they had a right to work anywhere after Walton Malaysia had asked
                    them to leave. As for the balance of the 300 staff who did not join either
                    Mr Iseli or Mr Yau, only half of them were replaced. Mr Iseli
                    contended with some force that if there had been no plans to reduce the number
                    of retail sales staff, more of such staff would have been recruited to bring the
                    retail sales division to its former strength. The fact that this was not done
                    was, in his view, another indication of the move towards corporate sales.
                    According to the defendants, only a mere 38% of the retail sales team from
                    January 2008 were still employed as at July 2010. To them, this contradicts the
                    plaintiffs’ professed business strategy of increasing the size and quality
                    of their staff and shows the trend for the retail sales department. The
                    plaintiffs retorted that most of those booted out had not been productive sales
                    persons and the reduction in numbers had no effect on productivity. This
                    appeared to support what Mr Yau had warned of, namely that only those who
                    worked hard in retail sales and produced results would have secure
                jobs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_206"></a>206    Finally, the fact that the plaintiffs
                    instituted legal proceedings against the defendants and other former retail
                    sales staff in Singapore and Malaysia unnerved some staff. All these events
                    further lowered morale and fuelled for some the spectre of
                    corporatisation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_207"></a>207    Walton Malaysia’s Ms Linnet Tan
                    also testified that the resignation or sacking of top retail staff like
                    Mr Yau, Mr Dirk Foo, Mr Iseli and Ms Loh could have led some
                    of Walton Malaysia’s staff to feel that retail sales had “lost its
                    lustre”. The following part of her cross-examination<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_104" id="Ftn_104_1"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span> merits
                    attention:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">…. Whilst you may not think that Walton is
                            going corporate, there is good reason for the people on the ground to
                            feel that it’s going corporate. Fair enough?</span></p>

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Agree.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_208"></a>208    Mr Doherty complained that Mr Yau
                    was incapable of explaining to the retail staff the benefits of corporate sales.
                    He overlooked the fact that his other senior management staff were not able to
                    explain what was going on in the company to the retail staff after the departure
                    of Mr Yau. Mr Razak was honest enough to admit that the situation
                    could have been more properly handled and that some of the company’s
                    actions which were unconnected with Mr Yau or Mr Iseli had made his
                    retail sales staff insecure. When cross-examined, he stated<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span> as
                    follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_209"></a>209    I do not have to determine whether or not
                    Walton Singapore and Walton Malaysia were actually heading in the direction of
                    corporate sales at the expense of the retail sales staff. What was clear was
                    that the plaintiffs’ own policies regarding the corporate and retail sales
                    divisions had demoralised their retail sales staff and made them fear that the
                    company would focus on corporate sales, and especially so when Walton
                    Malaysia’s own senior executives had themselves raised the spectre of
                    corporatisation to keep their staff in check.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_210"></a>210    In any case, even if the defendants had
                    spread rumours, it was not established that these were malicious rumours. Unlike
                    a claim for defamation, a plaintiff who asserts that the defendant has spread
                    malicious rumours must prove malice. This key ingredient of the tort refers to a
                    dominant improper motive and the onus is on the plaintiffs to prove malice.
                    While Bowen LJ pointed out in <em>Edgington v
                        Fitzmaurice</em> (1885) 29 Ch D 459 at 483 that the state of a
                    man’s mind is as much a fact as the state of his digestion, he added that
                    it is very difficult to prove what the state of a man’s mind at a
                    particular time is. Furthermore, it is clear that the fact that a person
                    continues to assert his belief after he has been informed that it is without
                    foundation is, without more, not evidence of malice. In <em>Greers Ltd v Pearman and Corder Ltd</em> (1922) 39 RFC 406,
                    Scrutton LJ explained at p 417:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Honest belief in an unfounded claim is not malice; but the nature of the
                        unfounded claim may be evidence that there was not an honest belief in it.
                        It may be so unfounded that the particular fact that it is put forward may
                        be evidence that it is not honestly believed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_211"></a>211    The defendants contended that they believed
                    that the company was “going corporate”. On 7 April 2008, when
                    Mr Iseli was interviewed by the Interborder team, he was honest enough to
                    tell the investigators that if he was asked, he would say that the company was
                    “going corporate”. He added that he would say that if it was his
                    business, he could see himself pushing the corporate side. Significantly,
                    despite having heard from Mr Iseli that he would be saying, if asked, that
                    the company was headed the corporate way, the Interborder team concluded that
                    there nothing “untoward” in Walton Malaysia and no action was
                    taken against Mr Iseli. When cross-examined about why action had not been
                    taken against Mr Iseli at that time for “spreading” the
                    rumour that the company was “going corporate”, Mr Doherty had
                    no real answer as he stated as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_212"></a>212    Admittedly, the plaintiffs claimed that
                    Mr Yau wanted to stage a comeback to Walton Singapore and the event which
                    motivated his intention to injure was a note written by Mr Doherty to him
                    on 23 January 2008 to inform him that to assist him in determining his future
                    options, he ought to know that he would not be offered a senior executive
                    position or the position he resigned from should he wish to return to Walton
                    Singapore. This, they contended, crystallised his intention to hurt the
                    plaintiffs. It cannot be overlooked that the allegation that
                    Mr Doherty’s letter of 23 January crystallised
                    Mr Yau’s intention to harm the plaintiffs was not
                pleaded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_213"></a>213    Mr Yau insisted that this letter had no
                    effect on him. In fact, after receiving Mr Doherty’s note of
                    23 January 2008, Mr Yau, who understood that he was not to return to
                    Walton, cordially replied to the former on 25 January 2008 as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Yes, I got it yesterday noon and <em>I clearly understand

                        way to send a “wake up” call to each and everyone in the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_215"></a>215    While Mr Yau lost an annual income of
                    more than US$5million by resigning, he knew this when he resigned. In my view,
                    while there were many possibilities about Mr Yau’s intentions that
                    could interest a novelist, there was inadequate proof of malice on his part. As
                    for Mr Iseli, the allegation that he had acted with malice was backed by
                    even weaker evidence and need not be considered further.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_216"></a>216    Finally, yet another reason for dismissing
                    the plaintiffs’ claim regarding malicious falsehood is that there was no
                    proof of a causal connection between the alleged rumours and the
                    plaintiffs’ losses. Mr Doherty admitted that in so far as Walton
                    Malaysia was concerned, he did not know how many staff left because of the
                    alleged rumours and how many were asked to leave because of poor performance.
                    The lack of proof of loss will be discussed later on when the experts’
                    views on the computation of the plaintiffs’ alleged losses are
                    considered.</p>

                    Mr Iseli had said that Mr Yau had refused such an offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Unlawful Interference with Trade or Business</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_222"></a>222    The plaintiffs also claimed that the
                    defendants had unlawfully interfered with their trade or business. This is a
                    claim in tort for economic loss caused by intentional acts. In <em>OBG Ltd and another v Allan and others</em> [2008] 1 AC 1 at
                    19 (“<em>OBG Ltd</em>”), Lord Hoffman
                    explained the genesis of such a tort:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The tort of causing loss by unlawful means has a different history. It
                        starts with cases like <em>Garret v Taylor</em> (1620)
                        Cro Jac 567, in which the defendant was held liable because he drove away
                        customers of Headington Quarry by threatening them with mayhem and vexatious
                        suits. Likewise, in <em>Tarleton v M‘Gawley</em>
                        (1794) Peake 270 Lord Kenyon held the master of the <em>Othello</em>, anchored off the coast of West Africa, liable in
                        tort for depriving a rival British ship of trade by the expedient of using
                        his cannon to drive away a canoe which was approaching from the shore. In
                        such cases, there is no other wrong for which the defendant is liable as
                        accessory. Although the immediate cause of the loss is the decision of the
                        potential customer or trader to submit to the threat and not buy stones or
                        sell palm oil, he thereby commits no wrong. The defendant’s liability
                        is primary, for intentionally causing the plaintiff loss by unlawfully
                        interfering with the liberty of others.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_223"></a>223    The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants
                    interfered with their trade and business by soliciting the sales teams of Walton
                    Singapore and Walton Malaysia. Furthermore, it was alleged that Mr Yau
                    procured Mr Iseli’s breach of contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_224"></a>224    In regard to solicitation, the plaintiffs
                    pleaded in the Statement of Claim at para 97:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Mr Yau’s] unlawful interference disrupted the
                        Plaintiffs’ business, destabilized their workforce and led to the
                            1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>
                        Plaintiffs’ employees breaching their contracts, leaving the
                            1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>
                        Plaintiffs with no choice but to terminate their employment
                        contracts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_225"></a>225    As the plaintiffs’ allegation of
                    solicitation by the defendants was not proven, the assertion of unlawfully
                    interference with their trade or business by soliciting their staff need not be
                    further considered. In any case, the defendants cannot be held responsible for
                    the paranoia of the plaintiffs, which led to their termination of the contracts
                    of many of their retail sales staff. Mr Doherty admitted that all of his
                    employees who filed affidavits on the defendants’ behalf had been sued or
                        sacked.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span> When pressed, Walton Singapore’s

                        Consultants of Walton Malaysia to join [Mr Yau’s] new business.
                        Iseli’s acts were done at [Mr Yau’s] behest. [Mr Yau]
                        knew and intended that Iseli would act in breach of Iseli’s
                        contractual and fiduciary duties. [Mr Yau] therefore procured
                        Iseli’s breach of Iseli’s employment contract with Walton
                        Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_230"></a>230    In <em>Tribune Investment
                        Trust Inc v Soosan Trading Co Ltd</em> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 407,
                    the Court of Appeal stressed that an action for unlawful interference with trade
                    is different in substance from and should not be confused with a claim for
                    inducement of a breach of contract. The court stated (at [15] – 17]) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15    [T]he elements required to satisfy both causes of
                            action are separate and distinct. In other words, they are two
                            substantively different torts and should be treated as
                            such….</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16    The law relating to most of the economic torts is
                            clear. To knowingly procure or induce a third party to break his
                            contract to the damage of the other contracting party without reasonable
                            justification or excuse forms the basis of the tort of inducing a breach
                            of contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17     An act of inducement <em>per
                                se</em> is not by itself actionable. The plaintiff must
                            satisfy a two-fold requirement in order to found a sustainable cause of
                            action: first, he must show that the procurer acted with the requisite
                            knowledge of the existence of the contract (although knowledge of the
                            precise terms is not necessary); and second, that the procurer intended
                            to interfere with its performance. Intention in this case is to be
                            determined objectively. It is not sufficient that the resulting breach
                            of contract was a mere natural consequence of the defendant's
                            conduct….</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_231"></a>231    Liability for inducing breach of contract
                    was established in <em>Lumley v Gye</em> (1853)
                    2 E &amp; B 216, where the court relied on the general
                    principle that to procure another person to commit a wrong is to incur liability
                    as an accessory to the contracting party’s liability. However, as was
                    reiterated by Lord Hoffman in <em>OBG Ltd</em> at [19], liability depends upon the contracting
                    party having committed an actionable wrong. After all, in <em>Lumley v Gye</em>¸ Wightman J stressed at p
                    238 that Ms Wagner had unlawfully broken her contract and that the
                    defendant had procured the breach. In the present case, Mr Iseli had not
                    breached his contract of employment. Walton Malaysia’s boss,
                    Mr Razak, testified that his company had no evidence against Mr Iseli
                    when he was sacked on 5 May 2008. This was not surprising as Mr Iseli
                    had just been promoted and appointed Walton Malaysia’s Vice-President
                    Sales in February 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_232"></a>232    Although Walton Malaysia contended that
                    Mr Iseli had breached his employment contract and wanted him to resign, it
                    offered him a generous financial package worth around RM2 million to leave
                    provided he was prepared to testify against Mr Yau. Mr Iseli refused
                    the offer as he did not believe that Mr Yau had committed the wrongful acts
                    alleged by the plaintiffs. His counsel, Mr Looi Teck Kheong
                    (“Mr Looi”), rightly pointed out that it is absurd that the
                    plaintiffs should sue his client for refusing to accept a compensation package
                    which was highly favourable to him. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_112" id="Ftn_112_1"><sup>[note: 112]</sup></a></span> I agree.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_233"></a>233    When cross-examined, Mr Razak admitted
                    that the fact that Walton Malaysia had to offer Mr Iseli a generous
                    financial package to resign must mean that it did not have evidence to sack him.
                    He disclosed Walton Malaysia’s real agenda when he testified<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_113" id="Ftn_113_1"><sup>[note: 113]</sup></a></span> as

                    that he would not have left Walton Malaysia if his contract had not been
                    abruptly terminated by the company. He had reached a very comfortable position
                    in the company and was entitled to overriding commissions on both corporate and
                    retail sales. Praises had been heaped on him by Mr Doherty in January 2008
                    and he had been promoted in February 2008. From February 2008 until he was
                    sacked on 5 May 2008, he had tried to convince Walton Malaysia’s
                    bosses to improve the commission of the retail staff and had planned incentive
                    trips for the retail sales staff. When cross-examined, Mr Knight agreed
                    that pushing for an increase in the commission of Walton Malaysia’s retail
                    sales staff would run against the grain of someone whose intention was to
                    solicit them to leave the company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_115" id="Ftn_115_1"><sup>[note: 115]</sup></a></span> Mr Yau stated that
                    Mr Iseli had his own mind and had criticised management even when he was a
                    part of the management of Walton’s business in Asia. He added that it was
                    ridiculous for anyone to believe that Mr Iseli would forsake his annual
                    income of RM2 million when he had no concrete plans to offer to the latter. When
                    asked why Mr Iseli would give up his lucrative job, Mr Baukol replied
                    that a person might do that out of loyalty to a friend. There was no evidence
                    that Mr Iseli would give up his extremely high salary out of loyalty to
                    Mr Yau.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_237"></a>237    When Mr Iseli met Walton Malaysia
                    retail staff, he heard their grievances and it is quite likely that he voiced
                    his own grievances as well. From such meetings emerged a “wish
                    list” that was presented to the management on 8 April 2008. That wish
                    list solved one outstanding grouse of the retail staff, namely the commissions
                    payable to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_238"></a>238    I have already found that Mr Iseli did
                    not solicit the plaintiffs’ staff and had not unlawfully interfered with
                    the plaintiffs’ trade and I now find that he was not in breach of his
                    employment contract when he was sacked. As such, the question of procuring his
                    breach of contract did not arise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Breach of Confidence and Misuse of Confidential Information</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_239"></a>239    In regard to breach of confidence, the
                    plaintiffs alleged that while Mr Yau discussed with Mr Foo the
                    latter’s forthcoming promotion to the post of Managing Director of Walton
                    Singapore, he revealed to the latter information regarding Walton
                    Singapore’s restructuring plans. Mr Yau, who had been tasked to
                    discuss with Mr Foo the latter’s promotion to such a senior post,
                    should not be faulted for mentioning the company’s forthcoming
                    restructuring plans to the incoming Managing Director. Although Mr Foo had
                    suggested in his AEIC that Mr Yau had revealed confidential information to
                    him, the thrust of his testimony was that he was surprised that he had not been
                    kept in the loop about the restructuring plans. He testified as
                        follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_117" id="Ftn_117_1"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_240"></a>240    If all the circumstances are taken into
                    account, there was no doubt that the plaintiffs’ complaint that
                    Mr Yau had breached his employment contract by revealing the restructuring
                    plans to Mr Foo lacked substance and must be dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_241"></a>241    As for the allegation of misuse of
                    confidential information, the plaintiffs asserted that Mr Yau’s
                    contract imposed a duty on him not to use or disclose any confidential
                    information to any third party. They pleaded that he was intimately familiar
                    with the details of Walton’s business “at the highest level”
                    and that his possession of extremely valuable and sensitive information about
                    their plans, competitive strategies and clients gave him a significant advantage
                    when handling the competing business that he had intended to set up. They
                    further pleaded that in attempting to solicit the sales teams of Walton
                    Singapore and Walton Malaysia to join him, Mr Yau intended to gain access
                    to their clients’ identities and financial positions for the purpose of
                    his new business. The plaintiffs claimed that Mr Yau did not succeed in
                    using the confidential information because they commenced proceedings against
                    him. The problem with the plaintiffs’ case was that it was not proven that
                    Mr Yau had solicited their staff to join his new company. Furthermore, none
                    of the retail sales staff who left Walton Singapore or Walton Malaysia,
                    including senior staff such as Ms Loh and ex-DM Chong, joined
                    Mr Yau’s business and there was no evidence that he had attempted to
                    use any of the plaintiffs’ confidential information. As such, the issue of
                    breach of confidence or misuse of confidential information by Mr Yau need
                    not be further considered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_242"></a>242    For completeness, it may also be noted that
                    the plaintiffs also complained that Mr Yau was in breach when he tried to
                    discourage Mr Foo from accepting the proposed promotion but their witnesses
                    furnished far too many versions of this incident to merit any serious
                    consideration of the allegation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_243"></a>243    In the case of Mr Iseli, there was no
                    serious attempt to show that he misused confidential information or that there
                    was a breach of confidence. As such, these issues need not be considered in
                    relation to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Alleged Conspiracy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_244"></a>244    In view of my findings, the
                    plaintiffs’ allegation of conspiracy on the part of the defendants really
                    has no leg to stand on. Even so, it will be referred to briefly. The
                    plaintiffs’ case was summed up at para 1093 of their closing submissions
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Yau and Iseli acted in concert to propagate the Corporatisation
                        Allegations. There was clearly an agreement between them to propagate the
                        Corporatisation Allegations and solicit the Plaintiffs’ employees as
                        can be seen from the lunches, dinners and meetings through which Iseli
                        arranged for Yau to meet the Plaintiffs’ employees, and to give Yau
                        access to them. Both of them propagated the Corporatisation Allegations and
                        solicited the Plaintiffs’ sales staff pursuant to such
                        agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_245"></a>245    What constitutes a conspiracy was explained
                    in <em>Seagate Technology Pte Ltd and another v Goh Han
                        Kim</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 836 by the Court of Appeal (at
                        [15]) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The essence of conspiracy is an agreement, and the question is whether the
                        appellants had proved that there was in existence an agreement or at least
                        some arrangement ... and a high degree of proof is required.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_246"></a>246    Admittedly, it is often difficult to prove
                    the existence of a conspiracy and one must be mindful of the following words of
                    Chao Hick Tin JA in <em>Asian Corporate Services (SEA) Pte
                        Ltd v Eastwest Management Ltd (Singapore Branch)</em> [2006]
                    1 SLR(R) 901 (at [19]) that it
                    is not often that the victim of a conspiracy has direct evidence to prove the
                    allegation and that proof of conspiracy is normally inferred from other
                    objective facts. He approved of the following passage from <em>R
                        v Siracusa</em> (1990) 90 Cr App R 340 at
                    349:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he origins of all conspiracies are concealed and it is usually quite
                        impossible to establish when or where the initial agreement was made, or
                        when or where other conspirators were recruited. The very existence of the
                        agreement can only be inferred from overt acts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_247"></a>247    Although the plaintiffs contended that the
                    defendants had conspired against them by lawful and unlawful means, they did not
                    even begin to prove the existence of any agreement between Mr Yau and
                    Mr Iseli to harm them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_248"></a>248    The plaintiffs hired four private
                    investigation firms in Singapore and Malaysia. In Singapore, the plaintiffs
                    hired two private investigation companies, Sterling Response Pte Ltd and
                    Goldeneye Investigation and Security Services. In Malaysia, Walton Malaysia
                    engaged two private investigation companies, namely Armoured Protection &amp;
                    Investigation Services Sdn Bhd and Commercial Intelligence Services Sdn Bhd.
                    According to Mr Britton, the investigators had been called in “to
                    find out if there was collusion going on, to find out if there was a plan to
                    steal our people away”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_118" id="Ftn_118_1"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span> All of them found no
                    evidence of a conspiracy. Mr Britton admitted that there was nothing in the
                    reports furnished by all these investigators to support the allegations against
                    the defendants or else the evidence would have been presented to the
                        court.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_119" id="Ftn_119_1"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_249"></a>249    Mr Yau’s counsel, Mr Tan,
                    submitted that as conspiracy was an issue that formed the crux of the
                    plaintiffs’ case, the fact that the defendants had not been asked probing
                    questions about the alleged conspiracy was fatal to the allegation of
                    conspiracy. In fact, in relation to the lunch and dinner in Singapore, which was
                    the foundation of the plaintiffs’ allegation of solicitation of their
                    Singapore DMs, Walton Singapore’s then Managing Director, Mr Foo,
                    conceded that there was no evidence of a conspiracy as he testified that in the
                    course of the investigations prior to the sacking of Ms Loh, there was no
                    evidence to suggest that the lunch and dinner had been organised pursuant to an
                    agreement between Mr Yau and Mr Iseli. Furthermore, Mr Doherty
                    agreed that in the AEICs of his witnesses, DM Yao and DM Ong, the only reference
                    to Mr Iseli in relation to the lunch and dinner was that he was present and
                    neither of these two DMs had alleged that Mr Yau and Mr Iseli
                    were involved in a conspiracy.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_120" id="Ftn_120_1"><sup>[note: 120]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_250"></a>250    In view of the aforesaid and my earlier
                    findings in relation to solicitation as well as other allegations by the
                    plaintiffs, I dismiss the allegation of conspiracy on the part of Mr Yau
                    and Mr Iseli.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">No proof of loss caused by the Defendants</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_251"></a>251    As I have found that the plaintiffs did not
                    prove their case against the defendants, the question of computation of damages
                    does not arise. Even so, it may be pointed out that had the plaintiffs succeeded
                    in their claim, they had not proven their loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_252"></a>252    As the trial was not bifurcated, it was
                    imperative that the plaintiffs prove their alleged losses at the trial. The
                    plaintiffs claimed the following as damages:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Between US$10.4 million to US$15.3 million for
                            loss of profits from lost retail sales allegedly suffered by Walton
                            Malaysia; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">US$4.01 million for costs and expenses allegedly
                            incurred to deal with the alleged unlawful acts of the defendants and
                            Ms Loh.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_253"></a>253    Many aspects of the plaintiffs’ claim
                    for damages and for expenses allegedly incurred to deal with the
                    defendants’ wrongful acts cannot be taken too seriously. For instance, the
                    plaintiffs claimed the costs incurred by private investigators hired by them
                    although nothing had been uncovered to show that the defendants had conspired to
                    undermine the plaintiffs’ interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_254"></a>254    The main part of the plaintiffs’ claim
                    for damages is in relation to the loss allegedly caused to Walton Malaysia by
                    the defendants in 2008. The plaintiffs’ expert, Mr Tam from Deloitte,
                    computed Walton Malaysia’s losses on the following specified
                    assumptions:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(i)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">there is a correlation between the sales
                            performance of Walton Singapore and Walton Malaysia;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(ii)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">the performance of these two companies must be
                            the same in 2008;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(iii)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">there was no significant reduction in Walton

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(iv)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">there were no other factors contributing to
                            Walton Malaysia’s poor performance in 2008.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">All these assumptions were fundamentally flawed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Alleged correlation between performance of the two
                companies</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_255"></a>255    According to the Deloitte report, there was
                    a correlation between the performance of Walton Malaysia and Walton Singapore
                    for 3 years, between 2005 and 2007. It noted that retail sales in Singapore
                    continued to record positive growth in 2008 and the revenues increased by 33.2%
                    to US$104.9 million. However, retail sales in Malaysia declined significantly by
                    38.6% to only US$36.4 million. Based on the assumptions in the Deloitte report,
                    Walton Malaysia claimed to have suffered losses amounting to US$10.4 million to
                    US$15.3 million and also sought damages for loss of time, costs and expenses
                    incurred to counter the alleged machinations of the defendants there and in
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_256"></a>256    The defendants’ two expert witnesses,
                    Mr Tay from KPMG and Dr Chan from La Trobe University, did not see why an
                    assumption should be made that Walton Malaysia’s performance in 2008 must
                    match that of Walton Singapore. Mr Tay said that that any attempt to
                    quantify Walton Malaysia’s alleged loss in 2008 purely or largely on the
                    basis of the sales of Walton Singapore and Walton Malaysia from January 2005 to
                    December 2007 was necessarily speculative. He stated in his report at para
                    6.1.1:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I] do not believe that the method adopted in [Deloitte’s report]

                        main reasons:</p>

                            be moving towards meeting personal expenditure, keeping cash and
                            deposits and making investments locally rather than

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_257"></a>257    Dr Chan said that it was naive to suggest

                    Deloitte. He also lambasted the biased selection by Deloitte of the years of
                    alleged correlation. Furthermore, he said that a model with relevant predictors
                    may not necessarily correspond to a “correct model”, such that
                    cause and effect may be established. He testified as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Now I think it’s over simplistic to base a judgment on the Singapore
                        sales. We should look at other factors which are relevant to this analysis.
                        We should look at the economic social conditions in Malaysia before we can
                        make a good judgment, otherwise my impression from [the Deloitte report] is
                        that the conclusion is very hasty, a lot of details were not provided, and
                        it’s … a very simple tool and in this case, I don’t think
                        it’s sufficient to provide the evidence to suggest that … the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_258"></a>258    As has been mentioned, although the
                    plaintiffs accused Mr Yau of undermining both Walton Singapore and Walton
                    Malaysia in 2008, Walton Singapore made record profits in that year while Walton
                    Malaysia did not match Walton Singapore’s sterling performance. If
                    Mr Yau had wanted to sabotage the plaintiffs, it is more likely than not
                    that his efforts would be more successful in Singapore than in Malaysia. That
                    his influence is greater in Singapore was conceded by Mr Doherty, who, when
