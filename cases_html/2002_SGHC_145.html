<p xmlns="">impaired his better judgment and control. Dr Phang added that however impaired though the

accused’s judgment might have been at and around the material time, he still retained

sufficient mental capacity to be capable of forming an intent to cause the injuries in

question. Dr Phang noted that the accused had a history of epilepsy dating back to 1983

and his seizures were not optimally controlled in spite of treatment, with recurrences on

a regular basis. The accused would have a predilection towards behaving violently and

dangerously when in an epileptic seizure. Dr Phang concluded that the accused would

require treatment and close follow-up on a permanent basis.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">        The accused pleaded guilty

and was convicted for the offence of committing culpable homicide not amounting to murder

under s 304(a) of the Penal Code, Cap 224. The sole issue before the court was what was

the appropriate sentence to be imposed in this case where the accused was found to be

suffering from a mental condition which required treatment on a permanent basis.</p>

cases. It would appear from the cases that the courts have imposed sentences of life

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">1.        Lim Hock

Hin, a 42-year old male Singaporean pleaded guilty before me and was convicted for an

offence of committing culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 304 (a) of the

Penal Code (Cap 224). The charge he faced averred that he slashed his 65-year old mother

with a knife at about 11.30 am, on 13 November 2001 with the intention of causing bodily

hurt as was likely to cause death and caused her to suffer death on 20 November 2001.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">2.        The facts

which gave rise to the present proceedings can be summarised as follows.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">3.        The accused

and his mother Mdm Tan Ah Pong were residing at a flat at Block 12 Redhill Close, #01-106,

Singapore. At about 11.30 am, on 13 November 2001, the accused had an argument with his

mother in their flat over the whereabouts of a pearl bracelet given to him by someone. In

the course of the altercation, he started pushing his mother in the chest continuously.

When his mother was trying to placate him by saying that she could not recall where she

had placed the bracelet, the accused started to become violent. He first used a chair and

later other objects which he could get hold of from the kitchen to hit and hurt her. When

his mother continued to protest that she could not recall where the bracelet was, the

accused suddenly seized a knife found nearby and slashed her, causing her to fall.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">4.        It would

appear that after Mdm Tan was hurt, she somehow managed to find her way to her

neighbour’s flat and informed her neighbour that her son had stabbed her with a

knife. The neighbour then called the police.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">5.        The

accused, in the meantime, fled the flat in panic. However, as he reached the top floor of

a nearby block of flats, he felt that his mother might still be alive. He then decided to

return home and he did.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">6.        Upon his

return, the accused noticed the presence of police officers as well as his siblings

outside the flat. Presently, he asked the police the condition of his mother and was told

that she was all right. He was soon arrested and sent to hospital for treatment as he was

found to have injured his right hand.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">7.        The

post-mortem finding of Dr Wee Kheng Poh, Consultant Forensic Pathologist from the Centre

for Forensic Medicine, Health Sciences Authority, was that the cause of the death of the

victim was bronchopneumonia with hypoxic encephalopathy following a slash wound of the

neck. The post-mortem report also listed a number of injuries to the victim’s head,

neck, chest, abdomen and arms.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">8.        The accused

was, in the event, sent to Woodbridge Hospital for a psychiatric assessment. In the

opinion of Dr Stephen Phang, Consultant Psychiatrist from Woodbridge Hospital and the

Institute of Mental Health, the accused was suffering from an acute epileptic seizure at

the time of the offence which significantly impaired his better judgment and impulse

control, to the extent that he attacked his mother fatally as a direct consequence of his

malady, which he would not have done had he not had a fit that morning. Dr Phang added

that ‘however impaired though his judgement may have been at and around the material

time, he still retained sufficient mental capacity to be capable of forming an intent to

cause the injuries in question’.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">9.        Further,

according to Dr Phang, the accused retained the mental capacity to know that his act was

likely to cause death, although unfortunately, his mental responsibility was significantly

diminished at and around the material time, qualifying him for the defence of diminished

responsibility. Dr Phang noted that the accused had a history of epilepsy dating back to

1983 and his seizures were still not optimally controlled in spite of treatment, with

recurrences on a regular basis. He commented further that when in the throes of an

epileptic seizure, the accused would have a predilection towards behaving violently and

dangerously. He concluded that the accused required treatment and close follow-up on a

permanent basis.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">10.        The sole

question before the court was what was the appropriate sentence to be imposed in this case

where the accused was found to be suffering from a mental condition which required

treatment on a permanent basis.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">11.        Section

304(a) of the Penal Code provides that:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">        Whoever

    commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder shall be punished with imprisonment for

    life, or imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to

    fine or to caning, if the act by which death is caused is done with the intention of

    causing death, or of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">12.        Defence

counsel in his mitigation plea urged the court not to impose a sentence of life

imprisonment on the accused. In this regard, he invited my attention to the view expressed

by defence psychiatrist, Dr Y C Lee who said that he ‘<i>believed that</i> <i>if the

epilepsy of the accused is well controlled and his psychosis is kept in remission with

medications, he[ would be] able to live a normal life and would not be a danger to others</i>.’

It was all well said but the question remained as to who was going to ensure the control

and treatment regimen suggested by Dr Lee. The sad fact was that his mother who was

residing with him was gone forever because of his sudden violence.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">13.        The

learned DPP in his submission said that the belief expressed by the defence psychiatrist

appeared to be predicated by a number of ‘ifs’ and ‘buts’ and urged

the court to take public interest into consideration. He reiterated Dr Phang’s

prognosis that the accused required treatment and close follow-up on a permanent basis due

to his continuing predilection towards violent and dangerous behaviour and the attendant

danger to the public and those who would be in immediate contact with him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">14.        In

relation to the sentence to be imposed, my attention was invited to the sentences imposed

by the High Court in the recent few years. Eight cases were cited and they were: <i><b>Public

public were not imaginary but real. In any event, in my view, the conditions for a long

sentence set out in <i><b>R v Rowland Jack Foster Hodgson</b></i> (1968) 52 Cr App R 113

(per MacKenna J) and approved by the Court of Criminal Appeal in <i><b>Neo Man Lee v

Public Prosecutor</b></i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=4986&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1991] 2 MLJ 369</a> at 370, by and large seemed to apply to the

facts and circumstances of the case at hand. The conditions mentioned in <i><b>Hodgson</b></i>

were:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3">       

    A sentence of life imprisonment is justified when (1) the offence or offences are in

    themselves grave enough to require a very long sentence; (2) it appears from the nature of

    the offences or from the defendant’s history that he is unstable and likely to commit

    such offences in the future; and (3) if the offences are committed the consequences to

    others may be specially injurious, as in the case of sexual offences or crimes of

    violence.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3">18.        

Consequently, having considered all the factors, I sentenced the accused to a term of

imprisonment for life with a direction that the accused be given treatment on a regular

basis for his illness whilst serving his sentence. In imposing the sentence, I was also

mindful of the aspect that under Rule 119A of the Prisons Regulations, the accused might

well receive a remission of sentence if the Life Imprisonment Review Board were to

conclude at the appropriate stage that he would be suitable for such remission.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3">Order accordingly.</font></p></i>
