        By an Option to Purchase dated 21 August 2002

(‘the Option’), the Defendant Chan Lee Pa (‘CLP’) granted the

Plaintiffs Fong Yoke San and Kwok Sing Cheong an option to purchase a property known as No

50 Jalan Lembah Thomson Singapore 577520 (‘the Property’) at a price of $1.15

million. The option fee was $11,500 and the expiry time and date for the exercise of the

Option was 4pm of 18 September 2002.</font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2.        The

Plaintiffs’ solicitors subsequently made a title search of the Property which

revealed that there were three owners of the Property who were joint tenants thereof:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a) CLP</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(b) Chan Tze Wun (who is the son

    of CLP)</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(c) Wong Kim Hoo (who is the wife

    of CLP)</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3.        The

Plaintiffs’ solicitors wrote to CLP’s solicitors on 17 September 2002 asserting

that because there were three joint tenants of the Property and the Option was given and

signed by CLP only, the Option was incomplete and unperfected. Accordingly, they demanded

the return of the option fee i.e $11,500.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4.        

CLP’s solicitors replied on 18 September 2002 stating that the other two owners

‘are at all times able, willing and ready to sign the said Option’.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5.        I

would add that apparently the two housing agents involved had arranged an appointment at

6.30pm on 17 September 2002 for the Plaintiffs to meet CLP and the other two owners for

the other two owners to sign the Option but that appointment was cancelled. However, it

was not clear whether the appointment was fixed with the knowledge of the Plaintiffs

before it was cancelled. Furthermore, as CLP’s Counsel, Ms Lee Mong Jen, did not rely

on estoppel or waiver, I need say no more about this appointment.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6.        The

Plaintiffs did not exercise the Option and the option fee was forfeited. The Property was

eventually sold to another purchaser at a price of $1.11 million i.e $40,000 less than the

price stated in the Option. The Plaintiffs brought this action to claim the repayment of

the option fee of $11,500. After hearing arguments, I dismissed the Plaintiffs’ claim

with costs. I now give my written reasons.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Arguments and my reasons</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7.        Mr

Lim Kim Song, Counsel for both the Plaintiffs, submitted that as CLP was the only one of

the three joint tenants to sign the Option, the Option was incomplete and unperfected. He

relied heavily on the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Mookka Pillai Rajagopal &amp;

Ors v Khushvinder Singh Chopra</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=10402&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1996] 3 SLR 457</a>. However, it is important to

understand the facts there.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8.        In

that case, there were three joint tenants of a property known as 91 Jalan Seaview. The

first appellant was the father of the second appellant. The third appellant was the wife

of the second appellant. An option was granted to the respondent to purchase this

property, the respondent being an advocate and solicitor. The option was expressed to be

given by the three appellants but only the second and third appellants signed it (see p

459 at G of the law report). It was on these facts that L P Thean JA said at p 462:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘The option was intended to

    be given and signed by the three appellants, who held and still hold the property as joint

    tenants. It was signed by only two of them. Neither of them purported to sign the option

    on behalf of the first appellant. It was an incomplete or unperfected option and was

    ineffective as an option to the respondent to purchase the property. It follows from this

    that when the respondent exercised the option on 25 October 1993 there did not arise an

    agreement between the appellants and the respondent for the sale and purchase of the

    property. At any rate, the option was certainly not binding on the first appellant, and on

    that date there was no agreement binding on him to sell or join in the sale of the

    property to the respondent, whatever might be the effect of the agreement, if any, that

    was made between on the one hand the respondent and on the other hand the second and third

    appellants - we shall refer to this as the unperfected agreement - and their liability

    thereunder.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9.        At p

467, Thean JA also said:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘…. The option signed

    by the second and third appellants were an incomplete or unperfected option and the

    respondent’s purported exercise thereof did not result in an agreement. At any rate,

    assuming that by the exercise of the option, a binding agreement was made with the second

    and third appellants, the agreement was not binding on the first appellant. The property

    being held by the three appellants as joint tenants, such an agreement was not effective

    to dispose of the entire property in favour of the respondent. The respondent would have

    serious difficulty in enforcing the agreement even as against the second and third

    appellants. It seems to us that, at the most, he would be able to recover only the

    consideration paid for the option.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10.        

Relying on the passage I have cited from p 467, Mr Lim submitted that the Option before me

was also incomplete and unperfected. However, it seemed to me that in <i>Mookka Pillai</i>,

the option was incomplete and unperfected because it purported to emanate from all three

joint tenants but only two had signed. Even then, Thean JA was prepared to consider the

possibility that it might still constitute a binding agreement on the second and third

appellants. I would add that in <i>Mookka Pillai</i>, the main substantive issue before

the Court of Appeal was whether the respondent purchaser had exercised undue influence on

the appellants or any one or more of them (see p 462 at B of the law report). Indeed both

Ms Lee and Mr Lim informed me that the three cases listed in p 458 of the law report were

on undue influence.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11.        In

the course of submissions, Ms Lee also drew my attention to another decision of our Court

of Appeal in <i>Tay Joo Sing v Ku Yu Sang </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=8766&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1994] 3 SLR 719</a>. In that case, two brothers

Tay Joo Sing and Tay Joo Meng were tenants-in-common in equal shares of a commercial unit

in Lucky Plaza, Orchard Road, Singapore, known as B1-124 (‘No 124’). They had

tried to sell No 124 as far back as 1985 but were not successful. Joo Meng then emigrated

to Australia and left the sale to Joo Sing. Eventually Joo Sing purported to sell No 124

to a purchaser Ku Yu Sang. For this purpose, a document prepared by a property broker was

signed. It was referred to as ‘PB1’ and it stated:</font>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The number of ‘B1-24’

should have referred to ‘B1-124’ but this was not material.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12.        On

4 May 1987, Joo Sing’s solicitors informed Yu Sang’s solicitors that he was not

agreeable to selling the property to Yu Sang and the cheque for $5,000 was returned.

However, Yu Sang would not accept this position and, on his instructions, his solicitors

sent to Joo Sing’s solicitors a cheque for $42,000 being the balance of the 10% of

the purchase price, in accordance with his understanding of the agreement reached with Joo

Sing on 2 May 1987 and also retendered the earlier cheque for $5,000. On 16 May 1987, Joo

Sing’s solicitors returned both cheques to Yu Sang’s solicitors. Yu Sang’s

attempts to resolve the dispute not being successful, he commenced action on 30 June 1989.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13.        Yu

Sang’s claim was firstly against both brothers for specific performance and secondly

against Joo Sing for specific performance of Joo Sing’s undivided half share in No

124, and damages.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14.        Joo

Sing denied that he had represented to Yu Sang that Joo Meng had authorised him to sell No

124. He also raised other defences but it is not necessary for me to specify them.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15.        On

these facts, the Court of Appeal found that looking at PB1 alone, Joo Sing had offered to

sell No 124 to Yu Sang for $470,000 on his own behalf as well as on behalf of Joo Meng

(see p 727 at I of the law report).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16.        

Apparently this case was not cited to the Court of Appeal in <i>Mookka Pillai</i>. In any

event, it also appears that in <i>Tay Joo Sing</i>, no argument was made to the effect

that PB1 was in fact an incomplete and unperfected option on the ground that it purported

to emanate from two persons but was signed by only one of them. Indeed, Joo Sing did not

sign twice i.e once for himself and once on behalf of Joo Meng. Had that argument been

raised, the Court of Appeal might have concluded that PB1 was incomplete and unperfected

or that such an option might be binding only on the person signing it.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17.        In

the case before me, the facts were different from those in <i>Tay Joo Sing</i> and <i>Mookka

Pillai</i>. The Option did not purport to emanate from all three joint tenants but one

only i.e CLP. True he did not have full title to the Property but, in my view, that was a

separate matter. The beginning of the Option stated:</font></p>

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19.        In

my view, the Option was complete and binding on CLP as a contract. Had the Plaintiffs

exercised the Option, CLP would have been obliged to complete the sale and purchase by

procuring the other two joint tenants to execute the instrument of transfer together with

him. If he could not do so, he would have been in breach of contract vis--vis the

Plaintiffs who would have been entitled to sue him for damages.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20.        On

the last point, Mr Lim submitted that in <i>Mookka Pillai</i>, Thean JA had said that the

purchaser would be able to recover only the consideration paid for the option. However, it

must be borne in mind that this was because the primary view there in respect of that

option was that that option was incomplete and unperfected. If an option was complete and

valid, I did not see why the person who had the benefit of the option would be unable to

sue on it.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21.        

Indeed, that was the outcome in <i>Malhotra v Choudhury</i> [1979] 1 All ER 186, which Ms

Lee relied on. In that case, an option to purchase a property was granted by the defendant

to the plaintiff but the property was owned by the defendant and his wife as joint

tenants. The plaintiff gave notice that he intended to exercise the option but the

defendant asserted that the option was not exercisable and refused to sell the property.

The plaintiff then commenced an action seeking specific performance of the option.

Eventually, the defendant was ordered by the English Court of Appeal to pay substantial

damages.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22.        Mr

Lim also sought to rely on s 6(d) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43) which states:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘6. No action shall be

    brought against -</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(d) any person upon any contract

      for the sale or other disposition of immovable property, or any interest in such property;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(e) ….</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">unless the promise or agreement

    upon which such action is brought, or some memorandum or note thereof, is in writing and

    signed by the party to be charged therewith or some other person lawfully authorised by

    him.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23.        In

my view, this provision did not assist the Plaintiffs. If they had exercised the Option

and if CLP was unable to complete the sale, the Plaintiffs would have been able to bring

an action against CLP, although not against the other two joint tenants. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24.        It

seemed to me that the existence of a valid contract should not be confused with its

performance. In my view, it is not necessary for a person granting the option to be the

full legal owner of the property in question at the time the option is granted or when the

option is exercised, before the option can be said to be binding on him.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25.        For

example, if, A, the owner of a property, grants an option to purchase to B and before B

exercises the option, B grants an option to purchase to C, there is a binding obligation

on B vis--vis C even though B is not the legal owner of the property.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">26.        In

addition, even if B does not have a legally enforceable right against A at the time B

grants an option to purchase to C, there is still a binding obligation on B vis--vis C.

Therefore, if, for example, A is the mother of B and A tells B that she will give or sell

a property in Singapore to him when she returns to Singapore in four weeks’ time, B

does not need to wait for A to return to Singapore, although it would be prudent for him

to do so in case something happens to A or A changes her mind. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">27.        On

the other hand, in some cases, it may be obvious after an option is granted that the

person granting the option will not be able to complete the sale in any event. For

example, the person granting the option is not the owner of the property and has no

contractual or other relationship with the owner which will cause the owner to complete

the sale. In such a case, there might be an anticipatory breach of contract by the person

granting the option, but the point is that there is a binding obligation on him which

entitles the other contracting party to sue him if he defaults. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">28.        On

the facts before me, it was not suggested that CLP would be unable to complete the sale

since the other two joint tenants had made it clear that they were able, willing and ready

to be parties to the Option and consequently to complete the sale, if the Option was

exercised. Instead, the Plaintiffs’ argument was that the Option was incomplete and
