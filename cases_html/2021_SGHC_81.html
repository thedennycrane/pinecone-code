In January 2018, the plaintiff commenced enforcement proceedings under s 46 of the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed) read with O 69 r 14 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed). In February 2018, the plaintiff duly secured leave to enforce both awards against IL in the same manner as judgments of the High Court to the same effect.

</div> The first defendant ignored the order for examination. A warrant was accordingly issued for his arrest. He was eventually found in contempt of court. He was fined $8,000 or eight days’ imprisonment in default and ordered to pay the costs of the committal proceedings to the plaintiff on the indemnity basis. The first defendant avoided imprisonment by paying the fine. The first defendant did, however, cooperate in that he gave IL’s financial documents to the second defendant, who produced them to the plaintiff in the enforcement proceedings. Those documents disclosed that IL had nothing of value against which the plaintiff could levy execution.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable legislation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The trial of this action took place in November 2020. This judgment is delivered in April 2021. Section 340(1) of the Act was in force when the plaintiff commenced this action. With effect from 30 July 2020, however, s 340(1) of the Act was repealed and replaced by s 238(1) of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 (Act 40 of 2018) (“the IRDA”). The plaintiff’s claim for relief is therefore being decided at a time when s 340(1) of the Act is no longer in force. The question which arises is whether it is s 340(1) of the Act or s 238(1) of the IRDA which applies to the plaintiff’s claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The IRDA makes transitional provisions for corporate insolvency in s 526 and s 527. These transitional provisions allow the Act to continue to apply in specified circumstances to certain applications, orders, windings up and persons as though the IRDA had not been enacted. An application under s 340(1) of the Act does not come within either s 526 or s 527 of the IRDA. That suggests on its face that the parties’ rights and liabilities in issue in this action are governed with effect from 30 July 2020 by s 238(1) of the IRDA instead of s 340(1) of the Act. But it would be in principle wrong for rights and liabilities which arose in or around July 2015 to be governed retrospectively by legislation which was not to come into effect until more than five years later. “Simple fairness” is the basis for the presumption against the retrospective application of legislation: <span class="font-italic">ABU v Comptroller of Income Tax</span> [2015] 2 SLR 420 at [73], citing <span class="font-italic">L’Office</span><span class="font-italic"> Chefifien Des Phosphates v Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship Co Ltd </span>[1994] 1 AC 486 at 525.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Fortunately, s 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) operates to ensure that s 340(1) of the Companies Act continues to apply to this action.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> It is true that IL is not “in the course of … winding up” within the meaning of s 340(1) of the Act. In fact, IL is not and has never been the subject of any winding up proceedings, whether initiated by the plaintiff, by another creditor or even voluntarily. Presumably, IL’s assets are so meagre that the costs of winding it up and appointing a liquidator are unjustifiable even to its shareholders, let alone to a creditor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 But this is not a reason for dismissing the plaintiff’s action <span class="font-italic">in limine</span>. The express language of s 340(1) allows an applicant to seek declaratory relief under s 340(1) of the Act if the fraudulent trading appears <span class="font-italic">either</span> “in the course of the winding up of a company” <span class="font-italic">or</span> “in any proceedings against a company”. If authority is needed for what is plain on the face of the section, it can be found in <span class="font-italic">Aquariva</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Gezel Group Pte Ltd and another</span> [2017] SGHCR 14 at [30]–[31].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The legislative history of s 340(1) confirms that a winding up is deliberately <span class="font-italic">not</span> a condition precedent to an application under s 340(1) of the Act. Section 340(1) of the Act is derived from s 304(1) of the Malaysian Companies Act 1965. The Malaysian section is derived from s 304(1) of the Victorian Companies Act 1961. The Victorian section is derived from s 332(1) of the English Companies Act 1948 (c 38). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The alternative phrase “or in any proceedings against a company” did not appear in either the English or the Victorian equivalents of s 340(1) of the Act. The Malaysian legislature introduced this phrase into s 304(1) of the Malaysian Companies Act 1965 in response to a recommendation made in 1962 by the  Company Law Committee chaired by Lord Jenkins in the UK: see Malaysia, Senate, <span class="font-italic">Parliamentary Debates</span> (16 August 1965), vol 2 at col 769 (Lim Swee Aun, Minister of Commerce and Industry). The Jenkins Committee noted that the English equivalent of s 340(5) of the Act framed too narrowly the liability of a person who uses a company to defraud its creditors: United Kingdom, <span class="font-italic">Report of the Company Law Committee</span> (Cmnd 1749, 1962) at paras 497, 499 (Chairman: Lord Jenkins). The Jenkins Committee therefore recommended at para 503(c) that it be “made clear that [the English equivalent of s 340(5) of the Act] provides a penalty for fraudulent trading where the facts are discovered <span class="font-italic">in other circumstances than in the course of winding up</span>” [emphasis added]. The Malaysian legislature adopted this recommendation. It therefore expanded the scope of the civil liability created by s 304(1) of the Malaysian Companies Act 1965 by introducing the words “or in any proceedings against a company” into that section. This had the result of expanding the coterminous criminal liability for fraudulent trading. These provisions were then adopted without amendment in s 340 of the Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30  A textual analysis of s 340(1) of the Act shows that there are only two conditions precedent for invoking it. First, there must be either: (a) a winding up of the company; or (b) proceedings against the company. Second, it must appear in the course of the winding up or in those proceedings that the company has traded fraudulently. If both conditions precedent are satisfied, the liquidator or any creditor or contributory of the company may apply to invoke the court’s declaratory jurisdiction under s 340(1) of the Act. Whether the applicant will succeed is, of course, an entirely separate matter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In the present case, the plaintiff commenced proceedings to enforce the arbitration awards against IL. Those proceedings are without doubt within the meaning of the phrase “any proceedings against a company” in s 340(1). The plaintiff received IL’s financial documents in those proceedings, as a result of the examination of judgment debtor procedure. It appears to the plaintiff from those documents that IL has traded fraudulently. The plaintiff has satisfied both conditions precedent for invoking s 340(1) of the Act. The fact that the plaintiff has not commenced winding up proceedings against IL is irrelevant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Second argument: nature of proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The second submission on the procedural point is that the plaintiff cannot commence an application under s 340(1) of the Act by issuing originating process against the directors alone, as it did to commence this action.

It was unnecessary to disentangle these two strands in <span class="font-italic">Max-Sun</span> because the plaintiff in that case: (a) sought the declaration under s 340(1) of the Act in the very same proceedings as those from which the fraudulent trading appeared; and (b) did not name the relevant company as a party when it commenced those proceedings. The latter point meant that the proceedings could not conceivably be the “proceedings against a company” within the meaning of s 340(1). It is for this reason that the plaintiff in that case failed in its attempt to invoke s 340(1) of the Act.

The plaintiff thus argues for a broad interpretation of s 340(1) while the second defendant argues for a narrow interpretation of the section.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35  I accept that s 340(1) <span class="font-italic">permit</span><span class="font-italic">s</span> an applicant to seek a declaration under that section in the proceedings from which the fraudulent trading appears, either as interlocutory relief or even as final relief. Where an applicant does so, the second strand of this submission does not arise. The company must, by definition, be a party to those proceedings. If that is not the case, then there are no “proceedings against a company” within the meaning of s 340(1) and one of the two conditions precedent for s 340(1) would not be satisfied. That is why the plaintiff’s attempt to invoke s 340(1) in <span class="font-italic">Max-</span><span class="font-italic">Sun </span>failed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 What I do not accept is that s 340(1) of the Act <span class="font-italic">requires</span> an applicant to seek a declaration under that section in the proceedings from which the fraudulent trading appears. In my view, therefore, the broad interpretation is correct. An applicant may also seek a declaration under s 340(1) of the Act by originating process. And it is not necessary for the company to be joined as a party to that originating process. I arrive at this conclusion for five reasons.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The underlying purpose of s 340(1)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 First, the narrow interpretation would defeat at least part of the purpose of s 340(1) of the Act. The immediate purpose of s 340(1) is to bring home personal liability for a company’s debts to those who are knowingly a party to the company’s fraudulent trading. That is a wholly exceptional species of liability, with the potential to subvert or abrogate entirely several fundamental doctrines of company law and the law of obligations: separate legal personality, limited liability, privity of contract, the duty of care analysis and the opposability of fiduciary obligations. Section 340(1) does this in order to achieve its ultimate purpose, which is to set and maintain standards of commercial morality by deterring natural persons from using the corporate form to trade fraudulently. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Many examples can be posited as to how the narrow interpretation would frustrate the operation of s 340(1). I give only one. Requiring an applicant to invoke s 340(1) of the Act in the proceedings from which the fraudulent trading appears would mean that s 340(1) could not apply when fraudulent trading is revealed in the course of an arbitration. The problem with the narrow interpretation is not the word “proceedings” in s 340(1). The drafting convention adopted in the Act distinguishes between an “action” and an “arbitration” (see <span class="font-italic">Kiyue</span><span class="font-italic"> Co Ltd v Aquagen International Pte Ltd</span> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 130 and the subsequent amendments to s 216A of the Act). But the Act draws no such distinction between the more general word “proceedings” and “arbitration”. Section 340(1) uses the word “proceedings”. That general word is capable of covering, at the very least, any binding dispute-resolution process. This obviously includes litigation of any type. But it equally obviously includes arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The problem with the narrow interpretation is that s 340(1) expressly and exclusively vests the power to grant a declaration under that section in the court. It is thus impossible to apply to an arbitral tribunal for relief under s 340(1) of the Act simply because the tribunal cannot grant it. On the narrow interpretation, therefore, it would be impossible to make an application under s 340(1) if the fraudulent trading is revealed in an arbitration. Given the proliferation of arbitration clauses in modern commerce, the narrow interpretation would frustrate significantly the underlying purpose of s 340(1). Indeed, the narrow interpretation would give natural persons who intend to use a company to trade fraudulently a perverse incentive to adopt arbitration agreements in all of the company’s fraudulent contracts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Textual analysis of s 340(1)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The second reason I accept the broad interpretation is that there is nothing in the textual analysis of s 340(1) of the Act which mandates the narrow interpretation. Ignoring the alternative of winding up as irrelevant for present purposes, the words in s 340(1) which are critical to the second submission on the procedural point are the following:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If<span class="font-italic"> </span>…<span class="font-italic"> in any proceedings against a company</span>, it appears that [the company has traded fraudulently] … <span class="font-italic">the Court</span><span class="font-italic"> … may … declare</span> that any person who was knowingly a party to the carrying on of the business in that manner shall be personally responsible … for all … of the debts … of the company …. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 It is true that the words “in any proceedings … the Court … may … declare …” implies a connection between the “proceedings” and the declaration under s 340(1). That also necessarily implies that the company is a party to those proceedings. But this is only a weak implication. On its face, s 340(1) requires only that the fraudulent trading appear in the course of “proceedings against a company”. The language and structure of s 340(1) do not expressly require any connection between the “proceedings against [the] company” and the proceedings in which the declaration is sought. Section 340(1) does not, for example, provide “… the Court … may … declare <span class="font-italic">in those proceedings</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>…”. Nor can it be said that reading these words into s 340(1) is necessary to advance its underlying purpose. Indeed, as I have shown, reading those words into s 340(1) would frustrate its underlying purpose. As such, there is no bar in the words of s 340(1) against an applicant seeking a declaration under that section by separate proceedings commenced by fresh originating process. There is also no bar against the applicant doing so without naming the company as a defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">O 88 r 2 of the Rules of Court</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The third reason I accept the broad interpretation is the effect of O 88 r 2(1) of the Rules of Court read with O 1 r 2(2). These provisions show that, where a company is not being wound up, an application under the Companies Act is to be made by originating summons. Order 88 r 2(1) reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Unless otherwise provided in the Act [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Companies Act] or this Order, every application under the Act must be made by originating summons and these Rules shall apply subject to this Order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">At the very least, the effect of O 88 r 2(1) is to establish an originating summons (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, an originating process) as the default procedure by which to invoke s 340(1) of the Act: see <span class="font-italic">Woon’s</span><span class="font-italic"> Corporations Law </span>(LexisNexis, 1999, June 2018 release) (“Woon’s Corporations Law”) at para 6554. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Consistency with the authorities</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The fourth reason I accept the broad interpretation is that it is consistent with the authorities cited to me.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The facts of the Malaysian case of <span class="font-italic">Tang </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Iron Works Co Ltd v Ting Ling Kiew &amp; Anor</span> [1990] 2 MLJ 440 (“<span class="font-italic">Tang </span><span class="font-italic">Eng</span>”) (appeal allowed on other grounds) are strikingly similar to the facts of the present case. In <span class="font-italic">Tang </span><span class="font-italic">Eng</span>, the plaintiff obtained an arbitral award against a company. The plaintiff then secured leave to enforce the award as a judgment. The company failed to pay the judgment debt. The plaintiff obtained an order to examine the defendants as officers of the judgment debtor. It appeared from the examination that the company had traded fraudulently. The plaintiffs commenced fresh proceedings against the defendants seeking a declaration under the Malaysian equivalent of s 340(1) that they be personally liable for the company’s judgment debt. The court granted the declaration. In so doing, the court relied on the Malaysian equivalent of O 88 r 2(1) to reject the defendants’ submission that the plaintiff could not invoke the Malaysian equivalent of s 340(1) by originating process.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The plaintiff also cites the Malaysian case of <span class="font-italic">Chin Chee </span><span class="font-italic">Keong v Toling Corp (M) Sdn Bhd </span>[2016] 3 MLJ 479 (“<span class="font-italic">Chin Chee </span><span class="font-italic">Keong</span>”) as authority for the broad proposition.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions (“PCS”) dated 11 January 2021 at para 10.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In that case, the court held that an applicant under the Malaysian equivalent of s 340(1) of the Act would necessarily have to proceed by separate originating process. The reason given by the court for its holding is that, where the fraudulent trading appears in the course of proceedings against a company, the plaintiff acquires standing to seek a declaration as a creditor of the company only upon securing judgment against the company in those proceedings. But when that happens, those proceedings are concluded (at [23] and [43]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 With respect, I have difficulty with this reason on two grounds. First, there is no requirement in s 340(1) of the Act that a plaintiff who seeks an order under s 340(1) be a <span class="font-italic">judgment</span> creditor of the company. Certainly, if a person commences proceedings against a company and those proceedings are <span class="font-italic">dismissed</span>, that person cannot thereafter apply for a declaration under s 340(1) of the Act. That is because it has been judicially determined that the person is <span class="font-italic">not</span> a creditor of the company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 But s 340(1) of the Act requires only that an applicant be a liquidator, a <span class="font-italic">creditor</span> or a contributory of the company. A person has the status of a creditor of a debtor whether or not he has a judgment in his favour against that debtor. As <span class="font-italic">Max-Sun</span> ([32] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) envisages, it is possible for a plaintiff to commence action against a company and for it to appear to that plaintiff in the course of those proceedings, for example as a result of discovery, that the company has traded fraudulently. In those circumstances, it should be possible for the plaintiff to join the knowing parties to the fraudulent trading to the existing action and to amend its statement of claim to seek relief under s 340(1) of the Act against them. The alternative would be either to: (a) require the plaintiff to litigate its action against the company to a conclusion and then commence separate proceedings against the knowing parties under s 340(1) of the Act; or (b) to commence separate proceedings against the knowing parties under s 340(1) of the Act in parallel with the original proceedings and have both proceedings consolidated or tried together. Both of those alternatives would waste time, costs and judicial resources. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The second difficulty I have with the reason in <span class="font-italic">Chin Chee </span><span class="font-italic">Keong</span> is that a civil court does not become <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span> for all purposes upon entering judgment. No doubt, entering a judgment on the merits of the parties’ dispute renders the court <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span> for that purpose. But the court is not <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span> for the purposes of enforcement. It remains seised of the matter for those purposes. And an application under s 340(1) of the Act can legitimately be seen as an aspect of the court’s enforcement jurisdiction just as much as levying execution, taxing a bill of costs or committing a recalcitrant party for contempt of court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 As a result, I do not accept <span class="font-italic">Chin Chee </span><span class="font-italic">Keong</span> as correct in so far as it suggests that an applicant under s 340(1) <span class="font-italic">must </span><span class="font-italic">necessarily</span> proceed by issuing originating process. Nevertheless, <span class="font-italic">Chin Chee </span><span class="font-italic">Keong</span> is at least authority for the proposition that an applicant under s 340(1) <span class="font-italic">may</span> proceed by issuing originating process. To this extent, therefore, I accept that the result in <span class="font-italic">Chin Chee </span><span class="font-italic">Keong</span> and its adoption of the broad interpretation to be correct.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Empirical support</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The fifth reason I adopt the broad interpretation is because it is supported empirically by the procedure actually adopted in the cases cited to me. In the Singapore cases cited to me in which liquidators of a company made an application under s 340(1) of the Companies Act while the company was in the course of being wound up, the application was made by originating process: <span class="font-italic">Liquidator of Leong Seng Hin Piling Pte Ltd v Chan Ah Lek and others </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 77<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Leong Seng</span>”); <span class="font-italic">M+W Singapore Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Leow Tet Sin and another </span>[2015] 2 SLR 271 (“<span class="font-italic">M+W Singapore</span>”); <span class="font-italic">Traxiar</span><span class="font-italic"> Drilling Partners II Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Dvergsten, Dag Oivind </span>[2019] 4 SLR 433 (“<span class="font-italic">Traxiar</span><span class="font-italic"> Drilling Partners</span>”). Originating process is also used in England: <span class="font-italic">Morris and others v Bank of America and others</span> [2002] All ER (D) 435 (Jul).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 It is true that – as in the Singapore cases cited to me – this plaintiff has made its application under s 340(1) of the Act by writ instead of by originating summons. But that is not the ground on which the second defendant argues that the plaintiff’s application is procedurally defective. And, given the allegations of fraud and the substantial disputes of fact in this application, any originating summons which the plaintiff would have filed would inevitably have been converted into a writ action under O 28 r 8 of the Rules of Court. As Woon’s Corporations Law puts it (at para 6554):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Procedure</span> Where the company is not being wound up an application under this section should be made by originating summons: Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Ed) O 88 r 2(1). However, where there are conflicts of affidavit evidence, and in particular when fraud is alleged, it would be more appropriate to continue the proceedings as if they were begun by writ; the court has discretion under the Rules of Court O 28 r 8(1) to so order. In <span class="font-italic">Ting Ling </span><span class="font-italic">Kiew v Tang Eng Iron Works Co Ltd </span>[1992] 2 MLJ 217, the Supreme Court of Malaysia held that it was inappropriate to proceed summarily under this section where fraud was the central issue, and ordered that pleadings should be filed and that the proceedings be continued as if they had been begun by writ.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the procedural point</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 For these five reasons, therefore, I hold that an applicant may invoke s 340(1) of the Act by any one of three alternative means: (i) in existing proceedings against the company, by issuing an interlocutory summons seeking a declaration under s 340(1); (ii) in existing proceedings against the company, by amending its pleadings to seek a declaration under s 340(1) as final relief in addition to the other relief sought; or (iii) in fresh proceedings, by issuing originating process seeking a declaration under s 340(1), whether alone or in addition to other relief.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 On the first of these three alternatives, the applicant will have to satisfy the court that it is appropriate to exercise its exceptional jurisdiction to make a final declaration on an interlocutory application: <span class="font-italic">International General Electric Co</span><span class="font-italic">mpany of New </span>York<span class="font-italic"> Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Commissioners of Customs and Excise</span> [1962] Ch 784 at 789–790. On both the first and second alternatives, the applicant may have to join the knowing parties to the existing proceedings so that they are properly before the court and can be heard and will be bound. On the third alternative, there is no requirement for the applicant to name the company as a defendant in the originating process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 For all these reasons, I reject the second defendant’s procedural objection.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Three preliminary points</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Before I turn to consider the substance of the plaintiff’s claim, I make three preliminary points. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Relevance of insolvency</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 First, liability under s 340(1) of the Act does not turn on whether the company which an applicant alleges was trading fraudulently was also insolvent at the material time. The touchstone for liability under s 340(1) of the Act is fraud. A company may be trading fraudulently even though it is unquestionably solvent on any conceivable test. So too, a company may not be trading fraudulently even though it is hopelessly insolvent on every conceivable test. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 A notable feature of the Act is that it imposed no civil liability on directors who cause a company to continue trading while it is insolvent. Insolvent trading was a criminal offence under s 339(3) of the Act. But as far as liability to compensate creditors was concerned, all that the Act did was to vest the court with the power to declare under s 340(2) of the Act that a person convicted of the offence of insolvent trading under s 339(3) of the Act was to be personally responsible for the debts so incurred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 General civil liability for directors who cause a company to continue trading while it is insolvent was introduced for the first time in our insolvency law with effect from 30 July 2020 by s 239 of the IRDA, where it is now known as “wrongful trading”. But of course, that provision was not in force when IL entered into the main charterparties or when the plaintiff commenced this action. And the plaintiff brings this action against the defendants under s 340(1) of the Act, not under s 239 of the IRDA. I therefore need say no more wrongful trading.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The factual issue of insolvency nevertheless has assumed central importance in this action. That is because the plaintiff relies on IL’s insolvency in or around July 2015 as circumstantial evidence that: (a) IL was trading fraudulently when it entered into the main charterparties in July 2015;

</div> and (b) that both the defendants were knowing parties to IL’s fraudulent trading.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Burden of proof</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The second preliminary observation I make is on the burden of proof. In this action, it is the plaintiff who asserts: (a) that IL was trading fraudulently in or around July 2015, when it entered into the main charterparties; (b) that IL was insolvent at that time (as circumstantial evidence); and (c) that the defendants were each knowingly a party to IL’s fraudulent trading. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The burden of proving each of these principal assertions – and of proving each subsidiary assertion that these principal assertions entail – rests on the plaintiff under s 103 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed). The plaintiff cannot rely on s 108 of the Evidence Act to argue that the burden of <span class="font-italic">disproving</span> any of these principal or subsidiary assertions lies on the defendants on the basis that these assertions involve facts especially within the defendants’ knowledge. Section 108 applies only in “very limited circumstances” because, if “[w]idely construed and lifted out of its context, it will reverse the burden of proof of the essential ingredients of the [claimant’s] case which by section 103 [of the Evidence Act] is cast on the [claimant]”: <span class="font-italic">Phosagro</span><span class="font-italic"> Asia Pte Ltd v Piattchanine, Iouri </span>[2016] 5 SLR 1052<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Phosagro</span><span class="font-italic"> Asia</span>”) at [68], citing Chen Siyuan and Lionel Leo, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Evidence in Singapore</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2016) at paras 3.055−3.056. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Thus, the starting point in my analysis of the factual issues in this case is that the burden rests on the plaintiff to prove each of the principal and subsidiary assertions which form a part of its case against each defendant. That is so even though virtually all of the contested facts which underlie these assertions are entirely within at least the first defendant’s personal knowledge and completely outside the plaintiff’s knowledge.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The weight of the first defendant’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The final preliminary observation I make is on the quality and weight of the first defendant’s evidence. On the first day of trial, first defendant’s counsel adduced a medical report on the first defendant condition issued by a doctor at the Singapore General Hospital.

The first defendant was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s dementia based on a history of gradual memory loss over the previous five years. Although the first defendant “was alert and forthcoming”, he “had difficulty communicating his thoughts, and displayed word finding difficulties” during his mental state examination. He also tried to answer questions but “could not do so at times” and “was not fully oriented to time”. Importantly, “[a]t this point, everything [the first defendant] says has to be corroborated with a family member who can verify the accuracy of his account”.

The plaintiff argues that (a) the first defendant’s evidence in the morning session should be given little or no weight because he suffered from some disability at the time; and (b) his evidence in the afternoon session should be disregarded or given little weight because he showed himself not to be a credible witness by deliberately evading questions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The common position of both defendants is that the first defendant was fit to testify.

For example, he could state his educational qualifications, albeit with some difficulty – as foreshadowed by the medical report – in finding the right words.

</div> IL was well able to meet these expenses. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 I therefore find that IL was not insolvent on the cash flow test in or around July 2015. It was able to pay its debts as they fell due. It remains the fact, however, that IL was insolvent on the balance sheet test at that time. And a finding of insolvency on just one test suffices for an overall finding of insolvency. IL was therefore insolvent in or around July 2015.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Intent to defraud</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The next question is whether IL was trading fraudulently in or around July 2015, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether it was trading at that time with intent to defraud its creditors or the creditors of any other person or for any fraudulent purpose. As IL had been dormant from 2013, answering this question does not require analysis of the pattern of IL’s trading activity in or around July 2015. IL’s only trading activity at that time was entering into the charterparties in July 2015. It is of course correct that even a single transaction can amount to fraudulent trading (<span class="font-italic">In r</span><span class="font-italic">e Patrick and Lyon, Limited</span> [1933] Ch 786 (“<span class="font-italic">Patrick Lyon</span>”)). The question to be analysed therefore is whether IL entered into the main charterparties with intent to defraud the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The standard of proof for an intent to defraud is the usual civil standard of the balance of probabilities, bearing in mind that the more serious the allegation, the more the plaintiff must do to establish his case: <span class="font-italic">Tang Yoke Kheng </span><span class="font-italic">(trading as Niklex Supply Co) v Lek Benedict and others</span> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 263 (“<span class="font-italic">Tang Yoke Kheng</span>”) at [14].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 As for the substance of an intent to defraud, Lord Lane CJ observed in the English criminal case of <span class="font-italic">R v Grantham</span> [1984] QB 675 at 681 that a debtor has an intent to defraud a creditor if the debtor obtains credit intending that the creditor will never be paid or obtains credit or carries on obtaining credit to the prejudice of the creditor in a manner which the debtor knows is generally regarded as dishonest:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… A man intends to defraud a creditor either if he intends that the creditor shall never be paid or alternatively if he intends to obtain credit or carry on obtaining credit when the rights and interests of the creditor are being prejudiced in a way which the defendant himself knows is generally regarded as dishonest … [A] trader can intend to defraud if he obtains credit when there is a substantial risk of the creditor not getting his money or not getting the whole of his money and the defendant knows that that is the position and knows he is stepping beyond the bounds of what ordinary decent people engaged in business would regard as honest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Court of Appeal cited this passage with approval in <span class="font-italic">Tang Yoke Kheng</span> (at [7]), while acknowledging the futility of “attempting to cast a legal definition of something as amorphous as ‘fraud’” and conceding that Lord Lane CJ’s words are “merely an account of an instance in which fraud might manifest itself”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Nevertheless, it is the case that even knowingly being a party to a company’s trading on credit while it is insolvent will not, in itself, warrant a declaration of personal liability under s 340(1). To establish fraudulent trading, it is necessary to show that the creditor was deceived or misled and that the defendant intended to gain an advantage: <span class="font-italic">Leong Seng</span> ([50] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [17]. As the Court of Appeal said in <span class="font-italic">Tang Yoke Kheng</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [7]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">To defraud someone is to cheat him, but what is cheating? The best that one can say is that it is an act or omission in which the fraudster deceives the innocent party so as to enrich the fraudster, or cause the innocent party to suffer a loss or detriment. But the fraudster or cheat may achieve his objective in any number of ways. The only invariable element is the element of dishonesty on the part of the fraudster or cheat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 There can be no intent to defraud, therefore, unless there is dishonesty resulting in deception of an innocent party: <span class="font-italic">M+W Singapore </span>([50] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [103]. Dishonesty is a subjective state of mind. What must be proven is that the defendant held subjectively a dishonest intent: <span class="font-italic">Leong Seng </span>at [13]. Of course, it is impossible to see into a defendant’s mind and thereby to prove conclusively that it held a subjective dishonest intent. Therefore, as a practical forensic necessity, an intent to defraud can be proven only by circumstantial evidence, not by direct evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Thus, where a plaintiff alleges fraud, it is necessary to test the allegation against all the available evidence. The more a plaintiff shows that a defendant’s conduct deviated from what an honest person would have done in his circumstances, the more easily it can be inferred that the defendant’s subjective state of mind in the course of that conduct was a dishonest intent (<span class="font-italic">Tang Yoke Kheng</span> at [9]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Unlike insolvent trading under s 339(3) of the Act and wrongful trading under s 239(12) of the IRDA, a finding that a company incurred a debt or other liability without reasonable prospect of meeting it in full is not a necessary or even a sufficient condition for a finding of fraudulent trading. Nevertheless, such a finding may be circumstantial evidence from which it is legitimate to draw an inference of an intent to defraud: <span class="font-italic">Loose &amp; Griffiths on Liquidators</span> (Peter Loose, Andrew Clutterbuck &amp; Paul Greenwood gen eds) (LexisNexis, 9th Ed, 2019) (“<span class="font-italic">Loose &amp; Griffiths</span>”) at para 6.96. But it must be remembered that an intent to defraud and the dishonesty that it entails cannot be proven simply by showing that the defendant failed to comply with some objective standard of reasonable commercial behaviour (<span class="font-italic">Tang Yoke Kheng</span> at [9]).

It is true, as the plaintiff points out, that there is no independent evidence to support the first defendant’s oral evidence that the plaintiff, IL and BMI had some sort of a three-way agreement or understanding that IL intended to enter into this back-to-back arrangement.

</div> But that does not take the plaintiff’s case very far. The contemporaneous objective evidence is that IL did have a back-to-back arrangement upstream with the plaintiff and downstream with BMI. This is proven by the terms of the main charterparties and the subcharterparties, all of which were in evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 I therefore accept that the main charterparties and the subcharterparties formed, from IL’s perspective, a single back-to-back transaction. In other words, I accept that IL entered into the main charterparties only because it was entering at the same time into the subcharterparties back to back. And I also accept that IL entered into the subcharterparties only because it was entering at the same time into the main charterparties back to back. I also accept that this back-to-back charter arrangement meant that the first defendant, as IL’s controlling mind and will, subjectively believed that IL would earn enough under the subcharterparties not only to pay the plaintiff under the main charterparties but also to yield IL a gross profit of US$16,000 per 30 days.

The Malaysian Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge that these facts supported a finding that there was an intent to defraud (at [47]–[48]). But the court also placed great weight on the fact that the defendants did not dispute that the company was unable to pay its creditors (at [49]) and could not explain how the company intended to honour its obligations to the plaintiff and did not suggest that there was a reasonable prospect of paying the plaintiff (at [58]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Unlike the defendants in <span class="font-italic">Chin Chee </span><span class="font-italic">Keong</span>, I accept that the first defendant, as IL’s controlling mind and will, subjectively believed in July 2015 that the back-to-back arrangements would enable IL to pay the plaintiff.

</div> This submission does not assist the plaintiff. I say that for three reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 First, I accept that directors have a fiduciary duty to take into account the interests of IL’s creditors when making decisions for a company which is insolvent or nearing insolvency (see <span class="font-italic">Liquidators of </span><span class="font-italic">Progen Engineering Pte Ltd v Progen Holdings Ltd</span> [2010] 4 SLR 1089 (“<span class="font-italic">Progen</span><span class="font-italic"> Engineering</span>”) at [48]). But this duty is owed not to the creditors but to the company (<span class="font-italic">Progen</span><span class="font-italic"> Engineering</span> at [52]). The plaintiff is therefore in no position to complain of a breach of this duty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Second, it is not helpful to conflate the question of whether a director has breached his fiduciary duties to the company with the question of whether a company was trading fraudulently within the meaning of s 340(1) of the Act. The question at this point in the analysis is whether IL was trading fraudulently, not whether the first defendant was knowingly a party to IL trading fraudulently. As such, any breach of duty within the company is irrelevant to the question of whether the company traded fraudulently as regards outsiders to the company.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Third, the plaintiff was not a creditor of IL until <span class="font-italic">after</span> it entered into the main charterparties with IL. As in <span class="font-italic">Prima </span><span class="font-italic">Bulkship Pte Ltd (in creditors’ voluntary liquidation) and another v Lim Say Wan and another </span>[2017] 3 SLR 839<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [71]), the plaintiff was not a creditor of IL at the material time; it became a creditor only by virtue of IL entering into the main charterparties. IL’s directors could not, therefore, have owed any duty to IL to take the plaintiff’s interests into account when they caused IL to enter into the main charterparties with the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) No reasonable prospect of BMI paying IL</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The plaintiff’s second point is that BMI had no reasonable prospect of paying IL enough for IL to discharge its contractual obligations to the plaintiff.

</div> In analysing this point, therefore, I assume in the plaintiff’s favour that BMI did owe IL a trade debt of $35,568.75 which IL wrote off in 2016.

</div> the debt dated from 2008. There is no evidence that the first defendant remembered this stale debt in July 2015. The financial statements available in July 2015, which both defendants had signed, do not identify by name the debtors who owe IL its trade receivables. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Second, I also do not accept that IL writing off the debt in 2016 goes towards establishing that IL had an intent to defraud the plaintiff. IL wrote off the debt over a year after entering into the charterparties. There is no evidence that BMI had been unwilling to pay this debt before the three companies’ relationships soured as a result of this transaction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 On the second subpoint, IL may have had any number of reasons for not taking legal action to recover payment from BMI after it defaulted under the subcharterparties. The failure to take legal action in 2016 and 2017 does not raise the inference that IL was trading fraudulently in July 2015. In any event, the first defendant gave some evidence that he did take steps to try and get payment from BMI. He said that he did ask BMI to pay, albeit orally and not in writing.

</div> IL’s payments to the first defendant when IL was in default of its payments to the plaintiff do not show an intent to defraud.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Even if I am wrong in finding that IL’s payments to the first defendant were repayments of a loan, these payments do not establish that IL was trading fraudulently in or around July 2015. Even where a director causes a company to pay money in breach of his fiduciary duties to the company, that will not in itself justify a finding of an intent to defraud. In <span class="font-italic">Traxiar</span><span class="font-italic"> Drilling Partners </span>([50] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), a director caused a company to borrow money from two lenders to buy a rig. Over the next two years, the director caused the company to pay the borrowed money to his own companies instead of using it to buy the rig. Aedit Abdullah J found that, by paying his own companies to the prejudice of lenders, the director had breached his duty to the company to take into account the interests of creditors (at [93]–[95]). But this did not, in itself, lead to the conclusion that the director had intended to defraud the lenders when he caused the company to borrow the money within the meaning of s 340(1) of the Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Looking at all of the other evidence, Aedit Abdullah J held that there was insufficient evidence that the director had no intention of repaying the loan at the time he caused the company to borrow the money from the lenders (at [119] and [127]). For one lender, this was partly because the plaintiff repaid that lender close to half of its loan (at [127]). As for the other lender, the director had charged his personal assets as security for that lender’s loan (at [126]). Further, the director had worked to secure contracts to buy the rig and caused the company to sign contracts to buy it. This made it more likely that the company genuinely intended to fund the purchase of the rig rather than to allow the director to siphon off the funds at the time it borrowed the money (at [125]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Similarly, the first defendant’s conduct after IL entered into the charterparties is at odds with an intent to defraud. First, if the defendants intended from the outset not to pay the plaintiff under the main charterparties, as the plaintiff alleges, it is wholly inconsistent with that intent for IL to make payment of the first month’s hire to the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 Second, when disputes arose over the condition of the vessels, the first defendant travelled to Maldives to, as he saw it, help resolve the issues between the plaintiff and BMI.

</div> In support of its case, the plaintiff relies on the fact that the second defendant was a shareholder, a director and the company secretary of IL. On that basis, the plaintiff submits that the second defendant “would be fully aware of the company’s dealings”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 The mere fact that a person is a director or other officer of a company or holds an executive position in the company does not mean that he is knowingly a party to everything that the company does. In <span class="font-italic">Tong Tien See Construction Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Tong Tien See and others</span> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 887, Tay Yong Kwang JC (as he then was) held some directors personally liable for the company’s debts under s 340(1) of the Act. They had used false accounts to project a false image of profitability to creditors. They knew that creditors could be paid only by using funds from new projects to pay debts incurred in old projects. They also knew that, at any given time, some creditors would not be paid. As the directing minds of this fraudulent scheme, these directors were knowingly a party to the company carrying on its business with intent to defraud its creditors (at [64]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 But Tay JC found two other directors, the fourth and fifth defendants, not liable under s 340(1) of the Act (at [102]). Given Tay JC’s finding that the company was trading fraudulently, the only way these two directors could have escaped liability was if the plaintiff failed to show that they were knowingly a party to the fraudulent trading. Both directors were also employed by the company (at [22], [27]). Both directors signed the company’s false accounts in their capacity as directors (at [59]). But these two directors were not the ones with the requisite knowledge of how the company was faring over the years and the ins and outs of its money (at [64]). The fraud lay in the scheme of “rob[bing] Peter to pay Paul”. So these two directors were not liable under s 340(1) because they had no personal knowledge of the company’s finances to the extent needed to know of the scheme.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 So too in the present case, the mere fact that the second defendant was a shareholder, a director and the company secretary of IL does not in itself establish his subjective knowledge of IL’s fraudulent trading in July 2015, let alone that he was a party to it. The fraud which I have assumed (contrary to my finding) lies in IL dishonestly entering into the main charterparties with no intention of paying the plaintiff. The plaintiff has not adduced any evidence which shows that the second defendant knew anything about the main charterparties before or at the time the first defendant signed them on IL’s behalf, let alone that the second defendant was a knowing party to IL entering into them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 As the second defendant points out, the plaintiff accepts that only the first defendant signed the main charterparties for IL.

</div> these financial statements make no reference to the main charterparties. In any event, the knowledge which s 340(1) requires is knowledge contemporaneous with the fraudulent trading. Subsequent knowledge based on hindsight does not suffice to engage liability under s 340(1) of the Act (<span class="font-italic">Re Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA (in liquidation) (No 15); Morris and others v Bank of India</span> [2004] 2 BCLC 279<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [13]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 Further, the plaintiff does not identify any positive steps which the second defendant took in causing IL to enter into the main charterparties.
