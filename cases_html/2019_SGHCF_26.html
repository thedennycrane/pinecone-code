</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Bearing in mind that third parties have interests in the immovable properties, I took heed of the Court of Appeal’s statements in <span class="font-italic">UDA v UDB and another </span>[2018] 1 SLR 1015 (“<span class="font-italic">UDA</span>”) at [56]–[58]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">56 If the property is legally owned by the third party, then the following options will be available to the court and the spouses.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d)  … [the] spouse [who claims the property to be a matrimonial asset] may ask the court to determine whether the asset is a matrimonial asset without involving the third party’s participation at all or making an order directly affecting the property. This is Option 1.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">57  In respect of [56(d)] above, the family justice court should only take Option 1 if both spouses agree to it, as this course could result in the disputed asset being treated as a matrimonial asset and adjustments being made in the division of other assets to account for its value when in separate proceedings later it may be determined that the third party was both the legal and the beneficial owner of the property and neither spouse had any interest in it at all. Thus, the result of taking Option 1 may be to prejudice the spouse who has had to account to the other for the value of an item of property which turns out not to be a matrimonial asset. By the time of the separate action the s 112 proceedings may have completed and no adjustments may be possible to reflect the decision made in the third party’s separate proceedings. … We should add that Option 1 would not be viable if the disputed asset is the main or only substantial asset available for division.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">58 The other situation is where the property is in the name of one of the spouses and the third party is a ‘shadowy’ figure in the wings whom that spouse claims has an interest in the property but no order is sought by or against the third party directly. In such a case, because no order is sought by or against the third party, it is permissible for the court to make an order exercising its powers under s 112 because the only parties directly affected by the order will be the parting spouses. This, again, is an Option 1 course. The choice of Option 1 would have the same risks for the spouses as alluded to in [57] above. Thus, for instance, the spouse in whose name the property stands, having been ordered to share the value of the property with the other spouse, may later find he or she has to account to the third party for such value or to transfer the property outright to the third party. This is because the determination of the ownership of the disputed property in the s 112 proceedings will not bind the third party who may challenge it in separate proceedings. But that is the risk the spouse takes by not seeking an order that will bind the third party. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 At a pre-trial conference before the ancillary matters hearing (“AM hearing”) started, counsel for the parties were asked to inform the affected third parties (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Wife’s brother-in-law and the Husband’s father) to assert their positions on their claims on the properties that they jointly owned, and also their positions on any orders which require disposition of those properties. The Wife’s brother-in-law filed an affidavit on 15 October 2018 for the purposes of the proceedings affirming that he and the Wife were tenants-in-common of the 18G Property, but did not state his position in relation to any orders that the court might make. Although the Husband’s father did not file a similar affidavit, I consider him a “shadowy” figure in the wings: <span class="font-italic">UDA </span>at [58]. Both parties’ counsel informed me at the hearing on 14 January 2019 that the third parties will not be participating in these proceedings, and were aware that their respective interests may be affected if there is an order for sale.

However, it does not operate in the context of the division of assets under s 112 of the WC. The Husband established [P] LLP in 2010, and his earnings and share in the firm are matrimonial assets as they were acquired during the marriage (s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the WC), just as how a spouse’s earnings from and share in any other commercial venture would be considered matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Both parties appointed accounting experts to value the Husband’s earnings and share in [P] LLP.

We are of the view that if, during these periods, and whether by way of gift or otherwise, one spouse expends a substantial sum, this sum must be returned to the asset pool if the other spouse is considered to have at least a putative interest in it and has not agreed, either expressly or impliedly, to the expenditure either before it was incurred or at any subsequent time. Furthermore, this remains the case regardless of whether: (a) the expenditure was a deliberate attempt to dissipate matrimonial assets; or (b) the expenditure was for the benefit of the children or other relatives.

As such, I prefer to analyse this issue of the Husband’s earnings in terms of whether he has sufficiently discharged his duty to make full disclosure of his assets and whether an adverse inference should be drawn against him for failing to do so. In this regard, the Wife alleged that the Husband’s expenses were vague and unsubstantiated, and that he made withdrawals that he failed to substantiate. For instance, although his UOB Account No -7862 had a balance of $51,461.88 as at September 2013, it had a balance of $0.00 by October 2016. The Wife submitted that the Husband was unable to provide a reasonable and reliable explanation on his earnings, and that her share of the disclosed assets should be uplifted by 20% to account for his undisclosed assets.

Instead, there were ten withdrawals of varying amounts over a period of three years. Many of the amounts withdrawn were not round figures but very specific sums of money (down to the cent) which suggests that the Husband was likely withdrawing these sums to pay for particular expenditures or to pay off specific loans. On the whole, the timing and amounts of these withdrawals do not support the inference of an orchestrated design to remove funds from the parties’ joint accounts. It also bears mention that the above ten withdrawals add up to a total of S$1,562,066 withdrawn between July 2008 and November 2011, and this, incidentally, is only slightly more than the S$1,529,040 which the Wife claims she received in October 2011 as reimbursement for personal and household expenses from 2008 to 2011 …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In the present case, the bank statements for DBS Account No -0943 showed that the account had a balance of $300,308.06 as at 31 August 2013

This interim agreement was not a maintenance agreement. Nonetheless, the High Court (Family Division) ordered the Husband to bear half of the monthly mortgage payments for the 18G Property and the full monthly mortgage payments for the 16G Property. The Wife was to collect the rental proceeds due, with the entitlement of the rental moneys to be determined at the AM hearing.

The status of the WP Property as a matrimonial asset is not premised on the Wife’s belief in her entitlement to the WP Property as a matter of inheritance or on the basis of any promise made, but in its use as the matrimonial home and the cradle of the family during the marriage. In any event, there is little evidence of any promises by the Husband or his parents that the Wife had any entitlement to the WP Property or that such promises had any legal effect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Also weighted against the Wife is the fact that the Husband’s father gifted the WP Property solely to the Husband and not jointly to the parties.

Significantly, although the affidavit evidence of the husband’s father in that case was that the sum was for the benefit of the husband alone, the father’s intention for the couple to jointly benefit from the money was reliably inferred from his objective acts to provide the sum for them to purchase the property in their <span class="font-italic">joint names </span>without taking additional steps to protect the sum from the wife. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Here, after parties married in May 2000, the Husband’s father took steps to create a joint tenancy with the Husband alone in June 2006.

The final ratio of division is to be 60:40 between the Husband and the Wife. </div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Husband (%)</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Wife (%)</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Direct Contributions</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">86</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">14</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Indirect Contributions</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold">50</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold">50</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">Average ratio</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">68</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">32</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">Post-adjustment ratio</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">60</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">40</span></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Distribution of assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Based on the ratio derived above, the parties are each entitled to the following shares of the matrimonial pool:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Husband</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Wife</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Share of matrimonial pool</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">$1,145,161.31</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">$763,440.88</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 It follows that the Husband is to transfer $391,068.47 (being $763,440.88 – $372,372.41 (at [57] above)) to the Wife within six months from the date of this judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The Family Division of the High Court does not have jurisdiction to make any directions that would bind a third party: see <span class="font-italic">UDA </span>at [28], [58].

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In <span class="font-italic">TNL </span>at [64], the Court of Appeal ordered the husband to pay the wife a lump sum maintenance of $100,000.00, approximately the sum obtained using a multiplier of three years and a multiplicand of $3,000.00. This was a long single-income marriage of 35 years with three children to the marriage. The wife was 57 years old and was entitled to $1,448,875.50 after division. The Court of Appeal also considered that the husband had maintained the wife up until mid-2015.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In the present case, the Wife’s share of the matrimonial assets is not substantial. She has also been out of work since August 2013. I accept that she has attempted to find employment but has had difficulties in doing so despite the positive testimonial given by her former employer prior to her employment at the Husband’s firm. The Husband has also been contributing towards the fees and the mortgage loan for the 18G Property, which the Wife will have to take over from the date of this judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In my judgment, it is fair that the Wife should be given a sum of maintenance to tide her over until she receives her full share of the matrimonial assets and is able to resume gainful employment. I bear in mind her age and the amount of time that she has spent out of employment, and grant some allowance in that regard. However, I find that her estimation of her monthly expenses is exaggerated. In the circumstances, I order the Husband to pay the Wife monthly maintenance of $3,000.00 for a period of 18 months from the date of this decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 For the reasons above, I make the following orders:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Husband is to transfer $391,068.47 to the Wife within six months from the date of this judgment.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Maintenance for the Wife is ordered. The Husband is to pay $3,000.00 in monthly maintenance to the Wife over a period of 18 months.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 I encourage parties to agree on costs, failing which they are to file and exchange submissions on the issue of costs (limited to 10 pages, excluding exhibits and authorities) within 21 days from the date of this judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-left"> </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Puay Boon<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-right">Sam Hui Min Lisa (Lisa Sam &amp; Company) for the plaintiff;<br/>Alfred Dodwell and Ahnushka Kaur Riar  (Dodwell &amp; Co LLC) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
