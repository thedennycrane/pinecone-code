The Court of Appeal declared that two distinct interests guide the operation of breach of confidence claims. First, a plaintiff has an interest in preventing wrongful gain or profit from its confidential information (“wrongful gain interest”) (<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA) </span>at [50]). Second, the plaintiff also has an interest in avoiding wrongful loss (“wrongful loss interest”), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>to seek protection for the confidentiality of the information <span class="font-italic">per se</span><span class="font-italic">. </span>Wrongful loss is suffered so long as a defendant’s conscience has been impacted in the breach of the obligation of confidentiality (<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA) </span>at [53]);<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Shanghai Afute </span>at [100(a)(ii)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Following the judgment of <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Court of Appeal clarified in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Oon Kuin and others v Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP and another appeal </span>[2022] 2 SLR 280 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Oon Kuin</span>”) that different analytical frameworks apply depending on whether the wrongful gain interest or wrongful loss interest is at issue. Where the wrongful gain interest is at stake, the traditional <span class="font-italic">Coco </span>approach applies (<span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Oon Kuin</span> at [39] and [41]). This means that the plaintiff bears the legal burden of proving unauthorised use of the confidential information. However, where the wrongful loss interest is engaged, the modified approach promulgated in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> is adopted (the “<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> approach”). Under the <span class="font-italic">I-Admin </span>approach, the first two requirements of the <span class="font-italic">Coco </span>approach are preserved, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the relevant information must have the necessary quality of confidence, and it must be imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence. If these two prerequisites are satisfied, the conscience of the defendant is presumed to have been impinged, and an action for breach of confidence is presumed (<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA) </span>at [61]). The legal burden then shifts to the <span class="font-italic">defendant</span> to prove that its conscience was unaffected (<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> at [61] and [62]; <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Oon Kuin</span> at [40]). Further, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Oon Kuin </span>endorsed the observation of Prof Ng‑Loy that the <span class="font-italic">I-Admin </span>approach is to be limited to “cases involving unauthorised acquisition of the confidential information, that is, the ‘taker’ cases” (<span class="font-italic">Ng-Loy</span> at [41.3.10]–[41.3.11]; <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Oon Kuin</span> at [41] and [42]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Traditionally, where a claim for breach of confidence is satisfied, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>where the wrongful gain interest has been infringed, the law has produced a “formidable armoury” of remedies, such as monetary remedies, “whether termed equitable compensation or damages” (<span class="font-italic">I-Admin (CA)</span> at [56]). On the other hand, where the defendant is liable for infringing on the wrongful loss interest, equitable compensation would be inappropriate as its restitutionary objective requires that a plaintiff be restored to the same position it would have been in if the breach had not been effected, but this may be highly speculative where there has been no actionable use of the confidential information (<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> at [72]). The Court of Appeal found that an account of profits was also not in consideration where there was no finding of actual use of the plaintiff’s confidential materials (<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> at [72]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Instead, the Court may order the remedy of equitable damages for infringement of the wrongful loss interest (<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> at [73] and [77]). In <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>, the Court of Appeal then remitted the question of the precise measure of damages to the High Court judge. However, the Court of Appeal directed that in determining the appropriate award, the High Court judge ought to consider the additional cost the third respondent would have incurred to develop its software without any reference to the confidential materials of the appellant, as well as the reduction in the time taken to set up the third respondent’s business, allowing it to commence profit-making earlier. Taken together, these would provide a quantifiable impression of the value of the appellant’s information to the respondents (<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> <span class="font-italic">(CA) </span>at [79]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Having considered the existing jurisprudence on breach of confidence, as well as parties’ submissions, I hold that a plaintiff is entitled to plead that it is proceeding on <span class="font-italic">both</span> the wrongful gain interest and the wrongful loss interest in a claim for breach of confidence. Therefore, within a claim for breach of confidence, the Court may, in fact, award both damages under the <span class="font-italic">Coco </span>approach as well as equitable damages under the <span class="font-italic">I-Admin </span>approach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 I now set out the reasons for my decision. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Reason 1: No conflicting binding precedent</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Firstly, in my judgment, there is nothing in the authorities by the Court of Appeal that precludes a plaintiff from claiming that both its wrongful loss and wrongful gain interests have been affected by the defendant’s breach of confidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>, the Court of Appeal did not need to address the issue of whether a plaintiff could claim both interests under breach of confidence because the wrongful gain interest had not been engaged at all. The High Court Judge found that there had been no actionable use of the confidential information, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the appellant’s case failed at the third limb of the <span class="font-italic">Coco </span>approach (<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> at [20] and [54]). Instead, only the wrongful loss interest was at stake, and the Court of Appeal correspondingly found the respondents liable for impinging on the appellants’ wrongful loss interest.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20  In fact, in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> (at [54]), the Court of Appeal alluded to the possibility that a defendant’s conduct can affect both the wrongful loss interest and the wrongful gain interest, such that there could be a “degree of overlap”. I set out the paragraph in full: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A question that follows is whether there is a threat to this wrongful loss interest that warrants a more robust response by the law. The elements of breach of confidence set out in <span class="font-italic">Coco</span> ([20] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) explicitly protect the wrongful gain interest. <span class="font-italic">Although there is often a degree of overlap, it may not always be the case that a defendant’s conduct will affect both the wrongful gain and wrongful loss interests</span>. This is exemplified by the facts of the present appeal. It was not proven that the respondents directly profited from their use of the appellant’s confidential materials. However, this does not detract from the fact that the respondents knowingly acquired and circulated these materials without consent. As submitted by Mr Lee, such conduct would have affected the respondents’ conscience, invoking the wrongful loss interest, because it was known that the relevant materials had been subject to an obligation of confidence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I agree with the plaintiffs’ submission that if “it may not always be the case that a defendant’s conduct will affect both the wrongful gain and wrongful loss interests”, then it follows <span class="font-italic">a fortiori </span>that there are cases where the defendant’s conduct affects both the wrongful gain interest and wrongful loss interest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 For completeness, I note that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Oon Kuin</span> also did not face the present issue that I have to determine, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>whether a plaintiff in a claim for breach of confidence may plead and claim that both its wrongful gain interest and wrongful loss interest have been infringed. Therefore, I am not bound by precedent to refuse a plaintiff from claiming for both its wrongful gain interest and wrongful loss interest.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Reason 2: The rationale for the wrongful loss and wrongful gain interest </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The position that a plaintiff may plead and claim the wrongful gain interest and wrongful loss interest is also strengthened by the Court of Appeal’s rationale for declaring the existence of both forms of interest in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin (CA)</span>. Recognition of the wrongful loss interest is intended to bolster and enhance protection for confidentiality. In <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Court of Appeal began its analysis on breach of confidence by reflecting on the circumstances where “defendants wrongfully access or acquire confidential information but do not use or disclose the same”. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal stated that “their actions compromise the confidentiality of the information in question” (<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> at [43]). Later on in the judgment, the Court of Appeal suggested that the “policy objectives behind the early law of confidence may have extended <span class="font-italic">beyond</span> safeguarding against wrongful gain” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> <span class="font-italic">(CA) </span>at [50]). At [58], the Court of Appeal then decided that the existing legal framework “[did] not adequately safeguard [the wrongful loss interest] or offer recourse where it has been affected”. Subsequently, in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Oon Kuin</span>, the Court of Appeal made clear that “[t]he <span class="font-italic">I‑Admin</span> approach was … intended to specifically fill the lacuna in the law in so far as the legitimate objective of protecting the wrongful loss interest was concerned” (<span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Oon Kuin</span> at [39]). Therefore, a plaintiff in a breach of confidence claim should be allowed to seek remedies under both the <span class="font-italic">Coco </span>approach and the <span class="font-italic">I-Admin </span>approach. The traditional approach should be applied for confidential documents involving harm to the plaintiff’s “wrongful gain interest” (see <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Oon Kuin</span> at [39]). Where there is no basis for such a finding of harm, only the <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> approach should be applied. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Reason 3: No conflicting High Court </span><span class="font-weight-bold">dicta</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I also take the opportunity to address two High Court decisions on breach of confidence that have discussed the law expounded in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> and <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Oon Kuin</span>. The defendants averred that the <span class="font-italic">dict</span><span class="font-italic">a </span>in these decisions support their position that the plaintiffs are not entitled to simultaneously claim damages under the <span class="font-italic">Coco </span>approach as well as equitable damages under the <span class="font-italic">I-Admin </span>approach.

</div> I disagree with this argument. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The first High Court judgment is that of <span class="font-italic">Writers Studio Pte Ltd v Chin Kwok Yung</span> [2022] SGHC 205 (“<span class="font-italic">Writers Studio</span>”). The defendants relied on the following <span class="font-italic">dict</span><span class="font-italic">um</span> by Lee Seiu Kin J (<span class="font-italic">Writers Studio</span> at [135]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I would add that in future cases, now that <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Oon Kuin</span> has provided clarity on the “modified approach” in<span class="font-italic"> I-Admin</span>, <span class="font-italic">counsel should take care to plead with specificity, whether they are proceeding </span><span class="font-italic">on the basis of the “wrongful loss” or “wrongful gain” interest.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-left">In my view, this statement by Lee J must be viewed in its rightful context. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In <span class="font-italic">Writers Studio</span>, the plaintiff, a business providing education support services to primary school students, claimed that the defendant, who had worked for the plaintiff as a tuition teacher, breached his duty of confidentiality by contacting the plaintiff’s clients privately, among other things (<span class="font-italic">Writers Studio</span> at [41]). One of the issues in <span class="font-italic">Writers Studio</span> was that the plaintiff did not plead that the defendant had infringed on its wrongful loss interest. Even though the claim in <span class="font-italic">Writers Studio</span> commenced after the Court of Appeal had handed down its decision in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>, the plaintiff in that case appeared unaware of the development of the <span class="font-italic">I-Admin </span>approach. The plaintiff’s pleadings had been framed based on the requirements set forth in <span class="font-italic">Coco</span>. Therefore, it appeared to have proceeded on the basis that the law was as it stood prior to <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> (<span class="font-italic">Writers Studio</span> at [134]). Given that the plaintiff had not pleaded that its wrongful loss interest was at stake, Lee J held that it was no longer open to it to rely on the <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> approach and that it “must now let the chips lie where they have fallen”. Lee J noted that even though there had been some uncertainty about the nature of the burden of proof for the defendant to show that his conscience was unaffected (prior to <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Oon Kuin</span>), “it was always open to [the plaintiff] to have pleaded the point”. Lee J also stressed that “pleadings are meant to give the other party notice of one’s case” (<span class="font-italic">Writers Studio</span> at [135]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Viewed in this context, it becomes clear that the purpose of Lee J’s <span class="font-italic">dict</span><span class="font-italic">um</span> was not to convey that a plaintiff may only plead <span class="font-italic">either</span> the wrongful loss interest or wrongful gain interest when claiming for breach of confidence. Rather, Lee J appeared to be imploring counsel to sufficiently plead their clients’ cases for breach of confidence. Given this recent development in the law, where the Court of Appeal had pronounced that not one but <span class="font-italic">two</span> distinct interests guide the operation of breach of confidence claims, it is important for a plaintiff to plead all facts pertaining to either or both of the interests that the plaintiff decides to proceed on.

In <span class="font-italic">Shanghai </span><span class="font-italic">Afute</span>, the plaintiff mounted its breach of confidence claim on two alternative bases – the defendants’ breach of cl 6(5) of its master franchise agreement and breach of a general obligation of confidentiality in common law or equity. As I found that the defendants were in breach of cl 6(5), the plaintiff was not entitled to more damages under the alternative cause of action due to the rule against double recovery. Nonetheless, I considered the merits of the plaintiff’s breach of confidence claim. This was because the plaintiff had sought an injunction on the use of the alleged confidential information and an order to deliver up any material containing the alleged confidential information only as part of the remedies for its breach of confidence claim (<span class="font-italic">Shanghai </span><span class="font-italic">Afute </span>at [99]). The plaintiff’s case was essentially that two of the defendants had misused the alleged confidential information or allowed the alleged confidential information to be misused to unlawfully gain a head start in establishing and operating the alleged competing business (<span class="font-italic">Shanghai </span><span class="font-italic">Afute </span>at [23] and [24]). I found that there was a breach of confidence by the sale and disclosure of certain confidential information to a company owned by the third defendant and granted an injunction against the first defendant to restrain him from using that certain confidential information for any purpose (<span class="font-italic">Shanghai </span><span class="font-italic">Afute </span>at [151] and [154]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In that case, I summarised the law on breach of confidence and set out the relevant approach to analysing whether there was, in fact, a breach of confidence (<span class="font-italic">Shanghai </span><span class="font-italic">Afute </span>at [100]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In summary, the following bifurcated approach is applied to establish an action for the breach of the equitable obligation of confidence:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">(a)     First, determine which interest the action for breach of confidence seeks to protect:</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">(i)       wrongful gain interest … ; or</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">(ii)       wrongful loss interest … </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b)     If the wrongful gain interest is at stake, the traditional approach <span class="font-italic">in Coco v AN Clark (Engineers) Ltd</span> [1969] RPC 41 (“<span class="font-italic">Coco</span>”) applies: <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Oon Kuin and others v Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP and another appeal</span> [2022] 2 SLR 280 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Oon Kuin</span>”) at [39] and [41].

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I accept that <span class="font-italic">Shanghai </span><span class="font-italic">Afute </span>would have provided clearer guidance if it had stated that the first step in the inquiry is to determine whether the defendant’s actions were an incursion to the wrongful gain interest <span class="font-italic">and/or</span> the wrongful loss interest. That said, the issue that I am faced with here did not arise in <span class="font-italic">Shanghai </span><span class="font-italic">Afute.</span>  In <span class="font-italic">Shanghai</span> <span class="font-italic">Afute</span>, the plaintiff simply relied on the <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> modified approach in its closing submissions with no explanation proffered for its preference for this approach. Its pleadings were silent on the <span class="font-italic">nature</span> of the interest relied on in its claim for breach of confidence (<span class="font-italic">Shanghai </span><span class="font-italic">Afute </span>at [103]). However, on the facts, the <span class="font-italic">I-Admin </span>approach did not apply. This was because <span class="font-italic">Shanghai </span><span class="font-italic">Afute</span> was not a “taker” case. The plaintiff had itself pleaded that the alleged confidential information was <span class="font-italic">provided </span>by the plaintiff to further the arrangement pursuant to parties’ master franchise agreement. Therefore, the relevant interest in <span class="font-italic">Shanghai </span><span class="font-italic">Afute </span>was the wrongful gain interest (<span class="font-italic">Shanghai </span><span class="font-italic">Afute </span>at [104]). Given that the plaintiff had (wrongly) made an election between the <span class="font-italic">I-Admin </span>approach and the <span class="font-italic">Coco </span>approach, albeit, without any explanation, I sought to draw out the required steps to make such an election and applied the relevant approach. Therefore, the approach set out at [100] and [103] in <span class="font-italic">Shanghai </span><span class="font-italic">Afute </span>was not intended to be exhaustive. The approach is to be applied where parties choose to elect between the <span class="font-italic">I-Admin </span>approach and <span class="font-italic">Coco </span>approach, but it does not mean that a plaintiff cannot simultaneously claim for its wrongful gain and wrongful loss interests in the same suit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In principle, it also makes sense for a plaintiff to be entitled to plead and claim both forms of interests. To illustrate, in a “taker” situation, Party A has unauthorisedly acquired ten confidential documents belonging to Party B. Over the course of the proceedings, it is found that only three of the ten documents were, in fact, used by Party A (so as to satisfy the third limb of the <span class="font-italic">Coco </span>approach). As for the remaining seven documents, there is no evidence that there was actionable use by Party A (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, these documents did not fulfil the third requirement of the <span class="font-italic">Coco </span>approach), but nonetheless, they were wrongfully “taken”. In such circumstances, Party B may claim for its wrongful gain interest and its wrongful loss interest. As held in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>, the wrongful loss interest is “distinct” from the wrongful gain interest (<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span> at [53]). The <span class="font-italic">Coco</span> approach and the <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> approach each seek to protect different wrongs that have been committed by the defendant against the plaintiff, and the plaintiff should be entitled to protect both interests. For completeness, I note that the parties have not argued before me that for the same document, the plaintiffs are entitled to claim for both the wrongful gain interest and the wrongful loss interest. Therefore, this judgment does not decide this issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In conclusion, a plaintiff is entitled to plead that it is proceeding on <span class="font-italic">both</span> the wrongful gain interest and the wrongful loss interest in a claim for breach of confidence and therefore claim for both damages under the <span class="font-italic">Coco </span>approach and equitable damages under the <span class="font-italic">I-Admin </span>approach. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Dedar Singh Gill<br/>Judge of the High Court </div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Derek Kang Yu Hsien and Yeo Wei Ying Jolyn (Cairnhill Law LLC) for the first and second plaintiffs;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Pereira George Barnabas and Chan Chee Yun Timothy (Pereira &amp; Tan LLC) for the first and second defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
