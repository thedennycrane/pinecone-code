The “substance test” looks at the events constituting the tort and asks where, in substance, the cause of action arose. As explained in <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore </span>at para 75.378, what these events are, and their respective significance, depend on what the plaintiff pleads as the tort that he is relying on. This is evident in the present case, where the reliance of the plaintiff on the alleged wrongful actions of the first and second defendants in the misrepresentation claim is a weighty factor in determining the place of the tort. After all, it is one element that goes towards establishing a claim in misrepresentation (see [86]–[87] below). In contrast, the reliance of the plaintiff on the alleged wrongful actions of the third defendant in the negligence claim does not feature as centrally in the determination of the place of the tort, considering that the element of reliance is merely one of the considerations when determining whether a duty of care has arisen (as further elaborated on at [53] below). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The “substance test” is a general one that is applicable to all torts, although legal principles on the application of the “substance test” to specific torts have also been developed. In the context of misrepresentation, the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span> (at [93]) that if the representation was received and acted upon in a single jurisdiction, that place should be the place of the tort, unless that place was fortuitous or if the receipt and reliance occur in different countries. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Based on the facts of this case, the key elements of the torts of fraudulent misrepresentation and negligent representation, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the receipt of the representations and the reliance upon the representations, all took place in Singapore. There is evidence that the Alleged Misrepresentations were made and received in Singapore.

</div> that the Acquisition is merely a culmination of the Alleged Misrepresentations and the plaintiff’s reliance on those representations. In and of themselves, the steps of acquisition taken in Australia have less to do with the substantive elements of the plaintiff’s claim in misrepresentation than the matters that occurred in Singapore, which took place before the plaintiff’s decision to proceed with the Acquisition. As earlier explained (at [23] above), the weight to be given to a connecting factor depends on whether that factor has a bearing on the adjudication of the issues in dispute. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 As the Alleged Misrepresentations were received and relied upon in Singapore, Singapore is the place of the torts and is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> the natural forum. There is nothing on the facts to suggest that Singapore, as the place of the torts, was fortuitous so as to displace the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> position. I do not agree with the second defendant’s argument that the fact that receipt of some of the representations took place in Singapore is entirely happenstance since the plaintiff is based in Singapore (see above at [29]). The fact that the plaintiff is based in Singapore is, as the learned AR correctly observed, “one of the significant reasons that most of the constituent acts in the alleged torts occurred in Singapore” (<span class="font-italic">Vibrant Group Ltd 1 </span>at [35]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Other connecting factors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The second defendant relies heavily on the steps taken by the plaintiff in Australia to acquire Blackgold Australia and the LOU as connecting factors to Australia. As observed earlier (see [34] above), these steps taken to acquire Blackgold Australia are more in the nature of consequences flowing from the commission of the torts. They are therefore not weighty connecting factors since they have little bearing on the adjudication of the issues in the plaintiff’s action in misrepresentation against the second defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I will now turn to consider the LOU as a connecting factor. The second defendant claims that the plaintiff’s alleged covenant in the LOU not to make any claim against him (see [12] above) is a connecting factor to Australia. He asserts that the circumstances leading up to the signing of the LOU and the interpretation of its terms will be key issues for determination at trial. The second defendant further contends that since the signing of the LOU took place in Australia and the preamble of the LOU makes reference to the scheme, which was to be implemented in Australia (see [11] above), the LOU is governed by Australia law.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In my view, the LOU is a relevant connecting factor that must be weighed in the balance. However, while the second defendant relies on it as an alleged agreement in his defence, the issue as regards its existence and effect is separate from the main issues for adjudication in the misrepresentation action. Even if it is accepted for the sake of argument that the LOU is governed by Australia law, as the learned AR correctly found, greater weight should be placed on the law applicable to the torts in this action than on the governing law of the LOU (<span class="font-italic">Vibrant Group Ltd 1</span> at [40(c)]). In other words, even if the LOU is governed by Australia law, it would be insufficient to outweigh the competing consideration that the applicable law of the misrepresentation action is Singapore law, given my finding that Singapore is the place of the torts (see [35] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In fact, there are a number of other connecting factors pointing to Singapore as the more appropriate forum to determine the action between the plaintiff and the second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 First, the plaintiff is a company incorporated and publicly listed in Singapore.

The learned AR had considered the fact of reliance by the plaintiff on the audit report to be relevant in the determination of the place of the tort and accorded due weight to it (see <span class="font-italic">Vibrant Group Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">v Tong Chi Ho and others </span>[2022] SGHCR 8 (“<span class="font-italic">Vibrant Group Ltd 2”</span>) at [32(c)]). The authorities are clear that in cases of pure economic loss where the links between the parties are not “bounded by the physical laws of nature”, a duty of care would generally arise “where the defendant has voluntarily assumed responsibility to the plaintiff and/or the plaintiff has reasonably relied on the defendant to take care to avoid such loss” (<span class="font-italic">NTUC </span><span class="font-italic">Foodfare Co-operative Ltd v SIA Engineering Co Ltd and another</span> [2018] 4 SLR 762 at [21]). On appeal, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">NTUC </span><span class="font-italic">Foodfare Co-operative Ltd v SIA Engineering Co Ltd and another </span>[2018] 2 SLR 588 further observed (at [41]) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… in cases of pure economic loss, there may be sufficient legal proximity between the parties even if the defendant does not voluntarily assume responsibility to the plaintiff and the latter does not specifically rely on the former not to cause it loss … We agree with the Judge that there was no assumption of responsibility or specific reliance. However, in our judgment, these are neither essential nor inflexible conditions for the requirement of proximity to be fulfilled in cases of pure economic loss. Other aspects of the relationship between the parties may establish a sufficiently close relation between them for a duty of care to arise; it is thus necessary to consider physical, circumstantial and causal proximity and the proximity factors referred to … above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53  Having regard to the reliance that the plaintiff placed on the Partnership, I agree with the conclusion of the learned AR and the third defendant’s submissions,

</div> that the duty of care, if any arises, emanates from the Partnership’s duty to take reasonable care in complying with Australia law and the applicable accounting or auditing principles, standards and practices in Australia. The plaintiff’s argument that is premised on the reliance of the plaintiff as one of the proximity factors does not shift the balance towards Singapore as the proper forum. The element of reliance, which must be established to succeed in a misrepresentation claim, is only one of the possible ways by which a duty of care could arise in a negligence claim. Any reliance by the plaintiff is therefore accorded greater significance in the misrepresentation action against the second defendant and less significance in the negligence action against the third defendant. Accordingly, I am of the view that the learned AR did not err in the amount of emphasis that he gave to the place of reliance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The principles guiding the application of the “substance test” in respect of the <span class="font-italic">tort of negligence</span> appears to be a relatively unexplored point of law in our local jurisprudence.

</div> I turn now to examine the English and Australian authorities cited by the third defendant on this point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In <span class="font-italic">Base Metal Trading</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Shamurin</span> [2005] 1 WLR 1157 (“<span class="font-italic">Base Metal Trading</span>”),<span class="font-italic"> </span>the defendant and two Russian nationals were in the business of investing and trading in metal. They had formed a number of Russian companies for this purpose but wanted to set up a foreign company that would attract customers who were reluctant to trade with the existing Russian companies in view of the prevailing banking, legal and regulatory situation in Russia at the time. The claimant company was thus set up and incorporated in Guernsey, and the defendant and one of the Russian nationals (“Yuri”) were made directors of the claimant company. The defendant was responsible for selling metal to foreign purchasers and was generally responsible for the claimant company’s activities outside of Russia. The defendant and Yuri had agreed that the claimant company would hedge the company’s exposure on resale price on physical trades by means of future trades made on the London Metal Exchange. Subsequently, the claimant company alleged that the defendant made a series of speculative trades in the name of the claimant company that resulted in losses of over £6m. The claimant company thus brought a claim for the damages and losses suffered as a result of the defendant’s alleged breach of duty of care. At first instance, the judge found, among other things, that the claim in tort was governed by Russian law, under which it was undisputed that the claims were not actionable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The judge at first instance answered the question “where in substance was the tort committed?” by identifying “the gravamen of the case against [the defendant] as being [his] decision to speculate” (<span class="font-italic">Base Metal Trading </span>at [16]). This was a decision made in Moscow, Russia, where all aspects of the claimant company’s business were conducted. The judge also found that although the trades were done in London where the claimant company had its bank account, the place where the loss was in fact felt by the claimant company was Russia, manifested by its lack of liquidity (<span class="font-italic">Base Metal Trading </span>at [16]). The judge’s decision was affirmed in part on appeal to the English Court of Appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Tuckey LJ (delivering the leading judgment of the English Court of Appeal) reasoned (at [46]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> <span class="font-italic">… </span><span class="font-italic">the wrongful acts</span>, being the decisions to speculate and give instructions accordingly, <span class="font-italic">all took place in Russia</span>. <span class="font-italic">The place where the loss occurs is not determinative.</span> When damage has occurred which makes the tort complete the right approach is to look back over the series of events constituting it and ask where in substance the cause of action arose: see <span class="font-italic">Distillers Co (Biochemicals) Ltd v Thompson </span>[1971] AC 458, 468. The judge after this long trial was entitled to conclude that [the claimant] really felt its loss in Russia. As part of its claim it had alleged that it had been unable to fulfil a contract in Russia because of the liquidity crisis caused by [the defendant’s] activities. The judge obviously did not ignore the fact that the trading losses occurred in London where [the claimant] had its bank account, but again it does not seem to me that these factors compelled the judge to conclude that all [the claimant company’s] loss had occurred here, still less that the substance of the tort was committed here [in the United Kingdom]. [emphasis added]  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 <span class="font-italic">Distillers Co (Biochemicals) Ltd v Laura Anne Thompson </span>[1971] AC 458 (“<span class="font-italic">Distillers Co</span>”) is a case that was cited with approval by our Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals </span>(at [90]) and <span class="font-italic">M</span><span class="font-italic">AN Diesel (CA)</span> (at [101] and [103]) as authority for the “substance test”. In <span class="font-italic">Distillers Co</span>, the first defendant was an English company which manufactured a drug containing thalidomide. The drug was distributed to an Australian company which sold it in New South Wales. The claimant’s mother bought and ingested the drug while pregnant, which allegedly caused the claimant to be born without arms and with defective eyesight. The claimant commenced an action in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, alleging that the first defendant’s negligence as the manufacturer and supplier of the drug caused the claimant to be born with disabilities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In upholding the decision of the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of New South Wales refusing the first defendant’s attempt at setting aside the writ, the Privy Council reasoned (at 469B–469E) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">So far as appears, the goods were not defective or incorrectly manufactured. The negligence was in failure to give a warning that the goods would be dangerous if taken by an expectant mother in the first three months of pregnancy … The plaintiff is entitled to complain of the lack of such communication in New South Wales [even though the warning could have been put in place when the drug was manufactured in England] as negligence by the defendant in New South Wales causing injury to the plaintiff there. That is the act (which must include omission) on the part of the English company which has given the plaintiff a cause of complaint in law. The cause of action arose within the jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Importantly, the Privy Council also cautioned that it would be inappropriate to determine the place of the tort based only on the place where damage happened (at 467H–468A):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In a negligence case the happening of damage to the plaintiff is a necessary ingredient in the cause of action, and it is the last event completing the cause of action. But the place where it happens may be quite fortuitous and should not by itself be the sole determinant of jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In <span class="font-italic">Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc v </span><span class="font-italic">Gutnick </span>[2002] 194 ALR 433 (“<span class="font-italic">Dow Jones</span>”), a case involving the tort of defamation, the High Court of Australia made the following general observation<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [43]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Attempts to apply a single rule of location (such as a rule that intentional torts are committed where the tortfeasor acts, or that torts are committed in the place where the last event necessary to make the actor liable has taken place) have proved unsatisfactory if only because the rules pay insufficient regard to the different kinds of tortious claims that may be made … In the end the question is ‘where in substance did this cause of action arise’? In cases, like trespass or <span class="font-italic">negligence</span>, where <span class="font-italic">some quality of the defendant’s conduct is critical</span>, <span class="font-italic">it will usually be very important to look to where the defendant acted, not to where the consequences of the conduct were felt.</span> [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In my view, the decisions in <span class="font-italic">Base Metal Trading</span>, <span class="font-italic">Distillers Co </span>and <span class="font-italic">Dow Jones </span>provide instructive guidance, considering that the “substance test” was identified as the applicable test for determining the place of the tort in each of those cases. <span class="font-italic">Distillers Co </span>is also the very authority that our Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span> and <span class="font-italic">MAN Diesel (CA)</span> relied upon for the “substance test” (see [58] above). Read together with <span class="font-italic">Dow Jones</span> (see [61] above), the place where the alleged wrongful act was committed is to be given greater significance in a case involving the tort of negligence. On the other hand, the place where the loss was suffered is not, by itself, determinative. It is on this basis that in <span class="font-italic">Base Metal Trading</span>, the place of the tort was adjudged to be Russia, where the wrongful decisions to speculate were taken and instructions to trade were given accordingly (see [55]–[57] above). Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Distillers Co</span>, the place of the tort was found to be Australia, where the defendant failed to provide any warning of possible side effects of the drug for pregnant women (see [58]–[59] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The crux of the plaintiff’s action against the third defendant is premised on the Partnership’s alleged negligence in conducting the audit and in rendering the audit report, and its alleged failure to uncover the Irregularities. Since the Partnership is alleged to have fallen short of an alleged duty of care owed to the plaintiff in relation to professional services provided by the Partnership in Australia, the place of the alleged wrongdoing is Australia. As such, even if the provision of the third defendant’s professional services in Australia involved an audit exercise that may have spanned across various jurisdictions, the conclusion remains unchanged. I therefore find that the learned AR did not err in concluding that “the fact that parts of the audit may possibly have been conducted in the PRC or Malaysia does not aid the plaintiff’s attempt to demonstrate that Singapore is the proper forum” (see <span class="font-italic">Vibrant Group Ltd 2 </span>at [32(b)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I note additionally that beyond the cases cited by the third defendant, there appears to be further support for giving significant weight to the place where the negligent act occurred in determining the place of the tort. In Martin Davies <span class="font-italic">et al</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Nygh’s Conflict of Laws in Australia </span>(LexisNexis Butterworths, 10th Ed, 2020) (“<span class="font-italic">Nygh’s</span><span class="font-italic"> Conflict of Laws</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at paras 20.9 and 20.12, the position in Australia is as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">20.9 If the tort alleged is based on a negligent act or omission of the defendant causing physical harm, the tort is committed in the place where that negligent act or omission occurred, even though consequential injury was suffered elsewhere … <span class="font-italic">The same is true in cases of negligent acts causing purely economic loss; the tort is committed where the negligent act occurred, not where the loss was suffered</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">20.12 <span class="font-italic">If the negligence consists of a failure to provide services or advice without proper care, the tort is committed in the place where those services were or ought to have been rendered</span> … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 For the proposition at para 20.12, <span class="font-italic">Nygh’s</span><span class="font-italic"> Conflict of Laws </span>refers to the case of <span class="font-italic">Voth</span><span class="font-italic"> v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd </span>(1990) 97 ALR 124 (“<span class="font-italic">Voth</span>”). I am mindful that <span class="font-italic">Voth</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>concerned a stay application, and that the test of whether the forum in which a stay was sought was a “clearly inappropriate forum” endorsed in <span class="font-italic">Voth</span> has been rejected by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [45].

The respondents obtained leave to serve their statement of claim outside New South Wales and in the State of Missouri, United States of America (the “US”), in order to commence professional negligence proceedings in the Supreme Court of New South Wales against the appellant, who was an accountant practising in the State of Missouri. The appellant had provided accounting, auditing and related services to the Group’s operating company in the US (“MMC”), which was a corporation established under the laws of the State of Kansas. The Internal Revenue Code of the US imposed upon the first respondent liability to income tax in respect of interest paid to it by MMC and also imposed an obligation upon MMC to deduct and withhold the tax. The required deductions and payments of withholding tax were not made, and the respondents alleged that the failure to do so was the result of negligent acts or omissions by the appellant. The damage to the respondents was largely suffered in New South Wales. The appellant submitted, among other things, that New South Wales was a clearly inappropriate forum (this being the test in Australian jurisprudence for cases concerning service out of jurisdiction) because the cause of action sued on by the respondents is a foreign tort, given that the acts or omissions complained of occurred outside New South Wales (<span class="font-italic">Voth</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at 142). The High Court of Australia (per Mason CJ, Dean, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ, with Brennan J dissenting), held that the allegedly negligent act was initiated and completed in Missouri and thus the tort, if there was one, was committed in Missouri. In arriving at this conclusion, the majority reasoned as follows (<span class="font-italic">Voth</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at 143–144):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It was held in <span class="font-italic">Jackson v </span><span class="font-italic">Spittall </span>(1870) LR 5 CP 542 [(<span class="font-italic">“Jackson v </span><span class="font-italic">Spittall</span>”)] at 552, that the question whether a cause of action is to be classified as local or foreign is to be answered by ascertaining the place of ‘the act on the part of the defendant which gives the plaintiff his cause of complaint’ … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The authority of <span class="font-italic">Jackson v </span><span class="font-italic">Spittall </span>was expressly affirmed in [<span class="font-italic">Dist</span><span class="font-italic">illers Co</span>], at 467 [in which the Privy Council adopted the “substance test”] … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The approach formulated in <span class="font-italic">Distillers </span>[<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the “substance test”] does no more than lay down an approach by which there is to be ascertained, in a common sense way, that which is required by <span class="font-italic">Jackson v </span><span class="font-italic">Spittall</span>, namely, the place of ‘the act on the part of the defendant which gives the plaintiff his cause of complaint’ … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">One thing that is clear from <span class="font-italic">Jackson v </span><span class="font-italic">Spittall</span> and from <span class="font-italic">Distillers</span> is that<span class="font-italic"> it is some act of the defendant, and not its consequences, that must be the focus of attention. </span>Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Distillers</span> the act of ingestion of the drug Distaval by the plaintiff’s mother was ignored, the place of that act being treated like the place of the happening of damage, as one that might have been ‘quite fortuitous’.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The act of the appellant giving the respondents their cause of complaint was committed in Missouri and thus the tort, if there was one, was committed in Missouri.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 As can be gleaned from the above extract, the majority held that it was the location of the defendant’s <span class="font-italic">actions </span>and not the location where the <span class="font-italic">consequences </span>of those actions were felt that must be the focus of attention. The place of the tort was found to be Missouri in the US, because the negligent audit was done there.

</div> It appears that the plaintiff has conflated the tort of negligent misrepresentation with the tort of negligence. It is clear from the majority’s decision that “[each respondent company sued] for damages for the <span class="font-italic">tort of negligence</span>” [emphasis added] (see <span class="font-italic">Voth</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at 127). I am cognisant that the majority in <span class="font-italic">Voth</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>made reference to the phrase “negligent misstatement”, for instance, when it stated at 144 that “[t]he present case is one that may be properly described either as a failure to advise (ie, an omission) or as a negligent misstatement of fact (ie, a positive act)”, but this is distinct from the tort of negligent misrepresentation. Further, it is unclear how the plaintiff’s argument (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the principles in <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals </span>specific to the tort of misrepresentation should be applied here) advances its case, given that the plaintiff’s pleaded case is one of negligence. In particular, the plaintiff has pleaded that “[t]he Partnership owed the [p]laintiff a duty of care to exercise reasonable skill and care … to be expected of reasonably skilled, competent and/or prudent auditors …”, the duty of care encompassed taking reasonable care to, among other things, “[a]ct in accordance with the applicable auditing standards in Australia …” and the Partnership had “negligently conducted its audit …”.

</div> There is no allegation of misrepresentation against the Partnership. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In relation to the standard of care that is owed, the applicable accounting and auditing standards, being Australian, are connecting factors to Australia, even if it is accepted that they are largely similar to the standards in Singapore as counsel for the plaintiff contends (see [51(b)] above). The learned AR was correct to give due weight to the fact that the duty of care allegedly owed by the Partnership is based on Australia law and that the Partnership was bound by Australia auditing standards, which will determine if there was any wrongdoing on the Partnership’s part by virtue of their falling short of the standard of care required of them.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The plaintiff’s reliance on the possibility of transfer to the SICC to argue that Singapore is the proper forum is misplaced.

</div> The plaintiff’s action against the third defendant is directed at the audit that flowed from this contract between Blackgold Australia and the Partnership.

</div> which is governed by Australia law and contains an exclusive jurisdiction clause in favour of the Australia courts. Pursuant to this indemnity clause, the Partnership is contractually entitled to bring third party proceedings or a counterclaim against Blackgold Australia to seek a contribution or indemnity. The learned AR observed (in <span class="font-italic">Vibrant Group Ltd 2 </span>at [37]) that the indemnity clause is a factor pointing towards Australia as the proper forum because any third party proceedings or counterclaims brought by the third defendant to seek a contribution or indemnity must be brought in Australia, in light of the exclusive jurisdiction clause in favour of the Australia courts. The learned AR nevertheless found that this factor was to be accorded less weight because whether any such proceedings will eventually be brought is speculative at this stage and in any event, the exclusive jurisdiction clause does not bind the plaintiff, who is not a party to the contract. The plaintiff takes issue with the learned AR’s observations, arguing that this factor is wholly irrelevant to the plaintiff’s claim against the third defendant because “no prejudice or injustice will be suffered by [the third defendant] even if it is required to bring indemnity proceedings against Blackgold Australia in Australia, while the [plaintiff’s] action against [the third defendant] is determined in Singapore”.

In respect of the claim in negligent misrepresentation, the plaintiff would have to show that the first and second defendants owed the plaintiff a duty to take reasonable care in making the representations and that the first and second defendants breached that duty.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 On the other hand, for the plaintiff’s claim in negligence against the third defendant, the plaintiff would have to establish five cumulative elements as follows (<span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span><span class="font-italic"> Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency </span>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 100<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [21]):</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the defendant owes the plaintiff a duty of care; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the defendant has breached that duty of care by acting (or omitting to act) below the standard of care required of it;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) the defendant’s breach has caused the plaintiff damage; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) the plaintiff’s losses arising from the defendant’s breach are not too remote; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) such losses can be adequately proved and quantified.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The inquiry for the claim in negligence against the third defendant, in contrast to the inquiry for the claims in fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentation against the first and second defendants, will be centred on what the Partnership was engaged to do, the level of skill that is to be expected of a reasonably competent auditor and the investigation or steps that would have been taken by a reasonably competent auditor to uncover “irregular or unusual matters” (<span class="font-italic">Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 23rd Ed, 2020) at paras 9-231 to 9-232, citing <span class="font-italic">Pacific Acceptance Corporation Ltd v Forsyth</span> (1970) 92 WN (NSW) 29 at 62). Contrary to what the plaintiff contends, in dealing with the plaintiff’s claim against the third defendant for professional negligence in its role as auditor, an Australia court would likely not need to determine any substantial issue about whether the first and second defendants in fact made any misrepresentations to induce the plaintiff to acquire Blackgold Australia. Rather, as submitted by the third defendant, the inquiry would be focused on whether a reasonable auditor in the same position as the Partnership would have reached the same conclusions which it arrived at.

</div> The inquiry would be undertaken by examining, in the main, the financial and accounting records that were before the Partnership. It would focus on matters such as, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, whether the auditor was put on inquiry by the existence of irregularities within the records (<span class="font-italic">PlanAssure</span><span class="font-italic"> PAC (formerly known as Patrick Lee PAC) v Gaelic Inns Pte Ltd </span>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 513 at [54], [65], [69], [73] and [77]) or whether the auditor failed to qualify its audit report when faced with the inability to obtain audit evidence (<span class="font-italic">JSI Shipping (S) Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Teofoongwonglcloong (a firm) </span>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 460 at [113]).<span style="color: rgba(79,129,189,1)"> </span>As provided by the contract between the Partnership and Blackgold Australia:

[The Partnership] will not verify the accuracy and completeness of such documentation or information.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The contractual clause provides context for the scope of the duty of care owed by the Partnership and goes towards showing that the Partnership’s duty did not extend to warranting against misrepresentations that would not have been detected by a reasonable auditor in the shoes of the Partnership. Seen in this context, the risk of re-litigation and conflicting decisions must not be overstated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 As for the plaintiff’s claims against the second defendant for fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentation, not only do the connecting factors point to Singapore; the claims are also clearly more closely connected with the plaintiff’s claims against the first defendant based on the same causes of action than the claims against the third defendant based on negligence. The plaintiff’s claims against the second defendant should therefore be tried in Singapore together with the claims against the first defendant as there are common facts and issues involved. Indeed, if the plaintiff’s action against the first defendant were tried in Singapore but the plaintiff’s action against the second defendant were tried in Australia, that would lead to an even greater risk of conflicting decisions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the service out of jurisdiction orders should be set aside because of the plaintiff’s failure to make full and frank disclosure of all material facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 For completeness, I address the issue of the plaintiff’s alleged failure to make full and frank disclosure of all material facts in obtaining leave to serve the originating process on the third defendant outside Singapore. This is strictly not necessary given that I have affirmed the learned AR’s decision to set aside the service out of jurisdiction order in respect of the third defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Before the learned AR, the third defendant took issue with the plaintiff’s omission to mention certain facts that point to the connection between the dispute and Australia. The learned AR found that the only such omission by the plaintiff was the failure to draw the court’s attention specifically to the exclusive jurisdiction clause in the Engagement Letter, which was, in his view, not a material omission, since the plaintiff had already disclosed other linkages to Australia and the plaintiff is not bound by the Engagement Letter nor the exclusive jurisdiction clause found therein (<span class="font-italic">Vibrant Group Ltd 2 </span>at [47]). I have no reason to disagree with the learned AR’s exercise of discretion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The third defendant also argues on appeal that the plaintiff had failed to state whether Singapore was the more appropriate forum. In addition, the defendant contends that the plaintiff had failed to state that it did not know where the audit was conducted.

</div> As stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tay Long Kee Impex </span>at [21], material facts are those which would have been material for the court to know in dealing with the application, and includes those facts that the applicant would have known if it had made proper inquiries. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In my view, the omission of the plaintiff to state whether Singapore was the more appropriate forum would be more appropriately regarded as a failure to substantiate a relevant factor in its application. By that omission, the plaintiff put its application at risk of a dismissal. As for the fact that the plaintiff did not know where the audit was conducted, I am unable to agree with the third defendant that the plaintiff’s lack of knowledge is itself material information which the court would necessarily have considered at the <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte</span> stage, in deciding whether to grant the order for service out of jurisdiction. It would have had little bearing on whether the requirements to obtain leave to serve out of jurisdiction were satisfied. The circumstances of the case also do not suggest any deliberate attempt by the plaintiff to mischaracterise the situation or to convey any false impression that the issue of proper forum was not in dispute.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion and orders made</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 For the above reasons, I dismiss RA 92/2022 and RA 234/2022, and uphold the orders made by the learned AR. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 I will hear parties on the question of costs separately.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Teh Hwee Hwee  <br/>Judicial Commissioner</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Thio Shen Yi SC, Chan Kah Keen Melvin, Ee Eng Yew Justin, Yong Wei Jie Timothy and Terence Yeo (TSMP Law Corporation) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Cham Shan Jie Mark (Zhan Shanjie) and Matthew Tan Jun Ye (Aquinas Law Alliance LLP) for the second defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Gary Leonard Low, Tan Wee Kio Terence (Chen Weiqiao) and Tan Jia Yi (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the third defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The first defendant absent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
