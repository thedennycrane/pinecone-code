<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, Labroy Offshore Ltd
                    (“Labroy”) entered into a construction contract dated 28 March
                    2007 (“the Construction Contract”) with the first defendant,
                    Master Marine AS (“MM”) under which Labroy was to construct a
                    self-elevating offshore unit (“the Rig”) for MM. Under the
                    Construction Contract, MM was to pay the contract price in six instalments
                    according to certain milestones. The first five instalments were deemed to be
                    “advances” to Labroy, with the sixth and final instalment due upon
                    delivery. Labroy was obliged to provide Refund Guarantees for repayment of each
                    of the first five instalments, which it did by arranging banker’s
                    guarantees from the second, third and fourth defendants in MM’s favour
                    (“the Refund Guarantees”) to guarantee the refund of MM’s
                    advances upon certain contingencies. The second, third and fourth defendants are
                    Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd, United Overseas Bank Ltd and DBS Bank
                    Pte Ltd respectively (collectively, “the Banks”). MM later
                    purported to rescind the Construction Contract under various articles thereof
                    and issued demands for payment under the Refund Guarantees to the Banks. Labroy
                    applied for an injunction to restrain the Banks from paying MM and to enjoin MM
                    from receiving payment thereby.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       After hearing the submissions of Labroy, MM and
                    the Banks, I granted Labroy’s application for an injunction against
                    MM. There was no need to make an order against the Banks because they adopted
                    the same position as Labroy. On MM’s request, I reserved my decision on
                    the question of costs. I set out below my reasons for allowing
                    Labroy’s application against MM.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       As the factual matrix of this case is fairly
                    complex, it will be helpful to explain first the relevant provisions of the
                    Construction Contract and the Refund Guarantees respectively, before explaining
                    the genesis of the dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Construction Contract and the Refund Guarantees</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       As explained above at <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a>, under Art 3.8 of the Construction Contract, the contract
                    price was to be paid in six instalments, the first five of which were deemed
                    “advances”. In respect of these advances, Labroy was obliged to
                    provide Refund Guarantees for its repayment upon certain contingencies.
                    The Refund Guarantees were initially set to expire one month following the
                    original delivery date, <em>ie</em>, 31 September
                    2010. However, if Labroy anticipated that delivery of the Rig would be delayed,
                    the Refund Guarantees were to be extended at least 14 working days before the
                    Refund Guarantee(s) expired. The extension was to be “for a further
                    thirty (30) days, <em>always ensuring that the Refund
                        Guarantee(s) is valid until the date falling thirty (30) days beyond the
                        delivery of the rig</em>” [emphasis added]. Failure to extend
                    the Refund Guarantees at least 14 working days before the expiry of the Refund
                    Guarantees is itself an event of default under the Construction Contract,
                    entitling MM to rescind the Construction Contract and demand a refund of the
                    advances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The “demands” under the Refund Guarantees</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Refund Guarantees (and not the Construction
                    Contract) provide for three types of “demands”, <em>ie</em>, three sets of circumstances in which MM may demand for a
                    refund of the relevant advances. While each of the advances is secured by three
                    Refund Guarantees by the Banks (each as to one-third of the advance), the Refund
                    Guarantees are in identical terms pertaining to the “Demands” as
                    set out below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The first type of “demand” is the
                    “Initial Demand”: under sub-para (b) of the first sub-para of para
                    3 of the Refund Guarantees – the sub-clauses are unfortunately not
                    numbered – the Banks are obliged to make payment to MM within 14 Singapore
                    banking days following the receipt of a written demand from MM for refund, such
                    demand stating that the Construction Contract has been cancelled or rescinded by
                    MM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       However, if within five Singapore banking days
                    from the date of the receipt of an Initial Demand the Banks receive notification
                    from MM that Labroy disputes MM’s claim for refund and that the matter has
                    been referred to arbitration, the Banks are entitled to defer payment of the sum
                    claimed under the Initial Demand. The Banks would then only be liable to make
                    payment of the sum eventually adjudged to be due to MM pursuant to an
                    arbitration award or agreed pursuant to a settlement agreement. The sum would be
                    payable immediately upon receipt from MM of a further written demand for such a
                    sum. This is the second type of “demand”, <em>ie</em>, a “Deferred Demand”, referred to in the second
                    sub-para of para 3 of the Refund Guarantees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The third type, the “New Demand”,
                    is that which gave rise to the contention between the parties. The fourth
                    sub-para of para 3 of the Refund Guarantees set out the circumstances in which a
                    New Demand may be made, and they are linked to Labroy’s obligation to
                    provide replacement guarantees to MM. Under the Refund Guarantees, MM was
                    entitled to request replacement guarantees from Labroy:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     in the event of any possible delay in
                        the delivery of the Rig; or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     if an Initial Demand has been made and MM’s claim
                        for a refund of its advances was disputed and referred to arbitration but
                        the said arbitration could not reasonably be expected to conclude 30
                        Singapore banking days before the Refund Guarantees
                    expired.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The replacement guarantees were: (a) to be issued by
                    the Banks on similar terms; (b) had to carry an expiry date 30 calendar days
                    from the new anticipated date of delivery of the Rig or the conclusion of the
                    arbitration, as the case may be; and (c) had to be furnished to MM no later than
                    14 Singapore banking days before the expiry date of the existing Refund
                    Guarantees. If Labroy did not comply, MM was entitled to make a written demand
                    to have its advances refunded (<em>ie</em>, a New Demand).
                    Under this New Demand, the entire sum claimed by MM had to be paid immediately
                    by the Banks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       I pause here to clarify that although the
                    language of Art 3.8 of the Construction Contract and the language of the Refund
                    Guarantees differ in that Art 3.8 refers to “extensions to the Refund
                    Guarantee” while the latter refer to “replacement
                    guarantees”, all parties used the expressions “extensions to
                    Refund Guarantee” and “replacement guarantees”
                    interchangeably. When asked, all parties accepted that in effect the two were
                    the same, <em>ie</em>, extending the validity period of the
                    Refund Guarantees.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The genesis of the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">MM’s request for replacement guarantees</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Upon realising that there would be a delay in
                    the delivery of the Rig, MM sent letters to Labroy (dated 12 and
                    28 January, 14 February, 6 and 17 March and finally 6 April
                    2011) stating that given the anticipated delay in the delivery of the Rig, the
                    validity period of the Refund Guarantees would have to be extended. While the
                    content of these letters varied, they each ultimately contained some variation
                    of the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     a statement that, given the
                        anticipated delay in the delivery of the Rig, a later validity/expiry date
                        of the Refund Guarantees was necessary and, accordingly, that the recently
                        procured extensions to the Refund Guarantees were <em>not</em> in accordance with the Construction Contract/Refund
                        Guarantees; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     a request for Labroy to issue valid replacement guarantees in accordance
                        with the terms of the Refund Guarantees and the Construction
                        Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Labroy disputed (a) and argued that the
                    validity/expiry dates were extended in accordance with Art 3.8 and that MM had
                    reached the above conclusion through an erroneous interpretation of Art
                    3.8.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     All parties agreed that the final day for
                    Labroy to procure extensions of the validity period of the Refund Guarantees
                    from 30 April to 31 May 2011 was 12 April 2011. Labroy applied
                    for the said extensions on 6 April 2011; on 8 April 2011 the Banks
                    duly extended the Refund Guarantees to 31 May 2011. However, MM was only
                    informed of these extensions on 12 April 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">MM rescinds the Construction Contract and invokes the Refund
                Guarantees</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 11 April 2011, at 9.48pm, Pal Are Sund
                    (“Pal”) from MM wrote to Ms Pearl Ann Jeyaraj of Labroy
                    (“PAJ”) enquiring why Labroy had not sent MM “new
                    [replacement guarantees] within the time frame given in the [Construction
                    Contract]”. PAJ replied on the same day at 10.17pm informing Pal that she
                    was told “that [Replacement Guarantees] will be issued tomorrow (14
                    working days prior to 30th April)” (<em>ie</em>, 12
                    April 2011).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 12 April 2011, MM sent Labroy a Notice of
                    Rescission, purporting to rescind the contract on two grounds:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     That Labroy had failed to secure
                        replacement guarantees by 7 April 2011 in accordance with the
                        Construction Contract, and by 11 April 2011 in accordance with the
                        original guarantee; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     That Labroy had failed to deliver the Rig for a period in
                        excess of 180 days after the delivery date and failed to deliver the Rig for
                        a period in excess of 270 days after the delivery date, such number of days
                        being the maximum allowable as the total accumulated delay of
                        non-permissible delay and <em>force majeure</em> delay
                        under the Construction Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Later that day, after the purported
                    rescission, MM served letters of demand to the Banks, seeking payment under the
                    Refund Guarantees. These letters of demand stated that the Construction Contract
                    had been rescinded pursuant to Labroy’s failure to provide extensions to
                    and/or replacement of the Refund Guarantees and to deliver the Rig on the agreed
                    delivery date. Specifically, two types of demands were made by MM:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     New Demands on the ground that
                        Labroy had failed to provide replacement guarantees at least 14 Singapore
                        banking days before the expiry of the Refund Guarantees;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     Further, or in the alternative,
                        Initial Demands on the basis that the Construction Contract had been validly
                        rescinded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Later that night, at 9.42pm, Labroy responded
                    to the Notice of Rescission by e-mail asserting that the Refund Guarantees had
                    been validly extended.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 13 April 2011, MM acknowledged receipt of
                    Labroy’s 12 April 2011 e-mail and stated that without prejudice to
                    the service of the Notice of Rescission, the guarantee extensions furnished on
                    12 April 2011 did not comply with the Construction Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Reference of dispute to arbitration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Labroy and MM agreed to arbitrate their
                    dispute, <em>ie</em>, whether MM was entitled to rescind
                    the Construction Contract either on the ground that Labroy failed to issue
                    replacement guarantees in accordance with the Construction Contract or that it
                    failed to deliver the Rig within the time stipulated in the Construction
                    Contract (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above). Accordingly, MM
                    notified the Banks, following up from the Initial Demands made, that its claim
                    for refund of its advances was disputed and had been referred to arbitration
                    (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary of pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Labroy’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     First, Labroy submitted that having made an
                    Initial Demand it was abusive and unconscionable, taking into account the
                    purpose of the Initial Demand and the New Demand within the scheme of Refund
                    Guarantees, for MM to also make a New Demand. Further, it asserted that MM had
                    received the benefit of its bargain and the purpose of the New Demand was
                    consequently extinguished, the purpose of both the Initial Demand and New Demand
                    being to secure MM’s right to a refund of the advances. Labroy emphasised
                    that the Refund Guarantees remained valid and MM’s right to a refund of
                    its advances remained secure, provided MM proved its right to rescind the
                    Construction Contract in arbitration. Further, it argued that MM’s veiled
                    purpose in making the New Demand was to enable MM to circumvent having to wait
                    for the arbitration award or settlement agreement before the Banks are obliged
                    to make payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     While Labroy accepted that the extension to
                    the Refund Guarantees were procured a day late, it argued that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     this was due to inadvertence on its
                        part, failing to take into account the Good Friday public
                    holiday;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     that MM
                        knew of this mistake; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     that MM had failed to exercise its right to rescind
                        during the requisite five-day time frame.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Accordingly, it
                    argued that MM’s making of the New Demands in these circumstances was
                    unconscionable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Second, Labroy submitted that the New Demands
                    were invalid under the terms of the Refund Guarantees. It argued that the
                    relevant clause in the Refund Guarantee (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above) contemplated two separate situations:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     Where an Initial Demand has not been
                        made and where there was a possible delay to the delivery of the Rig
                        (“limb (i)”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     If an Initial Demand has been made and arbitration is not
                        expected to conclude within 30 days before the expiry of the Refund
                        Guarantee (“limb (ii)”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It urged the court
                    to adopt a contextual, purposive construction and, accordingly, reach the
                    following conclusions: first, that MM’s right to make a New Demand under
                    limb (i) only applies where an Initial Demand has not been made; and second,
                    that MM is entitled to make a New Demand under limb (ii) only where an Initial
                    Demand has been made. It asserted that this interpretation best accorded with
                    the parties’ intentions and accepted purpose of the New Demand (<em>ie</em>, to function as security for the Refund Guarantees).
                    Alternatively, it argued that it is an implied term of the Refund Guarantees
                    and/or the Construction Contract that MM cannot simultaneously make a New Demand
                    and an Initial Demand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">MM’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     It should be noted that counsel for MM
                    clarified during the hearing in chambers (on 6 June 2011) that they were
                    relying only on a New Demand under limb (i), to use Labroy’s terminology
                    above at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>. Accordingly, MM’s case
                    was built on the basis that it made valid New Demands under limb (i) of the
                    Refund Guarantees on 12 April 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Second, MM denied Labroy’s allegation of
                    unconscionability. MM contended that, first, it played no part in Labroy’s
                    inadvertent failure to procure the replacement guarantees; and, second it would
                    be unconscionable to “deprive an innocent party of its contractual rights
                    merely because the party in breach failed to exercise its own diligence in
                    ensuring compliance”. In support of this, it cited in support <em>Dauphin Offshore Engineering &amp; Trading Pte Ltd v The Private
                        Office of HRH Sheikh Sultan bin Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan</em>
                    [2000] 1 SLR(R) 117 at [50]; <em>Astrata (Singapore)
                        Pte Ltd v Tridex Technologies Pte Ltd</em> [2011] 1 SLR 449
                        (“<em>Astrata</em>”); <em>Shanghai Electric Group Co Ltd v PT Merak Energi Indonesia</em>
                    [2010] 2 SLR 329 at [47]; and, finally, <em>Eltraco
                        International Pte Ltd v CGH Development Pte Ltd</em> [2000]
                    3 SLR(R) 198 at [32].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Third, it denied Labroy’s allegation of
                    bad faith on its part in rescinding the Construction Contract, arguing that
                    these were matters to be resolved in arbitration and had no relevance to the
                    instant suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Finally, it relied on <em>Union
                        Eagle Ltd v Golden Achievement Ltd</em> [1997] AC 514, to argue that
                    Labroy’s late payment ought not be excused and the cause of Labroy’s
                    lateness was irrelevant since deliberate non-performance or negligence is not a
                    requirement for contractual default. It cited <em>The
                        Laconia</em> [1977] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 315 at 325 to urge the court
                    to prioritise “certainty ... in all commercial transactions” and
                    not “[torture] the language of the charter in an effort to extract from
                    it a meaning which it does not bear, but might, if it did, lead to a less harsh
                    result”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Banks’ submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Banks supported Labroy’s application
                    for an injunction. They accepted that they were bound by the Refund Guarantees
                    to make payment if the requisite conditions were satisfied but submitted that,
                    contrary to MM’s argued position, the said conditions had not been
                    met.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     First, they argued that limbs (i) and (ii) had
                    to apply to distinct, mutually exclusive circumstances: limb (ii) applied where
                    the Construction Contract had been rescinded and an Initial Demand had been
                    served by MM, while limb (i) conversely applied where the Construction Contract
                    remained in force.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Second, they argued that a New Demand on the
                    basis of limb (i) could not be made in the instant scenario because if the
                    Construction Contract truly had been validly rescinded as MM alleged (in their
                    letters of demand to the Banks and Notice of Rescission to Labroy, all dated 12
                    April 2011), then a “possible delay in the delivery of the Rig”
                    could not be of issue. They asserted that there could be a possible delay in the
                    delivery only if the Construction Contract remained in force. Reference was also
                    made to correspondence between the parties (found in PAJ’s third affidavit
                    at pp 29, 31 and 35) that indicated that limb (i) was only to apply where the
                    Construction Contract had <em>not</em> been
                    rescinded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     They also made arguments regarding the
                    non-applicability of limb (ii) to the instant case. However, these were dropped
                    during the chambers hearing following MM’s clarification that MM would
                    only be relying on limb (i) (see above at <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>) to demonstrate that they had made valid New
                    Demands.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Third, proceeding on the conclusion that the
                    New Demands were invalid, the Banks reasoned that MM should dispense with the
                    call for refund of its advances and instead proceed with arbitration and make a
                    Deferred Demand after the conclusion of arbitration or a settlement agreement.
                    They pointed out that if arbitration was not reasonably expected to conclude in
                    the requisite time period (<em>ie</em>, within 30 Singapore
                    banking days of the expiry of the Refund Guarantees), MM would be entitled to
                    request for replacement guarantees from Labroy. If Labroy failed to furnish the
                    replacement guarantees within the requisite time period (<em>ie</em>, no later than 14 Singapore banking days before the expiry of
                    the Refund Guarantees), <em>only then</em> would MM be able
                    to validly make a New Demand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues before the court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     It is crucial to set out the parameters of the
                    dispute before me. The dispute between Labroy and MM was a fairly wide-ranging
                    one. The affidavits and pleadings before me included facts and arguments as to
                    how and why there was a delay in the delivery of the Rig and the consequence of
                    events surrounding Labroy’s application for replacement guarantees upon
                    MM’s request, and whether Labroy had complied with its obligations under
                    Art 3.8 of the Construction Contract to procure the Refund Guarantees and to
                    ensure that the Refund Guarantees included a certain rate of interest up to the
                    expiry of the validity date thereof. However, <em>in so far as
                        these facts and arguments pertain to the parties’ dispute under the
                        Construction Contract, they are irrelevant to the application before
                        me</em>. As established above at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>, Labroy and MM have referred their disputes under the
                    Construction Contract – specifically, whether MM was entitled to rescind
                    it on either of the two grounds it relied on – to arbitration. Indeed,
                    there is no dispute that the application proceeded before me on the basis
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_a"></a>(a)     MM was not relying on its letters of
                        demand as Initial Demands (see <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>
                        above). This was clearly correct because in so far as the letters of demand
                        amounted to Initial Demands, the Banks were not obliged to make payment
                        under the Refund Guarantees once they had received notification from MM that
                        its claim for refund of its advances was disputed and referred to
                        arbitration. In such a situation, MM could only make a Deferred Demand upon
                        receiving an arbitration award or settlement agreement in its favour (see
                            <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Construction Contract <em>had</em> been rescinded on 12 April
                2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The only question before me, therefore, was
                    really a narrow one: on an interpretation of the Refund Guarantees, was MM
                    entitled to make a <em>New Demand</em> when the
                    Construction Contract had been rescinded? I came to the conclusion that it was
                    not and therefore allowed Labroy’s application for an
                injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was MM entitled to make a New Demand under the Refund Guarantees when
                the Construction Contract had been rescinded?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     As set out at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above, the Refund Guarantees provided that MM was entitled
                    to request for a replacement guarantee if:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_a"></a>(a)     there was any possible delay in the
                        delivery of the Rig (defined at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>
                        above as “limb (i)”); or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_b"></a>(b)     (an Initial Demand having been made and MM’s claim
                        for refund of its advances having been disputed and referred to arbitration)
                        the said arbitration could not reasonably be expected to conclude within 30
                        Singapore banking days before the expiry date of the Refund Guarantee(s)
                        (defined at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above as “limb
                        (ii)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The replacement guarantees were then to be
                    procured by Labroy with an expiry date 30 calendar days from the “new
                    anticipated date of the delivery” of the Rig to MM (in a situation under
                    limb (i)) or conclusion of the arbitration (in a situation under limb (ii)). The
                    replacement guarantees were to be furnished to MM no later than 14 Singapore
                    banking days before the expiry of the Refund Guarantee(s). Failing this, MM
                    would be entitled to make a New Demand. MM’s entitlement to make a New
                    Demand can therefore be seen as a culmination of three stages:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     A “trigger event”
                        under either limbs (i) or (ii);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     MM’s request for replacement guarantees with new
                        expiry dates; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_c"></a>(c)     Labroy’s failure to provide these replacement guarantees to MM
                        at least 14 Singapore banking days before the original expiry dates of the
                        Refund Guarantees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The issue before me pertained to the first
                    stage, <em>ie</em>, how to interpret the relationship
                    between limbs (i) and (ii): specifically, whether limbs (i) and (ii) applied to
                        <em>mutually exclusive</em> situations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Labroy and the Banks took the position that
                    limbs (i) and (ii) were mutually exclusive, specifically, that limb (i)
                        <em>applied only when the Construction Contract was
                        alive</em> whereas limb (ii) applied only when the Construction
                    Contract had been rescinded. This was crucial because, as established above at
                        <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>, MM confirmed that it was only
                    relying on limb (i) for the purposes of this application. If limb (i) applied
                    only where the Construction Contract had <em>not</em> been
                    rescinded, MM clearly was not entitled to make a New Demand and Labroy’s
                    application had to be granted. MM obviously took the contrary position and
                    argued that a “plain and ordinary meaning of the words” showed
                    that limb (i) was not conditional on the Construction Contract still being in
                    force.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In my view, it was clear that limb (i) only
                    applied where the Construction Contract had not been rescinded. The plain
                    language of limb (i) shows that it is premised on a delay in delivery of the
                    Rig, with the replacement guarantees to have an expiry date of 30 calendar days
                    from the “new anticipated date of delivery”. I accepted
                    Labroy’s and the Banks’ submission that it would be nonsensical to
                    refer to a “new anticipated date of delivery” if the Construction
                    Contract had been rescinded with the result that MM would not be taking delivery
                    of the Rig <em>at all</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Furthermore, this reading accorded with the
                    overall scheme of the Refund Guarantees. MM had undertaken, in the Construction
                    Contract, to make advance payments to Labroy before receiving the benefit for
                    which it had entered into the Construction Contract, <em>ie</em>, the Rig built and delivered in accordance with the terms of
                    the Construction Contract. The Refund Guarantees secured Labroy’s
                    obligation under the Construction Contract to return the advances should Labroy
                    act in such a way as to entitle MM to rescind the Construction Contract. Cutting
                    through the intricacies of when and how Labroy was obliged to procure
                    replacement guarantees in MM’s favour, the ultimate purpose of the Refund
                    Guarantees was patently clear from Art 3.8 of the Construction Contract where it
                    referred to Labroy’s obligation to “<em>always
                        ensur[e] that the Refund Guarantee(s) is valid until the date falling thirty
                        (30) days beyond the delivery of the Rig</em>” [emphasis added]
                    (see above at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>). Despite the complexity of
                    their mechanics, the Refund Guarantees were meant to secure MM’s right to
                    repayment of the advances under the terms of the Construction
                Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     However, the Refund Guarantees were also
                    structured in such a way as to strike a balance between the parties’
                    competing interests where there is a dispute between them as to whether MM was
                    entitled to rescind the Construction Contract. This is why, if MM purports to
                    rescind the Construction Contract and makes an Initial Demand against the Banks
                    on the basis of their being entitled so to rescind, this Initial Demand is held
                    in abeyance once their right to rescind is disputed and referred to arbitration.
                    Until the arbitral tribunal makes an award in MM’s favour or the parties
                    reach a settlement under which a refund is called for (see above at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>), MM’s right to a refund of the advances
                    is deferred. However, after such award or settlement, if Labroy fails to make
                    due refund, MM could make a Deferred Demand under the Refund Guarantees calling
                    for immediate repayment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I found that Labroy and the Banks were correct
                    to argue that MM’s reading of limb (i) was inconsistent with this overall
                    scheme. If MM were entitled to a New Demand even where the Construction Contract
                    had been rescinded and the validity of the rescission referred to arbitration,
                    it would mean that MM would be able to get around the deferral of its right to a
                    refund pending the resolution of the parties’ dispute over the validity of
                    the rescission. In my view, what was crucial here was that there was an
                    arbitration pending with regard to the validity of MM’s purported
                    rescission of the Construction Contract. As MM’s letters of demand to the
                    Banks (see above at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>) were Initial
                    Demands, they were in abeyance pending the outcome of the arbitration, following
                    which MM would be entitled to make a Deferred Demand (see above at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>) <em>if</em> the outcome
                    of arbitration proved to be in its favour. It is inconceivable to me that the
                    parties intended limb (i) of the Refund Guarantees to operate in such a way as
                    to allow MM to drive a coach and four through this process and thereby undermine
                    the entire rationale for “deferring” the legal effect of
                    MM’s Initial Demand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Labroy argued that this made it
                    “unconscionable and abusive” for MM to have made New Demands in
                    the circumstances and its application for an injunction should be allowed. It
                    relied on <em>JBE Properties v Gammon Pte Ltd</em> [2011]
                    2 SLR 47 and <em>Astrata</em> (<a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> <em>supra</em>). I should clarify that I did not find it
                    necessary to go this far. As explained above, I accepted that MM was not
                    entitled to make the New Demands when its rescission of the Construction
                    Contract was the subject of arbitration proceedings because it would undermine
                    the overall scheme of the Refund Guarantees. However, in holding this, I
                    essentially held that <em>MM had no legal right under the Refund
                        Guarantees to make the New Demands</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In contrast, the doctrine of unconscionability
                    applies where a party <em>does</em> have certain legal
                    rights but the court finds that it would be unconscionable in equity for the
                    party to <em>assert</em> these legal rights – the
                    threshold for this is high (see, for example, <em>Astrata</em> at [73]–[74]). Since I held that MM had no legal
                    right to make the New Demands under the Refund Guarantees, it was unnecessary
                    for me to consider whether the New Demands were unconscionable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In conclusion, I found that the plain language
                    of limb (i) as well as the overall scheme of the Refund Guarantees supported
                    Labroy’s and the Banks’ reading that limbs (i) and (ii) applied to
                    mutually exclusive circumstances: limb (ii) applied where the Construction
                    Contract had been rescinded and an Initial Demand had been made, whereas limb
                    (i) applied only where the Construction Contract was still in force and the
                    delivery of the Rig was still envisioned by the parties. MM could not invoke
                    limb (i) if it had purported to rescind the Construction Contract. Given
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_a"></a>(a)     all parties agreed that this
                        application proceeded on the basis that MM had rescinded the Construction
                        Contract; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_b"></a>(b)     MM confirmed that it only relied on limb (i) in this application (see above
                        at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>),</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I granted
                    Labroy’s application for an injunction to restrain MM from receiving
                    payment from the Banks on the basis of its New Demands. Crucially, <em>MM would suffer no prejudice as a result of this
                        injunction</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     There is no dispute that Labroy has continued
                    to procure replacement guarantees pending the conclusion of the arbitration
                    between the parties, and has undertaken to continue to procure such replacement
                    guarantees on a rolling basis so as always to ensure that the expiry date of the
                    Refund Guarantees falls at least 30 days beyond the anticipated conclusion of
                    the arbitration. <em>MM’s right to demand repayment of its
                        advances therefore still remains intact</em>, should the arbitrator
                    find that it had validly rescinded the Construction Contract. Per contra, if MM
                    were allowed to recover the advances pursuant to limb (i) of the New Demands and
                    the arbitrator’s award eventually turned out to be in favour of Labroy,
                    the latter would be left in the lurch.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     For the reasons above, I allowed
                    Labroy’s application for an injunction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     At the request of parties, I reserved the
                    question of costs to be heard at a later date.</p>
