<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff in these proceedings,
                    Doctor’s Associates Inc., is a corporation incorporated in the USA with
                    its principal place of business in the state of Florida. The plaintiff is suing
                    the defendant, Lim Eng Wah, who is trading in Singapore under the name Subway
                    Niche, for relief against the defendant for infringing and passing off of the
                    plaintiff’s “SUBWAY” trade mark which is registered under
                    the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 2005 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) by the use
                    of the “SUBWAY NICHE” trade mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In these proceedings, the principal reliefs that
                    the plaintiff is praying for are, inter alia:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">A declaration that the plaintiff’s trade
                            mark “SUBWAY” is well known in Singapore, for the purposes
                            of the Act;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">A declaration that the continuing use of
                            “SUBWAY NICHE” by the defendant amounts to an infringement
                            of the plaintiff’s registered trade mark in
                        Singapore;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Further or alternatively, a declaration that the
                            plaintiff is entitled to restrain by injunction the use in Singapore, in
                            the course of trade and without the plaintiff’s consent, the trade
                            mark “SUBWAY NICHE” which incorporates or employs the
                            plaintiff’s well known trade mark “SUBWAY”, in
                            relation to any goods or services; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Further or alternatively, an order that the
                            defendant, whether by himself, his officers, servants, agents or any of
                            them be retrained from passing off by advertising, marketing, selling or
                            otherwise distributing goods and services by reference to the use of the
                            word “SUBWAY”, when such goods or services of the
                            defendant are actually not associated or connected to the
                            plaintiff.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">and the plaintiff also seeks to restrain the defendant from further
                    acts of trade mark infringement and passing off, damages and delivery up of any
                    offending material.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Viewed on its own, this is an unexceptional
                    action by one trader against another for the infringement of its intellectual
                    property. There is, however, a history to this case. The background is that the
                    plaintiff had sued the defendant for infringement of the trade mark in an
                    earlier action, Suit No. 764 of 2008
                    (“Suit 764”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In Suit 764, the plaintiff claimed as the
                    registered proprietor of several SUBWAY trademarks that the defendant had
                    committed acts of infringement and passing off against those registered trade
                    marks by the use of the name “SUBWAY NICHE”. The plaintiff sought
                    to restrain the defendant from committing those wrongful acts, delivery up of
                    any offending material and damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Suit 764 was not litigated on its merits because
                    it was struck out after the plaintiff had failed to comply with an unless order.
                    On 7 September 2009, an Assistant Registrar had issued an unless order
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">1.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The Plaintiffs do by 12.00 pm, Thursday, 10
                            September 2009 give further security for the Defendant’s costs in
                            this action to the sum of S$19,000.00 in the form of a banker’s
                            guarantee from a first class Singapore bank, the terms of which are to
                            be subject to the Defendant’s solicitors’
                        approval;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">2.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">In default of compliance, the Plaintiffs’
                            Statement of Claim be struck out and the action dismissed with costs
                            without further order;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       That was not the first order for the plaintiff
                    to furnish security for costs. There was an earlier consent order of
                    26 August 2009 by which the plaintiff was to furnish security in the sum of
                    $19,000 within seven days of the order. The consent order also provided that
                    pending the provision of the security, the action was to be stayed. The consent
                    order was different from the order of 7 September 2009 in that it was not
                    an unless order; it did not decree that the action was to be struck out if the
                    security was not furnished.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiff failed to comply with the unless
                    order of 7 September 2009 and appealed against the order. When the
                    plaintiff’s application for a stay of proceedings pending the appeal was
                    heard on 14 September 2009, it was dismissed with the result that the
                    appeal was not heard, and a further order was made striking out the
                    plaintiff’s action. The plaintiff was aggrieved by the order, and filed an
                    application on 13 October 2009 to set it aside. This application was heard
                    on 26 October 2009 and was dismissed. There was no appeal against the order
                    of court of 26 October 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The present appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The plaintiff filed the present originating
                    summons on 12 May 2010. On 31 May 2010, the defendant applied to
                    strike it out on the ground that it was an abuse of process of court, or
                    alternatively, it was frivolous and vexatious, but the arguments presented were
                    made on the first ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The defendant’s argument was that as Suit
                    764 was struck out and judgment was entered against the plaintiff, it was an
                    abuse of process of court for the plaintiff to commence the second action on the
                    same cause of action. When the plaintiff applied to set aside the judgment in
                    Suit 764, the defendant argued that as the plaintiff did not appeal against the
                    case of 26 October 2009:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]t is clear law that if the Plaintiffs took the view that their conduct
                        in Suit 764 had not been contumelious and that they should be allowed to
                        pursue their claim for alleged trade mark infringement and passing off
                        against the Defendant, <u>the onus was on them to file an
                            appeal against the [dismissal order]</u>. It is completely wrong
                        for the Plaintiffs not to pursue this avenue of appeal and instead file a
                        fresh action for the same cause of action against the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     That submission has to be examined against the
                    record of the proceedings. An Assistant Registrar (“AR”) who
                    dismissed the plaintiff’s application to set aside the judgment,
                    wrote:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This is a frivolous application and an abuse of process of court. As I
                        said earlier on 7 September 2009. SUM4258/2009 – the
                        application for security for costs – was entered into by consent
                        before AR Daphne Chang, whereby both parties agreed that Plaintiff was to
                        provide security within 7 days (i.e. 3 September 2009). It lies foul in
                        Plaintiff’s mouth to state that the unless order application was
                        unreasonable given that trial was originally to be fixed on
                        14 September but for Plaintiff’s conduct (Plaintiff has not even
                        set down the action for trial!). I also note that this is the second unless
                        order made by this court against Plaintiff – the first was on
                        29 July 2009 whereby AR Jeyendran Jeyapal ordered Plaintiff to file and
                        exchange the AEIC. Plaintiff’s contumelious conduct cannot and will
                        not be tolerated by this court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     It is to be noted that the AR had found the
                    plaintiff’s conduct <em>prior to</em> the making of
                    the unless order of 7 September 2009 contumelious and intolerable. However,
                    the AR did not refer to the actions the plaintiff had taken to comply with the
                    unless order of 7 September 2009, and did not make any finding that it was
                    the result of the plaintiff’s contumely. That being the case, the failure
                    of the plaintiff to appeal against the AR’s refusal to set aside the
                    judgment entered cannot be regarded as its acceptance that its non-compliance
                    with the unless order was contumelious, and does not bar the plaintiff from
                    asserting that it was not contumelious.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The defendant’s application to strike
                    out the originating summons was heard on 14 July 2010, and dismissed on
                    22 July 2010. The defendant was not satisfied with the order, and brought
                    the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Preliminary issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     There is a preliminary issue of whether the
                    present action is based on the same cause of action as Suit 764. The
                    defendant’s application was founded on the contention that it was. The
                    plaintiff, however, argued that it was not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     This issue can be dealt with quite simply. A
                    cause of action is “[a] factual situation the existence of which entitles
                    one person to obtain from the court a remedy against another person” per
                    Diplock LJ, <em>Letang v Cooper</em> [1965] 1 QB 232 at
                    242–243. It is clear beyond sensible disagreement that both the actions
                    brought by the plaintiff proceeded on the defendant’s alleged trade mark
                    infringement and passing off against the plaintiff’s
                    “SUBWAY” trade mark. The plaintiff’s former attorney and
                    in-house counsel, Valerie Pochron, had deposed in an affidavit filed on
                    2 July 2010 in the present action that:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">13.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The Plaintiffs initiated a fresh proceeding
                            against the Defendant in OS No.462 of 2010/Q (“OS 462”)
                            since Suit 764 was never tried by the Court and thus remains unresolved,
                            and that the Plaintiffs verily believe that there are substantial issues
                            to be tried in this matter which were prevented from being heard in the
                            Court due to procedural defaults.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">The plaintiff’s contention that the present action as a
                    distinct cause of action is a futile attempt to deny the simple fact that it was
                    the same cause of action, <em>ie</em>, that the
                    defendant’s use of the Subway Niche trade mark was an infringement and
                    passing off of the plaintiff’s SUBWAY trade mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     A party’s right to commence action after
                    a previous similar action has been struck out for the failure to comply with a
                    peremptory order has been discussed and settled by the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Changhe International Investments Pte Ltd (formerly known
                        as Druidstone Pte Ltd) v Dexia BIL Asia Singapore Ltd (formerly known as

                    SLR(R) 344 (“<em>Changhe</em>”) where it held
                    at [6]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Since the 1980s, it has been settled law that the court has the discretion
                        to strike out an action as an abuse of process of the court where there had
                        been a failure by a litigant to comply with a peremptory order of the court
                        in a previous action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It referred to the landmark English decisions in <em>Janov v Morris</em> [1981] 1 WLR 1389 and <em>Samuels

                        as being an abuse of the process of the court unless the litigant can give a
                        proper explanation to establish that his <em>failure to
                            comply with the peremptory order</em> was not contumelious. It
                        should be noted that <em>Tolley v Morris</em> [[1979] 1
                        WLR 592] also stands for the principle that disobedience to a peremptory
                        order would generally amount to contumelious conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In <em>Syed Mohamed</em>
                    the Court of Appeal gave thought to the meaning of “contumelious”
                    and “contumacious”. It referred to the judgment of Sir John Megaw
                    in <em>Jokai Tea Holdings Ltd</em> [1992] 1 WLR 1196 which
                    went back to where the root words of “contumelious” and
                    “contumacious” were. The judge’s definition of
                    “contumely” as “insolent reproach or abuse” and
                    “contumacy” as “perverse and obstinate resistance to
                    authority” were accepted without qualification, and
                    “contumelious” and “contumacious” must be construed
                    in accordance to those definitions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Court of Appeal in <em>Changhe</em> went on to add at [10] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]n cases in which it had to decide what were to be the consequences of a
                        failure to comply with an unless order, the relevant question was whether
                        such failure was intentional and contumelious. The court should not be
                        astute to find excuses for such failure since obedience to orders of the
                        court was the foundation on which its authority rested. The crux of the
                        matter was that the party seeking to escape the consequences of his default
                        would have to show that the failure was not contumelious because he had made
                        positive efforts to comply but was prevented from doing so by extraneous
                        circumstances, and that he had no intention of ignoring or flouting the
                        order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and the Court then found at [27] that the party would have to show that its disobedience in
                    respect of an earlier peremptory order was “not contumelious in that it
                    was not intentional and arose from an extraneous circumstance over which [it]
                    had no control.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The law can be summarised as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the disobedience of a peremptory order which
                            resulted in the striking out of an action would generally be regarded as
                            contumelious, and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a party whose first action has been struck out
                            for the failure to comply with a peremptory order may bring a second
                            action on the same cause of action if it can show that the failure to
                            comply with the peremptory order was not contumelious in the sense that
                            it was not intentional and it arose from extraneous circumstances over
                            which the party has no control.</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The burden on the plaintiff</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The plaintiff has the burden to show that its
                    failure to comply with the Order of Court of 7 September 2009 which led to
                    the striking out of the first action was not contumelious in that it was not
                    intentional, and had arose from an extraneous circumstances over which it had no
                    control.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The burden on the plaintiff, or any party in a
                    similar position, is to show that despite the earlier action being struck out,
                    it should be allowed to proceed with a second action. As the critical factor is
                    that the previous action was struck out because of its failure to comply with a
                    peremptory order, the reason for that failure is the primary matter for
                    consideration. I make this observation because the defendant had referred to the
                    conduct of the plaintiff before and leading to the making of the consent order
                    of 26 August 2009 and the unless order of 7 September 2009. Under the
                    law as set out in <em>Changhe</em>, such matters are not
                    relevant in determining whether the second action should also be struck out.
                    While they may have been taken into consideration for the making of the unless
                    order, it is the <em>non-compliance with the unless
                        order</em>, and not the previous conduct, that led to the striking out
                    of the action. The Court of Appeal had made it clear in <em>Changhe</em> that the party had to explain its non-compliance with
                    the unless order (and only that order).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Has the plaintiff discharged the burden?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The plaintiff did not comply with the unless
                    order of 7 September 2009 to furnish the security by noon 10 September
                    2009. The time for compliance was only two and a half days, an unusually and
                    impractically short time for the plaintiff in America to arrange for a Singapore
                    bank to issue the guarantee and for it to be delivered to the defendant’s
                    solicitors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Valerie Pochron affirmed an affidavit on
                    12 October 2009 in Suit 764 to explain the plaintiff’s failure to
                    furnish the banker’s guarantee in time. In her affidavit, she deposed
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am verily advised by the Account Department of the Plaintiffs that the
                        procedure for in [sic] order to obtain a bank guarantee in Singapore the
                        estimated time frame is 4 to 5 weeks from request to completion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and added that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In this case, and as outlined above, the Plaintiffs have not been tardy or
                        contumelious in respect of obtaining the Banker’s guarantee. It is due
                        to administrative difficulties that the Plaintiffs have not been able to
                        comply with the orders made by the learned Assistant Registrar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">She also exhibited a banker’s guarantee issued by the Hongkong
                    and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited to the defendant dated
                    18 September 2009 for the sum of $39,000.00. Counsel for the defendant
                    pointed out that the guarantee in fact did not take four to five weeks to be
                    issued, and the guarantee of 18 September 2009 was obtained within nine
                    days from the date of the unless order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It should also be noted that Valerie Pochron
                    did not state the time and the steps the plaintiff took to apply for the
                    guarantee. The only evidence available is in her email to the plaintiff’s
                    solicitors dated 9 September 2009 where she informed them:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Our accounting department is working as best they can, but are
                        encountering issues with the bank and getting the additional funds into the
                        Bank Guarantee. The funds are available, but needless to say it has not yet
                        been transferred into the form of a Bank Guarantee. <em>Our
                            accounting department is doing everything it can to comply with the
                            order</em>, but I cannot be assured that it will be in place by
                        the 10<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">That could be the reason the guarantee was issued in nine days instead
                    of four to five weeks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     On the basis of the available evidence, I
                    accept that it was difficult for the plaintiff to comply with the exceptionally
                    tight time-line imposed. The fact that the plaintiff obtained the guarantee on
                    18 September 2009 is evidence that its failure to furnish the bank
                    guarantee in time did not arise out of contumely, or even
                contumacy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The plaintiff’s willingness and
                    readiness to furnish security is further affirmed in an affidavit filed in the
                    present proceedings on 2 July 2010 by Max Ng, a director of the law
                    corporation acting for the plaintiff, in which he confirmed that the plaintiff
                    had placed with the corporation $40,000.00 to ensure that should there be a
                    similar requirement for security, the plaintiff will be able to comply in
                    time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Against the background of the evidence, I find
                    that the plaintiff has shown that its failure to comply with the unless order of
                    9 September 2009 did not arise from its contumely but because of the very
                    tight time-line. The plaintiff’s production of the guarantee, albeit out
                    of time, and the placement of $40,000.00 with its solicitors to ensure that it
                    is able to comply with any future order for security corroborated the
                    plaintiff’s plea that it had always wanted to comply with the unless
                    order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The plaintiff should be allowed to proceed
                    with its present action so that the issues of trade mark infringement and
                    passing off can be determined on their merits. The failure to comply with the
                    unless order should not disentitle the plaintiff from proceeding to have these
                    matters determined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The defendant’s appeal is dismissed with
                    costs.</p>
