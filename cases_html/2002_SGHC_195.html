<strong>Judgment</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000" face="Times New Roman"><u><strong>GROUNDS OF

DECISION</strong></u></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1

        This is an application under section 4 of the

Conveyancing and Law of Property Act. The matter relates to a contract between the

Plaintiffs and the Defendant for the purchase of a two-storey semi-detached house at 244E

Pasir Panjang Road ("the Property") for the sum of $1,710,000.00. The Plaintiffs

seek a declaration that they are entitled to an abatement in the sale price by way of

compensation amounting to $209,317.50.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2

        The facts are as follows. The Defendant

purchased the Property in April 1999. She engaged an architect, Ms Melati Salleh

("the Architect") of Design 2000 Pte Ltd, to take charge of reconstruction of

the building. The Defendant’s husband, Tan Joon Say ("Tan") liaised with

the Architect and contractors and represented the Defendant in the entire matter.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3

        In April 2002, the Defendant advertised the

Property for sale. The Plaintiffs, who are husband and wife, answered the advertisement

and viewed the Property on two or three occasions. Tan attended to them and conducted the

negotiations on behalf of the Defendant. There is some disagreement on what were said in

those negotiations and I shall revert to this issue later.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4

        On 30 April the parties reached agreement on

the price, S$1.71 million, and Tan handed the Plaintiffs a draft option. The Plaintiffs

took it and said that they would seek the advice of their solicitors. The parties’

solicitors then negotiated on the text of the option but by 2 May 2002 they could not

reach an agreement. In particular, the Plaintiffs’ solicitors had insisted that the

"area and size" of the Property be stated in the option. The Defendant’s

solicitors were only prepared to state that according to the Certificate of Title, the

land area was 429.9 square metres.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5

        To resolve this stalemate, Tan met the

Plaintiffs at their office around 4 May. A day or so after that Tan returned with a new

version of the option prepared pursuant to the earlier meeting. The Plaintiffs approved

it. Tan then went off to obtain the Defendant’s signature and returned shortly with

the signed option ("the Option"). By agreement the Option was backdated to 30

April 2002. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff gave Tan a cheque for $17,100 for the Option. On

14 May 2002 the Plaintiffs exercised the Option by signing on the acceptance copy of the

Option and making payment of the $153,900.00.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6

        The only reference in the Option to the area

and size of the Property is at the heading, which states as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">"<u><b>244E Pasir Panjang Road,

  Singapore</b></u></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Land area 429.9 sq. m.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Estimated Total Gross Floor Area 397 sq. m."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7

        On 23 May Tan discovered from the Architect

that the Gross Floor Area of the Property as approved by the URA was 348.36 square metres.

This is smaller than the figure of 397 square metres described as "Estimated Total

Gross Floor Area" in the Option. Tan said that the Architect explained to him that

the "total gross floor area" or "built-up floor area" remained at

approximately 397 square metres.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8

        On 24 May Tan telephoned the 2<sup>nd</sup>

Plaintiff and told her about this. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff recalled that she was

quite upset about this. She told Tan that she would speak to the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff.

A day or so later the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff telephoned Tan and asked for compensation

for the shortfall in the gross floor area. He requested a pro-rated reduction in the sale

price. The 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff made his calculation based solely on the

"shortfall" in "gross floor area" and asked for a corresponding

reduction of $193,850 in the price. There was some negotiation on the amount of

compensation. Tan offered $50,000 and the Plaintiffs asked for this to be put down in

writing. However Tan changed his mind and on 3 June telephoned the Plaintiffs to say that

he had been advised that there was no change in area and the Defendant would not offer any

reduction in the price.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9

        From then on, the solicitors took over the

matter and it is not necessary for me to relate the details of their exchange except that

the parties reserved their rights. In the event the sale and purchase was completed

without prejudice on 9 July 2002.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10

        This matter turns on two issues:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(i)    Whether the

  statement in the Option "Estimated Total Gross Floor Area 397 sq. m." is a

  misdescription of the area of the Property; and </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(ii)    Whether clause 10

  of the Option precludes the Plaintiffs from obtaining compensation or damages even if

  there is a misdescription.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">To succeed in this action, the Plaintiffs

need both issues to be determined in their favour.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Misdescription</font></p></b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11

        First of all it is necessary to clear the air

in respect of the expression "gross floor area" (hereafter "GFA").

This expression is used by the URA to control the quantum of built up space that may be

permitted in any land. This is done by way of the plot ratio of the land in question which

would limit the GFA permissible. Therefore the URA has a definition of GFA for this

purpose. However this definition is not a static one and has varied over the years to

reflect changes in policy as well as to accommodate feedback from building professionals.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12

        The URA has a wealth of information on its

web-site: <u>www.ura.gov.sg</u> and the various circulars to building professionals from

1992 are posted there. Among them are circulars relating to GFA. Hence on 15 July 1993,

URA issued a circular entitled "Revised Gross Floor Area Definition" which

provided as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">1. In 1989, following the introduction of

  the new development charge system, a simplified approach was adopted to determine the

  Gross Floor Area (GFA) of a building. Under this concept, all covered floor areas of a

  building, except otherwise stated, and uncovered areas for commercial uses are deemed the

  GFA of the building for purposes of plot ratio control and development charge.

  Owners/developers are free to make their own decisions on how much neutral areas they want

  in their buildings.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">2. Since then, URA has received feedback

  from practitioners, appeals and the professional institutes that the interpretation of the

  GFA definition in some instances inhibits building designs and penalises the use of modern

  construction technology.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">3. We are pleased to inform you that we

  have reviewed the definition of GFA. Without changing the concept of GFA as a control on

  building bulk and intensity of development, the revised GFA definition takes into account

  the following principles:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">a. Where the floor areas are uncovered and

    do not generate activities that will intensify the development, they would be excluded

    from GFA.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">b. Where the floor areas are required by

    government agencies or to meet public policies/ objectives, they would be excluded from

    GFA.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">c. Where the building design features or

    the use of modern construction techniques do not give rise to additional floor space and

    intensity of development, they would be excluded from GFA.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">d. Where the floor areas have a limited

    height clearance (1.5m or less) and are used for M&amp;E or other services, they would be

    excluded from GFA.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">4. In line with the principles mentioned,

  the following are additional areas not counted as GFA:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">a. Covered linkways, pavilions and sheds</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">b. Basement diaphragm walls</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">…</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">5. The following areas are however

  partially counted as GFA:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">a. Lift shafts</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">b. Vertical service duct space</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">…</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<b><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Implementation</font></p>
</b>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">6. The above revised GFA treatments are to

  be applied with immediate effect and floor area previously counted as GFA (for cases

  approved after 1 Sept 1989) could be used to offset proposed additional floor space

  submitted as amendments or additions/alterations plans. The new proposal should comply

  with the planning requirements for the site</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">…</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13

        Over the last ten years there have been a

number of such URA circulars clarifying or changing the definition of GFA. Indeed, matters

must have reached such a state of confusion that it was necessary for the URA to publish a

compilation of clarifications of GFA and distribute it with the following circular on 3

March 1999:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<b><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">CLARIFICATION ON GROSS FLOOR AREA (GFA)</font></p>
</b><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">1. Many planning applications have

  frequently excluded certain covered areas from GFA calculations even though these areas

  are part of the GFA. This has resulted in longer processing time as much time and effort

  are wasted on identifying such areas. Additional time and effort are also required to

  compile the GFA errors made.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">2. To improve our customer service and to

  assist your members, we have compiled a list of the frequently made GFA errors in <u>Appendix

  1</u> attached. The areas to be counted as GFA areas are indicated in the Appendix. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">3. I would appreciate it if you could

  convey the contents of this circular to the relevant members of your organisation.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">4. If you or your members have any queries

  about this circular, please do not hesitate to call our DCD Customer Service Hotline at

  Tel: 223 4811. We would be pleased to answer queries on this, and any other development

  control matter. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14

        In the present case, the Architect explained

that prior to April 2001, the URA definition of GFA included car porches, terraced areas

and external staircases. It was on that basis that she had come up with the figure of 397

square metres. On 26 April 2001 the URA issued a circular which states, <i>inter alia</i>,

the following:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<b><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">GROSS FLOOR AREA (GFA) EXEMPTION FOR

  CAR PORCHES AND GARAGES IN LAND-TITLED LANDED HOUSING</font></p>
</b><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">1. I am pleased to inform you that

  with immediate effect, all car porches and garages in land-titled landed housing are

  excluded from Gross Floor Area (GFA) computation. This GFA exemption is to provide more

  flexibility for the provision of covered car porches and garages in land-titled landed

  housing development, similar to the car parking spaces in other residential developments.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">…</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">This means that from that date, the owner

of a "Land-Titled Landed Housing" need not include any built up space used as

car porches or garages as part of his GFA. This means that he is entitled to have more

built up space for other areas, such as rooms in his house. On the basis of this

exemption, the Architect computed that the GFA for the Property was 348.36 square metres.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15

        From this, it can be seen that the expression

GFA, if it is intended to refer to the meaning that URA would ascribe to it for the

purpose of planning approval, is a fluid one and changes with time. Counsel for both sides

agree that the protagonists had no clue as to the URA definition of GFA. Indeed, it would

appear that even the building professionals are sometime not very clear about it and the

URA had found it necessary to issue clarifications from time to time. Against this

background, I turn to consider the evidence as to the communications between the parties

up to the point where the text of the Option was arrived at.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16

        The following are the portions of the 2<sup>nd</sup>

Plaintiff’s first affidavit touching on those communications:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">6. At the first viewing, I asked Tan the

  land area and the gross floor area (GFA) of the house. Tan told us that the GFA would not

  be less than [390 sq m] but he asked me and my husband to take it that it would be about

  [381 sq m] to be on the safe side. …</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">…</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">14. After this letter of 2nd May 2002 from

  Fong Partners &amp; Associates, we had a meeting with Tan at our office … in the

  afternoon. We went through the Option and resolved all the terms. During this discussion,

  we insisted that the GFA and the land area be set out clearly in the option as this was

  very important to us. He said that he would get it from the architect and include this in

  the option. This meeting lasted for about an hour.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">…</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">15. A few days later, Tan came to see me

  at [our office]. He showed me the option, which incorporated all the amendments. I checked

  and verified that the land area and the GFA was stated in the Option. I then signed the

  option.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17

        In his affidavit filed on behalf of the

Defendant, Tan described the relevant transactions in the following manner:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">8. At the first viewing, the 2nd Plaintiff

  asked to know the land area and the "built-up" area of the Property. I told her

  that the land area was about [427 sq m] but I did not know the built-up area. However, I

  said that the Defendant’s Architect had estimated the total gross floor area of the

  Property at [381 sq m] or [390 sq m]. I further informed the 2nd Plaintiff that the

  Defendant had a letter from the Defendant’s Architect stating the estimated total

  gross floor area in square metres. The Plaintiffs did not ask for a copy of this letter.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">9. In the premises, the 2nd

  Plaintiff’s statement in paragraph 6 of the Plaintiffs’ 1st Affidavit that she

  had asked me for "the gross floor area (GFA) of the house" is not true.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">10. I further state that the Plaintiffs

  did not tell me that they needed to know the gross floor area of the house for bank

  valuation or any other purpose. …</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">…</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">20. … On or about 4 May 2002, the

  Plaintiffs had discussions with me on the Draft Option and we eventually agreed on the

  terms of the option to be granted by the Defendant to the Plaintiffs (the

  "Option") … The discussions and the agreements leading to the Option are

  set out in the paragraphs below.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">21. The Plaintiffs asked that the floor

  area of the house be inserted in the description of the Property. I told them that I could

  only state the "estimated total gross floor area" of 397 sq m mentioned in the

  Defendant’s Architect’s letter … in the description of the Property. The

  Plaintiffs agreed. They did not ask for a copy of the letter. They also did not ask what

  was meant by the term "estimate total gross floor area".</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">22. In accordance with the above

  agreement, I amended the Draft Option so that the Property was described in the heading of

  the Option as:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<u><i><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">244E Pasir Panjang Road, Singapore</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Land area 429.9 sq. m.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Estimated Total Gross Floor Area 397 sq.

    m.</font></p>
</i></u>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18

        In her reply affidavit, the 2<sup>nd</sup>

Plaintiff gave the following responses to Tan’s allegations:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">8. With regard to paragraph 8 and 9 of

  Tan’s affidavit, Tan told me that the land area was about [427 sq m]. It was he who

  told us that the total gross floor area was [390 sq m] but to take it at [381 sq m] to be

  on the safe side. He did not mention anything about any letter from the Defendant’s

  architect or how he obtained gross floor area. <u>When we discussed the gross floor area,

  Tan, my husband and I were all talking about the same thing that is the covered area

  within the four walls of the property.</u></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">…</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">12. With regard to paragraph 21 of

  Tan’s affidavit, we wanted the Gross Floor Area to be included in the option as he

  had already told us the Gross Floor Area when we first viewed the house and we had

  maintained this position even when the draft option was discussed. He did not tell us that

  he had a letter from the architect. He said he would [obtain] the GFA from the architect

  and include it in. As we did not know there was a letter from the architect, we did not

  ask for it. He did not offer to show us any letter from the architect.</font></p>

        It is only in her reply affidavit that the 2<sup>nd</sup>

Plaintiff deals with what was meant by GFA. This is found in the last sentence of 8

(underlined above). It is in the form of an ambiguous statement that this was what the

Plaintiffs and Tan meant by GFA was the "covered area within the four walls of the

property". The 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff, who had the right of reply in under the

summons procedure, did not expressly state that the three of them had clarified what GFA

meant. That sentence could be interpreted to mean that this was her impression of what

they all had meant by GFA. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Plaintiff stated in 29 and 30 of her

reply affidavit that there was no discussion on the meaning of GFA. Those provide as

follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">29. With regard to paragraph 38 of

  Tan’s affidavit, Tan did not at any time tell the 1st Plaintiff or I that the meaning

  of ‘estimate total gross floor area’ referred to the total usable or built up

  area of the house and included the car porch, the external staircase and the balconies.

  The 1st Plaintiff and I agreed to use the term estimated total gross floor area based on

  what we had discussed. We had relied on this in obtaining financing and in agreeing to

  purchase the property. If Tan had thought otherwise, he would have just told me that the

  total estimated gross floor area remains the same and there would not have been any

  discussions in May 2002 regarding compensation. Moreover, if we had wanted to use the term

  built up area, we would have done so. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">30. With regard to paragraph 39 of the

  said affidavit, Tan did not at any time inform at the time when the option was granted

  that estimated total gross floor area was equivalent to the built up area. …</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20

        The following are the features of the

situation:</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) The protagonists have no idea of the

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) The Plaintiffs had meant built up area

  to the URA definition of GFA at the time;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(c) Tan, on behalf of the Defendants, had

  meant the URA definition of GFA prior to 26 April 2001, when URA exempted car porches,

  garages and some other areas from the computation of the GFA.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">At the time the terms of the Option were

settled, the parties were not talking of the same thing in relation to GFA. Therefore

there could not have been any misdescription by the Defendant in the Option inasmuch as

Tan was not referring to the "built up area within four walls" that the

Plaintiffs had intended, but to the pre-April 2001 URA definition.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21

        For completeness, I should add that there is no

issue on the accuracy of the figure of 397 square metres based on the pre-April 2001 URA

definition of GFA. In the premises, I would hold that there is no misdescription of the

Property by the Defendant.</font></p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Clause 10</font></p></b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22 The Defendant also relies on clause 10

of the Option to absolve her of any liability even if there is a misdescription in the

size of the built up area. Clasue 10 states as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">10. The property is believed to be and

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23

        The effect of such a provision is summarized in

<i>Emmet on Title (19 ed.) </i>as follows (at 4.023):-</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<b><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Conditions of sale as to misdescription</font></p></b>

  - In the past, conditions of sale to the following general effect were commonly

  encountered with the consequences indicated:

  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">       

  First, <i>that no misdescription shall annul the sale</i>. The purport of this condition

  is that the vendor should be able to enforce the contract despite rule (1) above [that a

  substantial misdescription will render the contract unenforceable by the vendor]. However

  the condition will <i>not</i> have this effect: the purchaser will still be able to avoid

  the contract, recovering both his deposit and costs, where the misdescription is

  substantial …</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Secondly, <i>…</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">       

  Thirdly, <i>that the purchaser shall not be entitled to compensation for any

  misdescription. </i>If the misdescription is substantial, the vendor will still be unable

  to enforce the contract against the purchaser (<i>Jacobs v Revell</i> … and <i>Lee v

  Rayson</i> …), and this is so even though the vendor is willing to waive the

  exclusion of compensation (<i>Watson v Burton …</i>). Therefore, the application of

  this condition is limited to preventing the purchaser from obtaining compensation if <i>he</i>

  asks for specific performance (<i>Re Terry and White’s Contract</i> (1886) 32 Ch D

  14) or from recovering damages for breach of contract (see <i>Curtis v French</i> [1929] 1   Ch 253).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24

        <i>Jacobs v Revell </i>[1900] 2 Ch 858 is a

case in which there was a misdescription in the title to a part of the property. The

purchaser claimed rescission of the contract and a return of the deposit paid by him. The

vendor counter-claimed for specific performance. The Court held that the vendor was unable

to obtain specific performance and the purchaser was entitled to rescission. That case is

therefore different from the present case where the Plaintiffs have elected to complete

the purchase. However Buckley J reviewed the authorities on the effect of compensation

provisions for misdescription. With regard to the situation in which the purchaser seeks

specific performance with a reduction in the purchase price where there is a provision in

the contract that disentitles him to compensation or damages, the judge said (at p 866):</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">In <i>Cordingley v. Cheeseborough</i> the

  purchaser sought for specific performance with an abatement of the purchase-money. The

  contract contained a clause that the admeasurements were presumed to be correct, but that

  if any error was discovered therein no allowance should be made or required either way.

  The clause, therefore, excluded compensation; but the purchaser, alleging that he was

  getting less than he contracted to buy, asked for specific performance with compensation.

  He wanted to buy upon altered terms. The Court decreed specific performance without

  compensation. Lord Westbury L.C. says: "In deciding this question it must be

  recollected exactly what is the nature of the present suit. It is not the suit of a vendor

  seeking to enforce a specific performance. It is the case of a purchaser coming for a

  specific performance, but insisting that he is entitled by virtue of the contract to a

  deduction from his purchase-money." In other words, he was insisting to something

  which was not in the contract.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25

        <i>Cordingley v. Cheeseborough</i> (1862) 4 DE

G F &amp; J 379 involved an innocent misdescription which resulted in the actual area of

the property being a little over half of that stated in the contract. The vendor offered

to vacate the contract, to repay the purchaser his cost and to give interest on the

deposit. The purchaser insisted on completing the purchase and instituted proceedings for

a reduction in the purchase price. The exemption clause considered by the Court was,

"<i>The admeasurements are presumed to be correct, but if any error be discovered

therein no allowance shall be made or required either way.</i>" The Court held that

the purchaser was not entitled to compensation or a reduction in the purchase price. Lord

Westbury said at p 1232:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">… My attention has been called, and

  very properly, to the decisions of the Court with respect to the construction of the

  particulars and conditions of sale against the vendor. No doubt it is a very wholesome

  maxim that a vendor shall be required to bring into the market particulars and conditions

  of sale prepared with great care and fairness; and when the vendor is the Plaintiff for a

  specific performance, that rule is, in my judgment, properly enforced as against the

  vendor. But when the purchaser insists that the terms of this contract give him a right to

  a deduction, claiming still to have the benefit of the contract, the rule to which we have

  been referred is no longer applicable, and the contract must be construed according to the

  ordinary rules of construction for the purpose of ascertaining whether he is or is not

  entitled to the deduction from his purchase-money.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">And at page 1234:-</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The purchaser adheres to his contract. The

  only question therefore is, whether here the purchaser, seeking a deduction from

  purchase-money, is entitled to that deduction according to the proper meaning of the

  contract that he has entered into. I am of opinion that he is not.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">26

        In <i>Curtis v French</i> [1929] 1 Ch 253 there

was a provision similar to the one in clause 10 which states that: <i>"No error,

misstatement or omission in the particulars, sale plan or conditions shall annul the sale,

nor shall any compensation be allowed either by the vendor or purchaser in respect

thereof."</i> The premises had been stated to be sold with vacant possession on

completion but in fact there was a sub-tenant who was entitled to remain as a statutory

tenant. Eve J said at p 261:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">But here is a term of the contract which

  says, notwithstanding that it is a misstatement, the purchaser is not to be entitled to

  recover any damages or compensation in respect of it. In the position which has arisen he

  would be entitled to rescind the contract, to recover his deposit with interest, and the

  costs of investigating the title, but nothing more. He has bargained for vacant possession

  of that which he has purchased. He cannot have vacant possession, the vendor cannot give

  him what he contracted to give him, but the contract itself precludes him from recovering

  anything for the loss sustained by reason of the misstatements. The action is brought for

  specific performance, but at the time the plaintiff does not ask for this relief; he is

  content with damages if he can obtain them. In my opinion he cannot, the terms of the

  contract are too strong, and the action, so far as it is an action for damages, fails.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">27

        In <i>Re Terry and White’s Contract</i>

(1886) 32 Ch D 14, there was a mis-statement of approximately 25% in the area of the

property. The vendor refused to make compensation but offered to annul the sale. The

purchaser refused to consent to the annulment and claimed for specific performance with

compensation. The vendor then rescinded the contract pursuant to a provision therein. Lord

Esher, MR said at p 22:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">… Conditions of sale are not always

  the same, they vary; some vendors may put in more stringent conditions of sale than

  others; but when the conditions of sale are put in, what are the rights of the parties?

  Why, the purchaser bids, knowing of those conditions of sale, and therefore agreeing to be

  bound by them; so that the conditions of sale are the agreement under which the purchaser

  bids and the vendor sells. Then, that is a contract, the conditions of sale forming part

  of the contract. How are they to be construed? To my mind they are to be construed in

  precisely the same manner in a Court of Law as in a Court of Equity. They are to be

  construed according to the ordinary interpretation of language as used in business, unless

  there is something in the contract or something in the subject-matter which obliges the

  Court – not which entitles the Court, but which obliges the Court – to read the

  language otherwise than in its ordinary sense.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">       

  Now, take that rule of interpretation, and apply it to the conditions before us. First of

  all, I will go to the third condition. "Each lot is believed" – that is

  only a statement as to the good faith of the vendor, - "and shall be taken to

  be" – that part of it is against the purchaser – "and shall be taken

  to be correctly described as to quantity and otherwise," and the respective

  purchasers shall be satisfied with certain evidence, "and shall be deemed to buy with

  full knowledge of the state and condition of the property as to repairs and otherwise, and

  no error, mis-statement, or misdescription shall annul the sale, nor shall any

  compensation be allowed in respect thereof." Now, let us construe that according to

  its ordinary meaning. It is meant to put the purchaser, if he does not choose to go and

  look at the land and have it measured according to the description, - which he might do, I

  presume, - to put him really in the condition of a man who has done so … It seems to

  me that if we construe that condition according to its plain meaning, it is a contract

  between the purchaser and the vendor that so far as the contract is concerned, no

  misdescription, honest misdescription, shall have any effect, or at least shall have any

  greater effect, than if the purchaser had gone to look at the land and bought the land on

  his own judgment; and, if he had, why then an innocent misdescription could have had no

  effect. It seems to me that the purchaser has therein contracted that if the contract is

  to go on, he shall not have any compensation for a misdescription of quantity.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">28

        The Plaintiffs submitted that clause 10 does

not have the effect of relieving the Defendant from liability for misdescription and cited

the following authorities: (i) <i>Kassim Syed Ali v Grace Development</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=45838&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 2 SLR 393</a>; and (ii) <i>Lau Lay Hong v Hexapillar</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=7419&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1993] 3 SLR 198</a>.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">29

        <i>Kassim Syed Ali v Grace Development</i>

involved the sale and purchase of shopping units in The Adelphi. It was originally

designed to accommodate an hotel in its tower block and a shopping centre in its podium

block. The shopping units in question were sold on this basis to the defendants. However

the plaintiffs decided to convert the tower block into offices instead of the hotel and

obtained planning permission for this without the defendants’ consent. When the

defendants refused to make the progress payment upon procurement of the certificate of

statutory completion, the plaintiffs sued for specific performance. The Court of Appeal

held that the plaintiffs were in breach of the sale and purchase agreements as it was

contemplated therein that The Adelphi was to be built as an hotel and shopping complex but

delivered as an office and shopping complex. The plaintiffs relied on condition 11 of the

Law Society’s Conditions of Sale which provides as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The property is believed and shall be

  taken to be correctly described as to quantity and otherwise and is sold subject to all

  chief, quit, and other rents and out-goings and to all incidents of tenure, rights of way,

  and other rights and easements (if any) affecting the same and if any error, misstatement,

  or omission (not of a serious or vital nature nor considerably affecting the value of the

  property) shall be discovered in the particulars special conditions or contract the same

  shall not annul the sale nor shall any compensation be allowed by or to either party in

  respect thereof.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">30

        The Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court

that condition 11 had no application because the matter did not concern any error or

misstatement or omission in the description of the property being sold and it was a case

where the premises delivered to the defendants were different from what they had

purchased. This is quite different from the present case which involves a misdescription

in the GFA and clearly falls within the ambit of clause 10.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">31

        In <i>Lau Lay Hong v Hexapillar</i> the sale

and purchase agreement also contained condition 11 of the Law Society’s Conditions of

Sale. It should be noted that in this condition, the words <i>"error, misstatement or

omission"</i> are qualified by <i>"not of a serious or vital nature nor

considerably affecting the value of the property"</i>. There was a shortfall of 76

square feet in the area of the apartment the subject of the sale, amounting to 2.83% of

the total area. Warren Khoo J held that the magnitude of this shortfall brought it outside

the qualifying words and hence the scope of condition 11. The judge reasoned as follows

(at p 206):</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">On the question of the area shortfall, I

  can dispose of the question very shortly as follows. I do not think that the shortfall was

  so substantial as to enable a purchaser to rescind the contract. However, it does appear

  to me to be substantial enough to be a subject of compensation. I do not think it is

  caught by condition 11.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">32

        In <i>Yeo Brothers Co (Pte) Ltd v Atlas

Properties (Pte) Ltd</i> [1987] SLR 443, the sale and purchase contract contained

condition 11 of the Law Society’s Conditions of Sale. The High Court held that the

shortfall in area of 10.77% was sufficiently substantial to bring it outside the scope of

condition 11 and accordingly the purchaser was entitled to an abatement in the price.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">33

        In <i>Re a Contract Dated 24<sup>th</sup> July,

1929</i> [1930] SSLR 199 there was also an exemption clause identical to condition 11 of

the Law Society’s Conditions of Sale. The shortfall there was about 8% and the Court

held that it was serious enough to bring it outside the scope of the exemption clause and

an abatement of the price was allowed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">34

        The exemption clause in the present case is

different from that dealt with by the Court in <i>Lau Lay Hong &amp; Anor v Hexapillar Pte

Ltd</i>, <i>Yeo Brothers Co (Pte) Ltd v Atlas Properties (Pte) Ltd</i> and <i>Re a

Contract Dated 24<sup>th</sup> July, 1929</i>. In those cases, the exemption clause only

protected the vendor to the extent that the error, misstatement, or omission was not of a

serious or vital nature or considerably affecting the value of the property. Consequently,

the issue before the Court in those cases was whether the reduction in the area of the

property from that stated in the contract was outside the exemption. Clause 10 in the

present case is not qualified at all and covers all misdescriptions. This was the view

taken by Stevens J in <i>Re a Contract dated 24<sup>th</sup> July 1929</i>, where he said

as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The third point concerns the construction

  of Singapore condition No. 11. It is clear that but for the insertion of the words

  "not of a serious or vital nature nor considerably affecting the value of the

  property" this condition would have afforded complete protection to the vendors (see <i>Terry

  &amp; White’s Contract</i>) unless the misdescription was such as to strike at the

  whole basis of the contract, so that the parties could not be said to be <i>ad idem</i>.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">35

        The Plaintiffs had elected to complete their

purchase of the Property although they were fully aware of the provisions of clause 10 of

the Option. They made such election notwithstanding that the Defendant had offered to

refund the deposit and treat the Option as cancelled. Applying the principles in <i>Jacobs

v Revell</i>, <i>Cordingley v Cheeseborough</i>, <i>Re Terry White’s Contract</i> and

<i>Curtis v French</i>, I hold that clause 10 of the Option precludes the Plaintiffs from

obtaining compensation or damages for any shortfall in the estimated total gross floor

area of the Property. Even if they were entitled to rescind the contract on account of a

misdescription, they cannot choose to proceed with the contract without clause 10.</font></p>
