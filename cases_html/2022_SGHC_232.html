That amounted to $34.59 for transport and meal expenses (for which Mr Sim provided receipts), and $750 for Mr Sim’s time (Mr Sim said he earned $14,700 a month; $750 per day is roughly one day’s pay based on 20 working days a month).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 PUB’s position was that it was not obliged to pay Mr Sim anything, but WhiteFern said they could advise PUB to pay for Mr Sim’s transport and meal expenses amounting to $34.59.

The present issue concerns payment in relation to a <span class="font-italic">subpoena</span> issued for a trial in 2020, prior to ROC 2021 coming into force (indeed, ROC 2021 no longer uses the term “<span class="font-italic">subpoena</span>” but instead “order to attend court”). I thus considered ROC (2014 Rev Ed) to be relevant, rather than ROC 2021. However, if ROC 2021 had applied instead, Mr Sim would likewise not be entitled to any payment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Order 38 rule 22 of ROC (2014 Rev Ed) refers only to a <span class="font-italic">subpoenaed</span> witness’ “expenses of going to, remaining at, and returning from, Court”.

[Underlining added for emphasis]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The commentary further stated that Singapore had no equivalent of the provisions under the Australian rules which allow <span class="font-italic">subpoenaed</span> witnesses to be compensated for not only <span class="font-underline">expenses</span> but also <span class="font-underline">loss</span> reasonably incurred in complying with the <span class="font-italic">subpoena</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 For completeness, the position in Singapore has now been broadened to cover not only a <span class="font-italic">subpoenaed</span> witness’ <span class="font-underline">expenses</span>, but also his <span class="font-underline">time</span>. For matters to which Order 15 rule 4(9) of ROC 2021 applies: “[a] witness who complies with an order to attend court … is entitled to claim <span class="font-italic font-underline">reasonable compensation</span><span class="font-italic"> for his or her </span><span class="font-italic font-underline">time</span> <span class="font-italic">and </span><span class="font-italic font-underline">expenses</span> <span class="font-italic">in complying with the order</span> …” [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Order 38 rule 22 of ROC (2014 Rev Ed) states that a witness <span class="font-underline">shall not be compelled to attend</span> on a <span class="font-italic">subpoena</span> unless there has been a reasonable tender of expenses. It does not expressly say that a witness who <span class="font-underline">attends</span> on a <span class="font-italic">subpoena</span> is entitled to payment for his reasonable expenses, but this would follow from the rule.

In his email of 20 November 2020, he said, “I will need to apply leave to my company in order to be able to attend the court”. He did not tell WhiteFern that even before he was served with the <span class="font-italic">subpoena</span>, he had already successfully applied for leave for the first week of trial, because he planned to accompany his wife.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In his email, Mr Sim said that he was told to appear in court on the first day of the trial, but he was not told which day he was scheduled to attend (as a witness). As such, he asserted that WhiteFern was responsible to pay for his appearance as witness for the whole trial period, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 23 November to 7 December 2020. He concluded by saying that if he did not hear further from WhiteFern by 5pm on 21 November, he would assume that WhiteFern had to pay him for the day(s) that he was in court; he said his monthly salary was $14,700.

His court attendance as a <span class="font-italic">subpoenaed</span> witness was scheduled for the afternoon of 1 December 2020 – but that attendance never happened, for the trial had ended by then. WhiteFern had already told him the day before the trial started, that he was not required to attend as a <span class="font-italic">subpoenaed</span> witness from the start of the trial: they would let him know later <span class="font-underline">whether</span> he was required as a witness, and if so, <span class="font-underline">when</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Although Mr Sim was expressly excused (and, indeed, excluded) from the trial by around 10.33am on the first day of trial (23 November 2020), he stayed at the court building (but outside the courtroom) while the trial was in progress until the end of that day, going home only after 6pm; and he again returned to the court building on 24, 25, and 26 November 2020 although the trial court had told him to return to the trial at 2.30pm on 1 December 2020, and not to sit in while earlier witnesses were testifying.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Mr Sim’s latest email of 2 September 2022 reinforces the point that he was just accompanying his wife to and from court. He says he had to chaperone and escort her from home to court, and back, on those four days; they travelled together in the same taxis. He further says he made all the logistical arrangements including the payment of taxi fares, “to ensure that Ms Chan was able to appear and attend the Court as required.” Had Mr Sim never been served with the <span class="font-italic">subpoena</span>, he would have behaved no differently: he would have accompanied his wife, as he did.

</div> If by that he meant that WhiteFern had ordered him to come to court and wait outside the courtroom day after day, although he was only required to testify in the afternoon of 1 December 2022, that never happened. After Mr Sim was excused from the trial and left the courtroom, WhiteFern and Ms Chan’s lawyers continued to be engaged in the trial – there was simply no opportunity for WhiteFern to have “ordered” Mr Sim to remain at the court building (but outside the courtroom). The position was instead as stated by WhiteFern: Mr Sim could have left, but he chose to stay on his own accord.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In any event, even if WhiteFern had “ordered” Mr Sim to remain at the court building, the court had told him directly that he only needed to attend as a witness on 1 December 2022.

</div> Mr Sim’s continued presence at the court building in the period of 23–26 November 2022 was thus not referable to the <span class="font-italic">subpoena</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Moreover, after the lunch break on 26 November 2022, WhiteFern informed the court that PUB would not require Mr Sim as a witness <span class="font-italic">at all</span>, and Ms Chan’s lawyers agreed to inform Mr Sim of this. However, Ms Chan continued to testify till the end of the day, and Mr Sim continued to wait outside the courtroom; they then travelled home together. This reinforces the conclusion that Mr Sim’s attendance in court in the period of 23–26 November 2022 was unrelated to the <span class="font-italic">subpoena</span>; he was just accompanying his wife, the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Cancellation fees</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 There is no basis for Mr Sim to get anything on his claim for 1-day cancellation fees. The trial effectively ended on 26 November 2020 because Ms Chan accepted PUB’s offer to settle; in the morning of 27 November 2020 (a day on which Mr Sim did not come to court), the court was informed of the settlement, vacated the rest of the trial, discharged the <span class="font-italic">subpoenas</span>, and gave further directions. If Mr Sim truly believed he was obliged to turn up at the court every day until his <span class="font-italic">subpoena</span> was discharged, he should have been there on 27 November 2020, but he was not (and neither was his wife, and so he did not need to accompany her to court).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Mr Sim had earlier been told he only needed to return to court on 1 December 2020. There is no evidence that Mr Sim had applied for leave to attend court on that date; his leave was for the period of 23–27 November 2020, as he intended to accompany his wife to and from court that week. Cancellation fees are not expenses recoverable under ROC (2014 Rev Ed); even if ROC 2021 applied, compensation would have only been for time spent complying with the order to attend court.

</div>
</div> In my view, however, as Mr Sim was told to leave the trial at around 10.33am, it was not reasonably necessary for him to have stayed till lunchtime (after 1pm), and then to charge his lunch expenses to PUB. Accordingly, the court would not award Mr Sim his lunch expenses, even if he were regarded as having attended court on the <span class="font-italic">subpoena</span> for half an hour that morning. In his email of 2 September 2022, Mr Sim says that he “had not included the claim of [his] entitled meals for the 2nd to 4th day”. Mr Sim however had no entitlement to eat at PUB’s expense on the 2nd to 4th day of trial, and any claim for these meal expenses would have been dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Even awarding Mr Sim his transport expenses would have been problematic, for (as Mr Sim confirmed) he had travelled to and from court together with his wife. His wife would have travelled to and from court in any event, as she was the plaintiff, and testifying as a witness. Mr Sim did not incur any <span class="font-underline">additional</span> travel expenses on account of being served with the <span class="font-italic">subpoena</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Moreover, as between Ms Chan and PUB, the court had made no order as to costs for a period that ran to the first day of trial, and Ms Chan was ordered to pay PUB costs for the period thereafter. PUB was thus not obliged to pay for Ms Chan’s transport expenses on the four trial days. Requiring PUB to compensate Mr Sim for his transport expenses would in effect be requiring PUB to pay for Ms Chan’s transport expenses – for Ms Chan and Mr Sim travelled together to and from court. Awarding Mr Sim his transport expenses would contradict the court’s earlier decision regarding costs as between Ms Chan and PUB. Accordingly, Mr Sim should not be awarded his transport expenses in any event.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Other legal filing fees &amp; costs - filing Complaint to Law Society &amp; SCT $ 73.34</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Mr Sim sought to be compensated for proceedings he had unsuccessfully commenced.

As the court in <span class="font-italic">Lam Hwa</span> put it at [20], it is “[t]he litigant who subpoenas the witness” who is obliged to compensate the witness.

</div>
</div> For the reasons above (at [56]–[58]), Mr Sim should not be awarded anything in relation to the Law Society and Small Claims Tribunals proceedings. As for his SMC complaint, such costs are likewise not expenses of attending court on the <span class="font-italic">subpoena</span>, and they do not concern Mr Sim’s time and expenses of complying with an order to attend court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Litigant time costs (as the court deems appropriate for 37 hours spent) $ 3,543</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Mr Sim sought to be compensated, at the rate of $766 per day, for time spent in relation to the Small Claims Tribunals proceedings, for corresponding with WhiteFern to get payment, and for writing to PUB, the Minister, and the court. These are not expenses of attending court on the <span class="font-italic">subpoena</span>; they are not time and expenses of complying with an order to attend court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The same observation applies to Mr Sim’s remark that he has “not costed” his time spent preparing his complaint letters to the SMC and the Law Society, to which he attributed a further 39 hours.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Moreover, Mr Sim’s rate of $766 per day is questionable. It is based on his <span class="font-italic">previous</span> salary of $14,700 per month with his <span class="font-italic">previous</span> employer, Targo Technology GmbH Singapore branch (“Targo”). It appears that Mr Sim revised his per day rate from $750 per day (which was what he had initially been claiming) to $766 per day because that was the rate Targo used (based on 260 working days a year, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, around 21 working days a month) in encashing his untaken leave.

</div>
</div> The same document shows Mr Sim’s resignation date (presumably meaning his last day as a Targo employee) as 31 January 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Mr Sim provided no information or documents as to whether he worked, or had any work income, after 31 January 2021. Most of his “litigant time costs” were in relation to things done by him after 31 January 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I did not accept Mr Sim’s contention that reasonable compensation to a litigant-in-person is to be computed according to the person’s work income. That would mean that a successful litigant-in-person who has no work income, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, a homemaker, or a retiree, would get no compensation for the time and work required for the proceedings: this cannot be right. But in so far as work income is a relevant consideration, Mr Sim failed to substantiate what his work income was (if he had any) after his resignation on 31 January 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 More fundamentally, Mr Sim does not deserve <span class="font-italic">any</span> compensation for the time he spent. He cited Order 21 rule 7 of ROC 2021, which reads: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Court <span class="font-italic">may</span> award costs to a <span class="font-underline">successful</span> party who is not represented by solicitors that would compensate him or her reasonably for the time and work required for the proceedings and for all expenses incurred reasonably. [Emphasis added in italics and underline]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The equivalent provision under ROC (2014 Rev Ed) is Order 59 rule 18A:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">On a taxation of the costs of a litigant in person, there <span class="font-italic">may</span> be allowed such costs as would reasonably compensate the litigant for the time expended by him, together with all expenses reasonably incurred. [Emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In a case concerning the rule in ROC (2014 Rev Ed), the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ong Wui Teck (personal representative of the estate of Chew Chen Chin, deceased) v Ong Wui Swoon and another and another appeal</span> [2019] SGCA 61  emphasised at [74] that the rule does not entitle a litigant-in-person to costs <span class="font-italic">as of right</span>: it only provides that he <span class="font-italic">may</span> be allowed reasonable compensation for the time and work required, and does not displace the fundamental principle that costs follow the event, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the court generally awards costs to the <span class="font-italic">successful </span>party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The position is even more pointed under the ROC 2021 rule: the court “<span class="font-italic">may</span> award costs to a <span class="font-underline">successful</span> [litigant-in person]” [emphasis added]. Mr Sim was not successful in his claims – he was repeatedly <span class="font-italic">unsuccessful</span>. There is no basis for requiring PUB or WhiteFern to pay for Mr Sim to pursue unsuccessful claim after unsuccessful claim. Indeed, in early 2021, Mr Sim ought to have accepted payment of his transport and meal expenses for the first day of trial; he should most definitely have accepted PUB’s later offer of $1,000 which was more than what he had initially claimed. Now, he gets nothing.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Mr Sim was served with a <span class="font-italic">subpoena</span>, but the trial ended before he was scheduled to attend as a witness. He went to court because he was accompanying his wife, the plaintiff; he did not do so as a <span class="font-italic">subpoenaed</span> witness. Mr Sim did not spend time or incur expenses in complying with the <span class="font-italic">subpoena</span> for which he ought reasonably to be compensated. He is not entitled to any payment from PUB or its lawyers WhiteFern for having been served with the <span class="font-italic">subpoena</span>.  Mr Sim’s claims for payment are dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Mr Sim has spent the better part of two years pursuing payment that he is not entitled to.
