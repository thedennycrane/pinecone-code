</div> DBS, as a creditor of both Mdm Eng and Mr Dong, has filed objections to both OSB 3 and OSB 20.

This turns on whether the court has the jurisdiction to grant its consent to a proposed disposition of property by a debtor prior to the making of a bankruptcy order.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, if the applications are not premature, whether the court should grant the orders sought by Mdm Eng and Mr Dong on the facts of their respective applications.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the applications are premature</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The first issue is whether the applications are premature given that no bankruptcy orders have yet been made against either Mdm Eng or Mr Dong. As mentioned above, this is a question of the court’s jurisdiction. This is an issue that was raised by counsel for the applicants, Mr Tris Xavier (“Mr Xavier”), in his written submissions. Although counsel for DBS, Ms Cherie Tan (“Ms Tan”), confirmed at the hearing that DBS did not take the position that the applications were premature or that the court did not have the jurisdiction to grant the orders sought, I consider it useful to engage with the issue given that there does not currently appear to be a reported decision in respect of the applicable provision, s 328 of the IRDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Section 328 of the IRDA reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Restrictions on dispositions of property by bankrupt</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">328.—(1)  Where a person is adjudged bankrupt, any disposition of property made by the bankrupt during the period beginning on the day of the making of the bankruptcy application and ending on the day of the making of the bankruptcy order is void except to the extent that such disposition has been made with the consent of, or been subsequently ratified by, the Court.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  For the purpose of this section, a disposition of property includes any payment (whether in cash or otherwise) made to any person by the bankrupt and accordingly, where any payment is void by virtue of this section, the person to whom the payment was made holds the sum paid for the bankrupt as part of the bankrupt’s estate.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)  Nothing in this section gives a remedy against any person in respect of — </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) any property or payment which the person received from the bankrupt before the commencement of the bankruptcy in good faith, for value and without notice that the bankruptcy application had been made; or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) any interest in property which derives from an interest in respect of which there is, by virtue of this subsection, no remedy.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5)  A disposition of property is void under this section even if the property is not or, as the case may be, would not be comprised in the bankrupt’s estate, but nothing in this section affects any disposition made by a person of property held by that person on trust for any other person.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Mr Xavier focuses on the use of “consent” in s 328(1), which is used in contradistinction to the phrase “or been subsequently ratified by”, to submit that the legislation contemplates that the court can grant <span class="font-italic">ex ante</span> approval to a proposed disposition of property rather than being limited to <span class="font-italic">ex post</span> ratification of a completed disposition.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 In my judgment, it is clear from the wording of s 328 of the IRDA and its context, as well as the legislative purpose of the provision, that the court can prospectively validate a proposed disposition of property before a bankruptcy order is made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 First, on the plain wording, I agree with the contrast drawn by Mr Xavier between the word “consent” and the phrase “or subsequently ratified by” in s 328(1). The ordinary meaning of “consent” refers to <span class="font-italic">ex ante </span>authorisation. On the other hand, the ordinary meaning of ratification – which the statute itself makes clear through the adverb “subsequently” – refers to <span class="font-italic">ex post</span> authorisation (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>,<span class="font-italic"> Alternative Advisors Investments Pte Ltd v Asidokona Mining Resources Pte Ltd</span> [2024] SGCA 3 at [2], in respect of ratification of an agent’s authority).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Second, I see nothing in the objective, purpose or context of s 328 that would militate against the court having the jurisdiction to grant prospective validation orders before a bankruptcy order is made. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Although the cases on the predecessor to s 328 of the IRDA – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>s 77 of the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) (“BA”) – and the parallel provisions in the context of corporate insolvency – previously s 259(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed), and now s 130(1) of the IRDA – are generally concerned with ratification rather than consent, Steven Chong J in <span class="font-italic">Centaurea International Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Citus Trading Pte Ltd</span> [2017] 3 SLR 513 (“<span class="font-italic">Centaurea</span>”) did recognise the possibility of seeking the court’s consent for a proposed disposition after a winding-up petition had been filed against a company (and presumably before a winding-up order had been made) (at [26]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A third party who, despite having knowledge that the winding up petition has been filed, is asked to enter into a transaction with a company after the commencement of winding up can always decline to do so until he or the company has obtained a <span class="font-italic">prospective</span> validating order. If he chooses to go ahead without first obtaining the validating order, then he obviously takes the risk of the court subsequently refusing to make the order. However, it is not always feasible to obtain such an order in advance because the third party may be unaware of the winding up application. Here we are concerned with such a situation; hence, the necessity for the <span class="font-italic">retrospective</span> validation order.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It is clear from this excerpt that seeking consent in the form of a prospective validation order does serve a tangible purpose, namely, to give counterparties to transactions with financially distressed individuals and companies peace of mind prior to entering into what would otherwise be an avoidable transaction in the individual or company’s subsequent bankruptcy or insolvency.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 If there were no jurisdiction for the prospective validation of dispositions prior to the making of a bankruptcy order, transaction counterparties would be forced to inevitably run the risk of subsequent nullity if a bankruptcy order were to be made later down the line. That would be a wholly uncommercial result and therefore an absurd construction that should be eschewed (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General </span>[2017] 2 SLR 850 at [38]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18  For these reasons, I hold that s 328(1) of the IRDA empowers the court to grant its consent, in the form of a prospective validation order, to a proposed disposition of property during the intervening period between the making of a bankruptcy application and the making of a bankruptcy order.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether consent should be granted</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The applicable principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The authorities in respect of the predecessor provision in s 77(1) of the BA are clear that the primary consideration when the court exercises its discretion to validate a disposition is that the disposition should promote an “orderly and rateable distribution to the general body of creditors” (see <span class="font-italic">Sutherland, Hugh David Brodie v Official Assignee and another </span>[2021] 4 SLR 752 (“<span class="font-italic">Sutherland</span>")<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [28]). Some implications of this are that the disposition that is sought to be validated should be proper and fair, consistent with the principle of <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span> distribution, and not amount to a preference of any creditor. I do not wish to foresee all possible situations, but the guiding light should be whether the disposition is (a) fair and (b) to the benefit of the general body of unsecured creditors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In an application for prospective validation, the fact that the disposition has yet to go through, and its effects yet to be felt, means that the court is faced with the difficult task of fortune-telling. Insofar as the question is whether the proposed transaction or disposition is fair or <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span>-compliant, such an inquiry may be less speculative. For example, where a debtor intends to apply his limited assets to repay a particular creditor in priority to other similarly situated creditors, the court does not need a crystal ball to see that the intended payee will obtain an advantage. However, insofar as the question is whether the proposed disposition or transaction is likely to benefit the general body of unsecured creditors, that inherently requires an element of projection. Ultimately, the burden of proof lies on the applicant seeking the court’s blessing to convince the court that, on the balance of probabilities, the proposed disposition is likely to benefit the general run of creditors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In contrast, in an application for ratification of a disposition that has been rendered void by operation of s 328(1), the inquiry would appear to be less speculative (see <span class="font-italic">Sutherland</span> at [38]); although I note that, in <span class="font-italic">Centaurea</span>, Chong J held (in the context of the predecessor provision to s 130(1) of the IRDA) that the relevant time for the inquiry even in ratification applications should be the time of the disposition, and that the question should remain framed in terms of likelihood of benefit to the creditors (at [48]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The parties’ arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Mr Xavier agrees that the court should primarily consider whether the proposed disposition would benefit the general pool of creditors. He submits also that the court should consider other factors such as whether the applicant debtor has acted in good faith, although he accepts that good faith <span class="font-italic">per se</span> would not be sufficient.

Here, what has been produced before the court has clearly fallen short. Tellingly, there is no list of creditors. Save perhaps for the odd case where a debtor is almost entirely indebted to a single creditor, it is difficult to see how the court can be expected to project the effects of a proposed disposition on the debtor’s creditors without knowing who the debtor is indebted to, and for how much.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The applicants’ focus appears to be to stave off the creditor that is currently knocking on the door (Maybank), and thereafter operate on a wing and a prayer to keep their business going.

It is simply not enough to kick the can down the road and hope for the best. Financial difficulty is rarely remedied by Micawberism.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The professed intention to pay off Maybank in full clearly amounts to a preference that is injurious of other unsecured creditors, including DBS. It is not enough to say that Maybank’s debt is cleared from the pool of unsecured debt: that happens with every preference. The other creditors are harmed because they get much less than Maybank when they should all be sharing <span class="font-italic">pari passu</span>. Conceptually, the payment of a preference unjustly enriches the preferred creditor at the expense of the remaining unsecured creditors (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Stanford International Bank (in liquidation) v HSBC Bank plc </span>[2023] AC 761 at [48]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 It follows that it would rarely be in the interests of the unsecured creditors for one of their number to be accorded preferential treatment. There will of course be exceptions: one can conceive of a case where it may be beneficial to the creditors as a whole for an unsecured creditor who is a major supplier of the debtor to be paid, so that the debtor can continue in business and trade its way out of difficulty. But the court would need some convincing, and the applicants have not adduced any evidence that displaces the general starting point that a preference would injure, rather than benefit, their unsecured creditors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 It might well be that the sale price in the proposed sale of the Property is, or will be, a better price than in a “fire sale” conducted by Orix Leasing in the event that it enforces its power of sale <span class="font-italic">qua</span> mortgagee of the Property. But in the absence of any valuation report, or any evidence of proper marketing by the applicant, the court cannot conclude that this is a likely benefit and will therefore not validate a proposed sale even if it means that the sale will be lost (see <span class="font-italic">Re Rescupine Ltd </span>[2003] EWHC 216 (Ch)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Candour and proactivity on the part of the debtors will be strong indicators of good faith. In this case, I am satisfied that Mdm Eng and Mr Dong have not exhibited the degree of candour or proactivity that the court will normally associate with good faith and a genuine intention to act in the interests of their creditors. Apart from failing to lead important pieces of evidence to allow the court to properly assess the merits of their applications, one would have expected them to engage with all their creditors rather than seeking to satisfy one at the potential expense of the others. In this connection, their glaring failure to notify DBS – a common creditor of both of them – of the proposed sale as well as these applications until the eleventh hour (one day before the original hearing date)
