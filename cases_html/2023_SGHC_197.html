However, at the quantum stage of the arbitration, the tribunal found that the claimant had failed to prove its pleaded loss, and awarded it only nominal damages. The claimant brings the present application to set aside the award on quantum, on the grounds that the tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction and breached the rules of natural justice by, among others, reversing itself on certain findings it had allegedly made in the award on liability.

NPV was the methodology adopted by EIL (OPAL’s project management consultant) to evaluate the bids received, utilising three basic components derived from the data submitted by the bidders: capital expenditure, operational costs and economic value derived from bidders’ quoted conversion efficiencies. Daelim’s bid was evaluated to have a distinctive advantage over Samsung’s bid, resulting in a higher NPV – in a nutshell, the higher the NPV, the better. With Daelim’s withdrawal from the contract, OPAL had no choice but to contract with Samsung, resulting in an NPV difference. It was this difference in NPV which was claimed by OPAL under its Loss of NPV Claim.

</div> The Tribunal issued a final award dated 28 December 2018 on liability, and a correction on 28 February 2019 (collectively, the “Liability Award”). The Tribunal was split, with Justices Raveendran and Singhvi in the majority, and Mr Leaver KC dissenting. In the Liability Award, the majority held that there was a concluded contract in existence between the parties, which Daelim had wrongfully abandoned. Turning to the heads of claim for damages, the majority dismissed the Guarantee Claim and Delay Claim outright, on the grounds that the former was a duplication of the Loss of NPV Claim, whereas the latter was barred by cll 6.2.1 and 6.2.3 of the GCC.

In the circumstances, the decisions relied upon by OPaL to contend that substantial damages can be awarded even where the exact amount of loss is not proved, will not apply.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 It is therefore OPAL’s argument that the Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction in revisiting and reversing the three critical findings in the Quantum Award, thereby rendering the Quantum Award liable to be set aside.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 An award may be set aside under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (“Model Law”) as set out in the First Schedule to the International Arbitration Act 1994 (2020 Rev Ed) (“IAA”) if the party making the application furnishes proof that “the award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Daelim’s contentions here could be characterised as raising threshold questions, which would significantly alter the nature of the inquiry at the quantum phase.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Taken together, the first five listed issues indicate that the majority of the Tribunal was not confining itself strictly to determining whether Daelim was liable for breach of contract – it also had its eye on the quantum phase. To that extent, there is some truth to the argument made by Ms Koh, that the phrase “Liability Award” was a misnomer. This however does not mean, as Ms Koh suggests, that the Tribunal must be taken to have made final and conclusive findings on every issue relating to quantum raised in the liability phase. The situation is not a binary one. An examination of the listed issues shows that the Tribunal was not using the term “liability” in the strict legal sense. The Tribunal was certainly making determinations on what one could describe as issues of liability in the strict sense (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, whether there was a valid and enforceable contract and whether Daelim was in breach in abandoning/repudiating the contract), but <span class="font-italic">also</span> on whether OPAL could show, at least in principle, that it had suffered a (or some) recoverable loss which was not excluded by the contract (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Issue (iv)) and which should be reserved to be fully argued and determined at the quantum phase. In that sense, it is not entirely a misnomer to call the award a “Liability Award” – the Tribunal also decided whether Daelim’s threshold “quantum” arguments had any merit, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, those arguments which had been raised at the liability phase to persuade the Tribunal that OPAL’s heads of compensation could be rejected at the threshold and that there was nothing to send to the quantum stage for further consideration. In my judgment, that is the context in which the Liability Award is to be read.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Seen in this light, it becomes clear why the Tribunal even gave consideration to Issues (vi) – (viii) at this stage, notwithstanding that they were not issues relating to “liability” in the strict sense. Those issues pertained to the three heads of compensation claimed by OPAL, and the focus of the analysis by the Tribunal was to determine which claims should be rejected at the threshold, and which should be allowed to proceed to the quantum phase for further consideration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 With this in mind, the Tribunal analysed Issue (vi), relating to the Guarantee Claim, and rejected it at the threshold because (a) it would lead to double compensation, and (b) as a matter of law, OPAL could not insist upon a performance guarantee or seek an equivalent amount where the contract was no longer in existence:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">115. The purpose of requiring a performance guarantee from a bank to be kept valid upto [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] the period of scheduled completion date and warranty period is to ensure that the contractor (DAELIM) honours its commitments under the contract. Clause 3.3.3 of GCC provides: 'In case contractor fails to furnish the requisite bank guarantee as stipulated above, then the Company shall have the option to terminate the contact and forfeit the bid security amount .... ' In this case, due to the failure to furnish the bank guarantee, OPAL has already forfeited the bid security amount. … OPAL has already made claims (for INR 409.28 crores and for INR 300.80 crores) for the losses sustained by it by reason of the breach by DAELIM which are the subject matter of the present proceedings. <span class="font-italic">If in addition to claiming such damages for its losses due to breach committed by DAELIM, OPAL claims 10% of the contract price being the performance guarantee amount, it would be a duplication of the claim for damages. At all events, a performance guarantee can be insisted upon only when the contract is in existence. When the contract has been terminated and there is no contract to be performed, the employer/owner (OPAL) cannot seek any performance guarantee or amount equivalent to performance guarantee but can claim only damages </span><span class="font-italic">for the breach/repudiation</span>. <span class="font-italic">Therefore, the first claim for 10% of the contract price being the amount for which DAELIM was required to furnish the performance guarantee, is rejected</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Tribunal similarly analysed Issue (viii), relating to the Delay Claim, and rejected it on the grounds that it was (a) a claim for a notional loss (rather than an actual loss) and (b) also a claim for consequential loss excluded by the contract:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">138. … <span class="font-italic">The above factors clearly demonstrate that there was no loss </span>and even the assumption of notional losses was without basis and erroneous.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">139. At all events, <span class="font-italic">having regard to the </span><span class="font-italic">limitations/exclusion by reason of Clauses 6.2.1 and 6.2.3 of GCC which barred OPAL from claiming any consequential damages in the nature of loss of profits or loss of revenue</span> and the provisions Clause 8.4.1.1 and 8.4.1.2 of GCC which permitted OPAL to claim only the extra cost, <span class="font-italic">the three claims for loss of production (HDPE, Polypropylene and by-products of Cracker plant) and the claim for 'extra interest for 115 days' allegedly incurred on financing availed for Cracker plant (aggregating to INR 300.8 crores) are wholly baseless and deserve to be rejected</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Unlike the Guarantee Claim and Delay Claim however, the Tribunal did not reject the Loss of NPV Claim (which was the subject of Issue (vii)) summarily. Instead, the Tribunal expressed (at para 140(iii) of the Liability Award) that the <span class="font-italic">validity and quantum</span> of this claim would be considered at the quantum phase, albeit limited to 20% of the contract price as per the terms of the contract (see [13] above). Did this then mean that the Tribunal had <span class="font-italic">conclusively</span> accepted every facet of this claim, including by making the alleged three critical findings? In my judgment, the answer is no. Given the general approach taken by the majority in analysing the issues relating damages and quantum, it is difficult to see why it would have intended to make any conclusive findings, especially in respect of a claim for which both questions of<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">validity and quantum </span>were expressly reserved to the quantum phase. Nonetheless, it is OPAL’s case that such conclusive findings were made by the majority, based on the clear words of the majority at multiple points in the Liability Award. I now turn to these passages in the Liability Award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Ms Koh highlighted paras 120–124 of the Liability Award in particular, arguing that the majority had clearly made all three critical findings within these paragraphs. To give some context to these paragraphs, I first reproduce below the point which the majority was addressing its mind to:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">119. The contention of DAELIM is that the claim based on NPV calculation is essentially a claim for loss of profit as a consequential damage and that such a claim is barred by the exclusion Clauses in the contract, namely, Clauses 6.2.1 and 6.2.3(a) of the GCC. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Ms Koh argued that paras 120 and 121 of the Liability Award (set out below) support the First Critical Finding, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that NPV methodology <span class="font-italic">was </span>the appropriate method to assess damages for the extra cost incurred by OPAL in awarding the contract to Samsung following Daelim’s repudiation:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">120. Clause 8.4.1.1 read with 8.4.1.2 of GCC provide that where the contractor repudiates or abandons the contracts, OPAL may deploy any other contractor for completing the work at the risk and cost of the defaulting contractor and recover the extra cost from the defaulting contractor subject to a ceiling of 20% of the contract value. When the NPV calculation was the accepted criteria for price evaluation of bids, there is no reason why NPV calculation cannot be the basis for ascertaining the loss caused due to the breach by the contractor resulting in the contract work being awarded to another contractor at the risk and cost of the contractor who committed the breach. The NPV calculation is not a mere calculation of future loss of profit as contended by DAELIM, but is a calculation which enables OPAL to determine the extract [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] cost that it will have to incur by reason of wrong repudiation/abandonment by DAELIM.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">121. EIL’s report dated 10.8.2017 regarding techno-economic evaluation of bids explains the need and scope of NPV evaluation, which, in brief, is as under: Each Bidder’s licensor would have different evolved plant processes based on their specific technology. The methodology adopted to evaluate different technologies involving different capital cost for constructing the plant and different operating cost during operation is known as ‘Life Cycle Costing’ (LCC) and that was adopted by EIL for evaluation of the price bids. LCC analysis is the preferred tool for economic evaluation of a technology, design alternatives selection and optimisation studies. It involves evaluation of alternatives to satisfy a required level of minimum threshold performance which may have different initial investment costs and different operating &amp; maintenance cost. It provides an assessment of long term cost effectiveness of a project (as contrasted from alternative economic methods which focus only on the first or initial cost of operation related costs in the short run). It takes into account every significant element of costs over life of the asset and works outs its total cost and benefits over the entire economic life of a project to a present value known as the Net Present Value (NPV). NPV represents the present value of future profits from today's investments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 At para 124, the majority then stated as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">124. <span class="font-italic">The claim of OPAL under Clause 8.4.1.1 read with Clause 8.4.1.2 of GCC is not for loss of profits as a consequence of the </span><span class="font-italic">breach, but is a claim for the extra cost to OPAL in getting the work completed through another contractor.</span> Therefore, OPAL is entitled to recover from DAELIM, the extra cost involved as provided in Clauses 8.4.1.1 and 8.4.1.2 of GCC subject to a ceiling of 20% of the contract price. The question as to what factors should be taken note of, or what legal principles should be applied, for ascertaining the extra cost/burden, which is the legal injury suffered by OPAL as a consequence of the breach and the quantum of such extra cost/burden on OPAL in getting the work executed through another contractor by the NPV method, are matters for consideration at the quantum hearing.  Nothing stated above is intended to be acceptance or recognition of the calculations or claim of OPAL for damages on the basis of loss of NPV under Clause 8.4.1.1 read with Clause 8.4.1.2 of GCC.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Ms Koh argued that the Second Critical Finding, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the Loss of NPV Claim is not barred by the exclusion clauses in cll 6.2.1 and 6.2.3 of the GCC, could be found in para 122:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">122. The exclusion clauses relied upon by DAELIM make it clear that what is excluded are ‘consequential damages’ in the nature of loss of profits, loss of production, loss of revenue, etc. <span class="font-italic">The exclusion clauses relied upon by DAELIM do not exclude claim </span><span class="font-italic">[sic] for damages for direct losses arising as a consequence of breach of contract. Clauses 8.4.1.1 and 8.4.1.2 of GCC describe the direct loss which OPAL is entitled to recover by way of damages, that is, the extra cost involved in awarding the contract to an alternative agency.</span> On the facts and circumstances where different processes and technologies are involved in regard to the two bids (of DAELIM and Samsung), <span class="font-italic">the recognised method of evaluating the extra cost involved in awarding the work to Samsung as a consequence of the breach committed by DAELIM, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">is the NPV calculation method</span><span class="font-italic"> as it is not possible to directly calculate the extra cost.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Ms Koh contended that the last sentence also encapsulates the First Critical Finding. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Lastly, Ms Koh submitted that the Third Critical Finding, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that OPAL suffered loss and did not have to show actual expenditure, was made in para 123:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">123. Another contention urged by DAELIM is that OPAL has not actually 'expended' as extra cost or suffered loss of the amount claimed, namely, INR 409.28 crores. It is well settled that the loss 'incurred' is the basis and that it is not necessary to prove the actual expenditure. The following illustration will clarify this position: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A agrees to sell a bag of rice to B on 1.1.2018 at a price of INR 1,000 per bag to be delivered on 10.2.2018.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A fails to deliver the bag of rice to B on 10.2.2018 and thereby commits default. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The market rate of the said bag of rice was INR 1,100 on 10.2.2018. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">B is entitled to the difference between the market rate (INR 1,100) and the contract rate (INR 1,000), namely INR 100 as damages irrespective of whether he actually goes and buys the bag of rice by paying INR 1,100 in the market. This is because B 'incurred' the loss when A failed to deliver and the measure of damages is the difference between the market rate and the contract rate. The fact that B did not actually go and buy the bag of rice by paying INR 1,100 will not disentitle him to damages of INR 100.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">But, on the other hand, if the market price on 10.2.2018 was INR 900, B will not be entitled to any damages as he did not 'incur' or 'suffer' any loss by reason of the breach committed by A in failing to deliver the bag of rice. In fact, even if B goes and purchases a bag of rice on 10.2.2018 at a higher cost of say INR 1,050 actually incurring an extra cost of INR 50, he will not be entitled to recover INR 50 as damages if A establishes the market rate was INR 900.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In this case, OPAL's claim is on the basis that the breach has resulted in a 'loss' of INR 409.28 crores by reason of DAELIM's breach and consequential award of the work to Samsung. NPV basis can therefore be an effective manner of ascertaining the extra cost to OPAL by reason of awarding the contract to Samsung when compared to the cost of the work under the contract awarded to DAELIM. It cannot therefore be contended that the claim on NPV basis is to be rejected at the threshold without going into the question of quantum. There is no straitjacket formula for assessing the extra cost. The fundamental principle on which damages are calculated in cases of breach of contract resulting in a legal injury, is that as far as possible, the injured party (person who has proved breach) should be placed in as good a situation as if the contract had been performed. The Supreme Court of India has recognised the accepted position that different formulae can be applied in different circumstances and the question as to whether damages should be computed by taking recourse to one or the other formula, having regard to the facts and circumstances of a particular case, would fall within the domain of the Arbitrator.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 At first glance, there are statements, words and phrases in the quoted paragraphs above which, if <span class="font-italic">taken in isolation</span>, could support OPAL’s contentions. But that is <span class="font-italic">not</span> how an award should be read. The reasoning of the majority of the Tribunal must be read in its entirety and understood in its proper context, as I have discussed at [35]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The First Critical Finding</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Firstly, I disagree with OPAL’s contention that the Tribunal had made the First Critical Finding. Paragraphs 120 and 121 of the Liability Award must be read together with para 123 (see [48] above), where the majority makes three statements – (a) that “NPV basis can therefore be an effective manner of ascertaining the extra cost to OPAL”; (b) that it cannot be contended that OPAL’s Loss of NPV Claim “is to be rejected at the threshold without going into the question of quantum”; and (c) that “there is no straitjacket formula for assessing the extra cost”. Reading these statements together with paras 120–121, it is clear that all the Tribunal had done was to acknowledge that NPV <span class="font-italic">could be </span>considered an acceptable formula, and that this question would be determined at the quantum tranche hearing. The Tribunal did not make any conclusive finding that NPV was the accepted methodology to calculate the extra cost to OPAL, leaving only the issue of calculations or quantification to be decided at the quantum tranche. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 This conclusion is affirmed at three further points in the Liability Award. The first is at para 124 (see [46] above), where the majority stated that the <span class="font-italic">legal principles</span> to be applied to ascertain the extra cost would be considered at the quantum hearing. The second is in the last sentence of para 124 where the majority stated that nothing in that section of the Liability Award was to be treated as acceptance or recognition by the majority of the <span class="font-italic">calculations or claim</span> of OPAL for damages on the basis of loss of NPV. The third is the dispositive section in para 140(iii) of the Liability Award, where the majority reserved both questions of both the validity and quantum of the Loss of NPV Claim to the quantum phase:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The <span class="font-italic">validity and the quantum</span> of the claim of OPAL (for award of INR 409.28 crores, subsequently restricted to 20% of the contract price of INR 4,593,300,500 plus USD 138,038,000) towards compensation for loss of Net Present Value shall be considered (along with the claim for interest thereon) in the second tranche hearing relating to quantum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 OPAL has sought to qualify the majority’s language in paras 124 and 140(iii) by arguing that the reference to legal principles and the validity of the claim was only directed at the fact that Daelim had made arguments on the assumptions to be applied in the calculation of loss of NPV and on remoteness, and that it was these arguments which would be considered at the quantum phase.

</div>
</div>
</div> In my view, this is a strained reading of the words used by the majority, particularly where the objective meaning of these words are clearly consistent with the rest of the majority’s reasoning.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Therefore, based on the language of the Liability Award alone, I find that the majority of the Tribunal was not determining conclusively that NPV was accepted as the method to compute extra cost and that the only issue at the quantum phase was computation of the monetary amount of damages. I would go further. Even if the majority had in some way endorsed the NPV methodology as acceptable, in the context of the issues they were considering in the Liability Award and the fact that the hearing was bifurcated, any alleged findings on the Loss of NPV Claim could at most only be provisional or preliminary as opposed to conclusive and final. This was why the majority expressly reserved its jurisdiction to consider the issue in a more fulsome and binding manner at the quantum phase of the arbitration (see [51] above). That disposes of OPAL’s contentions on the First Critical Finding.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The Second Critical Finding</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Similarly, I find that the paragraphs relied upon by OPAL do not support its contentions in respect of the Second Critical Finding. Upon a close reading of para 122 (see [46] above), it is apparent that the majority’s main point was that it had characterised OPAL’s claim to be one for extra cost under cll 8.4.1.1 and 8.4.1.2 of the GCC, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, one for direct loss suffered as a consequence of Daelim’s breach. Therefore, the extra cost <span class="font-italic">claim</span> would not be excluded as a claim for loss of profit under cll 6.2.1 and 6.2.3. A distinction must be drawn between the <span class="font-italic">nature</span> of the claim which was being made and the proposed methodology to <span class="font-italic">calculate</span> that claim. I do not read this paragraph of the Liability Award as finding that <span class="font-italic">any </span>claim for loss based on loss of NPV would not be barred under the exclusion clauses. Consistent with my conclusions on the First Critical Finding, I do not think the majority intended to go any further than to say that the NPV methodology could in principle be the method to calculate extra costs – that question was something to be conclusively addressed at the quantum phase.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) The Third Critical Finding</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Lastly, the contention that the majority had made the Third Critical Finding (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that OPAL had suffered loss and it was not necessary to prove actual expenditure) misconstrues what the majority had intended to say in para 123.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In para 123, the majority was addressing Daelim’s argument that OPAL could not recover for loss if it had not actually spent any money – that was the nub of the argument. The majority’s explanation, supplemented by an illustration, boiled down to a simple and fundamental principle – a party claiming damages for breach of contract is not restricted to recovering its reliance loss (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, money expended as a result of the breaching party’s non-performance), but can also claim for expectation loss to be put in the position it would have been if the contract had been performed. However, even expectation loss, must (as a matter Indian law which governed the Contract) be proved – loss cannot be established by bare assertions without evidence. I do not read the majority to be declaring, in contradiction of basic legal principle, that OPAL had established loss and was entitled to recover damages in respect of the Loss of NPV Claim (to be quantified) without actually proving its entitlement. If that was truly what the majority had intended, then there would have been no need for any quantum hearing at all and OPAL could have been awarded its then claimed sum of INR409.28 crores in full. Clearly, that was not the case.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In summary, even based on a reading of the Liability Award alone, I find that the majority of the Tribunal did not make the three critical findings contended by OPAL.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Dissenting Opinion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 OPAL also relies on the dissenting opinion of Mr Leaver KC to buttress its case that the Tribunal had made the three critical findings. OPAL refers to paras 18–21 of the dissenting opinion where it says the dissenting arbitrator set out his views as to why NPV was not appropriate to calculate the extra cost which OPAL was entitled to, or to calculate loss:

Even if an enforceable contract came into existence (which, as explained above, I do not think is the case) I do not agree, for the same reasons as are stated above, that the NPV calculation is one which enables OPaL to determine the extra cost that it will have to incur by reason of wrong(ful) repudiation/abandonment of the contract by Daelim. The extra cost, if any, will be demonstrated by the cost to Opal of the Samsung contract when compared with the proposed Daelim contract. That is the proper measure of damage, and is not theoretical. If there is no extra cost, but a saving, OPaL would have to adduce evidence that it lost production by reason of using the OPaL method. OPaL has not attempted to adduce any such evidence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The fact that this dissent was made at all must mean, OPAL argues, that the issues must have been deliberated upon and that the majority must have made at least the First Critical Finding and Third Critical Finding, thereby rejecting the dissenting arbitrator’s views.

This would be contrary to the principle that dissenting opinions are not part of the award and should not be treated as such – the point is summarised in Gary Born, <span class="font-italic">International Commercial Arbitration</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(Kluwer Law International, 3rd Ed, 2021) (“<span class="font-italic">International Commercial Arbitration</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at p 3305:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Notably, <span class="font-italic">a dissenting or concurring opinion is not part of the award, nor </span><span class="font-italic">is it another or independent award; rather, it is merely a separate statement by the dissenting arbitrator, without any of the legal consequences of an award</span>. Separate, dissenting and concurring opinions are common in both litigation arbitration in some legal systems, particularly in common law jurisdictions… [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Nor should a dissenting opinion be treated as evidence of a tribunal’s deliberations. One cannot assume that every facet of a dissenting opinion would have been deliberated (and disagreed upon) by the majority arbitrators. Further, as stated in <span class="font-italic">International Commercial Arbitration</span> at p 3309,<span class="font-italic"> </span>arbitrators are bound by obligations of confidentiality <span class="font-italic">inter se</span>, and are not generally free to disclose deliberations without restriction in their opinions:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Moreover, not unlike the making of arbitral awards, the making of a dissenting opinion is a serious act, that implicates the arbitrator’s personal duties of impartiality, confidentiality, collegiality and diligence. These duties require that any separate or dissenting opinion respect the secrecy of the arbitral deliberations (<span class="font-italic">i.e.</span>, not disclose or comment upon statements allegedly made during deliberations or prior drafts of awards)…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The confidentiality of arbitrators’ deliberations was recently affirmed by the Singapore International Commercial Court in <span class="font-italic">CZT v CZU </span>[2023] SGHC(I) 11 (“<span class="font-italic">CZT</span>”) at [43]–[44]. While in <span class="font-italic">CZT</span>, the court discussed exceptions to this general principle, those exceptions relate to orders for production of deliberations where serious allegations have been raised such that the interests of justice in producing the records of deliberations outweigh the policy reasons for the protection of confidentiality of deliberations (<span class="font-italic">CZT </span>at [53]). That is an entirely different context from the application before me. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Therefore, the fact that the dissenting arbitrator had expressed his disapproval of the NPV methodology does not necessarily mean, as OPAL contends, that the Tribunal was in fact making critical or conclusive findings at that stage as to whether the NPV methodology would be the method for calculating damages in the quantum phase of the arbitration. In fact, the dissent is equally consistent with the majority simply permitting OPAL to pursue its case on the NPV methodology at the quantum stage, <span class="font-italic">without deciding the point</span> in the Liability Award, and the dissenting arbitrator on the other hand concluding that OPAL’s case simply failed <span class="font-italic">at the threshold </span>and that there was therefore no need to even proceed to the quantum phase.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 A further point against OPAL’s reliance on the dissenting opinion is that the dissenting arbitrator’s views are mistaken at least in so far as they relate to the alleged Third Critical Finding. In para 19 of the dissenting opinion (see [58] above), the dissenting arbitrator records his disapproval with the majority’s supposed view at para 114(c) of the Liability Award that the difference between Daelim’s and Samsung’s bids represented actual loss. In the referenced passage – which was likely to be para 116(c) (there being no para 114(c) in the Liability Award) – the majority was not actually setting out its view. Rather, it was only summarising OPAL’s case and arguments at the liability stage:

The revised NPV of Samsung was INR 590.79 crores as against DAELIM's NPV of INR 1000.08 crores and therefore, OPAL suffered an actual loss of NPV to the tune of 409.29 crores. This loss is a direct and natural result of the breach committed by DAELIM. At the time when the contract was entered, the parties were aware that NPV method was the basis for evaluation of the bids and in the event of repudiation of contract, the NPV evaluation would be the basis for calculation of the loss. As OPAL, who is the injured by reason of the breach by DAELIM, is entitled to be put in the position it would have been if the contract had been performed by DAELIM as far as money can do it, OPAL is entitled to INR 409 .29 crores which it lost by reason of the breach by DAELIM.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Having concluded that the Liability Award, objectively read, does not contain the three critical findings contended by OPAL, I find additionally that there is nothing in the dissenting opinion which changes this conclusion.

Accordingly, I proffer some brief views on the arguments raised. To be clear, I have not considered the parties’ and Tribunal’s conduct post-Liability Award in order to interpret or discern what, objectively, the Tribunal decided in the Liability Award. Rather, I have considered these arguments simply to assess how the parties conducted themselves after the Liability Award was issued and whether that conduct (particularly OPAL’s) was consistent with the case advanced in this application. In short, a review of the record post-Liability Award and of the Quantum Award shows, in my judgment, that neither the Tribunal nor OPAL were under the impression that any final determinations had been made in respect of the Loss of NPV Claim at the liability phase. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I start with OPAL’s conduct in the quantum phase.

While Ms Koh sought to draw a distinction between “calculations” and “methodology” at various points during the oral arguments before me, I do not think that distinction applies in this instance. It is clear that the Tribunal was considering whether NPV was an appropriate <span class="font-italic">basis</span> to compute damages – if it had only meant to address the reliability of NPV <span class="font-italic">calculations</span> tendered, then it would not be necessary to have both paras 21(i) and 21(iv). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Further, at para 28 of the Quantum Award, the Tribunal started its analysis of OPAL’s claim by framing the question it had to address as follows:

OPAL’s argument (as explained at [22] above) is two-pronged. The first prong overlaps with OPAL’s argument in respect of the excess of jurisdiction by the Tribunal in reversing the three critical findings in the Liability Award. OPAL argues that in doing so, the Tribunal had embarked on a chain of reasoning which could not have been reasonably foreseen, such that the Quantum Award was manifestly incoherent.

</div> The second is that some aspects of the Tribunal’s reasoning were not derived from the parties’ submissions or raised to them so as to afford OPAL a reasonable opportunity to make submissions on them. Specifically, OPAL seeks to impugn the Tribunal’s reasoning that it would not be possible to calculate the extra cost claimed by OPAL using the NPV methodology because of the different inputs and outputs in Daelim’s and Samsung’s licensed technology, as well as the illustrations it used to explain that reasoning.

Section 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA provides that the court may set aside an award if “a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with the making of the award by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced”. A party seeking to set aside an award on this ground must establish (a) which rule of natural justice was breached; (b) how it was breached; (c) in what way the breach was connected to the making of the award; and (d) how the breach prejudiced its rights (<span class="font-italic">Soh </span><span class="font-italic">Beng Tee &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development Pte Ltd </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 86 (“<span class="font-italic">Soh </span><span class="font-italic">Beng Tee</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [29]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 For present purposes, the relevant rule of natural justice that OPAL relies on is the fair hearing rule, which requires each party to be given adequate notice of the case it must meet and a fair opportunity to be heard (<span class="font-italic">Soh </span><span class="font-italic">Beng Tee </span>at [43]). Two slightly different facets of the fair hearing rule are, according to OPAL, engaged in this case: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the fair hearing rule is breached where an arbitral tribunal issues a manifestly incoherent decision, as that incoherence demonstrates that the tribunal has not understood or dealt with the case at all (<span class="font-italic">BZW and another v BZV </span>[2022] 1 SLR 1080 (“<span class="font-italic">BZW</span>”) at [56]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the rule is also breached where the tribunal’s chain of reasoning is not one which (i) the parties had reasonable notice that the tribunal would adopt, or (ii) had sufficient nexus to the parties’ arguments. A party has reasonable notice of a chain of reasoning where it arose expressly, arose by reasonable implication from the parties’ pleadings, was reasonably brought to the party’s actual notice, flows reasonably from the parties’ arguments or is related to those arguments. To set aside an award on the basis of a defect in the chain of reasoning, a party must establish that the tribunal conducted itself either irrationally or capriciously such that a reasonable litigant in the party’s shoes could not have foreseen the possibility of reasoning of the type revealed in the award (<span class="font-italic">BZW </span>at [60(b)]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">OPAL’s objection on the three critical findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The first prong of OPAL’s argument can be disposed of quickly. This objection is premised on there being an excess of jurisdiction by reason of the Tribunal, despite being <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span>, revisiting and reversing the three critical findings as alleged by OPAL. As held by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">CDM and another v CDP </span>[2021] 2 SLR 235 at [16], where a party’s allegations of breach of natural justice and excess of jurisdiction overlap (in the sense that both arise from the same factual matrix), a failure to establish the latter ground would necessarily be fatal to the former. Since, as I have found, there was no reversal by the Tribunal of any findings made in the Liability Award (see [75] above), OPAL’s excess of jurisdiction argument falls away, and with it, the first prong of OPAL’s argument on breach of natural justice. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">OPAL’s objection on the Tribunal’s reasoning and use of illustrations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I turn to the second prong of OPAL’s argument relating to the Tribunal’s reasoning and use of illustrations.

The following illustrations may explain the position.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Illustration 1:</span><span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">An employer wants to set up a plant with a plant life of 20 years to manufacture/produce one lakh tons of `Product P' of a prescribed specifications [sic] per year, assuring an output of ten tons of `Product A' from 50 tons of raw materials to be provided by the employer. Several bids are received in response to a notice inviting tenders guaranteeing the above performance requirements. To find out the most advantageous and beneficial bid, the employer has to compare the bids received. For such comparison, there may not be any need for either the price of the `Product P' or the price of the raw materials supplied, as both are constants. The comparison will therefore be only of Capex plus Opex quoted by the rival bidders. Capex refers to the cost of construction of the unit. Opex refers to the cost/expenses relating to operation of the plant (that is, cost of electricity, water, steam and gases) for producing the specified quantity of Product P from a specified quantity of raw material. As a consequence, though different bidders may bid for the said project using different technologies to achieve the contracted result, in view of the input and output parameters being constant (that is, the product being of prescribed specifications, the raw materials required and the quantity of Produce P produced being the same, the production being of a specified quantity per day/per year and the plant life having been specified), for the purpose of evaluating the bids or the benefits to the employer), there is no need to consider the input costs or the revenue from the outputs nor the ‘profit' (that is, revenue by sale of output less cost of input). The comparative figures of Capex plus Opex would be the basis to evaluate the bids to choose the most advantageous bid, even though the bids may relate to use of different technologies for putting up and operating the plant. Even if some of the technologies offered may be of a higher capacity or of a longer life than what is required, that would not be relevant as what is relevant is the fulfilment of the three guaranteed requirements, that is, (i) the product being in accordance with the specifications, (ii) the capacity to produce the specified quantity per day/year and (iii) the life of the plant to produce the required quantities for the specified number of years. In such a case, if the contractor fails to complete the project and thereby commits breach and the work is awarded to another contractor using a different technology meeting the three guaranteed requirements, the extra cost incurred by the employer would be the difference in the aggregate of Capex and Opex. The input costs and the output revenue would not be relevant in such a case.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Illustration 2:</span><span class="font-italic"> An employer wants to set up a plant with a plant life of 20 years</span><span class="font-italic"> to manufacture/produce one lakh tons of `Product P' of a prescribed specifications [sic] per year, with the employer providing the required raw materials.

Another bidder specifies 55 tons of raw materials (inputs) would be required to obtain the same quantity of the specified product (output). In that event, it may not be sufficient merely to take the aggregate of the Capex and Opex for ascertaining the comparative merit. It would also be necessary to consider the conversion efficiency (economic value) in addition to the Capex and Opex, as the difference in the quantity of raw material required would alter the input cost of the employer. Even where the economic value of the quoted conversion efficiencies has to be taken note of for deciding which is of higher benefit to the employer, it would still be a case of ascertaining the cost and expense between the two processes and would not involve assessing the ‘profit' that would be derived by one or the other process.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Illustration 3:</span><span class="font-italic"> An employer wants to set up a plant with a plant life of 20 years</span><span class="font-italic"> to manufacture/produce one lakh tons of `Product P' of a prescribed specifications [sic] per year with the employer providing the required raw material.

ascertained or calculated, but calculation of the economic value of the quoted conversion efficiencies/inputs and outputs becomes very difficult having regard to the several variables with different values. As the above table shows, to calculate the economic value of the quoted conversion efficiencies, the employer will have to assess the cost/expense (that is, cost of inputs – items 1 to 4, and the expense relating to removal of waste output – item 7 in the case of first bidder; and cost of only inputs – items 1 to 4 in the case of the second bidder) and the revenue from the bye-product – item 6. For the purpose of calculating the NPV for selection of the more beneficial bid, it may be possible to take the value of items 2, 3 and 4 as constants and that there is no difference in regard to output items 6 and 7. But if the NPV method of calculation is to be adopted to find out the `extra cost’ involved in allotting the work to the second bidder in the event of breach by the first bidder, it will not be possible to treat the cost of input items 2, 3 and 4 as constants, nor will it be possible to treat output items 6 and 7 to be equal or constant. As the prices of these items would keep on varying over the course of 20 years, it will be next to impossible to calculate which would be more beneficial to the employer.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">95. The above illustrations demonstrate that it may be possible and feasible to calculate the `extra cost’ to the employer on awarding the work to the second bidder by NPV method in projects of the kind described in illustrations 1 and 2 but will not be possible in projects of the kind described in illustration 3. The numerous variables with fluctuating prices make it impractical and inaccurate to calculate the conversion efficiency factor in illustration 3. <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">Comparison becomes very difficult where two different technologies require use of different additives/catalysts of varying quantities to the main raw materials</span>.

In such a case, evaluation of the cost and evaluation of revenue becomes necessary and becomes complex. Difficulties would also arise where inputs required are of different quantities and value and the outputs are also of different quantities and value.

The Tribunal’s chain of reasoning (supplemented by its illustrations) was essentially as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The technologies used in Samsung’s and Daelim’s respective bids utilised different additives and catalysts, in differing quantities and with different values or prices.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Where there were differences in the inputs and outputs of two processes, both in terms of type and volume, it would be very difficult to use the NPV methodology to determine the conversion efficiencies and consequently, calculate the extra cost of using one process over the other, not least because the prices of inputs and outputs would vary over the life cycle of the plant.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) OPAL’s case was such a case (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Illustration 3 at para 94), in that Samsung’s and Daelim’s bids involved varying inputs, and different types and quantities of additives and catalysts. Furthermore, the cost of some of the catalysts/additives to be used in Daelim’s bid were not known due to their compositions being made secret. These uncertainties also meant that even a small variation in the quantities of the inputs could result in a “huge difference” in the economic value (at para 95). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Thus, it was not possible to quantify, with any certainty, whether there was any extra cost to OPAL and if so, the quantum of such cost (at para 97).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 OPAL says that the Tribunal’s reasoning and illustrations were surprising and unexpected as they were not derived from any of OPAL’s pleadings or arguments. Nor, OPAL argues, did Daelim ever contend that it was not possible to calculate OPAL’s extra cost using the NPV methodology because of the different inputs and outputs in Daelim’s and Samsung’s licensed technology. Daelim had only challenged the calculations tendered in support of OPAL’s Loss of NPV Claim, as opposed to the methodology.

OPAL highlights the illustrations used by the Tribunal in para 94 of the Quantum Award, arguing that they were never put to the parties or their experts by the Tribunal, and were therefore “the brainchild of the Tribunal, which it did on its own accord without any assistance or input from the parties, experts, textbooks, or cases”.

It was clear from paras 124 and 140(iii) of the Liability Award (see [51] above) that it was only in the quantum phase that the Tribunal would decide conclusively both<span class="font-italic"> </span>the validity of the claim for extra cost based on the NPV methodology <span class="font-italic">and </span>the quantum of the claim based on this methodology. This was consistent with the Tribunal’s views in para 123 of the Liability Award (see [48] above) that there was no “straitjacket formula” to assess the extra cost to OPAL and that NPV could be an appropriate method. It bears reiteration that this was a preliminary and not a final or binding conclusion. Based on this, the Tribunal was prepared to allow the Loss of NPV Claim to proceed to the quantum phase to determine both the validity (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the soundness) of the NPV methodology <span class="font-italic">and </span>the quantification of the claim.

</div>
</div> Mr Rai highlighted that this evidence found its way directly into para 95 of the Quantum Award, where the Tribunal stated its concern over small variations in quantity resulting in a huge difference in economic value. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Given the sources listed above, I agree that it cannot be said that the Tribunal’s reasoning and illustrations were pulled out of thin air or that it came up with its own ideas without affording the parties the opportunity to address them. In essence, the Tribunal agreed with Daelim’s arguments (contrary to OPAL’s submissions) that the NPV methodology was unsound and unreliable. That was a decision on the merits of the claim, and the building blocks for the illustrations used were also found in the evidence adduced and submissions made during the quantum phase of the arbitration. It is thus not open to OPAL to challenge the Tribunal’s decision on the merits by attempting to argue that there was a process failure. In my judgment, OPAL’s objection is in effect a disguised attempt to attack the decision on its merits, which is impermissible. I accordingly reject the second prong of OPAL’s argument on breach of natural justice. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Was OPAL prejudiced by the Tribunal’s findings?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 It is not enough for a party to show that there was a breach of natural justice occasioned by the tribunal’s conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 An award may only be set aside on grounds of a breach of natural justice if that breach caused actual or real prejudice. Prejudice here means that if there was no such breach, that could reasonably have made a difference to the outcome of the arbitration (<span class="font-italic">L W Infrastructure Pte Ltd v Lim Chin San Contractors Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2013] 1 SLR 125 (“<span class="font-italic">L W Infrastructure</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [81]). Taking a step back and looking at the Quantum Award as a whole, there was, in my view, no prospect of the Tribunal coming to a different conclusion. As such, OPAL could not have suffered any prejudiced even if there was any breach of natural justice on the part of the Tribunal. I elaborate below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The Tribunal’s <span class="font-italic">primary</span> conclusion was <span class="font-italic">not</span> its decision on the unreliability and unsoundness in using NPV as the methodology to calculate the extra cost to OPAL; it was that <span class="font-italic">OPAL had failed to prove what it pleaded</span>.

(ii) The NPV will be calculated by considering three factors (economic value derived from bidders' quoted conversion efficiencies, CAPEX and OPEX) and this would be done by applying a discount factor of 10% on the net cash flow per year and the net cash flow would be arrived at by deducting the OPEX and CAPEX from the sales revenue. This was the basis of the claim, and the Tribunal directed a quantum hearing with reference to the claim so made in the SoC on the basis of EIL' s NPV calculations. <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">The question that can be considered during the quantum hearing, therefore, is whether </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">OPaL has made out a case for awarding damages on the basis of NPV claim as pleaded in its Statement of Claim based on the EIL calculations.</span> In other words, OPaL had to establish the claim by justifying the capital costs, the fixed operating costs, the variable operation costs and the sales revenue adopted/assumed by EIL to arrive at the net cash flow which was subjected to an annual discounting of 10% for 20 years, to arrive at the NPV. <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">This was made clear in paragraphs 116 to 124 of the Liability Award dated 28.12.2018 and the said finding is binding upon the parties during the quantum hearing</span>. <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">OPaL</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline"> has adopted a different method of calculating loss of NPV</span> which involved (a) changing the plant life period for purpose of calculations of loss of NPV as 25 years from commencement of operation (March 2017 to March 2042) instead of 20 years from the date of NOA (28.4.2011 to 28.4.2031); and (b) changing the calculation of NPV adopting a calculation of NPV by applying a different discounting factor to the difference between the total of capital costs and operating costs of DAELIM bid and the actual costs and operating costs of Samsung (instead of the method adopted by EIL by applying a discounting factor of 10% to the annual net cash flow (which is arrived at by deducting the capital costs and operating costs from the sales revenue).

Reading this in context (as set out in para 56), it is apparent that this was not a reference to the Tribunal accepting conclusively the appropriateness of NPV methodology in the Liability Award (as alleged by OPAL). This was the Tribunal emphasising that what OPAL had been permitted to do in the quantum phase was to prove its entitlement to and quantum of loss of NPV <span class="font-italic">as pleaded in its </span><span class="font-italic">statement of claim in the liability phase</span>. As discussed at [16], OPAL did not do this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Instead, OPAL made a tactical decision to amend its claim, which in its submission was merely an updated claim with no change to the NPV methodology.

DAELIM does not dispute the fact that subsequent events can be taken note of to mitigate/reduce the claim for damages calculated with reference to the date of breach and consequently, DAELIM does not dispute that the Tribunal can take into account the up-to-date evidence while assessing compensation. This involves consideration of the questions (a) whether OPaL has made out the case as put forth in the SoC-Q (quantum hearing)? and (b) If the claim as pleaded in the SoC-Q is made out, then whether it can be re-worked on the basis of what was pleaded in the original SoC, for making any award towards the NPV claim?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Thus, it is clear that the Tribunal was very much alive to the issues in play, and was proactively seeking to “connect the proverbial dots” (to use the Court of Appeal’s words in <span class="font-italic">BZW </span>at [58]) between OPAL’s new and unpleaded claim and its original pleaded case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Having set out the context for its analysis to follow, the Tribunal sought to determine the first question, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether OPAL could make out its new and unpleaded claim. This required a close examination of Mr Flower’s Report, which formed the foundation for OPAL’s new claim. The Tribunal agreed with Daelim that Mr Flower’s Report contained several errors which made it unreliable. Three major errors were discussed in the Quantum Award under the headers “Re. Error in the rate of Zinc Stearate”, “Re. Calculation of ‘loss’ period” and “Date of assessment of damages”. It was only after analysing these major errors in detail that the Tribunal proceeded to make its <span class="font-italic">separate</span> comments on the unsoundness of the calculation of damages (at paras 93–97 of the Quantum Award) which have formed the basis of OPAL’s present objections in this application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In the Tribunal’s concluding paragraphs under the header “Whether OPaL has established the quantum of loss for award of damages”, the Tribunal summarised, in two distinct paragraphs, its reasons for finding that OPAL had failed to establish its claim:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">98. The Tribunal has found that in cases where the two technologies use different additives/catalysts and/or where the quantities of the additives/catalysts and standard inputs are different, it will not be possible to find the `extra cost' as the determination would involve assessment of revenue, expenditure and profits which is barred by the contract, apart from the complexity and the impracticality of comparing the inputs and outputs in projects using different technologies.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">99. <span class="font-italic">The Tribunal </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">also</span><span class="font-italic"> finds that </span><span class="font-italic">OPaL has not chosen to prove what it pleaded in support of its claim for damages of INR 409.28 crores towards compensation for loss of NPV; and that the method adopted by Mr. Flower for calculating the damages as INR 5,317 million by way of compensation of loss on account of NPV suffers from serious and fundamental errors requiring rejection</span>. The Tribunal has considered three major errors out of the eight errors listed by Mr. Arora, DAELIM' s expert, in the calculations of by Mr. Flower which are sufficient to hold that Mr. Flower's methodology was both contrary to the contract and proceeded on erroneous assumptions. In this view, it is not necessary to consider the other errors listed by Mr. Arora (in the table in para 67). It is held that OPaL has failed to prove the NPV loss in respect of the claim for INR 409.28 crores subsequently restricted to 20% of contract value.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 It is clear that the Tribunal’s conclusions at para 99, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that OPAL chose not to prove what it pleaded in the liability phase and that Mr Flower’s Report suffered from “serious and fundamental errors requiring rejection”, were <span class="font-italic">separate </span>conclusions to that reached by the Tribunal on the unsoundness of the calculation of damages by OPAL. Thus, these formed separate and independent grounds for the Tribunal’s ultimate finding that OPAL had failed to prove its pleaded claim for INR409.28 crores. As such, even if the Tribunal had accepted that NPV methodology was acceptable to calculate OPAL’s damages, OPAL’s claim would, in my view, still have failed on these separate grounds.

In the first place, the point of this report (and Mr Arora’s evidence more generally) was to show the fundamental errors in Mr Flower’s calculations, rather than to offer an alternative sum of damages. Nor was it Daelim’s case that OPAL should at best be awarded INR355 million in damages.

It could not then, in the same breath, adopt the Sixth Expert Report to award OPAL a sum of INR355 million based on the very methodology it had rejected. As I have found, the Tribunal’s conclusions on the NPV methodology cannot be interfered with. There cannot therefore be any prejudice arising in respect of the Sixth Expert Report. It would have had no impact on (or made any difference to) the Tribunal’s primary conclusion that OPAL had simply failed to prove what it pleaded.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Having chosen to adopt a particular strategy at the quantum phase of the arbitration, OPAL must lay in the bed it made, no matter that the outcome of the arbitration is unpalatable to it. It is not for the court to rescue OPAL from strategic decisions which, with the benefit of hindsight, may have proven to be disastrous.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on breach of natural justice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 I reject OPAL’s arguments that there was any breach of natural justice in this case or that it had been prejudiced by any such breach on the part of the Tribunal. This disposes of the second string to OPAL’s bow in this application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Waiver by election / approbation and reprobation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Given that I have rejected all of OPAL’s grounds of objection, it is unnecessary for me to consider Daelim’s arguments that OPAL is in any event precluded from raising these objections either because the doctrine of approbation and reprobation applies, or by reason of waiver by election on OPAL’s part. It suffices to say that based on the material before me, it appears that there has been some inconsistency in the positions taken by <span class="font-italic">both</span> OPAL and Daelim over the course of the arbitration and in these proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 For the reasons detailed in this judgment, the claimant’s application is dismissed.
