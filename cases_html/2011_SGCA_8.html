        Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       These are two related appeals filed by the
                    Husband, Yeo Chong Lin, and Wife, Nancy Tay Ah Choo, respectively, against the
                    decision of a judge of the High Court (“the Judge”) relating to
                    the division of matrimonial assets following an interim judgment
                        (“<em>decree nisi</em>”) granted by the
                    Family Court. The Judge granted 35% of the matrimonial assets to the Wife and
                    65% to the Husband. CA 81 of 2010 is filed by the Husband and CA 82 of 2010, the
                    Wife. Both parties are dissatisfied with various aspects of the Judge’s
                    decision. The decision of the Judge may be found at [2010] SGHC 126
                    (“GD”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The marriage of the parties is among the longest
                    to come before the courts in recent years. It was a 49 year marriage. The
                    parties were married in 1956. The Husband was the breadwinner and the Wife was a
                    full-time homemaker throughout the entire marriage. In April 2005, the Wife
                    petitioned for divorce on the ground of adultery. A <em>decree
                        nisi</em> was granted in July 2005.There are four children from the
                    marriage and they are all grown-up, the youngest having been born in 1967. At
                    the time the <em>decree nisi</em> was granted, the Husband
                    was aged 73 and the Wife 71. An exceptional feature of this case is that the
                    matrimonial assets are huge, estimated by the Judge to be in the region of about
                    S$116,560,000. It was not disputed that the accumulation of this large amount of
                    wealth was due largely to the efforts, business sense and acumen of the Husband,
                    who came from a rather poor background. In the words of the Judge, “[d]ue
                    to the Husband’s unceasing and tireless efforts, he was able to build up
                    an extremely profitable and diverse business in the marine industry” (GD
                    at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>). His assets included a substantial
                    shareholding (held through his company, Yeo Holding Pte Ltd
                    (“YHPL”)) in a publicly listed company, Swissco International
                    Limited (“SIL”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The shares in YHPL which are held by the Husband
                    constitute a large proportion of the matrimonial assets. As at 30 May 2006, the
                    Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) records
                    showed that the shares in YHPL were held by the following members of the
                    family:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>Husband - 5,592,298 shares;</p>
<p class="Judg-2">Two daughters,
                        Catherine Yeo Lee Twan (“Catherine”) and Margaret Yeo Lee
                        Hiang (“Margaret”) - 1,516,556 shares (758,278 shares each);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2">Son, Alex Yeo Kian Teong (“Alex”) –
                        2,369,618 shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       As at 16 September 2009, ACRA records showed
                    that the shares in YHPL were held by the following persons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>Husband – 5,213,160 shares;</p>
<p class="Judg-2">Husband’s
                        brother, Yeo Chong Boon (“Yeo Chong Boon”) – 947,847
                        shares;</p>
<p class="Judg-2">Husband’s sister, Anna Yeoh Ai Tin (“Anna
                        Yeoh”) – 947,847 shares; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2">Son, Alex–
                        2,369,618 shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       After the Wife had filed for divorce, the
                    Husband acquired additional assets which he contends should not be regarded as
                    part of the matrimonial assets to be divided. These assets are the
                    following:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">property at 202A Lornie Road, which was purchased
                            in May 2005, and which was sold before the hearing of the ancillary
                            matters;</div>

                            2007 by YHPL.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">The Husband argues that these assets should not be regarded as
                    matrimonial assets because after the Wife left the matrimonial home, and in any
                    case after the divorce proceeding was filed, the marriage had effectively come
                    to an end. He contended that the cut-off date (“operative date”)
                    for determining matrimonial assets should be the date when the parties separated
                    or, at the latest, when the divorce proceeding was filed. This point, in turn,
                    raises the issue as to whether, under the Women’s Charter, there ought to
                    be an operative date for determining what assets would fall within the pool of
                    matrimonial assets for division and what that operative date should be. These
                    are issues which we will consider.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Other issues which also arise in these appeals
                    are:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">How the shares in YHPL given by the Husband to
                            the son and two daughters ought to be regarded; the Judge decided that
                            these shares should be regarded as belonging to the
                        Husband.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">How the jewellery given by the Husband to the
                            Wife during the marriage ought to be regarded; the Husband has alleged
                            that during the marriage he gave the Wife a considerable number of
                            jewellery items.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Whether the apportionment of matrimonial assets
                            at 35:65 in favour of the Husband is just and equitable.</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summons 3287/2010 – Husband’s application to adduce
                further Evidence on Appeal </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Before we examine the question of division of
                    matrimonial assets, we should first refer to Summons No 3287/2010/D (“SUM
                    3287”), filed by the Husband seeking leave to adduce fresh evidence by
                    affidavit for the purposes of the hearing of the two appeals. The fresh evidence
                    relates to the fact that their two daughters, Catherine and Margaret, have filed
                    High Court Suit No S373/2010/C (“S 373/2010”) on
                        21<sup>st</sup> May 2010 claiming beneficial ownership of
                    the 1,516,556 shares in YHPL (“Daughters’ Shares”) which the
                    Judge at GD [28] had held to belong to
                    the Husband and placed them in the pool as matrimonial assets to be divided. The
                    Daughters’ Shares are estimated to have a value of
                $14,512,086.03.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Husband averred that the further evidence
                    should be admitted as it relates directly to the heart of the matter in these
                    appeals – who possesses the beneficial ownership of the 1,516,556 shares.
                    Clearly, if the shares belong to the two daughters, they cannot be considered as
                    part of the matrimonial assets to be divided even though the Husband had claimed
                    at the hearing of the ancillary matters before the Judge that the beneficial
                    ownership to the shares vested in him (although they are registered under the
                    daughters’ names) because the daughters had not provided any consideration
                    for the same. The hearing of the ancillary matters was held on 16 to
                    17 September 2009 and the decision of the Judge was released 26 April
                    2010. The two daughters commenced S 373/2010 only in May 2010. As the documents
                    relating to S 373/2010 only came into being after the decision had been
                    rendered, they are, therefore, not subject to the requirements as set out in
                        <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> [1954] 1 WLR 1489
                        (“<em>Ladd v Marshall</em>”). Moreover,
                    even if <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> should apply, the facts in
                    this case would have satisfied the criteria for accepting fresh evidence on
                    appeal as laid down in that case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Wife initially disputed the admission of the
                    further evidence on the ground that the evidence related to a matter which had
                    already been brought to the attention of the Judge. She pointed to the fact that
                    on 16 September 2009, she found from an ACRA search that the daughters were
                    no longer listed as shareholders of YHPL and that their shares had been
                    transferred to the Husband’s sister, Anna Yeoh and the Husband’s
                    brother, Yeo Chong Boon. These facts were brought to the attention of the Judge
                    on 17 September 2009. On 22 September 2009, with the leave of court,
                    the daughters filed an affidavit to confirm that the shares were transferred
                    without their consent and that the daughters would be “taking up this
                    matter in due course to investigate”. This affidavit of the two daughters
                    was served on the Husband the next day. Accordingly, the Wife asserted that what
                    was sought to be admitted as fresh evidence was already brought to the
                    court’s attention before the decision was made by the Judge and that it
                    did not fulfil the conditions laid down in <em>Ladd v
                        Marshall</em>. We should add that while the two daughters’
                    shares in YHPL were purportedly transferred out without their consent, for the
                    purposes of these appeals, the shares will be treated as still being registered
                    under their names.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     It is true that the dispute between the
                    Husband and two daughters over the beneficial ownership of the Daughters’
                    Shares was already highlighted to the Judge and many of the documents filed as
                    evidence for the daughters’ High Court suit were already admitted in this
                    case. Moreover, at the hearing before the Judge, the daughters had also
                    indicated that they would challenge their father’s act in taking away
                    their legal and beneficial ownership in the Daughter’s Shares. Therefore,
                    in a sense, by instituting S 373/2010 nothing really new has happened, only that
                    the daughters have taken the matter one step further as they had earlier
                    indicated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     However, the fact of the matter is that the
                    filing of S 373/2010 was certainly an event which occurred after the judgment
                    was delivered. The documents filed in the writ would not have been documents
                    which the Husband could have produced to the Judge. It cannot be gainsaid that
                    the institution of this writ is directly relevant to the question as to whether
                    the Judge is correct to have treated the Daughters’ Shares as belonging to
                    the Husband and thus formed part of the matrimonial assets. Let us assume for a
                    moment that the decision of the Judge on this question is affirmed and let us
                    further assume that at the trial of S 373/2010 the court held that the
                    Daughters’ Shares belonged to them beneficially as gifts given by their
                    father and that their father was not entitled to take away their shares without
                    their consent. Where would that scenario leave the Husband? The Husband has
                    accused the daughters of aiding their mother (the Wife) in trying to have the
                    shares classified as matrimonial assets by only filing a lawsuit after the
                    decision was released when they could have filed the writ in the four-year
                    period when the ancillary matters were pending. Without going into the merits of
                    this accusation made against the daughters, what we see is that the Husband now
                    faces a real prospect of a lose-lose situation. We note that while the daughters
                    did not realise that their father had removed their names as owners of those
                    shares until the day of the hearing of the ancillary matters, <em>ie</em>, 16 September 2009, it seems to us that if their stand
                    had been that the shares in any event belonged to them beneficially then they
                    should have made their position definite and clear to their parents ahead of
                    time so that they would not need to argue unnecessarily over those shares. To
                    bring the action only after the Judge had ruled that the Daughters’ Shares
                    constituted part of the matrimonial assets to be distributed between their
                    parents would be to inflict a double whammy upon their father, the Husband.
                    Having said that, obviously nothing is certain until the disposal of S 373/2010,
                    as the mere filing of the suit does not mean that the daughters will succeed in
                    their claim. They alleged that the shares were given to them in consideration of
                    their years of service working for their father’s companies as well as in
                    lieu of bonuses they were entitled to. The Husband is defending the
                    daughters’ claim for the shares and if he should succeed in his defence,
                    it would still be correct to include the shares in the pool of matrimonial
                    assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Under s 37(2) of the Supreme Court
                    Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”),
                    this Court has “full discretionary power” to receive further
                    evidence on appeal. Under ss 37(3) and 37(4) of the SCJA, further evidence
                    “as to matters which have <em>occurred after the date of
                        the decision</em> from which the appeal is brought” (emphasis
                    added) are distinguished from matters which occurred before the date of decision
                    and does not need to satisfy the requirement of special grounds (<em>ie</em>, the conditions laid down in <em>Ladd
                        v Marshall</em>) to be admitted. These provisions are also reflected
                    in O 57 r 13(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5,
                    2006 Rev Ed). The fresh evidence which the Husband seeks to adduce
                    clearly relates to events which occurred after the decision of the Judge and
                    thus do not need to satisfy the requirement of special grounds. The fact that
                    the daughters’ claim to be entitled to those shares was a matter which was
                    brought to the attention of the Judge does not mean that S 373/2010, which was
                    instituted after the decision of the Judge, is not an event which occurred after
                    the decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Obviously while this Court has the general
                    discretion to allow a party to adduce fresh evidence, the principle of <em>finis litium</em> should not be lightly disregarded. In the
                    English House of Lord cases of <em>Mulholland v
                        Mitchell</em> [1971] AC 666 and <em>Murphy v
                        Stone-Wallwork (Charlton) Ltd</em> [1969] 1 WLR 1023, it was
                    held that no precise formulation should be laid down regarding the admission of
                    further evidence on matters that occurred after the decision. Clearly, further
                    evidence which will materially alter the basis of the decision should be
                    allowed. It stands to reason that the conditions governing the admission of
                    further evidence on matters that occurred after trial should not be more
                    restrictive than the special grounds laid down in <em>Ladd v
                        Marshall</em>. The second special ground enunciated in <em>Ladd v Marshall</em> only requires the further evidence to
                    have an important influence on the outcome of the appeal, but it need not be
                    determinative. Therefore, perhaps, the test should be: would the further
                    evidence have a <em>perceptible impact</em> on the decision
                    such that it is in the interest of justice that it should be
                admitted?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In this case, the further evidence which was
                    sought to be admitted by the Husband clearly goes to the heart of the decision,
                    and could alter the basis of the decision regarding the matrimonial assets. If
                    the outcome of S 373/2010 is that the beneficial ownership of the
                    Daughters’ Shares belongs to the daughters and not the Husband, then they
                    should not form part of the pool of matrimonial assets for division. We should,
                    at this juncture, place on record that at the commencement of the hearing by
                    this court of SUM 3287, the Wife quite rightly recanted and withdrew her
                    objection to the admission of the fresh evidence for the purposes of the hearing
                    of the appeal. Accordingly, we granted the application made in SUM
                3287.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The operative date for division of matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Section 112(10)(b) of the Women’s
                    Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Charter”)
                    defines a “matrimonial asset” as “any ... asset of any
                    nature acquired during the marriage by one party or both parties to the
                    marriage”. In the present case, given the long lapse of some four years
                    between the date of the <em>decree nisi</em> and the
                    hearing of the ancillary matters, the question of the operative date for
                    determining the matrimonial assets becomes of importance. As stated in <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above, some assets were bought by the Husband
                    after the <em>decree nisi</em> had been granted and the
                    Wife has contended that those assets should still be treated as matrimonial
                    assets. The Wife alleged that the delay was due to the Husband’s
                    persistent refusal to make full and frank disclosure and his constant change of
                    solicitors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Judge, having considered <em>Yap Hwee May Kathryn v Geh Thien Ee Martin and another</em>
                    [2007] 3 SLR(R) 663 (“<em>Yap Hwee May
                        Kathryn”</em>) and <em>Lim Ngeok Yuen v Lim Soon
                        Heng Victor</em> [2006] SGHC 83, held that the operative
                    date for the purposes of determining matrimonial assets should be the date on
                    which the <em>decree nisi</em> was issued (see GD [33]). In this case, the Judge held that the
                    operative date would be July 2005, when the <em>decree
                        nisi</em> was granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Husband submits that, in any event, it
                    would only be just that at the very latest, the operative date should be the
                    date on which the divorce petition was filed, <em>ie</em>,
                        20<sup>th</sup> April 2005. His basic reasoning is that once
                    a spouse has decided to leave the matrimonial home or file a Petition for
                    divorce (whichever shall be the earlier), the marriage has effectively ended and
                    the moral or emotional support which the spouses have for each other would also
                    have ceased and it would be unjust for the party who wanted to end the marriage
                    to demand, as of right, any asset which the other party accumulates
                    thereafter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Wife submits that the starting point is
                    that all assets, whether acquired during the course of marriage or after the
                    breakdown of the marriage, fall within the pool of matrimonial assets. The date
                    of the <em>decree nisi</em> should not be taken as the
                    operative date. The Wife, while recognising that some authorities were against
                    her, effectively contended that until the <em>decree
                        absolute</em> is made, the “marriage” still exists in
                    law and any assets acquired by any party until then should be regarded as
                    matrimonial assets. In this regard, the Wife relies on the decision of this
                    Court in <em>Yeo Gim Tong Michael v Tianzon Lolita</em>
                    [1996] 1 SLR(R) 633 (“<em>Tianzon</em>”) for the proposition that assets acquired by a
                    spouse after the breakdown of the marriage should still be included as
                    matrimonial assets. While <em>Tianzon</em> was a case
                    decided under the previous version of the Charter, the phrase in question,
                    “during the marriage”, was also present in that earlier version.
                    This Court in interpreting the phrase “during the marriage” in the
                    previous Section 106 (1) and (3) of the Women’s Charter (which is similar
                    to the present s120(10)(b)) held that the marriage “is only dissolved
                    when the <em>decree nisi is made absolute</em>”
                    (emphasis added). In this regard, we note that the High Court in <em>Leong Mei Chuan v David Chan Teck Hock</em>
                    [2001] SGHC 80 (“<em>Leong Mei
                    Chuan</em>”) applied <em>Tianzon</em> to the
                    current s 112 of the Charter and held that the meaning accorded to the
                    phrase “during the marriage” in <em>Tianzon</em> would similarly apply to the same phrase in the present
                    s 112(10)(b). The court there held that the fact that the husband was
                    allotted shares after the breakdown of the marriage was a factor to determine
                    the Wife’s entitlement to them. Although the court in <em>Leong Mei Chuan</em> held that even shares vested after the breakdown
                    of the marriage were matrimonial assets, the wife in fact restricted her claims
                    to shares vested in the husband up to the date of the <em>decree
                        nisi</em>. What is clear from <em>Leong Mei
                        Chuan</em> is that under s 112 of the Charter, assets acquired by
                    a party after the breakdown of marriage should still be regarded as matrimonial
                    assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     There are a number of ways one can look at the
                    phrase “during the marriage”. First, one could say that until a
                    marriage is dissolved finally by a <em>decree
                    absolute</em>, the marriage still subsists in law and therefore anything
                    obtained by a spouse before then should be regarded as an asset acquired during
                    the marriage. The second is to regard the grant of the <em>decree
                        nisi</em> as effectively the end of the marriage and any assets
                    acquired thereafter should not be treated as having anything to do with the
                    marriage. The third is to treat the marriage as having ended even earlier when
                    the marriage has irretrievably broken down, and the parties have stayed apart
                    and gone their separate ways, as the Husband contends here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In the recent case of <em>AJR v
                        AJS</em> [2010] 4 SLR 617 (“<em>AJR</em>”), the High Court had the occasion again to consider
                    the question of the operative date and decided in favour of the date of the
                        <em>decree nisi</em>. The judge there reasoned that the
                        <em>decree nisi</em> effectively put an end to the
                    marriage and that event indicated that the parties “no longer intend to
                    participate in the joint accumulation of matrimonial assets nor in any further
                    joint investment in any matrimonial assets with the associated market risk of a
                    fall in the value of those joint investments”, unless a contrary
                    intention was demonstrated by them (<em>AJR</em> at
                        [4]). In coming to that view, the
                    judge in <em>AJR</em> noted what this Court stated in
                        <em>Sivakolunthu Kumarasamy v Shanmugam Nagaiah and
                        Anor</em> [1987] SLR(R) 702 (“<em>Sivakolunthu</em>”) at [25]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The grant of a decree <em>nisi</em> is a recognition
                        by the “court that the marriage is at an end”. When such a
                        decree is pronounced, there is, as Lord Wright said [in <em>Fender v St John-Mildmay</em> [1938] AC 1 at 45-6], no
                        longer any matrimonial home, no <em>consortium
                            vitae</em> and no right on either side to conjugal rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Returning to <em>Yap Hwee May
                        Kathryn</em>, we note that the judge there reasoned that adopting the
                    date of the <em>decree nisi</em> as the operative date is
                    more appropriate than that of the date of the <em>decree
                        absolute</em> because (i) if all the relevant facts were before the
                    court at the grant of the <em>decree nisi</em>, there would
                    have been no reason why the division of the matrimonial assets could not or
                    should not have been decided at that point in time, and (ii) the date of the
                        <em>decree absolute</em> could not have been
                    ascertained at the time of division of matrimonial assets since the <em>decree absolute</em> would only be granted after the
                    ancillary matters had been settled. Adopting the <em>decree
                        absolute</em> date as the operative date would clearly cause
                    unnecessary uncertainty as it would necessarily be a date in the future. As
                    such, such an operative date would be impracticable. In the nature of things,
                    the latest operative date would have to be the date of the hearing. Even on this
                    basis, we need to make one clarification. For example, if on that day it is
                    known that a spouse is likely in the future to receive an employment benefit due
                    to his past services, it does not follow that the court may not take that into
                    account in its division.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Positions in some other common law jurisdictions regarding operative
                date </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Counsel for the parties had, at our request,
                    done some further research into the law and/or practice in other common law
                    jurisdictions on the question of the operative date for the division of
                    matrimonial assets. The positions in Malaysia, England, Hong Kong, Scotland,
                    Australia, New Zealand and Canada were explored.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In Malaysia, the Law Reform Marriage and
                    Divorce Act 1976 provides in s 76(1) that the court has the power, when
                    granting a decree of divorce, to order the division between the parties of
                    “any assets acquired by them during the marriage”, a set of
                    wording very similar to ours. In <em>Chew Ling Hang v Aw Ngiong
                        Hwa</em> [1997] 3 MLJ 107 at 113, the Malaysian court held
                    that a party seeking the division of matrimonial assets must make the
                    application “before the decree nisi or at least before it was made
                    absolute”. This would appear to suggest that the relevant date in
                    Malaysia could not be the time when the <em>decree
                        nisi</em> is made absolute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In England, under s 24(1) of the
                    Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, orders for property division may be made upon the
                    grant of a decree of divorce, nullity of marriage or judicial separation as well
                    as even after a decree of divorce or nullity of marriage is made absolute. Leave
                    of court is required to apply for ancillary relief post-<em>decree absolute</em>. It does not appear that in England the date of
                    separation is the necessary operative date. There is a suggestion that the date
                    the court exercises the power to apportion assets would be a “natural
                    date” – see <em>Cowan v Cowan</em>
                    [2001] EWCA 679 at [132]. Invariably, the circumstances of the case
                    will determine the approach the court would take to reach a just
                result.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In Hong Kong, the assets of the spouses which
                    can be divided upon divorce are the same as those in England. They encompass
                    property and other financial resources which each spouse “has or is
                    likely to have in the foreseeable future”: s 7 of the Matrimonial
                    Proceedings and Property Ordinance. Thus, even property acquired by a party
                    before marriage will be put in the pool. The court will determine the assets
                    (and their values) to be taken into account as at the date of hearing. We should
                    add that even though assets acquired by one spouse before marriage, as well as
                    gifts, (which are classified as non-matrimonial) may be taken into account by
                    the court, the discretion rests with the court as to whether they should be
                    shared and in what proportion. It would seem that “the longer the
                    marriage the more likely non-matrimonial property will become merged or
                    entangled with matrimonial property” and where the marriage is short
                    “non-matrimonial assets are not likely to be shared unless needs require
                    this”: see <em>KMD v PIB</em>
                    [2010] HKFamC 14 (“<em>KMD</em>”).
                    Assets acquired post-separation may or may not qualify as
                    “non-matrimonial” property. Fairness will be the order of the
                    day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In Australia, by s 79(1) of the Family
                    Law Act 1975, the court is mandated to “make such orders as it considers
                    appropriate”. The position in Australia is similar to that in England and
                    Hong Kong as all assets owned by the parties at trial are under the purview of
                    the Court for equitable distribution. While England and Hong Kong have no
                    statutory definition for matrimonial assets to limit the assets under the
                    Courts’ purview, Australia has a statutory definition for matrimonial
                    assets. Under s 4 of Family Law Act 1975, “property” in
                    relation to parties to a marriage means “property to which those parties
                    are, or that party is, as the case may be, entitled, whether in possession or
                    reversion”. It is a broad definition that leaves all assets owned by the
                    parties under the Court’s purview as, unlike ours, it does not seek to
                    carve out non-matrimonial property. It seems to us that the Family Law Act 1975
                    leaves it entirely open as to where the line should be drawn or what property of
                    either spouse should be brought into the pool for division, leaving it to the
                    court to decide in the light of the circumstances of each case what would be an
                    appropriate order to make to achieve a just result: see <em>Scott
                        v Scott</em> [2006] FamCA 1379 at [113].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In Scotland, the operative date is statutorily
                    provided. Under s 10(4) of Family Law (Scotland) Act 1985, “the
                    matrimonial property” is defined as “all the property belonging to
                    the parties or either of them at the relevant date”. The “relevant
                    date” is defined under s 10(3) of Family Law (Scotland) Act 1985 to
                    mean whichever date is earlier (a) the date which the parties ceased to cohabit
                    or (b) date of service of the summons in the action for divorce.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In New Zealand, the operative date is also
                    statutorily provided. The general operative date is the date of separation.
                    Under s 9(4) of the Property (Relationships) Act 1976, the parties’
                    assets are treated as “separate property” (non-matrimonial assets
                    in our context) if they are acquired “while they are not living together
                    as husband and wife”. However, s 8 of the New Zealand statute
                    singles out the “family home” and “family chattels”
                    as unique matrimonial assets that will be relationship property “whenever
                    acquired”. Thus, such properties in New Zealand have no operative
                    date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In Canada, the provinces do not appear to have
                    taken a uniform approach. In British Columbia’s Family Relations Act and
                    Yukon’s Family Property and Support Act (RSY 2002), matrimonial property
                    is identified on the basis of whether the property was “ordinarily used
                    for a family purpose”. In the other provinces, generally they have
                    classes of property that are excluded from the pool of assets subject to
                    distribution. In Ontario, the operative date is likely to be the same as the
                    valuation date. By virtue of s 4(1) of Ontario’s Family Law Act 1990,
                    property for division is usually valued as at the date of separation, and
                    presumably that would also be the cut-off date, but the court is not precluded
                    from adopting a later date if the circumstances warrant it and the eventual
                    outcome will be equitable: see <em>Tran v Ma</em>
                    (2007) NWTSC 33.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In Alberta, there is no clear operative date
                    as under s 7 (3)(c) of the Matrimonial Property Act (RSA 2000), property
                    acquired after a <em>decree nisi</em> is liable to be
                    distributed. Under s 7(2) of the Matrimonial Property Act (RSA 2000), in
                    respect of a property acquired before marriage, the market value of the property
                    at the time of marriage is exempted from distribution. Similarly for gifts
                    received during marriage, the market value of the gift at the time thereof will
                    be exempted. What is of interest to note is that under s 7(3) the court is
                    required to distribute matrimonial property in a manner that it considers
                    “just and equitable”. Further, under s 8(f), one of the
                    factors which the court has to take into account in making distribution is
                    “whether the property was acquired when the spouses were living separate
                    and apart”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     What this review of the law and practice in
                    some common law jurisdictions shows is that there is no uniformity of approach.
                    It seems to this court that there is no one single formula or test which is
                    adopted generally. What is clear is that in every jurisdiction, in its own way,
                    the court seeks to achieve a just result.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Should there be an operative date for division of matrimonial assets
                in Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     It seems to us that Parliament has very aptly
                    recognised that it would not be wise to lay down a fixed date for the purposes
                    of determining what assets would fall within the pool of matrimonial assets and
                    what would not. A fixed cut-off date may not necessarily secure a just result in
                    every case. The simple truth is that the circumstances under which an asset
                    could be acquired by a spouse are so varied that it would be best to leave it to
                    the court to determine where the line should be drawn after taking into account
                    all the circumstances. It may be useful to illustrate the problems through
                    several examples.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Take a case like the present, where the
                    husband buys a property jointly with his new companion after the <em>decree nisi</em>. Clearly, they are planning for their
                    future. It would be wholly unreal to treat this property as a matrimonial asset
                    when that would be the last thing on their mind. It seems to us that there could
                    be two reasons why a spouse seeks to contend that such a property is
                    nevertheless matrimonial property. First, there is the belief that if such a
                    property is not regarded as a matrimonial property, it would be all too easy for
                    a spouse to reduce the matrimonial assets to be divided by merely buying a
                    property after the <em>decree nisi</em> is granted. In our
                    opinion, this belief overlooks one fact. The funds which that spouse has used to
                    buy the property do not cease to be matrimonial assets and it must be put back,
                    at least notionally, for the purposes of division so that the other spouse would
                    not lose out. By so restoring the funds into the pool, fairness is achieved.
                    Second, it is assumed that the value of property will always go up. What if it
                    goes down? There were instances in the past when property prices dipped. Why
                    should the spouse who has nothing to do with the purchase bear the loss? The
                    possible downside to a property purchase is often overlooked.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Next, let us take a variant of the same
                    example. Let us say that the property was not bought after the <em>decree nisi</em> but before the grant of that decree. How
                    should the property be viewed? The answer can hardly be a straightforward one.
                    Admittedly, the same arguments can be made to say that the property should not
                    be regarded as a matrimonial asset. All the circumstances would have to be
                    considered before a final decision is taken.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Again, let us say that the asset bought is not
                    a real property but shares in a company (whether listed or otherwise). Because
                    of the inherent volatility of share values, an even stronger case can be made
                    that the purchasing spouse should bear the risk relating to the purchase,
                    subject always to that spouse restoring to the common pool the funds he had
                    taken to make the purchase of the shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     It seems to us that practicality would suggest
                    that there should be an operative date. However, the problem is in determining
                    what that operative date should be, bearing in mind the possible diverse assets,
                    and the different circumstances under which they were acquired. Indeed, it does
                    not follow that there can only be one operative date. Multiple dates are
                    distinctly possible, depending on the nature of the assets and the circumstances
                    surrounding their acquisition. Ultimately, perhaps the adoption of an operative
                    date or dates may not really be that critical as compared to arriving at a just
                    and equitable division.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">What should be the operative date in this case?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In his submission to us, the Husband avers
                    that in the context of the Charter, the operative date for the division of
                    matrimonial assets should be the date of filing of the divorce petition because
                    there would be certainty as to that date. In his contention, any later date
                    would be unjust because following the filing of the petition, the spouses would
                    have nothing to do with each other and the marriage would have effectively ended
                    save for the formal dissolution. Earlier, the husband took the position that it
                    should be the date the parties separated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     On the other hand, the Wife submits that even
                    assets acquired by one party after the breakdown of the marriage should fall
                    within the pool of matrimonial assets. If there needs to be a cut-off date, it
                    should be the date of the final hearing, <em>ie</em>,
                    hearing of the ancillary matters after the <em>decree
                        nisi</em>. She argues that adopting the date of the hearing as the
                    cut-off date would produce the fairest result.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In our opinion, Parliament obviously
                    appreciated that it would be unwise, and difficulties could arise, if a definite
                    cut-off date is prescribed. Any prescribed adherence to a timeline may not
                    necessarily be conducive towards attaining a just and equitable outcome.
                    Moreover, as indicated earlier at <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a>, even
                    in a case where a court is inclined to adopt a particular point in time as the
                    cut-off date for dividing the matrimonial assets, it does not follow that that
                    date should necessarily apply across the board to all categories of assets which
                    the court is expected to divide. Speaking broadly, and as indicated at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>, there are possibly four timelines which a
                    court could conceivably adopt. The first is the date of separation. The second
                    is the date on which the petition of divorce is filed. The third is the date on
                    which a <em>decree nisi</em> is granted. The fourth is the
                    date of hearing of ancillary matters (including the date of the hearing of an
                    appeal). As stated in <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>, we have ruled
                    out the date of the grant of the <em>decree absolute</em>
                    as an option because it is a date in the future and cannot realistically be
                    applied. Of the four possible cut-off dates, it seems to us that generally
                    speaking it would be sensible to apply either the date of the <em>decree nisi</em> or the date of the hearing of the ancillary matters.
                    Much would depend on the fact-situation. As indicated at <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a>, there is nothing to preclude the court from
                    applying different cut-off dates to different categories of assets if the
                    circumstances so warrant. The argument that it is wholly unreal to treat assets
                    acquired after the <em>decree nisi</em> as
                    “matrimonial assets”, when the marriage contract has for all
                    practical purposes come to an end and there is no longer any marriage, is not
                    without merit, subject always to the proviso that the spouse who made the
                    purchase should restore to the common pool whatever money he had taken to fund
                    the purchase. Once an asset is regarded as a matrimonial asset to be divided,
                    then for the purposes of determining its value, it must be assessed as at the
                    date of the hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Reverting to the present case, we do not think
                    that the Judge was wrong to have held that the operative date should be the date
                    on which the <em>decree nisi</em> was granted. The adoption
                    of this operative date would not bring about an unjust result. Between the date
                    of the <em>decree nisi</em> and the determination of the
                    ancillary matters, there was a lapse of some four long years. The spouse
                    undertaking any new investment should be made to bear the consequences of his or
                    her act provided that he or she restores to the common pool the funds which
                    he/she had used to acquire the new asset. But this is where the difficulty lies
                    as far as the present case is concerned. The Husband has not disclosed clearly
                    in respect of the assets acquired after the filing of the divorce petition how
                    much funds he had taken out from his savings to acquire each of these assets so
                    that the same may be restored to the common pool. Given the adverse inferences
                    that might be drawn in these circumstances, we think it would be best to deal
                    with this group of assets in connection with the Husband’s failure to make
                    full and frank disclosure (see <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a>
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Shares in YHPL given by the Husband to the son and two
                daughters</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     We have earlier referred to the
                    Daughters’ Shares which are very much in dispute (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above). The position taken by the Husband
                    before the Judge was that the Daughters’ Shares were shares which the
                    daughters held on trust for him because they have yet to provide any
                    consideration for the same. Interestingly, the Husband has not made a similar
                    assertion in respect of the shares which were transferred to the son Alex
                    (“Alex’s Shares”). The Judge not only held that the Husband
                    was the beneficial owner of the Daughters’ Shares but also held that the
                    Husband was the beneficial owner of Alex’s Shares. Alex’s 2,369,618
                    shares in YHPL were valued at <b>$22,675,127.24</b>. The
                    Judge’s reasoning was that the position of Alex’s Shares was
                    analogous to that of the Daughters’ Shares. She said at [28] of the GD: “There is no direct
                    evidence as to how the husband regards the shares in his son’s name but it
                    is probable that he has a similar attitude to them and that as far as he is
                    concerned, the son holds the shares at the husband’s pleasure”. The
                    approach taken by the Judge seems to be that since there was evidence that the
                    Husband regarded himself as the beneficial owner of the Daughters’ Shares
                    it was logical to conclude that he would treat Alex’s Shares in the same
                    way as the circumstances surrounding the transfer of the shares to the son were
                    no different from those relating to the transfer of the Daughters’ Shares
                    to the daughters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     It is settled law that an appellate court
                    should defer to the trial judge’s finding of fact unless it can be
                    established that the finding of fact is plainly wrong or unjustified on the
                    totality of the evidence before the trial judge (<em>Peh Eng Leng
                        v Pek Eng Leong</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 939). However, the
                    appellate court would be in as good a position as the trial judge to make
                    finding of facts when it is not based on the veracity and credibility of the
                    witness (as in this case where the evidence was adduced in affidavits) but on an
                    inference drawn from the facts or the evaluation of primary facts (see <em>Tat Seng Machine Movers Pte Ltd v Orix Leasing Singapore
                        Ltd</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 1101 at [41] <em>)</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     As stated in <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> above, the Judge’s finding as regards Alex’s
                    Shares was based on a simple deduction from her finding as regards the
                    Daughters’ Shares. On the evidence before the court, we could not help but
                    believe that the Husband made the assertion that the daughters held their shares
                    on trust for him because he took umbrage with the fact that the daughters,
                    instead of taking a neutral stance, sided with their mother (the Wife) in the
                    current matrimonial dispute between the parties. However, the fact of the matter
                    is that the questions regarding the beneficial ownership of the Daughters’
                    Shares were never fully explored. The daughters did not intervene in the
                    proceedings. Neither did they file any affidavit in response to their
                    father’s (the Husband’s) claims that the daughters were bare
                    trustees of those shares. The question of the transfer of the shares to the
                    daughters could very well be regarded as gifts, where the presumption of
                    advancement would apply, and that was not addressed by the Judge. What is more
                    significant is that, as stated before, shortly after the Judge had given her
                    verdict, the daughters took out S 373/2010 claiming beneficial ownership of the
                    Daughters’ Shares. Now that the Husband is facing a distinct prospect that
                    the court in S 373/2010 could declare that the 1,516,556 shares belong to the
                    daughters, it would be wholly inequitable to require the Husband to share
                    something as a matrimonial asset when the very thing could very well be held not
                    to belong to him (if the court were to hold in S 373/2010 that the
                    Daughters’ Shares were given by the Husband to the daughters as
                    gifts).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Admittedly, some aspects of the
                    Husband’s conduct pertaining to the shares in YHPL left much to be
                    desired. He had in November 2004 forged the Wife’s signature on a share
                    transfer form to transfer 1,885,996 shares in YHPL which were registered in the
                    Wife’s name to himself and allegedly a daughter (in respect of 195,273
                    shares - however, it is not clear to whom these shares in fact went). He had
                    also transferred the Daughters’ Shares (without their consent) to his
                    brother and a sister on the pretext that the latter were each entitled to
                    947,847 of the shares pursuant to two trust documents executed in November 2004.
                    The Husband first mentioned these trust documents only in July 2008. The Judge
                    did not accept this assertion and treated the shares transferred to the
                    Husband’s siblings as his. The Husband had also not been entirely
                    forthright in disclosing his assets so much so that the Judge drew an adverse
                    inference against him. Several injunctions had also been obtained against the
                    Husband to restrain him from dissipating matrimonial assets. For example, there
                    was a court order granted on 21 June 2005 to restrain the Husband in his
                    capacity as managing director and shareholder of YHPL from disposing the assets
                    of YHPL – namely, the matrimonial home at No. 14 Lornie Road. However, on
                    6 March 2006, the Husband called for an extraordinary general meeting
                    (“EGM”) of YHPL and passed a resolution approving the sale of No
                    14 Lornie Road. He was the sole attendee at the EGM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In view of the foregoing, the Judge found the
                    Husband to be someone who would manipulate the shareholdings of YHPL for his own
                    purposes and thus YHPL should be considered the Husband’s alter ego.
                    Relying on the observations of Munby J in <em>W v
                        H</em> [2001] 1 All ER 300 (“<em>W v
                        H”)</em>, where he opined that the Family Division was entitled
                    to pierce the corporate veil and hold a company to be an alter ego of the
                    husband even where there was insignificant minority interest, the Judge here
                    found that the Husband should be treated as the beneficial owner of the shares
                    in his children’s names (see GD at [29]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     With respect, we have some reservations as to
                    whether it would be appropriate to apply the views expressed in <em>W v H</em> to the circumstances of the present case. In
                        <em>W v H</em>, as the company was the alter ego of the
                    husband, the court was able to pierce the corporate veil to regard a property
                    owned by the company as belonging to the husband for the purposes of granting an
                    interlocutory relief in order to preserve the status quo. <em>W v
                        H</em> did not decide the ownership of shares, as the wife there was
                    only asking for an injunctive relief to stop the Company and a third party (to
                    whom the husband had transferred his shares in the company) from disposing of
                    the matrimonial property before its true ownership could be decided in the
                    ancillary proceedings between the wife and the husband. For the purposes of the
                    injunctive relief, the property owned by the company was treated as having been
                    vested in the husband, but it did not mean the property owned by the company
                    therefore actually belonged to the husband. The observation on piercing the
                    corporate veil was to justify the grant of the interlocutory relief without
                    requiring the company to be joined as a party. Here we are dealing with shares
                    in YHPL which the Husband had already transferred to his son Alex and the two
                    daughters and the question which is now in issue is whether those shares were
                    intended as gifts to the children or whether the children are just bare
                    trustees. We do not see how the principle of piercing the corporate veil arises
                    or is relevant here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Returning to the issue of the Daughters’
                    Shares, the status of those shares would have to await the outcome of S
                    373/2010. As for Alex’s Shares, the outcome of the daughters’ suit
                    should not affect Alex’s shares since rebutting the presumption of
                    advancement for the daughters does not equate to rebutting the presumption of
                    advancement for Alex. Although the Husband claims that he gave shares to his
                    family members as the Company Act did not allow him to be the sole shareholder,
                    that claim <em>per se</em> may not necessarily suffice to
                    rebut the presumption of advancement to the son. Furthermore, the Judge erred in
                    treating the Daughters’ shares and Alex’s shares analogously since
                    it was clear from the facts that the Husband treated the daughters and Alex
                    differently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The facts suggest that the shares were given
                    by the Father not just as gifts to his children but as recognition of their
                    contributions in his companies because no shares were ever given to his oldest
                    son who did not work for his companies. Alex had played a very different role as
                    compared to the daughters in YHPL and SIL. Alex is the current Chief Executive
                    Officer of SIL and occupies a more senior managerial role than the
                    daughters’ previous clerical positions. The daughters also recognised in
                    their affidavits filed for Suit 371/2010 that the Father had treated Alex as his
                    future successor in SIL. As Alex and the daughters clearly hold their shares in
                    different capacities, the Judge should not have automatically applied the
                    reasoning for the Daughters’ shares to Alex. Presently, neither the
                    Husband nor Alex disputes that Alex is the beneficial owner of his shares and
                    thus Alex’s shares should be excluded from the pool of matrimonial
                    assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Shares in YHPL given to the Wife</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     As mentioned in <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> above, the Husband forged the signature of the Wife in
                    transferring the 1,885,966 shares in YHPL held in the Wife’s name back to
                    himself and allegedly a daughter (in respect of 195,273 shares). It is not clear
                    to whom the 195,273 shares had actually gone. But that is hardly important. In
                    any case, for the purposes of the division of matrimonial assets, it would make
                    no difference whether those shares are held in the name of the Wife or the
                    Husband or his nominee. They will remain as matrimonial assets to be divided
                    between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Thus, excluding Alex’s Shares and the
                    Daughters’ Shares, the undisputed total shareholding which the Husband
                    holds in YHPL amounts to 5,787,570 shares, consisting of 3,901,604 shares in the
                    Husband’s name plus the 1,885,966 shares taken from the Wife. This
                    constituted 61% of the total shareholding in YHPL (the total shares issued in
                    respect of YHPL being 9,478,472).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Wife’s jewellery is part of the Matrimonial
                Assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The next issue which we need to address is the
                    Husband’s claim that the Wife’s jewellery should be included in the
                    pool of matrimonial assets. The Wife had not given details of her jewellery
                    collection in her affidavits and the Husband submits that an adverse inference
                    should be drawn against her under Section 116(g) of the Evidence Act. In
                        <em>Tianzon</em>, this Court said (at [13]) that it saw “no reason why gifts
                    of substantial value such as a motor car, landed property and investments, which
                    were acquired by one spouse during the marriage and given to the other”
                    should not be considered matrimonial assets. However, “for practical
                    purposes, minor items of gift such as dresses and even jewellery of no
                    substantial value, are normally considered <em>de
                        minimis</em> and are not taken into account” (<em>Tianzon</em> at [13]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The Judge believed the Wife, who had generally
                    made full and frank disclosure of her assets, that her jewellery collection was
                    not of substantial value. The Husband gave no evidence to substantiate his claim
                    that the Wife’s jewellery collection was valuable, and since he was the
                    one who gave the jewellery to the Wife, it does not seem unreasonable for him
                    to, at least, give some evidence on the individual jewellery pieces which the
                    Wife owned or an estimate of their value. The Judge exercised her discretion and
                    excluded the jewellery from being taken into account because in her view,
                    relative to the matrimonial assets as a whole, “even if the jewellery was
                    worth something in the range of a quarter million to half a million
                    dollars” this would not add a substantial value to the pool of
                    matrimonial assets (GD at [48]). We are
                    not minded to disturb this exercise of discretion by the Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The total matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The Judge at [46]-[47] of the GD held
                    that the Husband’s matrimonial assets totalled <b>$</b>111,429,816. This was rounded up to $111.5m. Both the Husband
                    and Wife are in agreement that the Judge’s calculation of $111,429,816 had
                    an arithmetic error and this was probably due to the double-counting of the
                    amount of $524,970 for the 614,000 shares in SIL (see table at <a href="#p1_62">[62]</a> below). In the subsequent paragraphs, we will
                    also be addressing some other errors of computation.</p>

                    and (e) in the table above, are assets beneficially owned by him. However, as
                    regards the other items, it seems to us that there is double counting. Those
                    sums of money belong to YHPL. The approach taken by the Judge seems to be that
                    as she regarded the Husband as the effective owner of all the shares of YHPL,
                    she treated the moneys listed under items (a),(b),(c) and (f) as belonging to
                    the Husband. Quite apart from the question as to whether in circumstances like
                    the present, where there is no allegation that YHPL was a sham entity or was
                    just a device (see <em>Win Line (UK) Ltd v Masterpart (Singapore)
                        Pte Ltd and another</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 24) it is proper to
                    pierce the corporate veil to treat these sums of money of YHPL as belonging to
                    the Husband, it would be quite unfair in the fact-situation here to so regard
                    those moneys. This is because since those sums were taken into account in
                    determining the worth and value of YHPL, to have them regarded as the assets of
                    the Husband would necessarily lead to double-counting. Therefore, only <b>$</b>2,102,505.84 (items (d) and (e) in the table above) of

                    of matrimonial assets to be divided.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Sale of 22.5 million shares that YHPL held in SIL</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Another instance of double-counting relates to
                    22.5 million shares in SIL which were held by YHPL and which the latter sold for
                    the sum of $6 million. The Judge, on the basis that the Husband owned all the
                    shares in YHPL, held that the $6 million belonged to the Husband. For the
                    reasons alluded to in <a href="#p1_55">[55]</a> above, the sale
                    proceeds of $6 million should not be treated as something belonging to the
                    Husband. As we have said, the valuation of the shares in YHPL would have
                    included this sum.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Assets the Husband argue should not be Matrimonial Assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     At <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a>
                    above, we upheld the Judge’s finding that the operative date in this case
                    was the date of the <em>decree nisi</em>. It must therefore
                    follow that the assets the Husband acquired after the date of the <em>decree nisi</em> were not matrimonial assets. However, as the
                    Husband has failed repeatedly to make full and frank disclosure of his assets
                    and to furnish evidence that the assets he acquired after the date of decree was
                    not funded from the common pool of matrimonial assets, an adverse inference that
                    these assets were acquired from funds from the common pool of matrimonial assets
                    will be made against him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     We now turn to the 614,000 SIL shares which
                    the Husband allegedly bought in April 2005, after the Wife left the matrimonial
                    home and which have a value of $524,970. There is no evidence as to the precise
                    date on which they were bought by the Husband. The Husband contends that as the
                    shares were acquired after the Wife had left the matrimonial home, they should
                    not be regarded as a matrimonial asset. For the reasons which are alluded to in
                        <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a>, this contention is clearly
                    untenable. By the Husband’s logic it would be all too simple for a spouse
                    to exclude assets which are part of the common pool for division by simply
                    making fresh purchases after the date of separation. As the Husband has not
                    indicated how much he had spent to pay for the shares, we are in no position to
                    restore what was taken by him from the common pool for that purpose and as the
                    Wife also wishes to treat the shares as matrimonial assets, it is only just the
                    court should do so. The Husband has not shown that the shares had been bought
                    with resources which he had independently amassed after the grant of the
                        <em>decree nisi</em>. Therefore, an adverse inference
                    will be drawn and the entire value of the 614,000 shares will be notionally
                    placed into the pool of matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The proceeds from the 202A Lornie Road
                    property will be included in the pool of matrimonial assets. It was acquired in
                    May 2005 before the date of the <em>decree nisi</em>.
                    However, the property at 6 Chestnut Close bought by YHPL will be excluded from
                    the pool of matrimonial assets as it would be double-counting. Unlike 202A
                    Lornie Road, for which the Husband subsequently asserted had been bought for him
                    by YHPL as a trustee, 6 Chestnut Close remains YHPL’s
                property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The property at 9 Wak Hassan Drive was bought
                    after the date of the <em>decree nisi</em> in November 2005
                    with the party cited. The Husband in his affidavit stated that he made a direct
                    financial contribution of $600,000 to its purchase. An adverse inference is
                    drawn because there is no evidence that this was independently amassed after the
                    grant of the <em>decree nisi</em> and $600,000 will be
                    notionally returned to the pool of matrimonial assets. Similarly, 74 Andrews
                    Terrace was bought after the date of the <em>decree
                        nisi</em> in August 2008 with the party cited. The Husband in his
                    affidavit stated that he made a direct financial contribution of about
                    $1,000,000 to its purchase. An adverse inference is also drawn because there is
                    no evidence that this was independently amassed after the date of the <em>decree nisi</em> and $1,000,000 will be notionally returned
                    to the pool of matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The Husband was granted in April 2009 an
                    option to subscribe for 500,000 shares in SIL. This was acquired four years
                    after the <em>decree nisi</em> and should not be regarded
                    as a matrimonial asset. It is also likely that this was given to the Husband for
                    the work he did after the date of the <em>decree nisi</em>
                    and therefore no adverse inference should be drawn. As regards the 800,000
                    shares in Roxy Pacific Holdings Ltd, the Husband has provided no evidence as to
                    when those shares were acquired. The company was listed in March 2008. While
                    these shares were likely acquired after the date of the <em>decree nisi</em>, the Husband provided no evidence as to what funds
                    he had used to acquire these shares and an adverse inference will be drawn to
                    place the value of these shares into the matrimonial pool. The cars bought on
                    hire-purchase in 2008 and 2009 are disregarded because of indications that they
                    are of negative value.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     If in S 373/2010 the Daughters’ Shares
                    are held to belong to the Husband, an additional $14,512,086.03 will be added to
                    the pool of matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Adverse Inferences</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Adverse Inference as to the Husband’s Undisclosed
                Assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The Judge found that the Husband had breached
                    his duty of making full and frank disclosure of his assets and attributed a
                    “further $11m or ten percent of the disclosed assets as being the value
                    of the husband’s undisclosed assets” (GD at [47]). The Judge took a broad brush approach
                    in adding 10% more as representing the Husband’s undisclosed assets. The
                    Judge seemed to be following the mode suggested by the High Court in <em>Lau Loon Seng</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 688, where it
                    was held that when quantifying “undisclosed assets”, the court
                    should make a finding of the value of the undisclosed assets on the available
                    evidence and it would be for the other party to prove that such a value is
                    unreasonable. This approach was reiterated in <em>Tay Sin Tor v
                        Tan Chay Eng</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 385 (“<em>Tay Sin Tor</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In <em>NK v NL</em>
                    [2007] 3 SLR(R) 743 (“<em>NK v
                        NL”)</em>, this court had the occasion to consider the approach
                    adopted in <em>Tay Sin Tor</em> and held that while that
                    approach was sound, it was but one of at least two alternatives. Much would
                    depend on the fact-situation of each case. This court also cautioned against
                    “unnecessary speculation” with regard to the specific values of
                    the undeclared assets (<em>NK v NL</em> at [61]). In <em>NK v
                        NL</em>, what was in contention was that the husband was not able to
                    account for the disappearance of some $2.7 million. Rather than adding a
                    specific sum into the matrimonial pool for division, this court held that in
                    those circumstances (the unaccountability of $2.7 million) it “might be
                    more just and equitable (not to mention, practical) to order a higher proportion
                    of the known assets to be given to the wife” (<em>NK v
                        NL</em> at [62]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In this connection, we would like to emphasise
                    one aspect where a party is regarded as not having made full and frank
                    disclosure of his or her assets. In the nature of things, whichever approach the
                    court adopts in such a situation, it is undoubtedly to a large extent
                    speculative; whether it decides to give a value to what it considers to be
                    “undisclosed assets” or to give a higher percentage of the
                    disclosed assets to the other party. Either approach would translate to giving
                    something more to the other spouse by way of a specific sum. The very fact that
                    the court is confronted with the problem of “undisclosed assets”
                    means that the position is unclear and far from certain. In the final analysis,
                    it is for the court to decide, in the light of the fact-situation of each case,
                    which approach would in its view best achieve an equitable and just result. What
                    must be clearly recognised is that when the court makes such a determination it
                    is not undertaking an exercise based on arithmetic but a judgmental exercise
                    based, in part at least, on feel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     To take 10% of the disclosed assets as being
                    the value of the Husband’s undisclosed assets could be said to be
                    arbitrary. In the present case, the arbitrariness of this approach is perhaps
                    illustrated when one considers that if some of the trial judge’s findings
                    on matrimonial assets are overturned (as happened here), the pool of disclosed
                    matrimonial assets would shrink and in turn the 10% representing the undisclosed
                    assets would similarly shrink. Of course, this is not to say that, in a like
                    scenario, taking the other approach of giving a higher percentage of the
                    matrimonial assets as determined by the Judge would not have had a similar
                    effect. If an appellate court were to remove some assets from the pool of
                    matrimonial assets, then the ultimate assets which the Wife would obtain by way
                    of the higher percentage would also be reduced. Thus, in each case the court
                    would have to decide on the facts which approach would best enable it to achieve
                    a just and equitable result. We would further add that in the present case,
                    there is one further complication which must be factored into the equation. Here
                    we are dealing with not only undisclosed assets but also with disclosed assets
                    in respect of which values are not disclosed. This is an aspect to which we will
                    now turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Husband’s disclosed assets with unknown values</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     It would be seen from the assets listed in the
                    table at [62] that a number of them have
                    unknown values: item (j), cars owned at date of the <em>decree
                        nisi</em>; item (k), a half share in 6 Shamah Terrace and item (l),
                    property in Gold Coast, Australia. The Judge did not attempt to give a value to
                    each of these items. Neither did she include these items in the final
                    computation of the total value of the matrimonial assets. Item (k) was in fact
                    sold and the profits given to charity, but the Husband did not give information
                    as to the price at which 6 Shamah Terrace was sold. In view of these omissions,
                    the Judge was within her rights to draw an adverse inference against the Husband
                    and to give a value to each of these items as she deemed
                reasonable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In <em>Koh Kim Lan Angela v
                        Choong Kian Haw</em> [1993] 3 SLR(R) 491 (“<em>Koh Kim Lan Angela</em>”), this court drew such an
                    adverse inference against the husband when it ascribed a value to disclosed
                    assets with unknown values. The husband in <em>Koh Kim Lan
                        Angela</em> deliberately gave an inflated value of the shares which
                    was obviously not the true value of the shares as this value was attributed
                    before the structural reorganisation of the family business and the shares would
                    in consequence be worth less. The husband thought the Court would thus not be
                    able to divide the shares because the true value of the shares was not known at
                    the ancillary hearing. However, the Court drew an adverse inference and ordered
                    the division of the shares using the inflated value the husband provided. It
                    should be noted that to counterbalance the inflated values, the court gave the
                    wife only 15% of the matrimonial assets as so determined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The problem which the court was confronted
                    with in the present case was that with insufficient evidence, the court could
                    not reasonably ascribe a value to those disclosed assets (with no indicated
                    values). Of course, the Judge could have ordered the assets to be assessed by an
                    independent valuer, whose costs could have been ordered to be borne equally
                    between the parties. From the GD at [47], it would appear that the Judge had lumped the undisclosed
                    assets together with the disclosed assets (with no values indicated) and
                    accorded them a value based on 10% of the disclosed assets (with values). We
                    cannot say that this approach is necessarily wrong or that the approach of
                    giving a higher percentage of the total matrimonial assets would necessarily
                    give a more accurate and just figure. Thus, 10% of the disclosed assets will be
                        <b>$6,266,695.51</b> and an additional $<b>1,451,208.60</b> if the Daughter’s Shares in YHPL are
                    eventually held, following the action in S 373/2010, to belong beneficially to
                    the Husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Adding these figures (<b>$62,666,955.13</b> and <b>$6,266,695.51</b>)
                    will give a sum of $<b>68,933,650.64</b>, which sum
                    amounts to the total value of the matrimonial assets. This figure excludes the
                    value of the Daughter’s Shares. Although the Judge deducted $6.8 million,
                    being YHPL’s overdraft liability which the Husband took responsibility for
                    as guarantor and shareholder of YHPL, this is incorrect as that sum cannot be
                    treated as the Husband’s own liability. To deduct YHPL’s liabilities
                    from the matrimonial assets would be to make the same error as double-counting
                    YHPL’s assets into the pool of matrimonial assets. All of these are
                    already reflected in YHPL’s share value.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Division of Matrimonial Assets</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Just and Equitable Division</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The Judge divided the matrimonial assets in
                    the proportions of 35:65 in favour of the Husband. Both parties are unhappy,
                    with the Husband arguing that the Wife should not get more than 20% while the
                    Wife submits that the matrimonial assets should be divided equally. The question
                    before us is whether this division is “just and
                equitable”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     At this juncture, we will briefly revisit the
                    findings of the Judge as to what each party has done for the family as well as
                    towards the accumulation of the family fortune. She found that the Wife’s
                    contributions were “being a parent, a homemaker and a caregiver”
                    and her contributions “were confined to the domestic sphere” (GD
                    at [51]). She regarded the Wife’s
                    earlier contributions when the Husband first started out his business such as
                    helping to entertain customers’ wives, answering phone calls and even
                    procuring an alleged loan of $20,000 for the business start-up as
                    “peripheral” and of “minimal” significance (GD at
                        [50]). While the Wife’s
                    contributions were only indirect contributions in the domestic sphere, the Judge
                    nevertheless emphasised that the Wife “contributed to the family and the
                    marriage to the <em>best of her ability</em> by taking on
                    the role of homemaker and mother” (emphasis added) (GD at [56]). Although the family is extremely
                    well-off now, they were poor in the early years and therefore the Wife’s
                    role must have been “more arduous” then (GD at [56]). Of course as the family fortune
                    improved, the physical demands on the Wife would be less (with perhaps the help
                    of a maid). But her duty to maintain the home and attend to the needs of
                    children would have continued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The Husband sought to lessen the significance
                    of the Wife’s contribution by saying that after their youngest child left
                    for United Kingdom in 1981 to study in a boarding school, there was not much for
                    her to do. He claimed that from then on, “she had led a luxurious life
                    engaging in ballroom dancing, singing lessons and having tea with her
                    friends” (GD at [51]). We are not
                    persuaded that this argument should be given much weight. The Judge also thought
                    so. It stands to reason that in all long marriages, where the wife is a
                    full-time homemaker, there will come a point in time when the children will
                    become independent as adults and their demands on the Wife, as a mother, will
                    decrease. But her duty to maintain the home would undoubtedly continue. It would
                    be grossly inequitable to minimise her contributions just because the children
                    have grown up and left the coop.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     However, the Judge recognised the
                    Husband’s “unusual drive and ability” in building up an
                    extremely successful business in the marine industry literally from scratch (GD
                    at [57]). It cannot be gainsaid that the
                    success was due largely to the Husband’s “special skills” in
                    the marine industry. What is clear is that all the direct financial
                    contributions to the family’s wealth have been made by the Husband while
                    the indirect non-financial contributions have substantially been made by the
                    Wife. What is also not disputed is that the Husband has been meeting all the
                    expenses of the family, including the children’s education overseas. This
                    is very much a traditional family as far as the roles of the spouses are
                    concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Section 112(2) of the Charter provides a
                    non-exhaustive list of factors which a court is required to have regard in
                    determining how the matrimonial assets are to be divided. A wide discretion is
                    conferred upon the court. The section does not prescribe the weight which should
                    be attributed to each factor or how each factor should be regarded as against
                    another factor. In most instances, the difficulty lies in evaluating the
                    non-financial contributions of the homemaker wife as such contributions are not
                    easily reducible into monetary terms. In <em>Lock Yeng Fun v Chua
                        Hock Chye</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 520 (“<em>Lock Yeng Fun</em>”) this Court noted (at [39]) that non-financial contributions were by
                    their very nature “difficult to measure because they are, intrinsically,
                    incapable of being measured in precise financial terms”. That having been
                    said, the court went on to state that such difficulty should never be a ground
                    to refuse that spouse his or her equitable share in the matrimonial
                    assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In <em>Lock Yeng Fun</em>
                    at [40], this court had also observed
                    that the legislative mandate in s 112 of the Charter was to treat all
                    matrimonial assets as “community property”. Adopting this view of
                    the matrimonial assets, counsel for the Wife argued that she should be given an
                    equal share of the matrimonial assets. In support of her contention, the Wife
                    relies on the following statement expressed by the High Court in <em>Yow Mee Lan v Chen Kai Buan</em> [2000]
                    2 SLR(R) 659 at [43]
                        (“<em>Yow Mee Lan</em>”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[M]arriage is not a business where, generally, parties receive an economic
                        reward commensurate with their economic input. It is a union in which the
                        husband and wife work together for their common good and the good of their
                        children. Each of them uses (or should use) his or her abilities and efforts
                        for the welfare of the family and contributes whatever he or she is able to.
                        The parties often have unequal abilities whether as parents or income
                        earners but, as between them, this disparity of roles and talents should not
                        result in unequal rewards where the contributions are made consistently and
                        over a long period of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">At this juncture, we would wish to point out that the judge who made
                    the above quoted remarks in <em>Yow Mee Lan</em> was also
                    the same judge who in the present case decided to accord the Wife only 35% of
                    the matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The views expressed in <em>Yow
                        Mee Lan</em> was endorsed by this court in <em>Lim
                        Choon Lai (mw) v Chew Kim Heng</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 260
                    where it said that in determining the division of matrimonial assets all
                    relevant circumstances must be taken into account, particularly those matters
                    listed out under s 112(2). But the court is not expected to make an exact
                    calculation of each spouse’s contributions, whether financial or
                    non-financial. Ultimately, the court must take a broad brush approach to reach
                    what in its view is a just and equitable division.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     As observed in <a href="#p1_76">[76]</a> above, Parliament has very appropriately refrained from
                    laying down more specific considerations in s 112 other than listing out a
                    non-exhaustive list of factors which the court should take into account.
                    Similarly, we do not think it falls within the province of the court to fill in
                    the blanks which Parliament has deliberately left open. Thus the exact division
                    which the court will make in each particular case will necessarily be fact
                    sensitive and that must have been intended by Parliament. The only guidance
                    which Parliament has laid down is “just and equitable” and that is
                    the objective which the court must in each case seek to achieve. The division
                    made in an earlier case is no more than an illustration which subsequent cases
                    can take into account as guides, always bearing in mind the difference in
                    circumstances and that no two cases are identical.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     In order for this court to disturb the
                    division ordered by the Judge of 35:65 in favour of the Husband, it must be
                    shown that the Judge had erred in law or had clearly exercised her discretion
                    wrongly or had taken into account irrelevant considerations or had failed to
                    take into account relevant considerations: see <em>Koh Bee Choo v
                        Choo Chai Huah</em> [2007] SGCA 21 at [46]. She specifically stated that she had
                    taken into account all the circumstances, including the length of the marriage
                    as well as the size of the pool of the matrimonial assets. We note the
                    Judge’s observation that the Husband’s contributions to the
                    family’s fortunes have been “extraordinary” (GD at [57]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     At this point, we would refer to <em>AJR</em> where the High Court advanced an 8-step approach as
                    a countercheck to see if the apportionment arrived at by using the broad brush
                    approach to the division of matrimonial assets is just and equitable. All we
                    wish to say is that the 8-step approach is much too detailed and seeks to make
                    it appear as if the court’s determination of the division of matrimonial
                    assets is an exercise which is capable of being reduced to mathematical
                    precision when in fact it is not so. Indeed, the High Court judge had to make
                        <em>certain assumptions</em> in order to find that the
                    importance of total direct contributions and indirect contributions to the
                    overall welfare of the family was in the ratio of 65-35. Section 112 of the
                    Charter is concerned with dividing surplus matrimonial assets between the
                    Husband and Wife based on <em>their</em> respective
                    contributions. To make a finding that both parties contributed 65% by total
                    direct contributions and 35% by total indirect contributions to the welfare of
                    the family adds little value to the final determination. The 8-step approach is
                    a fine brush approach rather than a broad brush approach. As the two approaches
                    are quite distinct and different, we have reservations as to whether it will
                    really be appropriate to use the result of one approach to verify the
                    correctness of the other. At the end of the day, we wish to underscore the point
                    that the broad brush approach, as stated in <a href="#p1_66">[66]</a>, is all about feel and the court’s sense of
                    justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The Judge in making the division had viewed
                    the matrimonial assets on a global basis. Having regard to all the
                    circumstances, she felt that a division at 35:65 was just and equitable. The
                    Wife’s case is basically that as this is a long marriage and she has given
                    all she has to the family, by way of maintaining the home and taking care of the
                    children, she should be entitled to a half share of the matrimonial assets. But
                    that is not the scheme of things under the Charter. Neither is it what the
                    Charter says. What the court is being asked is to weigh the various factors and
                    to give the appropriate weightage to each. The Judge did that and felt that an
                    apportionment at 35:65 was right. We cannot find any specific basis to question
                    that division. Neither can we say that 35% of a large pool of matrimonial assets
                    would be unjust to a spouse whose contributions were all in the domestic sphere.
                    In the result, we are not inclined to overturn the division made by the
                    Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     For the above reasons, the appeal in CA 81 of
                    2010 is partially allowed to the extent that the position of the
                    Daughters’ Shares would have to await the outcome in S 373/2010. We have
                    also removed the instances of double-counting in considering the pool of
                    matrimonial assets. In the meantime, the total value of the matrimonial assets
                    shall be as stated in <a href="#p1_71">[71]</a> and that is the
                    amount to be divided between the parties in the ratio of 35:65 in favour of the
                    Husband. The sum of <b>$</b>11,689,762.04 paid into court
                    has already been paid out to the Wife towards satisfying her share of the
                    matrimonial assets. In addition, the $860,000 which she currently holds and the
                    maintenance she has received must also be brought into account. The remainder of
                    the Wife’s entitlement should be paid by the Husband to her within three
                    months from the date hereof.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     In the event that following the final outcome
                    in S 373/2010 (including any appeal to this court), the Daughters’ Shares
                    are to be regarded as belonging to the Husband, then the values of those shares
                    shall be added to constitute part of the matrimonial assets and the Husband
                    shall pay to the Wife her due share of the enlarged matrimonial assets (which
                    should include the 10% mark-up for non-disclosure – see <a href="#p1_70">[70]</a> above) within six months of that final
                    outcome.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     CA 82 of 2010 is substantially dismissed as
                    the Wife has not succeeded on the two main issues raised, the value of the
                    matrimonial assets and the Wife’s share of those assets. Of course, we
                    also recognise that these issues replicate some of those in CA 81 of 2010. In
                    the result, we order that there shall be no order as to costs of the appeals,
                    including the two interlocutory applications, SUM 3287 of 2010 (to adduce fresh
                    evidence) and SUM 5494 of 2010 (application for stay of execution pending the
                    delivery of this judgment). There will be the usual consequential
                orders.</p>
