The tenant’s defence was that the landlord had misrepresented that the premises could be used for the operation of a pub, bar and club with live entertainment when the landlord had not obtained the requisite permission for these uses from the relevant authorities. The High Court Judge (“the Judge”) accepted that the landlord had made misrepresentations but held that the tenant affirmed the contract after it had discovered the misrepresentations. The tenant appealed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 After hearing the parties’ submissions, we dismissed the tenant’s appeal with costs on the indemnity basis. The following legal issue arose in the appeal: where misrepresentation is alleged in a contract and the representee has taken steps which are ostensibly and objectively acts of affirmation of the contract, is it necessary for the representee to know that he has a legal right to affirm or to rescind the contract before he can be said to have affirmed the contract or is it sufficient that he has knowledge of the relevant facts which entitle him to rescind the contract, irrespective of whether he also knows that he has the said legal right? </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The respondent is the landlord and retail operator of Kallang Wave Mall (“the Mall”) which is part of the Singapore Sports Hub.

The Judge remarked that the evidence given by the appellant’s director, Mr Tony Tan Hock Kian (“Tony”), at trial was “equivocal” on these points and it appeared that the appellant had simply assumed that it could cater for events (other than its own) at the Sports Hub and that its food and beverages could be brought into the Sports Facilities. The Judge added that the appellant did not even operate a catering business. It was a sole proprietorship owned by Tony that did.

These representations were false and the respondent knew that they were false.

</div> The Judge rejected the respondent’s argument that the Representations on Live Entertainment had subsequently ceased to be false. The URA’s decision to allow the Premises to be used as a “restaurant with ancillary bar and ancillary live entertainment” was not the same as the respondent’s implied representations to the appellant. The Judge also rejected the argument that the parties had entered into a settlement agreement on 25 August 2014 as this was not pleaded by the respondent.

However, the Judge held that “the better view is that knowledge of the facts giving rise to the right to rescind is sufficient”.

The evidence made it clear that the respondent knew at all material times that the appellant had intended for the Premises to operate beyond midnight.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Secondly, the appellant submitted that the Judge erred in finding that the respondent had not made the Representation on Take-out.

The Judge also appeared to have relied only on Tony’s testimony during cross-examination and ignored the subsequent clarifications he gave in re-examination.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The respondent was aware that the appellant had devoted about one-fifth of the length of the Premises to providing take-out food. This was corroborative of the existence of the Representations on Take-out.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Even if the Representations on Take-out were not expressly made, they were impliedly made. Elyn accepted in cross-examination that she had told the appellant that: (i) there would be large crowds attending the events at the Sports Hub; (ii) the Premises would be near the ticketing office where crowds would gather when entering the event premises and during intervals; and (iii) it would be good for the appellant to provide take-out food. The ordinary man would have understood this to mean that the crowds attending the Sports Hub events would be able to take away the appellant’s food for consumption at the event premises.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The appellant did not challenge the Judge’s findings in respect of the Representations on Catering.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Thirdly, the appellant contended that the Judge erred in finding that it had affirmed the Lease Agreement. It submitted that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Its conduct did not amount to a clear and unequivocal election to affirm the Lease Agreement. This is a high threshold that was not met on the facts. All of the appellant’s actions were in the context of ongoing negotiations for alternative leasing arrangements which were evidenced by the documentary exhibits. The appellant had also been in talks with the URA and the PLRD to try to mitigate the effect of the respondent’s misrepresentations. It should have been entitled to rescind the Lease Agreement once the negotiations had broken down and this would be in line with the public policy of encouraging parties to negotiate settlements.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Further or in the alternative, the appellant’s election not to exercise its right to rescind and to proceed with the Lease Agreement was conditional upon the respondent agreeing to reduce the rent or otherwise taking all steps to accommodate the change in the appellant’s business model necessitated by the respondent’s misrepresentations. This could be inferred from certain e-mails and the fact that the parties had been in negotiations for a full year. As the respondent had failed to meet these conditions, the appellant’s right of rescission “re-emerged” and was exercised when it vacated the Premises.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Moreover, its actions could not have amounted to affirmation when it did not know of its right to rescind the Lease Agreement at the material time. The Judge erred in law in holding that only knowledge of the facts was required for election, as cases such as <span class="font-italic">Wishing Star Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Jurong Town Corp</span> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 339 (“<span class="font-italic">Wishing Star</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>”), <span class="font-italic">The Pacific Vigorous</span> [2006] 3 SLR(R) 374 and <span class="font-italic">Peyman</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>stand for the proposition that an election could only be made by someone with full knowledge of his legal rights. The Judge also erred in finding on the facts that, in any event, the appellant was aware of its rights when it made its election.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The appellant submitted that it was entitled to the recovery of a total of $3,318,447.18, being the loss it suffered in reliance on the respondent’s misrepresentations. Should the respondent be found liable for innocent misrepresentation rather than fraudulent misrepresentation or negligent misrepresentation under s 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act (Cap 390, 1994 Rev Ed), then the appellant submitted that it would be entitled to an indemnity of all obligations under the Lease Agreement and all losses incurred in the course of carrying out such obligations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Respondent’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The respondent argued that the appellant had not articulated any compelling reason for the Judge’s findings on any of the issues to be overturned. In particular, it pointed out that the appellant’s continued possession of the Premises and its payment of rent, amongst its other acts, amounted to unequivocal acts of affirmation. Further, the respondent submitted that Tony (as the appellant’s representative) knew of his legal right to rescind the Lease Agreement at the material time, as evidenced by the testimony of the appellant’s witnesses at trial and certain Whatsapp conversations. All this evidence was considered by the Judge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The respondent also submitted that the Judge was correct in holding that the law does not require a representee to know its legal rights before it affirms a contract. The respondent contended that the judicial pronouncements in the local cases cited by the appellant, such as <span class="font-italic">Wishing Star (HC)</span> and <span class="font-italic">The</span> <span class="font-italic">Pacific Vigorous</span>, were made <span class="font-italic">obiter </span>and without full arguments and that other local cases such as <span class="font-italic">Goldzone</span><span class="font-italic"> (Asia Pacific) Ltd v Creative Technology Pte Ltd </span>[2011] SGHC 103 (“<span class="font-italic">Goldzone</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Aero-Gate Pte Ltd v Engen Marine Engineering Pte Ltd</span> [2013] 4 SLR 409 (“<span class="font-italic">Aero-Gate</span>”) generally held that it was sufficient that the representee had full knowledge of the facts when affirming the contract.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The following issues arose in this appeal:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) whether the Judge erred in finding that the respondent had not made the (alleged) Representations on Operating Hours;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) whether the Judge erred in finding that the respondent had not made the (alleged) Representations on Take-out; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) whether the Judge erred in finding that the appellant had affirmed the Lease Agreement and was therefore not entitled to rescind it for misrepresentation and in particular:</div><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(i) that the appellant had made a clear and unequivocal election to affirm the Lease Agreement;</div><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(ii) that the appellant did not need to know its legal right to rescind the Lease Agreement in order to affirm it, as the appellant’s knowledge of the relevant facts was sufficient; and</div><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(iii) that, in any event, the appellant knew its legal right to rescind the Lease Agreement when affirming it.</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the respondent made the Representations on Operating Hours</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The legal principles relating to the elements of actionable misrepresentation are not disputed by the parties. In the contractual context, the elements are satisfied when a party relies on a false representation in entering into the contract with the representor. A representee who can establish misrepresentation will be entitled, as a general rule, to rescind the contract such that the parties are restored to their pre-contractual positions (<span class="font-italic">RBC Properties Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Defu Furniture Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 1 SLR 997 at [56]; <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> (Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2012) at paras 11.003 and 11.006).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The appellant’s first contention was that the Judge had erred in finding that the respondent had not made the Representations on Operating Hours and that the appellant would not have relied on any such representations even if they had been made. It suffices for us to address this issue briefly as we saw no reason to disturb the Judge’s findings in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Even if the respondent was aware that the appellant intended to operate its business at the Premises beyond midnight, this still did not detract from the Judge’s reasoning that the appellant knew that the operating hours for selling alcohol and providing live entertainment were contingent upon the PLRD’s grant of the relevant licences. Clause 2(b) of the Letter of Offer and cl 5.1.2 of the Lease Agreement made clear that the responsibility lay with the appellant to apply for these licences.

</div> We agree with the Judge that there was no express representation as to the operating hours of the Premises, nor any reason to imply any such representation. Moreover, the appellant would have been familiar with these licensing requirements especially considering that it was running a pub in Clarke Quay at the material time. It could not possibly have relied on any representation from the appellant as to how late the Premises would be allowed to be open for business.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The appellant attempted to link this issue to the Representations on Live Entertainment (in relation to which the Judge found that there was actionable misrepresentation) by arguing that it would have applied to the PLRD earlier and would have been put on notice as to the PLRD’s restrictions on opening hours sooner, if the respondent had sought and obtained permission from the URA prior to entering into the Lease Agreement. This argument was logically unsustainable as it ignored the above point that it was still ultimately incumbent upon the appellant to apply for the licences. If the appellant had indeed believed and relied on the Representations on Live Entertainment, then there was no reason why it delayed in applying for the relevant licences from the PLRD. This delay was certainly not attributable to the respondent. For these reasons, we rejected the appellant’s submissions regarding the Representations on Opening Hours.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the respondent made the Representations on Take-out</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In our judgment, the appellant’s arguments regarding the Representations on Take-out similarly lacked merit. The appellant was not able to point to any evidence that could show convincingly that the respondent had indeed represented that the appellant would be able to provide take-out F&amp;B services to the users of the Sports Facilities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The appellant relied on assertions made in the testimony of its F&amp;B Consultant and its Project Manager, as well as Tony’s testimony during re-examination that Elyn (as the respondent’s representative) had in fact made clear representations to this effect. This evidence was expressly considered by the Judge who found Tony’s statements at trial “equivocal” when considering the totality of his evidence.

</div> Contrary to the appellant’s submissions on appeal, the Judge did not ignore Tony’s evidence during re-examination that Elyn had said “guests may take things into the stadium and into the nearby places”. The Judge preferred Tony’s original answer during cross-examination that the respondent had simply not informed him of the prohibition against “outside food and beverages” in the Sports Facilities. The Judge also took into account the testimony of the appellant’s other witnesses and noted that the appellant’s F&amp;B Manager stated that he had “thought” that they would have some takeaway business. The Judge considered that this indicated that the appellant had made assumptions as to whether food could be brought into the Sports Facilities.

</div> We were not satisfied that any of these findings of fact should be overturned on the available evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Further, the appellant was not prevented from offering take-out F&amp;B services entirely. It was only that the appellant’s F&amp;B items could not be brought into the Sports Facilities. The appellant was still able to sell take-out food and drinks to users of the Sports Hub, patrons of the restaurant who were not entering the Sports Facilities and users who had left the Sports Facilities. It followed therefore that the appellant’s argument that it had devoted about one-fifth of the length of the Premises to providing take-out food and that the respondent was aware of it could not establish that the relevant representations had been made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The Judge therefore did not err in finding that the Representations on Take-out had not been expressly or impliedly made.

Specifically, the appellant contested the following findings of the Judge in fact and law:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) first, that the appellant had in fact made a clear and unequivocal election to affirm the Lease Agreement;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) second, that it was sufficient as a matter of law that the appellant knew the facts when affirming the Lease Agreement, whether or not it was aware of its legal right of rescission; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) third, that in any case, the appellant knew its legal right to rescind the Lease Agreement when affirming it.</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether there was clear and unequivocal affirmation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 A binding election requires the injured party to communicate his choice to the other party in clear and unequivocal terms and he will not be bound by a qualified or conditional decision (<span class="font-italic">Jurong</span><span class="font-italic"> Town Corp v Wishing Star Ltd</span> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 283 (“<span class="font-italic">Wishing Star (CA)</span>”) at [171(a)]).

This Court stated in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Wishing Star (CA)</span> at [171(b)] that such conduct can be express or implied. In other words, the appellant must have made a clear and unequivocal election to affirm the Lease Agreement in order for such an election to be binding upon it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The appellant’s case was that its conduct did not evince clearly and unequivocally an intention to affirm the Lease Agreement as its actions were taken in the context of ongoing negotiations for alternative leasing arrangements. It had sought an urgent meeting on 2 July 2014 to negotiate with the respondent and it was at this meeting that the parties had purportedly reached a “gentlemen’s agreement” to renegotiate the rent.

</div> According to the appellant, these negotiations lasted for over a year until September 2015 (see [16] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 We were unable to agree with the appellant’s submissions. The parties signed the Lease Agreement on 25 August 2014, which was more than a month after the URA’s decision to allow the operation of a “restaurant with ancillary bar” was communicated to the appellant (see [7] above). Counsel for the appellant conceded at the hearing that the appellant did not make any qualification when entering into the Lease Agreement, even though it was open to the appellant to do so. As the Judge noted, there was similarly insufficient evidence that the appellant had acted under protest when it later: (a) took possession of the Premises in September 2014; (b) commenced business in November 2014; and (c) paid rent for December 2014 and made other subsequent payments.

In particular, certain negotiations on rent had been precipitated largely by the increase in floor area of the Premises after the final survey, as well as other complaints unrelated to the Representations on Live Entertainment such as ones relating to car park space, road closures, air-conditioning issues, WiFi, opening hours, catering and take-out.

In <span class="font-italic">Goldzone</span>, Andrew Ang J noted <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> at [39] that “no election can be said to have been made unless the misled party is broadly aware of the true facts.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The respondent further cited <span class="font-italic">Chai Cher Watt</span><span class="font-italic"> (trading as Chuang Aik Engineering Works) v SDL Technologies Pte Ltd and another appeal</span> [2012] 1 SLR 152, where this Court did not find it necessary to determine this issue on the facts of the case but remarked nonetheless at [34]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… As to what knowledge is relevant, it would appear that the party waiving his right should at least have knowledge of the facts giving rise to those rights. (Note, however another view espoused in <span class="font-italic">Peyman</span> … that there must be knowledge of the <span class="font-italic">existence</span> of contractual rights themselves, at least in so far as they are express contractual rights, though this decision has been critiqued by The Hon Mr Justice K R Handley, in <span class="font-italic">Estoppel by Conduct and Election </span>(Thomson/Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2006), especially at para 14-015)… [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As the Court noted in the above passage, the <span class="font-italic">Peyman</span> decision has been criticised by Handley J in <span class="font-italic">Estoppel by Conduct and Election</span>, as well as in a separate article, K R Handley, “Exploring Election” (2006) 122 LQR 82 (“<span class="font-italic">Exploring Election</span>”): As Handley J states in <span class="font-italic">Exploring Election</span> at p 96, “[i]n so far as <span class="font-italic">Peyman</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>… held that there can be no election without knowledge of the right to elect, it was wrongly decided”. We will discuss this in greater detail subsequently.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The above cases show that the law in Singapore on this specific legal issue is unsettled and that the relevant judicial pronouncements made by our courts thus far were <span class="font-italic">obiter dicta</span>. After hearing the parties on this issue, we declined to follow <span class="font-italic">Peyman</span> for the reasons that follow.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 First, the factual circumstances in <span class="font-italic">Peyman</span> were quite unusual. The plaintiff in that case was an Iranian who spoke no English. The plaintiff entered into an agreement to purchase a leasehold interest from the 1st defendant.  The 1st defendant’s title to the lease was defective as he had arranged for a third party to impersonate him at interviews with the landlords’ managing agents because he feared that the agents would not recommend assigning the lease to someone with his profile and scruffy appearance. When the plaintiff was later faced with the choice of whether to affirm or to rescind his contract, he was advised erroneously to continue with the contract by the 2nd defendant, a solicitor who was acting improperly for both the plaintiff and the 1st defendant at the same time.

</div> the authors of <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract</span> (Michael Furmston, ed) (LexisNexis, 4th Ed, 2010) (“<span class="font-italic">Furmston</span><span class="font-italic"> on Contract</span>”) express the view (at p 930) that <span class="font-italic">Peyman</span> “might be seen in the context of its special facts, notably, the helplessness of [the plaintiff], however, commercial law rarely makes allowance for ignorance of language or of local law”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Second, as Handley J observes in <span class="font-italic">Exploring Election</span> at p 96, the <span class="font-italic">Peyman</span> decision was based on the <span class="font-italic">dictum</span> of Lord Blackburn in <span class="font-italic">Kendall v Hamilton </span>(1879) 4 App Cas 504 (“<span class="font-italic">Kendall</span>”) at 542 which must be read in its proper context. Lord Blackburn was quoted in <span class="font-italic">Peyman</span> (at 482) as saying that “there cannot be election until there is knowledge of the right to elect”. However, as Handley J points out, <span class="font-italic">Kendall </span>“had nothing to do with election”, and Lord Blackburn was in fact really referring to the plaintiffs’ knowledge of the facts<span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">Exploring Election </span>at pp 84 and 86). In two other cases, Lord Blackburn also articulated his view that knowledge of the facts is sufficient for a person to make an election between his rights (<span class="font-italic">Exploring Election</span> at pp 83–85, citing <span class="font-italic">Scarf v Jardine</span> (1882) 7 App Cas 345 at 360–361 and <span class="font-italic">Clough v London and North Western Railway Co </span>(1871) 7 Ex 26 at 34).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Another English case cited in <span class="font-italic">Peyman</span> (at 483–484) and relied upon by the appellant was <span class="font-italic">Evans v Bartlam </span>[1937] AC 473 (“<span class="font-italic">Evans</span>”), a House of Lords decision in which Lord Atkin said, “to infer election it must be shown that the person concerned had full knowledge of the various rights amongst which he elects” (at 479). However, Lord Russell expressed the conflicting view (at 483) that “[t]he doctrine of election only applies to a man who elects with full knowledge of the facts”. In any case, <span class="font-italic">Evans</span> was about the question of whether a defendant against whom a default judgment is entered is taken to have elected to treat the judgment as valid when he obtains a stay of execution for more time to make payment. The House of Lords was not referred to and did not deal with the authorities on election between rights (<span class="font-italic">Exploring Election</span> at p 88). Another case, <span class="font-italic">Young v Bristol Aeroplane Co Ltd</span> [1946] AC 163 was cited in <span class="font-italic">Peyman</span> (at 483–484) but that case turned on a question of statutory construction and, as Handley J opines, provides no support for <span class="font-italic">Peyman</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>either (<span class="font-italic">Exploring Election</span> at p 89).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Counsel for the appellant acknowledged that <span class="font-italic">Peyman</span> has not been followed in any subsequent English decisions. In the later House of Lords case of <span class="font-italic">The Kanchenjunga</span> [1990] 1 Lloyd’s L R 391 (see <span class="font-italic">Wishing Star (HC)</span> at [15]), Lord Goff observed (at 399) in the context of an uncontractual tender of performance that “if, with knowledge of the facts giving rise to his right to reject, [a party] nevertheless unequivocally elects not to do so, his election will be final and binding upon him and he will have waived his right to reject the tender as uncontractual”. However, Lord Goff had said earlier in that decision that it was not necessary for him to consider the cases in which it had been held that, as a prerequisite of election, the party must be aware not only of the facts giving rise to his rights but also of the rights themselves because it was not in dispute in the case before him that the relevant party was aware both of the facts and of its rights (at 398). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The Australian courts have departed from the <span class="font-italic">Peyman</span> position. In <span class="font-italic">Sargent </span>at 658, the High Court of Australia stated expressly that “knowledge of the existence of the alternative right, as distinct from knowledge of the facts giving rise to the right, is not essential to the making of a binding election.” As the Judge noted, the authors of Dominic O’Sullivan, Steven Elliott &amp; Rafal Zakrzewski, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Rescission</span> (Oxford University Press, 2008) at paras 23.34–23.49 came to the same conclusion as the High Court of Australia did in <span class="font-italic">Sargent</span> after having reviewed the English and Australian authorities on this question.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61  Finally, in our view, the policy considerations are firmly in favour of the respondent’s position. As a general principle, no one should be allowed to benefit from his ignorance of the law. As described in the following passage by Handley J in <span class="font-italic">Exploring Election</span> (at p 97) quoted in the Judge’s decision below:
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-a9f7e09c-5f4b-4c51-8b0c-281c1a22f74a" data-toggle="modal" type="button">42</button></sup>

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Ignorance of the law is generally treated as a misfortune, not an advantage. In <span class="font-italic">Hourigan v Trustees Executors &amp; Agency Co </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd</span> Dixon J quoted Knight Bruce LJ saying in 1857 “generally when the facts are known … the right is presumed to be known”.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Disputes about an election normally arise because the other party relies on an earlier election to defeat a later attempt to elect the other way. Legal professional privilege would make it difficult for that party to prove that the elector was aware of his right at the earlier time. A rule that knowledge of the right had to be proved would encourage perjury and reward those who do not seek advice …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The appellant’s position that knowledge of one’s legal rights is required for affirmation could lead to unfairness if the representee is allowed to hide behind his ignorance of the law and to choose deliberately not to seek legal advice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 There are also considerable practical difficulties in real life if the appellant’s position is correct. When a representor is faced with what ostensibly and objectively are acts of affirmation by a representee, would he have to inquire further and seek confirmation from the representee that he was aware of his contractual rights when he did the said acts in spite of the misrepresentation? Further, it is often the case (as it was in the present case) that the representor does not even accept that there was misrepresentation in the first place. There would therefore be no reason for him to even make such an inquiry. Moreover, short of the representee stating expressly when he did the said acts that he was aware of his contractual rights or admitting such knowledge subsequently, how is the representor going to prove that the representee possessed the requisite knowledge of his legal rights when affirming the contract? It will often be an impossible task to inquire into or to find objective evidence of the representee’s subjective state of mind.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Perhaps one way of proving knowledge of legal rights is by showing that the representee had legal advice when he did the acts in ostensible affirmation of the contract. However, how does one show what sort of legal advice was given when solicitor-client privilege stands firmly in the way? Other problems may also arise. For instance, what is the significance of a representee’s delay in seeking legal advice, as the appellant did in the present case? What happens if the legal advice obtained by the representee is erroneous or defective, as it was on the facts of <span class="font-italic">Peyman</span>? These are some of the thorny questions which may have be dealt with if the court is required to inquire into whether a party had knowledge of his legal right of rescission before his affirmation could be regarded as binding. Commercial relationships may then become fraught with uncertainty. As the authors of <span class="font-italic">Furmston</span><span class="font-italic"> on Contract</span> at p 930 opine, “a rule by reference to actual knowledge of rights makes it very difficult for the other party to decide whether he can safely rely on what appears to be affirmation”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Having considered the local and foreign case authorities, the criticism of <span class="font-italic">Peyman</span> and the relevant policy considerations, we are of the view that knowledge of the facts giving rise to the right of rescission is sufficient for affirmation to take place. In the present case, it was therefore not necessary for the respondent to show that the appellant knew of its legal right to rescind the Lease Agreement when it did the acts in apparent affirmation of that agreement despite having known about the misrepresentation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 At the hearing, counsel for the appellant advanced the further argument that even if knowledge of the facts is ordinarily sufficient for a binding election to be made, knowledge of the legal right is nonetheless required when a party is said to have affirmed a contract in spite of fraudulent misrepresentation. In support of this proposition, counsel cited the Supreme Court of Victoria case of <span class="font-italic">Coastal Estates Pty Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Melevende</span> [1965] VR 433 (“<span class="font-italic">Coastal Estates</span>”) at 435, which was cited in <span class="font-italic">Peyman</span> at 489 and <span class="font-italic">Sargent</span> at 657. However, a closer reading of the case will show that Herring CJ, in distinguishing cases involving fraudulent misrepresentation, was merely expressing the view that a representee in such a case cannot be presumed to have knowledge of his right to elect under the contract. Ultimately, the court in <span class="font-italic">Coastal Estates</span> adopted the same approach as was taken later in <span class="font-italic">Peyman</span>, on the basis of its interpretation of Lord Blackburn’s “general principle” in <span class="font-italic">Kendall</span> that a party cannot make a biding election until he has knowledge of the right to elect. As mentioned at [60] above, this view was rejected conclusively by the High Court of Australia in <span class="font-italic">Sargent</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Although Mason J noted in <span class="font-italic">Sargent</span> (at 658) that the court did not need to determine whether cases involving fraudulent misrepresentation should be treated any differently from other cases involving election between rights, he remarked that “it should be kept firmly in mind that the doctrine of election is of general application and that no good purpose is to be served by drawing distinctions in its various applications unless considerations of justice make it necessary or expedient so to do.” We were unable to see any special considerations in cases involving fraudulent misrepresentation which would warrant a derogation from the general principle that the representee’s knowledge of the facts is sufficient. At the time of the affirmation, a representee who is aware of all the relevant facts would not be under any misapprehension caused by the misrepresentation. There is therefore no need to accord such a representee additional protection from any potential unfairness. On the basis of the Judge’s finding that the respondent had made the Representations on Live Entertainment with the knowledge that they were false (see [21] above), the elements of fraudulent misrepresentation were made out in this case but this was ultimately of no assistance to the appellant’s case on the issue of affirmation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the appellant knew of its legal right to rescind the Lease Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In any event, we saw no reason to depart from the Judge’s finding of fact that the appellant was aware of its legal right of rescission when it affirmed the Lease Agreement. In reaching this finding, the Judge relied mainly on certain Whatsapp messages between Tony and representatives of the respondent on 1 and 2 August 2014.

Neither of these explanations was convincing as they did not accord with the context and the wording of Tony’s messages. Instead, as the Judge found, the messages showed that Tony believed that the appellant could have walked away from the Lease Agreement without being in breach. The respondent further pointed out that Tony was being advised by a project manager from Strix Strategies Pte Ltd at the time and was himself a savvy businessman who had incorporated several legal entities with the intention of having them operate at the Premises.

<p><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">4 July 2018</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Case Summary</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Strait Colonies Pte Ltd v SMRT Alpha Pte Ltd </span></em></strong><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">[2018] SGCA 36<em><br/>
</em>Civil Appeal No 100 of 2017</span></strong></p>
<p><font face="Calibri">_____________________________________________________________________</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Judge of Appeal Tay Yong Kwang):</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">1          This appeal arose from an action for the payment of rent due under a lease over certain units (“the Premises”) in Kallang Wave Mall. The tenant’s defence was that the landlord had misrepresented that the premises could be used for the operation of a pub, bar and club with live entertainment when the landlord had not obtained the requisite permission for these uses from the relevant authorities.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">2          The High Court Judge (“the Judge”) accepted that the landlord had misrepresented that the appellant would be able to operate a pub, bar and club providing live entertainment services at the Premises. However, the Judge held that the tenant affirmed the contract after it had discovered the misrepresentations and was therefore not entitled to rescind it. The tenant appealed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">3          The Court of Appeal dismissed the tenant’s appeal. It held that where misrepresentation is alleged in a contract and the representee has taken steps which are ostensibly and objectively acts of affirmation of the contract, it is not necessary for the representee to know that he has a legal right to affirm or to rescind the contract before he can be said to have affirmed the contract. It is sufficient that the representee has knowledge of the relevant facts which entitle him to rescind the contract, irrespective of whether he also knows that he has the said legal right.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Other alleged representations on operating hours and take-out services</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">4          The Court upheld the Judge's finding that the respondent had not made any other misrepresentations. The respondent had not represented that the appellant would be able to operate its business at the Premises until the early hours of the morning. In any event, the appellant would not have relied on any such representation. It knew that the operating hours for selling alcohol and providing live entertainment were contingent upon the authorities’ grant of the relevant licences. The Letter of Offer and the Lease Agreement made clear that the responsibility lay with the appellant to apply for these licences (<strong>[34]–[36]</strong>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">5          There was no evidence of any representations that the appellant would be able to provide take-out food and beverage services for events and attendees at the Singapore Sports Hub when in fact, users were prohibited from bringing outside food and beverages into the sports facilities at the Sports Hub (<strong>[37]–[40]</strong>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Affirmation of the Lease Agreement</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">6          The Court held that that the appellant’s conduct evinced a clear and unequivocal intention to affirm the Lease Agreement despite the respondent’s misrepresentations regarding live entertainment. The appellant signed the Lease Agreement without making any qualifications more than a month after it received word of the URA’s decision. It made no protest when taking possession of the Premises, commencing business and paying rent. There was no evidence of any “gentlemen’s agreement” between the parties to renegotiate the rent, nor any evidence of the appellant’s alleged intention that its affirmation was only conditional upon reduction in rent (<strong>[44]–[47]</strong>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">7          The Court held that it was not necessary for the respondent to show that the appellant knew of its legal right to rescind the Lease Agreement when it did the acts in apparent affirmation of that agreement despite having known about the misrepresentation. It was sufficient that it knew of the facts giving rise to its right of rescission. This position is in line with policy considerations and the general principle that no one should be allowed to benefit from his ignorance of the law. It also avoids considerable practical difficulties such as requiring a representor to inquire and seek confirmation that the representee is aware of his legal rights when he is faced with what ostensibly and objectively are acts of affirmation as well as to find objective and admissible evidence of the representee’s state of mind (<strong>[61]–[64]</strong>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">8          In any event, the Court saw no reason to depart from the Judge’s finding that the appellant was aware of its legal right of rescission when it affirmed the Lease Agreement. Certain Whatsapp messages between the parties’ representatives indicated that the appellant knew that it could have walked away from the Lease Agreement without being in breach (<strong>[67]–[68]</strong>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">9          The appeal was therefore dismissed.</span></p>
