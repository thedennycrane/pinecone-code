In making this determination, Judith Prakash J, as she then was, adopted a two-step analysis in <span class="font-italic">Monex</span><span class="font-italic"> Group</span> (at [31]). The court first considers what the relevant order(s) required of the contemnor. It must then determine whether the contemnor fulfilled these requirements. In doing so, the court applies the criminal standard of proof of beyond reasonable doubt (s 28 of the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act 2016 (No 19 of 2016) (“AJA”)).

</div>
</div> The first defendant’s attempt to raise these arguments during the committal proceedings faced two obstacles. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Firstly, the first defendant is deemed to have admitted to all the facts and matters alleged in the ASOC, including Schedule A. Where judgment is granted under O 19 r 7 of the ROC, the facts in the statement of claim are “taken to be admitted by the defendant; and … no evidence can be admitted as to those facts” (<span class="font-italic">per</span> Bowen LJ in <span class="font-italic">Young v Thomas</span> [1892] 2 Ch 134 at 137). This conclusion can also be reached by an alternative route. Under O 18 r 13(1) of the ROC, any allegation of fact made by a party in his pleading is taken as admitted unless it is specifically traversed by the opposite party. Lim Teong Qwee JC observed in <span class="font-italic">Zulkifli</span><span class="font-italic"> Baharudin v Koh Lam Son </span>[1999] 2 SLR(R) 369 that a defendant who has not served a defence “cannot be in a better position than if he had served a defence and had not specifically traversed all allegations of fact” (at [17]). Therefore, the effect of judgment against the first defendant is that he is to be taken to have admitted to the facts alleged in the statement of claim. Accordingly, the first defendant could not now challenge the factual basis of the Orders as pleaded in the ASOC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Secondly, if the first defendant intended to oppose the substance of the Orders, the appropriate legal process would have been for him to apply for them to be discharged, set aside or stayed (<span class="font-italic">OCM Opportunities Fund II, LP and others v Burhan </span><span class="font-italic">Uray (alias Wong Ming Kiong) and others </span>[2005] 3 SLR(R) 60 (“<span class="font-italic">OCM</span><span class="font-italic"> Opportunities</span>”) at [28]). In the face of a court order requiring compliance, the party in breach cannot be heard to question the correctness of the order. If such a party is allowed to do so, court orders will necessarily lose the authority that they are otherwise intended to wield in the administration of justice. Such a situation will be a recipe for anarchy and can have no place in our legal system. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Having withdrawn his Defence and not having challenged the Orders, it was not open to the first defendant to argue that the information was not confidential or that his use and disclosure were authorised. The relevant issue in this case is whether the first defendant has satisfied his obligations pursuant to the Orders. On the instant facts, the scope of the Orders is clear and uncontested.

</div>
</div> However, what exactly the first defendant deleted is the subject of debate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The plaintiff’s position is that the first defendant did not delete the items in his personal Dropbox account and that these materials therefore remain subject to the Orders. Determining the plausibility of the first defendant’s explanations necessitates an examination of how Dropbox operates. Dropbox is a file hosting service which offers cloud storage. Users create a Dropbox account by signing up online. Logging into the Dropbox website each time to upload and delete content from an account is cumbersome and, as a solution, users can download the Dropbox application to various devices (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, computers, tablets and mobile phones). This allows them to conveniently access their account across multiple devices (Joe Kissell, <span class="font-italic">Take </span><span class="font-italic">Control of Dropbox</span>, TidBITS Publishing Inc, 2nd Ed, 2016 (“<span class="font-italic">Take </span><span class="font-italic">Control of Dropbox</span>”) at p 12). When the Dropbox application is downloaded onto a computer, it creates a Dropbox folder which is usually stored in the computer’s C-drive (<span class="font-italic">Take </span><span class="font-italic">Control of Dropbox</span> at pp 14 and 16). As a default, this folder is automatically synced with the user’s Dropbox account (<span class="font-italic">Take </span><span class="font-italic">Control of Dropbox</span> at p 15). Therefore, provided that there is internet access, a file which is deleted from the user’s Dropbox account will be automatically removed from the folder. Conversely, a user can upload materials to his account through the Dropbox folder. By placing documents into the folder, these files are immediately uploaded to the online account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 When he uninstalled the Dropbox application in September 2016 (see [10] above), the Dropbox folder that had been created upon installation remained on the first defendant’s computer. This is because Dropbox folders are not automatically removed when the application is deleted. Subsequently, the forensic examination revealed that this folder contained 3,052 files, namely, the plaintiff’s confidential information. As discussed at [43], there is an automatic sync between a user’s Dropbox account and the local Dropbox folder found on a computer. Applying this premise, the documents that were in the Dropbox folder on the first defendant’s computer were a reflection of the documents that were in the first defendant’s Dropbox account when he resigned. If the first defendant had really deleted all of the non-disclosed items from his Dropbox account during his employment, these materials would not have been recovered from the folder. There was no evidence to suggest that the automatic syncing between the first Defendant’s Dropbox account and Dropbox folder had been manually overridden. In light of this, I determined that there were confidential documents which had not been deleted by the first defendant prior to his resignation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The first defendant has claimed that he has no reason to and would gain no advantage in withholding any information from the plaintiff.

The Court set out seven factors, citing the <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> of Lawrence Collins J in <span class="font-italic">Crystal Mews Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Metterick</span> [2006] EWHC 3087 (Ch) at [13], providing a non-exhaustive framework to assist courts in arriving at the appropriate sentence. A court should consider: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the claimant has been prejudiced by virtue of the contempt and whether the prejudice is capable of remedy; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the extent to which the contemnor has acted under pressure; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether the breach of the order was deliberate or unintentional;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the degree of culpability; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) whether the contemnor has been placed in breach of the order by reason of the conduct of others;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) whether the contemnor appreciates the seriousness of the deliberate breach; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) whether the contemnor has co-operated.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The relevance and weight to be accorded to each of these factors would vary in each case. For instance, on the current facts, [50(b)] and [50(e)] would be inapplicable. The first defendant’s breaches were not the result of third party intervention. There is also no evidence to suggest that he was under pressure not to comply with the Orders. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Besides laying down these considerations, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mok</span><span class="font-italic"> Kah Hong </span>also drew a distinction between the sentencing approach for one-off breaches and breaches which are of a continuing and/or repeated nature (at [103]). The one-off contemnor is no longer in a position to remedy the breach and so the primary sentencing principle is that of punishment (<span class="font-italic">Tay </span><span class="font-italic">Kar Oon v Tahir</span> [2017] 2 SLR 342 (“<span class="font-italic">Tay </span><span class="font-italic">Kar Oon</span>”) at [56]). However, in respect of continuing breaches (<span class="font-italic">M</span><span class="font-italic">ok Kah Hong</span> at [103]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the objective of compelling the contemnor to effect compliance with the order is likely to be … given a significant degree of weight … the sentence imposed will include both <span class="font-italic">punitive</span> and <span class="font-italic">coercive</span> elements. … [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 This being a case where there was non-compliance over an extended period of time, I considered whether the first defendant’s sentence should contain a coercive element. In <span class="font-italic">Mah</span><span class="font-italic"> Kah Hong </span>itself, the Court of Appeal suspended the sentence for four weeks to offer the contemnor a final chance to effect compliance (at [116]). The first defendant was given multiple opportunities over a period of several months to comply with the Orders. Notwithstanding evidence to the contrary, he maintained that he had delivered up and disclosed all relevant information to the plaintiff. It was apparent at the hearing that he had no intention of fully satisfying the Orders. Giving the first defendant more time would have been a mug’s game. I therefore determined that the sentence should be purely punitive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Such a conclusion does not immediately translate to a custodial sentence. Committal to prison is normally a measure of last resort (<span class="font-italic">Lee Shieh-Peen Clement v </span><span class="font-italic">Ho Chin Nguang</span> [2010] 4 SLR 801 at [49]). However, I was of the view that a fine would not sufficiently register the court’s disapproval of the first defendant’s conduct. The first defendant engaged in a cynical manipulation of the legal process. He declared himself a bankrupt. Instead of defending the action, he withdrew his Defence. In respect of the delivery up order, he put forward different reasons for his failure to fully comply before finally taking the position that all the documents had been delivered up. For the disclosure order, against the objective evidence, he claimed that he had made no disclosure. The first defendant’s actions were calculated to frustrate the plaintiff’s legitimate efforts in seeking compliance with the Orders. With this in mind, I examined earlier decisions where contemnors had received custodial sentences through the lens of the <span class="font-italic">Mok</span><span class="font-italic"> Kah Hong</span> factors.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The case law </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The degree of prejudice caused to the plaintiff and whether this prejudice is remediable is a significant consideration. This can be seen in <span class="font-italic">In</span><span class="font-italic"> re</span> <span class="font-italic">Barrell</span><span class="font-italic"> Enterprises</span> [1973] 1 WLR 19 (“<span class="font-italic">r</span><span class="font-italic">e Barrell</span>”), a decision that was relied upon by the plaintiff. In <span class="font-italic">r</span><span class="font-italic">e Barrell</span>, the breach was the failure to deliver up valuable securities. The English Court of Appeal found that in weighing the seriousness of the act of disobedience, it was right to take into account the fact that the papers in question were of a value running into many thousands of pounds (at [27E]). Obviously the greater the value of the documents withheld, the higher the degree of prejudice to the party seeking compliance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Another relevant consideration is the deliberateness of the breach. An individual who deliberately breaches court orders is treated more severely than the inadvertent wrongdoer. This is well illustrated by <span class="font-italic">OCM Opportunities</span>, a case which was also relied on by the plaintiff. The defendants in <span class="font-italic">OCM Opportunities </span>breached a Mareva injunction on multiple occasions. They <span class="font-italic">repeatedly</span> failed to disclose assets and did not attend court for cross-examination even after being given several opportunities to co-operate<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)">. </span>In ordering an imprisonment term of six months for each contemnor, Belinda Ang Saw Ean J took cognisance of their deliberate disobedience of the orders which continued even after a permanent injunction was obtained. Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Precious Wishes Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Sinoble Mettaloy International (Pte) Ltd </span>[2000] SGHC 5, Judith Prakash J, as she then was, emphasised the contemnor’s <span class="font-italic">deliberate</span> disregard for a Mareva injunction in determining the seriousness of his contempt (at [34]). In that case, the contemnor was the local resident director of the defendant company and had facilitated bank withdrawals from the company’s account in breach of the injunction order. Significant non-remedial prejudice to the plaintiff was also caused as the contemnor was unable to subsequently recover the withdrawn funds to make restitution. He was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In <span class="font-italic">Global Distressed Alpha </span><span class="font-italic">Fund I Ltd Partnership v PT Bakrie Investindo</span> [2013] SGHC 105 (“<span class="font-italic">Global Distressed Alpha</span>”), the contemnor breached examination of judgment debtor (“EJD”) orders by failing to attend <span class="font-italic">nine</span> EJD hearings without valid reasons save on one occasion where the court’s leave was obtained for an adjournment. Lai Siu Chiu J, as she then was, took this recalcitrance as an aggravating factor. She also found that his conduct displayed a conscious and deliberate decision not to comply with the order (at [53]) and that there had been no intention on his part to mitigate his breaches (at [57]). She imposed a sentence of seven days’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The deliberateness of the breach also has an effect on the contemnor’s degree of culpability, although it is not the sole determining factor. Culpability can also be assessed by looking at the frequency and duration of the breaches. In <span class="font-italic">Tay Yun </span><span class="font-italic">Chwan Henry v Chan Siew Lee Jannie </span>[2018] SGHC 181 (“<span class="font-italic">Tay Yun </span><span class="font-italic">Chwan</span>”), the defendant repeatedly breached a consent judgment which recorded a settlement between parties. She had been previously convicted and fined for similar acts. Hoo Sheau Peng J observed that the fine imposed in the previous set of committal proceedings had clearly failed to deter the defendant and there was a clear lack of remorse on her part (at [26]). The defendant’s breaches were also of a continuing nature. Her first breach occurred barely a month after settlement was reached and continued even after committal proceedings were commenced (at [18]–[20]). In light of her recalcitrance and persistent breaches, Hoo J sentenced the defendant to two weeks’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Higher culpability is also found where a contemnor takes little to no steps to purge his contempt (see <span class="font-italic">OCM Opportunities</span> at [36]). In <span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Sandipala Arthaputra v STMicroelectronics Asia Pacific Pte Ltd and others</span> [2018] 4 SLR 828 (“<span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Sandipala</span>”), the second and third defendants failed to attend court for EJD hearings on three occasions and had belatedly answered EJD questionnaires on their assets and income. They were sentenced to seven days’ imprisonment each. George Wei J was not satisfied that the pair had shown genuine remorse or had taken real and substantial steps to address their breaches (at [83]). Their answers to the EJD questionnaires were bare denials of assets and income with little information or details provided.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Another consideration is the ability of the contemnor to appreciate the seriousness of his breach. This is especially relevant in cases where lawyers have breached court orders. As officers of the court, there are serious consequences for practitioners who flout judicial authority. The plaintiff relied on the decision in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Meng Chai v Heng Chok Keng and Another </span>[2001] SGHC 33 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Meng Chai</span>”) where a sentence of four months was meted out. There, a lawyer evaded the production of trial documents and stakeholding moneys which had been entrusted to him. Chan Seng Onn JC, as he then was, discussed the defendant’s conduct in strong language, finding that he had relied on “lame excuses to ignore and flout the court orders” (at [106]) and had raised unmeritorious defences in the hope of delaying compliance. In the circumstances, a grave view had to be taken “of such utterly contemptuous and disgraceful conduct by an advocate and solicitor and an officer of the court” (at [106]). However, I was of the view that the facts in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Meng Chai</span> were different from the conduct of the first defendant and the case was of limited persuasive authority.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Besides the nature and circumstances surrounding the breach of court orders, the courts also look at what a contemnor has done post-breach. For instance, a contemnor who commits a breach which he then seeks to rectify would be looked upon more favourably. It would also reflect a lower degree of culpability (see [57] above). The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tay </span><span class="font-italic">Kar Oon </span>considered that a fine was appropriate on the facts because while the contempt had been sustained, it had also been substantially purged (at [58]). The contemnor in that case was an art dealer who had failed to procure a sculpture as requested for by the respondent. The respondent commenced an action for the recovery of the sums paid for the sculpture. Parties entered into a settlement agreement which the contemnor then breached. She also breached an injunction order, failed to attend an EJD hearing and failed to provide answers to the EJD questionnaire. During committal proceedings, the contemnor admitted liability for her acts of contempt. She completed the EJD questionnaire and disclosed missing bank statements and relevant correspondence. She also gave an undertaking to cooperate with the respondent and the respondent’s counsel. On the basis of this cooperation, the respondent was willing to withdraw committal proceedings against her (at [57] and [58]). Taking these developments collectively, a fine was sufficient punishment.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appropriate sentence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The plaintiff’s counsel, Ms Leong Yi-Ming, sought a custodial sentence of no less than five months, arguing that the first defendant’s conduct had been deliberate and contumelious. In response, Mr Joethy submitted that this was too long a duration and that seven days would be more appropriate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 At first blush, the first defendant’s behaviour exhibited several of the aggravating factors highlighted in the case law. His failure to comply with the Orders was deliberate and persisted over the course of several months. His explanations for such non-compliance were unconvincing. Further, he would have appreciated the seriousness of his conduct and the impact it would have had on the plaintiff’s business, having worked for the plaintiff for many years. However, there are two important considerations which mitigate his conduct. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The first is that the first defendant took steps to comply with the Orders. He did, in the months preceding the committal proceedings, offer up some of the relevant materials via the CDs. This degree of cooperation stands in contrast with the contemnors in <span class="font-italic">OCM Opportunities </span>and <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Meng Chai </span>who demonstrated total non-compliance with the Orders against them. I took this as a mitigating factor in the first defendant’s favour.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The second point relates to the degree of prejudice suffered by the plaintiff. The materials that were obtained and disseminated by the first defendant were of a high value; they were the plaintiff’s confidential information. Non-compliance by the first defendant was detrimental to the plaintiff’s business as its product formula files, raw material lists etc could be shared with market competitors. In this sense, the plaintiff’s position was analogous to the facts in <span class="font-italic">r</span><span class="font-italic">e Barrell</span>. However, unlike <span class="font-italic">r</span><span class="font-italic">e Barrell</span>, the plaintiff was in a better position to alleviate the harm it had sustained. Having conducted the forensic examination and being in possession of the first defendant’s Dropbox folder, the plaintiff was aware of <span class="font-italic">some</span> of the materials which had not been delivered up and disclosed by the first defendant. It could, at least to some extent, determine what information may have been compromised and take necessary measures. It is also likely that this knowledge may assist the plaintiff in establishing its losses against the defendants.      </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 There are two other points which make <span class="font-italic">r</span><span class="font-italic">e Barrell</span> a less useful precedent for sentencing in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 First, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mok</span><span class="font-italic"> Kah Hong</span> made the following observations at [105]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [W]e believe it is useful to refer to foreign cases not so much for benchmark sentences, but rather to discern the common factors that courts usually take into consideration in deciding the appropriate sentence to impose in each individual case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Although the Court of Appeal was referring to foreign cases dealing with contempt in matrimonial proceedings, there is no reason why such guidance does not apply more generally. Singapore has its own body of jurisprudence on the law of contempt. <span class="font-italic">r</span><span class="font-italic">e Barrell</span> can offer guidance on relevant sentencing factors but it should not be taken as authority for the actual sentence of six months. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Second, the rather convoluted facts of <span class="font-italic">r</span><span class="font-italic">e Barrell</span> also do not lend themselves to general application. For failing to deliver up the valuable securities, Pennycuick V.C made an order for the appellant’s committal. The order was stayed pending an appeal. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and the appellant went to prison. Subsequently, the appellant applied for a new trial of the committal proceedings on the basis of fresh evidence and an order for her release from custody. Brightman J refused to set aside the committal order. He also refused to release the appellant. By the time the appeal against the orders of Brightman J came before the Court of Appeal, the appellant had been in prison for six months. It was in the context of the second appeal that the Court of Appeal stated that it did not agree with the opinion of Pennycuick V.C that a month’s imprisonment was adequate punishment. The Court also stated that it did not consider that Brightman J was wrong in declining to order the release of the appellant (at [28C]). It considered that six months was “by no means excessive” but was “sufficient” (at [27E]). In as much as the clock could not be wound back to impose a sentence of between one and six months, I would prefer to confine the sentence in <span class="font-italic">r</span><span class="font-italic">e Barrell</span> to its unique facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Ultimately, sentencing remains a fact-sensitive exercise with the court’s discretion being guided by certain established considerations. I was not persuaded that the first defendant’s conduct necessitated a <span class="font-italic">lengthy</span> custodial sentence. Considering the confidential nature of the information involved, I found the first defendant’s behaviour to be of more gravity than the conduct of the contemnors in <span class="font-italic">Global Distressed Alpha</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">PT Sandipala</span>. I therefore determined that in this case, a sentence of 14 days’ imprisonment would be appropriate. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 For the reasons above, I found the first defendant to be guilty of contempt of court and imposed a sentence of 14 days’ imprisonment. I ordered costs to be paid by the first defendant to the plaintiff from the OA’s security deposit, fixed at $10,000, inclusive of disbursements.  </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Dedar Singh Gill  <br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Aaron Lee Teck Chye, Leong Yi-Ming and Marc Wenjie Malone (Allen &amp;

<p class="MsoNormal">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Decision of Judicial Commissioner Dedar
Singh Gill:</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Outcome: First
defendant found in breach of disclosure and delivery up orders made against
him, sentenced to 14 days’ imprisonment for contempt of court. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Background </span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">1          This
case arose out of an application by the plaintiff for an order of committal
against the first defendant for contempt of court. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">2          The
first defendant is a former employee of the plaintiff. He worked for the plaintiff
in two stints (from 1987 to 2002 and from 2012 to 2016). During his second
stint, the first defendant served as the plaintiff’s Myanmar production
manager, working with the second and third defendants in producing and
distributing the plaintiff’s products in Myanmar. In the course of his work,
the first defendant gained access to the plaintiff’s confidential and business
sensitive information. The first defendant resigned in September 2016. The
plaintiff subsequently discovered that he unlawfully accessed, downloaded and
copied its confidential information before disseminating the same to the second
and third defendants.            </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">3          On
6 July 2018, the plaintiff obtained judgment against the first defendant
pursuant to O 19 r 7 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed). The
first defendant was required to deliver up and disclose all of the plaintiff’s
confidential information in his possession, power, custody or control within
seven days of the judgment. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">4          The
plaintiff subsequently commenced committal proceedings against the first
defendant on the basis that the first defendant had failed to comply with the
orders against him. Whilst the first defendant had provided several CDs containing
relevant documents and correspondence, these CDs did not contain all of the
confidential information which had been taken. In response, the first defendant
asserted that he had delivered up all of the relevant materials in his possession.
He had deleted information that was no longer of use to him before he left the
plaintiff’s employ and was unable to deliver materials which he no longer
possessed. In respect of the disclosure order, the first defendant claimed that
he had not communicated any confidential information to third parties and there
was consequently nothing to disclose. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The court’s decision</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">5          The
High Court found that the first defendant had breached the delivery up and
disclosure orders. It was apparent that there were materials, which the first
defendant had conceded to accessing (at [32]), which were not handed over to
the plaintiff (at [36]). The first defendant did not take steps to remedy this
non-compliance (at [37]–[39]). Having conducted a forensic examination of the
first defendant’s computer, the plaintiff was also aware that there had been
communications amongst the defendants which were subject to the disclosure
order (at [41]). This directly contradicted the first defendant’s assertions.
There was also evidence that the first defendant had not deleted all of the
plaintiff’s confidential materials <em>before</em>
he resigned (at [43]–[44]). He retained these materials in his possession
post-resignation and was required to disclose this to the plaintiff. He failed
to do so.  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">6          In
respect of sentencing, the High Court considered that a custodial sentence should
be imposed to register the court’s disapproval of the first defendant’s conduct
(at [53]). The court took guidance from the non-exhaustive list of sentencing
considerations set out by the Court of Appeal in <em>Mok Kah Hong v Zheng Zhuan Yeo</em> [2016] 3 SLR 1. Bearing these
considerations in mind, the first defendant had breached these orders
deliberately over a period of several months. In the circumstances, a sentence
of 14 days’ imprisonment was appropriate. </span></p>
