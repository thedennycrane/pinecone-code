</div> In the Adjudication Response, CMC Ravenna justified its response amount of “(S$735,378.93)” by disputing CGW’s claimed amount of S$381,705.78 (inclusive of GST) and proposing deductions in the sum of S$1,076,815.22. In particular, the bulk of the deductions in the Adjudication Response comprised the liquidated damages in the sum of S$547,500.00 that CMC Ravenna had allegedly suffered due to CGW’s alleged delay in completing the Addendum works (“the Liquidated Damages Claim”).

Applications to set aside adjudication review determinations<span class="font-italic"> </span>have rarely arisen for our courts’ consideration: to the best of my knowledge, the only two decisions involving the setting aside of an adjudication review determination that have been issued in the High Court are the recent decisions of <span class="font-italic">Ang Cheng Guan Construction Pte Ltd v Corporate Residence Pte Ltd </span>[2017] 3 SLR 988 (“<span class="font-italic">Ang Cheng Guan</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Mataban</span><span class="font-italic"> Development Pte Ltd v Black Knight Warrior Pte Ltd </span>[2017] SGHCR 12 (“<span class="font-italic">Mataban</span><span class="font-italic"> Development</span>”). Also, the adjudication review procedure provided for under the SOPA has no statutory analogue in any of the other jurisdictions that have introduced similar regimes to expedite payments in the construction industry, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand: <span class="font-italic">Ang Cheng Guan </span>at [11], citing <span class="font-italic">SEF Construction Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Skoy Connected Pte Ltd </span>[2010] 1 SLR 733 (“<span class="font-italic">SEF Construction</span>”) at [24]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Having said that, the paucity of case law in this regard is not in itself a major concern because the grounds for setting aside adjudication review determinations are broadly similar to those for setting aside adjudication determinations, which have been the subject of numerous High Court and Court of Appeal decisions since the SOPA’s inception (see [36] below). Rather, what causes some difficulty is the identification of the precise grounds on which adjudication determinations may be set aside. I shall first turn to consider the law as it currently stands on the setting aside of <span class="font-italic">adjudication determinations</span>, before setting out the applicable legal principles in respect of the setting aside of <span class="font-italic">adjudication review determinations</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Setting aside adjudication determinations</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">No review on the merits</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The fundamental rule underlying the court’s role in hearing and determining an application to set aside an adjudication determination is that the court should not review the merits of the adjudicator’s decision: <span class="font-italic">Le</span><span class="font-italic">e Wee Lick Terence (alias Li Weili Terence) v Chua Say Eng (formerly trading as Weng Fatt Construction Engineering) and another appeal </span>[2013] 1 SLR 401 (“<span class="font-italic">Chua Say </span><span class="font-italic">Eng</span>”) at [66], citing <span class="font-italic">SEF Construction</span> ([19] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). This starting position follows from the fact that a court’s role in dealing with an application to set aside an adjudication determination is limited to exercising a <span class="font-italic">supervisory</span> function: see <span class="font-italic">Citiwall</span><span class="font-italic"> Safety Glass Pte Ltd v Mansource Interior Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 1 SLR 797 (“<span class="font-italic">Citiwall</span>”) at [41]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 This rule also comports with the policy objective underlying the SOPA, which is to facilitate cash flow in the building and construction industry by establishing “a fast and low cost adjudication system to resolve payment disputes”: <span class="font-italic">Chua Say </span><span class="font-italic">Eng </span>([21] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [2], citing <span class="font-italic">Singapore Par</span><span class="font-italic">liamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (16 November 2004) vol 78 at col 1112 (Cedric Foo Chee Keng, Minister of State for National Development) (“the second reading speech”). Any potential unfairness that might result from the quick resolution of payment claim disputes is meant to be tempered by the temporary finality that underpins the adjudication process, whereby any injustice in the adjudication outcomes may yet be redressed at a more thorough and deliberate forum like arbitration or litigation: see <span class="font-italic">Vinod Kumar </span><span class="font-italic">Ramgopal Didwania v Hauslab Design &amp; Build Pte Ltd </span>[2017] 1 SLR 890 at [31], citing <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel Construction Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Osko Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 3 SLR 380 (“<span class="font-italic">W Y </span><span class="font-italic">Steel</span>”) at [22]. It is thus consistent with the purpose of the SOPA for a court hearing a setting-aside application to refrain from looking into the merits of an adjudicator’s decision to determine if the adjudicator had arrived at the correct decision: see <span class="font-italic">Citiwall</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([21] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [48].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Permissible grounds of review</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 However, the critical question is what a court is entitled to review when hearing an application to set aside an adjudication determination. In this regard, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Citiwall</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([21] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) has held that a setting-aside application is only “concerned with the propriety of the [adjudication determination] itself (that is to say, with issues relating to the jurisdiction of the adjudicator, including non-compliance with the SOPA, and procedural propriety in the adjudication, including whether there was a breach of natural justice)” (at [49]). Although this accords with the general notion that a court must not review the merits of the adjudicator’s decision, the matters that a court is permitted to consider when hearing a setting-aside application remain unclear. I thus endeavour to set out, in the light of various Court of Appeal decisions that have been issued in this regard, the grounds on which a court may set aside an adjudication determination.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Breach of natural justice</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 First, a court has the power to set aside an adjudication determination for breach of natural justice. This ground is uncontroversial and stems from the statutory obligation imposed on an adjudicator under s 16(3) of the SOPA to “act independently, impartially and in a timely manner” (s 16(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)), as well as to “comply with the principles of natural justice” (s 16(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)): see <span class="font-italic">Citiwall</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([21] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [47], citing <span class="font-italic">SEF Construction </span>([19] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [45]. The principles of natural justice oblige the court to consider first whether the parties to the adjudication have been accorded a fair hearing and secondly whether the adjudicator has been independent and impartial in deciding the dispute: <span class="font-italic">UES Holdings Pte Ltd v KH </span><span class="font-italic">Foges Pte Ltd </span>[2017] SGHC 114 (“<span class="font-italic">Foges</span>”) at [28], quoting <span class="font-italic">Metropole Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Designshop Pte Ltd</span> [2017] SGHC 45 at [46].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Invalid appointment of adjudicator and non-compliance with important statutory requirements</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 A court also has the power to set aside an adjudication determination on the ground that an adjudicator was invalidly appointed, or when the claimant did not comply with important statutory requirements when making his adjudication application. This was the conclusion of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chua Say </span><span class="font-italic">Eng</span> ([21] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), where it was held (at [66]–[67]) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">66 Turning now to the court’s role in a setting-aside action, we agree with the holding in <span class="font-italic">SEF Construction</span> … that the court should not review the merits of an adjudicator’s decision. <span class="font-weight-bold">The court does, however, have the power to decide whether the adjudicator was validly appointed</span>. If there is no payment claim or service of a payment claim, the appointment of an adjudicator will be invalid, and the resulting adjudication determination would be null and void.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">67 Even if there is a payment claim and service of that payment claim, <span class="font-weight-bold">the court may still set aside the adjudication determination on the ground that the claimant, in the course of making an adjudication application, has not complied with one (or more) of the provisions under the </span><span class="font-weight-bold">[SOPA] which is so important that </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">it is the legislative purpose that an act done in breach of the provision should be invalid</span>, whether it is labelled as an essential condition or a mandatory condition. A breach of such a provision would result in the adjudication determination being invalid.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">These two discrete grounds on which a court may set aside an adjudication determination have been characterised by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Grouteam</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v UES Holdings Pte Ltd </span>[2016] 5 SLR 1011 (“<span class="font-italic">Grouteam</span>”) at [49] as errors that go towards an adjudicator’s jurisdiction (see [32] below). For this reason, I shall refer to these two grounds as “jurisdictional errors” in this judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 To facilitate a more nuanced understanding of the limits of these two jurisdictional errors, I now turn to examine the two distinct approaches undertaken in the Singapore courts at that time, which the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chua Say </span><span class="font-italic">Eng </span>([21] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) had to reconcile. The first was the approach taken by Judith Prakash J (as she then was) in three decisions she authored in quick succession, <span class="font-italic">Chip </span><span class="font-italic">Hup Hup Kee Construction Pte Ltd v Ssangyong Engineering &amp; Construction Co Ltd </span>[2010] 1 SLR 658 (“<span class="font-italic">Chip </span><span class="font-italic">Hup Hup Kee</span>”), <span class="font-italic">SEF Construction</span> ([19] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) and <span class="font-italic">AM Associates (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Laguna National Golf and Country Club Ltd </span>[2009] SGHC 260 (“<span class="font-italic">AM Associates</span>”). The second approach was that taken by Lee Seiu Kin J in <span class="font-italic">Sungdo</span><span class="font-italic"> Engineering &amp; Construction (S) Pte Ltd v Italcor Pte Ltd </span>[2010] 3 SLR 459 (“<span class="font-italic">Sungdo</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Out of the three decisions issued by Prakash J, most of the key principles expounded on by her were set out in <span class="font-italic">SEF Construction </span>([19] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>).

However, while Prakash J intended for the “basic requirements” to be exhaustive grounds under which a court is allowed to set aside an adjudication determination, Hodgson JA stated that the “basic and essential requirements” listed in his judgment (at [53]) were not meant to be exhaustive (at [55]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In <span class="font-italic">Sungdo</span> ([26] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), Lee J held (at [34]), in the context of setting aside an adjudication determination, that where a document does not purport to be a payment claim, the court would be entitled to set aside the adjudication determination. However, where a document purports to be a payment claim, the court would be entitled to review an adjudicator’s decision that the document indeed satisfies all the requirements of a payment claim only if the adjudicator’s findings are unreasonable in the sense as described in <span class="font-italic">Associated Provincial Picture Houses, Limited v </span><span class="font-italic">Wednesbury Corporation </span>[1948] 1 KB 223 (“<span class="font-italic">Wednesbury</span>”), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, <span class="font-italic">Wednesbury</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>unreasonable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chua Say </span><span class="font-italic">Eng </span>([21] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) reconciled the two approaches in <span class="font-italic">SEF Construction </span>([19] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) and in <span class="font-italic">Sungdo</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([26] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) by finding that they were addressing “different legal questions” (at [37]). According to the Court of Appeal (at [39] and [51]), Lee J in <span class="font-italic">Sungdo</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was addressing situations where the payment claim was either non-existent or had not been served at all. Hence, Lee J was dealing with the “threshold issue of competence” (at [37]) that went to the “validity of the appointment of the adjudicator” (at [31]). In so ruling, the Court of Appeal affirmed the holding in <span class="font-italic">Sungdo</span> that the court may set aside an adjudication determination where the payments claim is either non-existent or has not been served. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 On the other hand, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chua Say </span><span class="font-italic">Eng </span>([21] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) considered that Prakash J was addressing situations where the payment claim existed and had been served, but did not comply with all the requirements of the SOPA (at [39]). Hence, Prakash J was dealing with the “substantive issue of legality” (at [37]) that went to the “validity of the adjudication determination” (at [31]). However, in respect of situations of mere non-compliance with the SOPA, the Court of Appeal refrained from affirming Prakash J’s more restrictive interpretation of the essential conditions approach as laid down in <span class="font-italic">Brodyn</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([27] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). Instead, it went on to affirm the approach laid down by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chase Oyster Bar </span><span class="font-italic">Pty Ltd and Others v Hamo Industries Pty Ltd and Another</span> [2010] NSWCA 190 (“<span class="font-italic">Chase Oyster</span>”) at [37]–[38] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Spigelman CJ (“the legislative purpose test”), which provides that the court may set aside an adjudication determination, even if there was a payment claim and that payment claim was served, where a claimant fails to comply with a SOPA provision which is so important that it is the legislative purpose that an act done in breach of the provision should be invalid: see <span class="font-italic">Chua Say </span><span class="font-italic">Eng </span>at [67]. Under the legislative purpose test, in order to determine the legislative purpose of any SOPA provision in question, the court must consider the language of the SOPA provision, and the scope and object of the whole SOPA: see <span class="font-italic">Chua Say </span><span class="font-italic">Eng </span>at [40] and [52]–[53], citing <span class="font-italic">Chase Oyster </span>at [37]–[38].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The upshot of the <span class="font-italic">Chua Say </span><span class="font-italic">Eng </span>([21] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) decision is that in relation to situations where the payment claim is in existence and has been served, the Court of Appeal preferred the legislative purpose test to the essential conditions approach. This is clear given that the court in <span class="font-italic">Chase Oyster</span> ([30] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) had rejected the essential conditions approach laid down in <span class="font-italic">Brodyn</span> ([27] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). However, the “basic requirements” listed by Prakash J in <span class="font-italic">SEF Construction</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([19] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [45] remain relevant as <span class="font-italic">examples </span>of provisions that fulfil the legislative purpose test. In other words, the “basic requirements” listed in <span class="font-italic">SEF Construction </span>at [45] are examples of provisions that are so important that it is the legislative purpose that an act done in breach of those provisions should be invalid. This interpretation finds support in the Court of Appeal’s observation in <span class="font-italic">Chua Say </span><span class="font-italic">Eng </span>(at [61]) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… it seems to us in the context of the different provisions and structure of the [SOPA] (as compared with the NSW [SOPA]) that the characterisation of an essential condition in <span class="font-italic">Brodyn</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>… as a condition the breach of which would invalidate an adjudication is substantially the same as the characterisation of a mandatory condition in <span class="font-italic">Chase Oyster </span>the breach of which would lead to the same result.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 To conclude, where a payment claim does not exist or is not served at all, the appointment of the adjudicator would be invalid because there would be no basis at all for the adjudicator to be appointed in the first place. The adjudicator would thus lack <span class="font-italic">jurisdiction at the threshold</span>. Conversely, even where a payment claim exists or has been served, if the claimant fails to comply with a provision of the SOPA that is so important that it is the legislative purpose that an act done in breach of the provision should be invalid, the adjudication determination would be found to be invalid as a substantive matter because there would be no basis for the adjudicator to act or come to any determination binding on the parties concerned. The adjudicator would thus lack <span class="font-italic">substantive jurisdiction</span>. Examples of such important SOPA provisions include the “basic requirements” listed in <span class="font-italic">SEF Construction </span>([19] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [45]. An adjudicator determination may be set aside on the ground of either of these jurisdictional errors: see <span class="font-italic">Grouteam</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([25] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [49].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Patent error on the face of the record</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Finally, a court also has the power to set aside an adjudication determination on the ground that a patent error on the face of the record has been committed. This ground, by allowing a court to look into the substance of the adjudicator’s decision, might appear to contravene the cardinal rule that a court is not to engage in a review of the merits of the adjudicator’s decision. However, this danger is regulated by the highly circumscribed manner in which a “patent error” has been defined by the courts: an adjudicator would be considered to have committed a patent error only if he commits errors that are plain and evident on the face of the material that has been properly placed before the adjudicator and which he is permitted and, indeed, obliged to consider: see <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel </span>([22] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [51] and [54]. Put in another way, for an error committed by the adjudicator to be considered a “patent” error, it must be “easily recognisable” or “obvious”, such that it would have been incumbent on the adjudicator to avoid such an error had he considered the material properly placed before him: see <span class="font-italic">Kingsford Construction Pte Ltd v A Deli Construction Pte Ltd and another matter</span> [2017] SGHC 174 (“<span class="font-italic">Kingsford</span>”) at [35], quoted with approval in <span class="font-italic">OGSP Engineering Pte Ltd v Comfort Management Pte Ltd </span>[2017] SGHC 247 (“<span class="font-italic">OGSP</span>”) at [23].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Conclusion</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I note in passing that another possible ground on which courts have previously held that it is possible to set aside an adjudication determination is where the adjudication determination has been obtained by fraud: <span class="font-italic">OGSP </span>([33] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [37]; see also <span class="font-italic">Mansource</span><span class="font-italic"> Interior Pte Ltd v Citiwall Safety Glass Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 3 SLR 264 at [31] and <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel Construction Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Osko Pte Ltd</span> [2012] SGHC 194 at [7]. However, the Court of Appeal has thus far neither affirmed nor rejected fraud as a valid setting-aside ground: see <span class="font-italic">OGSP </span>at [34]–[35]. Given that this ground was not raised in this matter, I refrain from expressing a view on whether fraud should indeed be a valid setting-aside ground and leave this to be dealt with by another court with the benefit of comprehensive submissions in this regard.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The role of a court in hearing and determining an application to set aside an adjudication determination may thus be conveniently restated as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) When considering an application to set aside an adjudication determination, the court should not review the merits of the adjudicator’s decision (see [21]–[22] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) However, the court has the power to set aside the adjudication determination if:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The adjudicator has acted in breach of the principles of natural justice (see [24] above);</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) The adjudicator was not validly appointed because the payment claim does not exist or was not served at all, which causes the adjudicator to lack<span class="font-italic"> </span>jurisdiction at the threshold (see [32] above);</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Even if the adjudicator was validly appointed, the claimant, in the course of making an adjudication application, has not complied with one (or more) of the provisions under the SOPA which is so important that it is the legislative purpose that an act done in breach of the provision should be invalid, which causes the adjudicator to lack<span class="font-italic"> </span>substantive jurisdiction (see [32] above); or</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) The adjudicator commits a patent error on the face of the record (see [33] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Examples of the provisions under the SOPA that are considered so important that it is the legislative purpose that an act done in breach of the provision should be invalid include (see [27] and [31] above):</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) the existence of a contract between the claimant and the respondent, to which the SOPA applies (s 4);</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) the fulfilment of the formal requirements by the claimant when effecting service of a payment claim on the respondent (s 10);</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) the making of an adjudication application by the claimant to an authorised nominating body (s 13);</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) the reference of the application to an eligible adjudicator who agrees to determine the adjudication application (s 14); and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(v) the determination by the adjudicator of the application within the specified period by determining the adjudicated amount (if any) to be paid by the respondent to the claimant; the date on which the adjudicated amount is payable; the interest payable on the adjudicated amount and the proportion of the costs payable by each party to the adjudication (ss 17(1) and (2)).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Setting aside adjudication review determinations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In my view, the principles set out above regarding the setting aside of adjudication determinations should apply with equal force, albeit with suitable modifications, to the setting aside of adjudication review determinations for the following reasons: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, applications to set aside adjudication review determinations are brought under the exact same provision as applications to set aside adjudication determinations, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, s 27(5) of the SOPA. Section 27(5) only expressly refers to a “party to an adjudication [commencing] proceedings to set aside the adjudication determination or the judgment obtained”, and an “adjudication determination” is defined under s 2 to, “in relation to an adjudication, [mean] the determination of the adjudicator”. However, s 2 defines an “adjudication” to include “an adjudication review”, and also defines an “adjudicator” to include “a review adjudicator or a panel of review adjudicators appointed under s 18(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)”. Accordingly, the setting aside of an “adjudication determination” referred to in s 27(5) should also include the setting aside of a determination of a review adjudicator or a panel of review adjudicators.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, review adjudicators are empowered under s 19(5) of the SOPA to determine almost precisely the same matters as adjudicators are empowered to determine under s 17(2), such that review adjudicators are effectively entitled to “reconsider the findings of facts as well as the application of legal principles to those findings of fact”: <span class="font-italic">SEF Construction </span>([19] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [23]. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, adjudication review determinations have the same temporarily binding quality of adjudication determinations. This is evident from s 21 of the SOPA, which provides that an adjudication determination shall be binding on parties to the adjudication unless or until leave of the court to enforce the adjudication determination is refused, the dispute is finally determined by a court or tribunal or at any other dispute resolution proceeding, or the dispute is settled by agreement of the parties (s 21(1)), and that an adjudication review determination “shall have effect as if it were an adjudication determination for the purposes of [the SOPA]” (s 21(2)). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Finally, Prakash J in <span class="font-italic">SEF Construction </span>([19] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) has also implicitly recognised (at [45(g)]) that an adjudication review determination “may be treated by the court in a similar manner as if it were an adjudication determination”: <span class="font-italic">Mataban</span><span class="font-italic"> Development </span>([19] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [29].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 It thus stands to reason that the principles set out above (at [34]) could be suitably modified for the purposes of delineating the court’s role in setting aside adjudication review determinations. I restate them in the following manner:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) When considering an application to set aside an adjudication review determination, the court should not review the merits of the review adjudicator’s decision.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) However, the court has the power to set aside the adjudication review determination if:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The review adjudicator has acted in breach of the principles of natural justice;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) The review adjudicator was not validly appointed, which causes the review adjudicator to lack<span class="font-italic"> </span>jurisdiction at the threshold;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Even if the review adjudicator was validly appointed, the respondent in the adjudication, in the course of making an adjudication review application, has not complied with one (or more) of the provisions under the SOPA which is so important that it is the legislative purpose that an act done in breach of the provision should be invalid, which causes the review adjudicator to lack<span class="font-italic"> </span>substantive jurisdiction; or</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) The review adjudicator commits a patent error on the face of the record.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I now proceed to deal with each of the identified issues in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Having carefully considered the parties’ submissions and the authorities cited in support thereof, I find against CGW on both issues. In the result, I dismiss the Setting Aside Application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Appointment Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 CGW’s first contention for the setting aside of the Review Determination is that the Review Adjudicator lacks the jurisdiction to hear and determine the Review Application because a panel of three review adjudicators, instead of a single review adjudicator, should have been appointed pursuant to s 18(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SOPA read with reg 10(3) of the SOPR. Two questions arise from this contention: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether the SMC’s appointment of the wrong number of review adjudicators is a jurisdictional error; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether the SMC should have appointed three review adjudicators to hear and determine the Review Application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I find that the Review Adjudicator had the jurisdiction to hear and determine the Review Application. In my judgment, although the ANB’s appointment of the wrong number of review adjudicators is a jurisdictional error, the SMC had rightly appointed a single review adjudicator to hear and determine the Review Application in this case. Hence, the Review Determination should not be set aside on this ground.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the ANB’s appointment of the wrong number of review adjudicators is a jurisdictional error </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 At the outset, I note that it was common ground between both CGW and CMC Ravenna that if CGW managed to show that the SMC had appointed the wrong number of review adjudicators, the Review Determination would be liable to be set aside (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the SMC’s appointment of the wrong number of review adjudicators is a jurisdictional error). CMC Ravenna did not seriously contest this point of law, while CGW expressly asserted in its submissions that if it managed to show that the SMC should have appointed a panel of three review adjudicators instead of a sole review adjudicator under reg 10(3) of the SOPR, then the Review Adjudicator would clearly “not have jurisdiction” to hear and determine the Review Application.

</div> Therefore, it is strictly unnecessary for me to determine which <span class="font-italic">type</span> of jurisdictional error the appointment of the wrong number of review adjudicators would fall under (see [35(b)(ii)] and [35(b)(iii)] above). Nevertheless, for the purposes of clarity, I shall proceed to consider whether the ANB’s appointment of the wrong number of review adjudicators would cause the review adjudicator to lack jurisdiction at the threshold or lack substantive jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In my view, if the ANB appoints the wrong number of review adjudicators, the review adjudicator would lack jurisdiction <span class="font-italic">at the threshold</span> to hear and determine the adjudication review application because the appointment of the review adjudicator would be invalid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I first set out the provisions relevant to the appointment of review adjudicators by the ANB.

On the contrary, there are still facets of the ANB’s role in the appointment process that are pivotal to the validity of the appointment of an adjudicator or review adjudicator.

This should then cause the adjudicator to lack jurisdiction at the threshold. More importantly for our purposes, s 18(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) read with s 18(7)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) both incorporate these mandatory requirements under s 14(1) for the purposes of the appointment of review adjudicators.

This, pursuant to reg 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPR, would require a single review adjudicator to be appointed. In aid of this reading of “relevant response amount”, CMC Ravenna relied on the definition of “response amount” under s 2 of the SOPA to argue that the “relevant response amount” under reg 10(3) of the SOPR cannot carry a negative value because CGW cannot possibly propose to pay a negative value.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I accept CMC Ravenna’s contention that the “relevant response amount” under reg 10(3) of the SOPR cannot carry a negative value. This is first evident from the plain and literal reading of the definition of “response amount” under s 2 of the SOPA, which defines a “response amount” as “the amount that a respondent <span class="font-italic">proposes to pay</span> to a claimant in a payment response” [emphasis added]. Interpreting “relevant response amount” under reg 10(3) of the SOPR to include negative values would do violence to the express wording of the definition of “response amount” under s 2 of the SOPA because, as submitted by CMC Ravenna, it is not logically possible for a respondent to <span class="font-italic">propose to pay</span> a negative amount to a claimant. In other words, the definition of “response amount” under s 2 of the SOPA clearly envisages a “relevant response amount” under reg 10(3) of the SOPR to carry only positive values or a nil value but not a negative value.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Next, it is trite that statutory provisions ought to, as much as possible, be construed as a harmonious whole with the other provisions in the same statute or related subsidiary legislation. I thus find it telling that the interpretation of “relevant response amount” advanced by CMC Ravenna also makes eminent sense when read alongside reg 6(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the SOPR, which provides that every “payment response provided in relation to a construction contract shall … state ‘nil’ where the respondent does not <span class="font-italic">propose to pay</span> any part of the claimed amount and the reasons therefor” [emphasis added]. Put in another way, reg 6(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) categorically states that where a respondent does not propose to pay any part of the amount claimed by a claimant whatsoever, he or she is supposed to state “nil”, as opposed to any possible negative amount. In my view, there is thus much force in the argument that the “relevant response amount” under reg 10(3) of the SOPR is not intended to carry negative values.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The final nail in the coffin of the assertion that the “relevant response amount” under reg 10(3) of the SOPR can carry negative values comes from the clear parliamentary intention in respect of the provisions providing for adjudication review. In his speech for the second reading of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Bill 2004 (No 54 of 2004), the Minister of State for National Development made the following observations about the adjudication process (the second reading speech at col 1117):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Adjudication does not require the consent of both parties to proceed. The entire process will be completed within three weeks after application unless the parties agree to a longer period. The adjudicator will determine the amount to be paid by the respondent to the claimant, the pay-by date and the adjudication fees payable by both parties. The adjudicator’s decision on the particular progress payment in dispute is binding. <span class="font-italic">The respondent could apply for the decision to be reviewed only if the adjudicated sum differs by more than $100,000 from the amount that he is </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">willing to pay </span><span class="font-italic">in his response to the claimant</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">To my mind, the Minister of State’s express recognition that the response amount for the purposes of an adjudication review application is the amount that the respondent is <span class="font-italic">willing to pay</span> in his response to the claimant confirms that the “relevant response amount” under reg 10(3) of the SOPR must be a positive figure or a nil figure when he is not willing to pay anything.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In contrast, I find the arguments advanced by CGW in support of the “relevant response amount” being “(S$735,378.93)” to be unconvincing. First, CGW’s main contention that the “relevant response amount” must be the exact amount stated in the original payment response in question is question-begging. CGW argued that the “relevant response amount” that the SMC ought to have considered when deciding on the number of review adjudicators to appoint should have been the response amount referred to in PR 16, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “(S$735,378.93)”. In my view, although the definition of “response amount” under s 2 of the SOPA does indeed make an express reference to “the amount that a respondent proposes to pay to a claimant in a <span class="font-italic">payment response</span>” [emphasis added], it ultimately begs the question of whether a “relevant response amount” is indeed intended to be capable of carrying a negative value. While CGW’s argument might demonstrate that the response amount should be consistent throughout the entire adjudication process, it leaves us none the wiser regarding what exactly the response amount in the original payment response ought to be in the first place.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I also do not accept CGW’s second contention, which is that the adjudication process clearly contemplates the prospect of the “relevant response amount” being a negative figure because the provisions pertaining to payment responses and adjudication responses under the SOPA and the SOPR (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, ss 11(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and 15(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA and reg 6(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the SOPR) expressly recognise the possibility of sums being withheld by respondents. In my view, this argument is a <span class="font-italic">non sequitur</span>. To illustrate the fallacy underlying this argument, I first set out the provisions referred to by CGW. Sections 11(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) and 15(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the SOPA read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Payment responses, etc.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">11.—</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) A payment response provided in relation to a construction</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">contract —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) shall <span class="font-italic">state, </span>where the response amount is less than the claimed amount, the reason for the difference and <span class="font-italic">the reason for any amount withheld</span>; …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Adjudication responses</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">15.—</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) The respondent shall not include in the adjudication response, and the adjudicator shall not consider, <span class="font-italic">any reason for withholding any amount, including but not limited to any cross-claim, counterclaim and set-off</span>, unless —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) where the adjudication relates to a construction contract, the <span class="font-italic">reason was included in the relevant payment response provided by the respondent to the claimant</span>; …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Regulation 6(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the SOPR reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Payment responses in relation to construction contracts</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">6.—</span>(1) Every payment response provided in relation to a construction contract shall —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) where the response amount is less than the claimed amount—</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) contain the amount that the respondent proposes to pay for each item constituting the claimed amount, the reasons for the difference in any of the items and the calculations which show how the amount that the respondent proposes to pay is derived; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) <span class="font-italic">contain any amount that is being withheld, the reason for doing so and the calculations which show how the amount being withheld is derived</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It is true that all three provisions highlighted above suggest that the SOPA and the SOPR clearly contemplate that there will be amounts withheld in a payment response that are independent of the items in the payment claim, and which may take the form of cross-claims, counterclaims or set-offs. However, in my view, just because these provisions state that a payment response may be accompanied by the <span class="font-italic">reasons</span> for any withheld amount, it does not <span class="font-italic">ipso </span><span class="font-italic">facto</span> follow that the response amount can carry a negative value. In particular, both s 11(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the SOPA and reg 6(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the SOPR merely provide for the content of the payment response in the specific event “where the response amount is less than the claimed amount”. Nothing is said about whether the response amount can indeed take on a negative value. Therefore, in asserting that these provisions show that the adjudication process contemplates that the response amount can carry negative values, CGW is overstating their effect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Finally, I also reject CGW’s third contention. CGW argued that it is an accepted practice for the response amount in the payment response to be reflected as a negative value, as evinced by the following cases: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Foges</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([24] <span class="font-italic">supra </span>at [4]), the payment response amount was negative S$91,371.23;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel Construction Pte Ltd v Tycoon Construction Pte Ltd (in liquidation) </span>[2016] SGHC 80 (at [3]), the payment response amount was negative S$666,382.89; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In <span class="font-italic">Quanta Industries Pte Ltd v Strategic Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 2 SLR 70 (at [3]), the payment response amount was negative S$155,891.63; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) In <span class="font-italic">Tienrui</span><span class="font-italic"> Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd v G &amp; Y Trading and Manufacturing Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 5 SLR 852 (at [8]), the payment response amount was negative S$186,774.96; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) In <span class="font-italic">JRP &amp; Associates Pte Ltd v Kindly Construction &amp; Services Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 3 SLR 575 (at [5]), the payment response amount was negative S$220,009.37; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) In <span class="font-italic">Newcon</span><span class="font-italic"> Builders Pte Ltd v Sino New Steel Pte Ltd </span>[2015] SGHC 226 (at [81]), the payment response amount was negative S$149,587.18. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">To my mind, the cited cases are by no means indicative of whether the response amount can carry a negative value. None of the cases cited by CGW turned on whether the payment response amounts could take on negative values, and therefore no arguments were canvassed on this point. Accordingly, I do not think that any weight ought to be placed on the mere fact that the courts in those cases did not question whether the response amounts stated in the payment responses should not have shown negative values. In my judgment, the negative amounts that all the respondents had posted in the cases cited by CGW, just like CMC Ravenna had done in this case, were merely meant to provide the <span class="font-italic">reason</span> for the respective respondents’ refusal to pay the <span class="font-italic">whole</span> of the amounts claimed by the respective claimants. At the end of the day, the respondents in those cases, including CMC Ravenna in this case, proposed to pay the claimants nothing. Hence, the response amount posted should be regarded as “Nil”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Therefore, I take the view that the SMC was correct to consider the “relevant response amount” to be “Nil” in this case. As the adjudicated amount of S$340,515.61 (plus GST) exceeds the effectively “Nil” relevant response amount by more than S$100,000 but less than S$1m, I thus find that the SMC had rightfully appointed a single review adjudicator to hear and determine the Review Application under reg 10(3) of the SOPR. Accordingly, CGW’s Setting Aside Application fails on this ground.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Misdirection Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 CGW’s second ground of contention for setting aside the Review Determination is that even if the Review Adjudicator had jurisdiction to hear and determine the Review Application, he had misdirected himself on a point of law. Again, I reject CGW’s submissions and find that the Review Determination should not be set aside on this ground. In my judgment, courts should be precluded from evaluating whether a review adjudicator had misdirected himself on a point of law, especially one that relates to the manner of his substantive determination of the quantum of the adjudicated amount. This is because reviewing an adjudication review determination for a misdirection on a point of law or fact (as the case may be) that affects the quantification or assessment of the adjudicated amount would amount to an impermissible intrusion of the court into a review of the merits of the review adjudicator’s decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 CGW submitted that an adjudication review determination may be set aside if the review adjudicator had misdirected himself on a point of law by taking into account irrelevant considerations and not taking into consideration relevant matters. In support of this contention, CGW relied heavily on the recent High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Ang Cheng Guan </span>([19] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) (at [35]–[46]).

</div> On the facts, CGW argued that the Review Adjudicator had misdirected himself on a point of law in respect of the Liquidated Damages Claim. According to CGW, the Review Adjudicator, in deciding that there was a clear contractual completion date on 24 December 2015 for the purposes of the Liquidated Damages Claim, had mistakenly failed to consider: (a) the context in which the word “months” was used in the Addendum; (b) the nature of CGW’s subcontract works; and (c) the context in which the Addendum was signed. Accordingly, the Review Adjudicator had supposedly made a mistake in contractual interpretation, which is a mistake in law: <span class="font-italic">Lim Chin San Contractors </span><span class="font-italic">Pte Ltd v LW Infrastructure Pte Ltd </span>[2011] 4 SLR 455 at [49]–[50].

</div> In response, CMC Ravenna simply submitted that the Review Determination may not be set aside just because the Review Adjudicator had misdirected himself on a point of law, given that doing so would involve reviewing the merits of the Review Determination.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I find myself in agreement with CMC Ravenna’s submissions. In my view, it should not be open to this court to set aside the Review Determination on the basis that the Review Adjudicator had misdirected himself on the point of law as set out by CGW. By evaluating whether the Review Adjudicator had failed to take into account relevant matters or had taken into account irrelevant matters in respect of the Liquidated Damages Claim, which thereby affected his determination of the quantum of the adjudicated sum, this court would effectively be reviewing the merits of the Review Adjudicator’s decision. It cannot be gainsaid that this is clearly prohibited (see [21]–[22] and [37(a)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I also do not think that the <span class="font-italic">Ang Cheng Guan </span>([19] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) decision cited by CGW is persuasive authority for conducting an evaluation of whether the Review Adjudicator in this case had misdirected himself on a point of law. In <span class="font-italic">Ang Cheng Guan</span>, the respondent had engaged the claimant to carry out works. In the adjudication brought by the claimant, the adjudicator was to determine, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, whether the claimant was entitled to an extension of time, whether liquidated damages were wrongfully imposed, and whether amounts were payable to the claimant for work done and prolongation claims. The adjudicator found in favour of the claimant. The respondent thus applied for an adjudication review, seeking a review of two of the adjudicator’s determinations. Two issues were framed (“Respondent’s Issues”). However, at the adjudication review, the claimant was also dissatisfied with the adjudicator’s determinations, and submitted three issues for the review adjudicator’s determination (“Claimant’s Issues”). The review adjudicator took the view that his jurisdiction was limited to determining only the Respondent’s Issues, and hence did not consider the Claimant’s Issues that were not inextricably linked to the Respondent’s Issues. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 When the claimant applied to set aside the adjudication review, Lee Seiu Kin J held that the review adjudicator ought to have reviewed the entire adjudication determination, and not only the Respondent’s Issues. In Lee J’s view, the review adjudicator, in considering only the Respondent’s Issues, had misdirected himself in a point of law and had as a result failed to take into consideration a very relevant matter, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Claimant’s Issues (at [38] and [44]). Accordingly, Lee J set aside the adjudication review determination on this basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In arriving at his conclusion that a court could set aside an adjudication review determination on the basis of a wrong direction as to law, Lee J first cited with approval the <span class="font-italic">Wednesbury</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>case ([28] <span class="font-italic">supra </span>at [39]), and proceeded to rely on various other UK and Singapore cases expounding on the principles of the illegality head of review under administrative law (at [40]–[43]). With respect, I disagree with the approach taken in <span class="font-italic">Ang Cheng Guan</span> ([19] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). None of these cases were decided pursuant to the setting aside provisions under the SOPA or its statutory equivalent in the UK. Accordingly, they clearly fail to account for the unique policy reasons underpinning the SOPA regime that justify the highly circumscribed scope of review currently permitted in setting-aside applications under the SOPA (see [21]–[22] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Lee J also referred to the New South Wales Supreme Court cases of <span class="font-italic">Musico</span><span class="font-italic"> and Others v Davenport and Another </span>[2003] NSWSC 977 (“<span class="font-italic">Musico</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Multiplex Constructions Pty </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd v Luikens and Another </span>[2003] NSWSC 1140 (“<span class="font-italic">Multiplex</span>”) in order to reinforce his conclusion in <span class="font-italic">Ang Cheng Guan </span>([19] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) that a court may consider whether a review adjudicator had misdirected himself on a point of law in an application for the setting aside of adjudication review determinations. Specifically, both decisions purported to stand for the proposition that a court may set aside a decision of an administrative tribunal if the administrative tribunal has fallen into an error of law by, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, failing to take into account something that ought to have been considered or basing its decision on something that it ought not to have taken into account (<span class="font-italic">Ang Cheng Guan </span>at [45]–[46]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 However, I am of the view that these two cases are also of limited utility for two reasons. First, they were decided before the New South Wales Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Brodyn</span> ([27] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) was decided. <span class="font-italic">Brodyn</span> went on to overturn the positions in <span class="font-italic">Musico</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([68] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) and <span class="font-italic">Multiplex </span>([68] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) by introducing the essential conditions approach (at [52]–[55] and [59]). Although, as I have earlier noted (see [30] above), the court in <span class="font-italic">Chase Oyster </span>([30] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) subsequently rejected the essential conditions approach laid down in <span class="font-italic">Brodyn</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>this was on the specific ground that <span class="font-italic">Brodyn</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>purported to, for the purposes of the NSW SOPA, entirely replace the dichotomy between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors with the essential conditions approach: see <span class="font-italic">Chase Oyster </span>at [27]–[32] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Spigelman CJ. It was for this reason that Spigelman CJ rejected the essential conditions approach, and instead went on to define the test for determining what would constitute a jurisdictional error in the terms as set out in the legislative purpose test: see <span class="font-italic">Chase Oyster </span>at [37]–[38]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Second, it is crucial to note that in laying out the legislative purpose test in <span class="font-italic">Chase Oyster </span>([30] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), Spigelman CJ clearly refrained from importing wholesale all conceivable forms of errors of law that a court supervising an administrative tribunal would traditionally consider, which had been the approach adopted in both <span class="font-italic">Musico</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([68] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) and <span class="font-italic">Multiplex </span>([68] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). In <span class="font-italic">Musico</span>, McDougall J affirmed (at [50] and [52]) the holding of the High Court of Australia in <span class="font-italic">Craig v The State of South Australia </span>(1995) 184 CLR 163 (at 179) that a court may set aside the decision of an administrative tribunal where it “falls into an error of law which causes it to identify a wrong issue, to ask itself a wrong question, to ignore relevant material, to rely on irrelevant material or, at least in some circumstances to make an erroneous finding or to reach a mistaken conclusion”. In <span class="font-italic">Multiplex</span>, Palmer J cited with affirmation (at [34]) the holding of the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Anisminic</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Foreign Compensation Commission</span> [1969] 2 AC 14 (at 171) that a tribunal’s decision would be a nullity if, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, it “refused to take into account something which it was required to take into account … [or] based its decision on some matter which, under the provisions setting it up, it had no right to take into account”. Conversely, Spigelman CJ in <span class="font-italic">Chase Oyster </span>consciously set out a test that ensured a scrupulous fidelity to the language and purpose of the NSW SOPA. The legislative purpose test laid down in <span class="font-italic">Chase Oyster </span>has since become a permanent fixture in our local SOPA jurisprudence when it was accepted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chua Say </span><span class="font-italic">Eng </span>([21] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [67]. It thus stands to reason that the positions adopted by the courts in <span class="font-italic">Musico</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Multiplex </span>have little jurisprudential value, if at all.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Ultimately, mere errors of law or fact that relate to the determination of the quantum of the adjudicated sum should not be considered errors that permit a setting aside by the court of the adjudication review determination under the SOPA as it would amount to a review of the merits of the adjudication review determination by the backdoor. Accordingly, I am of the view that courts may not consider whether a review adjudicator has misdirected himself on a point of law, especially one that affects the review adjudicator’s substantive determination of the quantum of the adjudicated sum. I thus find against CGW on the Misdirection Issue. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72   For all of the reasons stated above, I dismiss the Setting Aside Application.
