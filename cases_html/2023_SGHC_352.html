They entered into an oral agreement on 8 October 2012 for the claimants to invest in a mixed-use development known as the Permas City Development located in Johor Bahru, Malaysia (the “Permas City Development”). The terms of the oral agreement form the subject of strenuous contention by the parties in OC 385, but it is not disputed that pursuant to this agreement the claimants had on the same day paid an investment sum of RM2,307,744.74 to a Malaysian-registered company (of which the first defendant is a director and majority shareholder) which was the main developer for the Permas City Development. In OC 385, the claimants assert that the defendants had breached the terms of the oral agreement between them, including by failing to ensure that the construction of the Permas City Development would be completed in a profitable manner and by failing to repay the investment sum of RM2,307,744.74 to the claimants. The claimants also bring an alternative claim in the tort of negligence alleging that the defendants had made certain representations as to the guaranteed profitability of investing in the Permas City Development and that the defendants had breached their duty of care by failing to advise and inform the claimants of the risks involved before the parties had entered into the oral agreement on 8 October 2012.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In response, the defendants filed a defence stating that the Singapore courts should not exercise their jurisdiction to hear the action and that all proceedings in OC 385 should be stayed.

Under Stage One, the court searches for those incidences (or connections) that have the most relevant and substantial associations with the dispute. Factors that may be considered include: (i) the personal connections of the parties and witnesses; (ii) connections to relevant events and transactions; (iii) the applicable law to the dispute; (iv) the existence of proceedings elsewhere; and (v) the shape of the litigation. The process is not mechanical; a court has to take into account an entire multitude of factors in balancing the competing interests: see also <span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments Ltd and another v Nicolai Baron von </span><span class="font-italic">Uexkull</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 377 (“<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments</span>”) at [15].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, if the court concludes that there is a more appropriate forum, then the court will ordinarily grant a stay unless there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nonetheless not be granted (“Stage Two”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In <span class="font-italic">Rappo</span>, the Court of Appeal further emphasised (at [70] and [72]) that it is the <span class="font-italic">quality </span>of the connecting factors that is crucial in this analysis, rather than the quantity of factors on each side of the scale.

The Claimants allege that there were various meetings in Singapore between these two parties between October 2011 to October 2012 prior to the Oral Agreement being entered into.

</div> However, apart from these screenshots which, I would note, do not shed light in any way on the previous business dealings between Mr Sugiarto and Mr Hendro Tok, the Claimants have not otherwise substantiated the bare assertion that such previous dealings took place in Singapore, or even given particulars of the dealings. In any event, whether such “historical dealings” took place in Singapore or not is not entirely relevant to the circumstances surrounding the inception of the Oral Agreement. It is not disputed that the Oral Agreement was made orally and there is no suggestion that Mr Sugiarto or Mr Hendro Tok was in Singapore at the material time. I therefore decline to place any weight on this proposed factor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Lastly, I also decline to place much weight on the proposed factor that Mr Tan, being a citizen of and resident in Singapore, has suffered damage in Singapore. In <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi Anil </span><span class="font-italic">Salgaocar v Jhaveri Darsan Jitendra</span> [2019] 2 SLR 372 (“<span class="font-italic">Lakshmi</span>”), the Court of Appeal considered (at [85]) that limited weight ought to be placed on the factor of the place of breach given that it <span class="font-italic">assumes </span>that the plaintiff’s claim has been made out.  Likewise, I consider that the fact of Mr Tan suffering damage in Singapore presupposes that there has been a breach, and it should therefore be given limited weight in the overall analysis. I should add that the fact that the second Claimant, Mr Sugiarto, suffered damage in Indonesia (if the claimants’ case is found at trial to be made out) and this would further dilute whatever weight that could be given on this score.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Governing law of the Oral Agreement </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I consider the governing law of the Oral Agreement to be a factor pointing to Malaysia, subject to the qualification expressed at [55] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 To recapitulate, the Claimants submit that Singapore law applies by default as the <span class="font-italic">lex </span><span class="font-italic">fori </span>whereas the Defendants argue that Malaysian law governs the Oral Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 It is well-accepted that the court applies a three-step approach to determine the governing law of a contract (see <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd v S Y Technology Inc and another appeal</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 491 (“<span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span>”) at [36], citing <span class="font-italic">Overseas Union Insurance Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Turegum Insurance Co </span>[2001] 2 SLR(R) 285 at [82]). At the first stage, the court considers whether the parties had expressly chosen a governing law. If there is no express choice made by the parties, the court considers at the second stage whether the intention of the parties as to the governing law can be inferred from the circumstances. If the court is unable to infer the parties’ intentions, it proceeds to the third stage where the court assesses which system of law the contract has the closest and most real connection with the contract in question and the circumstances surrounding the inception of that contract. This is the same as the objective test of what the reasonable man ought to have intended if he had thought about the matter at the time when he made the contract for the dispute to be determined “in the most convenient way and in accordance with business efficacy” (<span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation </span>at [47] and [49]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Applying the three-stage approach, it is clear that there was no express law to the Oral Agreement. Moving on to the second stage, I begin by noting that the place of contracting is regarded as “generally not important in determining the governing law of a contract, except, perhaps, where the contract is to be performed in that country” (<span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation </span>at [43], citing <span class="font-italic">Chatenay</span><span class="font-italic"> v The Brazilian Submarine Telegraph Company, Limited </span>[1891] 1 QB 79).

</div> I set out the factors identified in <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation </span>at [37] and [43]–[44] that are relevant to the present case as follows:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the commercial purpose of the transaction;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the currency of the contract or the currency for payment; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) the places of residence or business of the parties.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The first factor is the commercial purpose of the transaction, which for much the same reasons as set out at [37] above, clearly points to Malaysia. The very subject matter of the Oral Agreement concerned financing the construction of the Phase Two development that is located in Johor Bahru, Malaysia.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 With this in mind, even if the Oral Agreement was largely concluded in Singapore, this bore no particular relation to the place of performance of the Oral Agreement. With the parties based across various jurisdictions, it is equally plausible that Singapore was a convenient location for Mr Tan and Mr Jonathan Tok to physically meet to sort out the details relating to the Claimants’ investment in the Phase Two development. I therefore decline to give much weight to the place of contracting at the second stage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The second factor is the currency of the contract, which also points to Malaysia. It is not disputed that payment pursuant to the Oral Agreement was made in Malaysian Ringgit, namely, the Investment Sum of RM8,263,313.40 (see [8] above). Furthermore, payment of the Investment Sum was made to Buana Tunggal, which was a company registered in Malaysia and the main developer for the Phase Two development.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The third factor relates to the places of residence or business of the parties, which is neutral.

</div> and I have accepted that any other communications between Mr Sugiarto and Mr Hendro Tok must necessarily have been made by telephone conversations and/or electronic means.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 For these reasons, I find that it is reasonable to infer that the implied law governing the Oral Agreement is likely to be Malaysian law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 For completeness, even if it could not be inferred that the parties intended Malaysian law to be the governing law following the second stage of the analysis, I would have no difficulty arriving at the same conclusion under the third stage as to which law has the closest and most real connection with the Oral Agreement. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation </span>clarified (at [48]) that the same factors are to be taken into consideration at the second and third stage, but the difference lies in the weight which is to be accorded to these factors, with equal weight being placed on <span class="font-italic">all </span>factors at the third stage. For similar reasons as stated above, it is clear that Malaysian law bears the most connection with the Oral Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 As to the Claimants’ argument that Malaysian law was not expressly pleaded by the Defendants, I would note that this is precisely because a defence on the merits of the case would typically not be filed by a defendant who seeks a stay of proceedings based on <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens </span>(see O 6 r 7(4) of the Rules of Court 2021 (the “ROC 2021”)). In the present case, I am satisfied that there is adequate material before the court for a finding to be made as to the governing law of the Oral Agreement, for the purposes of identifying the appropriate forum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 For the foregoing reasons, I consider the governing law of the Oral Agreement to be a relatively important factor pointing to Malaysia, even taking into account the following qualification. I recognise that the issues to be determined at trial (as identified by the parties at [18] above) are largely factual as opposed to legal in nature (see in this regard the observations of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi </span>at [56]–[57]). Furthermore, both Singapore and Malaysia are common law jurisdictions. Although I note that the law of contract in Malaysia is governed by her Contracts Act 1950 (Act 136), there is no suggestion by either party that the Malaysia or Singapore courts would apply different contract or tort law principles such as to affect the outcome of the dispute.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Place where the tort occurred</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Insofar as the Claimants’ alternative pleaded case lay in the tort of negligence, I also consider the place where the tort was alleged to have occurred, which can provide a convenient starting point or <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>position insofar as the place of the tort was not fortuitous (<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments </span>at [39] and [40]; <span class="font-italic">JIO </span><span class="font-italic">Minerals FZC and others v Mineral Enterprises Ltd </span>[2011] 1 SLR 391 (“<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals</span>”) at [106]). But in the present case, I consider the place of the tort to be a neutral factor for the following two reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The test that is commonly applied for determining the place of the tort is that which looks at the events constituting the tort and asks where, in substance, the cause of action arose (<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals </span>at [90]). For the tort of negligence, this would be where the failure to take reasonable care took place (<span class="font-italic">Distillers Co (Biochemicals) Ltd v Laura Anne Thompson</span> [1971] AC 458). The Claimants’ pleaded case in negligence alleges that prior to the Oral Agreement being entered into the Defendants had failed to take reasonable care in giving certain advice, warranties and representation to the Claimants that the Phase Two development would be a safe investment with guaranteed profits.

</div> Therefore, I consider that the closest link to Singapore would be insofar that the Defendants’ voluntary assumption of responsibility substantially took place by Mr Jonathan Tok’s acts or omissions in Singapore. However, even this could not be said for certain for much the same reasons as set out at [40] above. I reiterate that the physical meetings between Mr Jonathan Tok and Mr Tan told only one side of the story. As between Mr Hendro Tok and Mr Sugiarto, their communications must necessarily have been made by telephone conversations and/or electronic means from their respective locations. There is also some suggestion that Mr Hendro Tok and Mr Sugiarto were in fact the key decision makers behind the Oral Agreement. More importantly, on at least two occasions in October and November 2011 the Claimants had made social visits to the Defendants and to the construction site of the Phase Two development in Malaysia. By the Claimants’ own pleaded case, it is alleged that during the time of both these visits to Malaysia the Defendants had continued making the representations the subject of the Negligence Claim.

On the issue of the Claimants’ pleaded Reasonable Care Term, if indeed found to be a term of the Oral Agreement, this is likely to raise a significant number of disputed factual issues, for instance, as to who is at fault for the delays to the Phase Two development, and whether these delays were critical delays such that the project as a whole was delayed.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Although the Claimants have not adduced expert evidence on this point of Malaysian law, in Singapore, it is well-recognised that issues of foreign law can also be proven by directly adducing raw sources of foreign law as evidence, provided they satisfy the requirements in the Evidence Act 1893 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “EA”). Nonetheless, the precise evidentiary weight to be accorded may differ depending on the foreign law at hand (<span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation </span>at [55] and [60]). In the present case, I note that s 59(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the EA provides that the Singapore courts shall take judicial notice of “all Acts passed or hereafter to be passed by the legislature of any territory within the Commonwealth”. Furthermore, under s 59(2) of the EA, our courts can “resort for [their] aid to appropriate books or documents of reference” when dealing with such Acts. Given the comparative similarities between Singapore and Malaysian civil procedure and the presence of an equivalent legislative provision in Singapore, being O 55 r 1 of the ROC 2021 (and its predecessor legislation, O 66 r 1 of the Rules of Court 2014), I consider that there is little difficulty in the present case in a Singapore court competently assessing whether O 66 r 1 of the Malaysian ROC provides for the position as stated by the Claimants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Order 66 r 1 of the Malaysian ROC provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Jurisdiction of Registrar to make order (O 66 r 1)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1.

Pending before a court or tribunal in a place outside the jurisdiction. </span>There must be a matter pending before the foreign court or tribunal before the High Court can exercise its power under this rule. The question of whether there is a matter pending before the foreign court or tribunal is for the requesting court to determine. The court will not question the bona fides of a letter of request from a foreign court: see the dicta of Eusoff Chin J (as his Lordship then was) in <span class="font-italic">Lorrain Esme Osman v A-G of Hong Kong </span>(unreported, Originating Summons No R8-24-59-89), where it was also held that concrete evidence in the form of a decision of the foreign court must be produced to prove that no proceedings were pending at the date of the application for the order for examination of witnesses and production of documents in the High Court. See also <span class="font-italic">Dato Mohamed Hashim Shamsuddin v A</span><span class="font-italic">-G, Hong Kong </span>[1986] 2 MLJ 112, where the Supreme Court was satisfied from the order of the foreign court for issue of the letter of request, the letter of request itself and the affidavit filed in the High Court in support of the application that there were pending proceedings in the foreign court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I am therefore satisfied that the availability of O 66 r 1 of the Malaysian ROC mitigates, to some extent, the witness compellability factor as relied upon by the Defendants. Where proceedings are pending before a foreign (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, outside of Malaysia) court or tribunal, and where a witness in Malaysia is unwilling to give evidence or to produce documents voluntarily, the High Court in Malaya and the High Court in Sabah and Sarawak have the power to make an order that evidence be taken in Malaysia, for the purposes of the foreign proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Witness convenience</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 I consider that the appropriate weight to be given to the witness convenience factor must be balanced between (a) on the one hand, the availability of giving evidence via video-link as well as the close proximity of Singapore to Malaysia (<span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals </span>at [69]–[70] and [110]; see also O 15 r 5 of the ROC 2021) and (b) on the other hand, the greater significance afforded to the witness convenience factor where the main disputes in the case at hand revolve around questions of fact (<span class="font-italic">Rickshaw Investments </span>at [19]), and also given that the Defendants intend to call <span class="font-italic">multiple </span>witnesses based in Malaysia.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In addition, while I noted at [71] above that the Malaysian courts have the power to make an order under O 66 r 1 of the Malaysian ROC that evidence be taken in Malaysia for the purposes of foreign proceedings, such mode of taking evidence will no doubt be more cumbersome in both time and expenses to the Defendants should the Malaysian Witnesses turn out to be <span class="font-italic">unwilling </span>to give evidence and/or to produce documents voluntarily. In this regard, O 66 r 4(2) alludes to the payment of fees and expenses due to the examiner under the procedure in O 66 of the Malaysian ROC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 On balance, therefore, I consider that there would be relatively more convenience in having the case decided in the forum where the Malaysian Witnesses are ordinarily resident.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 For the following two reasons, however, I do not consider the availability of documents to be a relevant connecting factor in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In the first place, the Defendants have not demonstrated an at least arguable case that the project documents cannot be easily obtained. On the contrary, I agree that these documents relating to the Phase Two development are most likely to have been stored and circulated in electronic form. I also agree, bearing in mind that Buana Tunggal was the main developer for the Phase Two development, and that the Defendants appear to occupy key positions in Buana Tunggal (see [4] and [5] above), that it is likely that the Defendants would have easy access to these project documents which are relevant to their defence and Intended Counterclaim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Furthermore, even if I am wrong as to the above, I also consider the availability of the procedure under O 66 r 1 of the Malaysian ROC sufficient to rebut the Defendants’ argument that they would be unable to obtain documents which are solely in the possession of Malaysian parties. As noted at [71] above, the Malaysian courts would have the power to make an order for the production of documents by a witness based in Malaysia, for the purposes of foreign proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Personal connections of the parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The Claimants submit that this factor points in favour of Singapore as the first claimant is a Singapore citizen, the first defendant is a Singapore permanent resident, and the second claimant is willing to attend and testify in Singapore court proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 However, the first defendant is also a citizen of Malaysia and the second defendant resides in Malaysia. I therefore consider this factor to be neutral and find applicable in this regard the observation of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Rappo </span>(at [71]) that “in disputes involving well-heeled parties who have a high degree of mobility … the current domicile of the parties may be of little legal significance, depending on the circumstances of the case.” This is even more so given the close geographical proximity between the parties’ respective places of domicile in the present case (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion: Malaysia is the more appropriate forum</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I am satisfied that the Defendants have discharged their burden of showing that Malaysia is clearly and distinctly the more appropriate forum than Singapore for the trial of the case concerned. The place of performance of the Oral Agreement was intended by the parties to be substantially performed in Malaysia and the underlying subject matter of the Oral Agreement, being the construction of a development project that is located in Johor Bahru, clearly points to Malaysia (see [37] above). Together with the governing law of the Oral Agreement which I have found at [52] above to be Malaysian law as well as the undoubted convenience in having the case decided in Malaysia where the intended witnesses are ordinarily residents (see [74] above), I consider that the connecting factors meaningfully point to Malaysia as the jurisdiction in which the case may be “tried more suitably for the interests of all the parties and for the ends of justice” (<span class="font-italic">Rappo</span> at [72], citing <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> at 476). Insofar as the strongest argument to be made in favour of Singapore is that many of the physical meetings between Mr Jonathan Tok and Mr Tan had taken place in Singapore, I reiterate my considerations at [40] above that it was Mr Sugiarto and Mr Hendro Tok who played the more significant roles as the key decision makers behind the investment in the Phase Two development and, in any event, much of the communications between the parties must necessarily have been made by electronic means given that they were all residing in different jurisdictions at the material time. Furthermore, there were at least two occasions where the Claimants had visited the Defendants in Malaysia and during which time, by the Claimants’ pleaded case, they say that the Defendants had continued to make certain representations as to the profitability of the investment. Finally, while I consider the strength of the witness compellability factor to be largely mitigated for the reasons expressed at [71] above, I also note the Court of Appeal’s observation in <span class="font-italic">Ivanishvili </span>(at [96]) that “[u]ltimately, the court will usually be prepared to assume that despite the possible arrangements and accommodations [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the availability of judicial assistance proceedings for taking evidence in the foreign jurisdiction], it would <span class="font-italic">typically</span> be easier to secure the evidence of witnesses in the jurisdiction where they are located”. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 On balance, therefore, I consider at Stage One of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>test that Malaysia is the more appropriate forum.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Stage Two of the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold">test</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The legal burden at Stage Two of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>test is on the claimant to establish the existence of special circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nonetheless be refused (<span class="font-italic">CIMB </span><span class="font-italic">Bank </span>at [26]). In the present case, the Claimants have not raised any personal or juridical advantage that they would lose or that they would be denied substantial justice if the case is not litigated in Singapore. I also do not consider that any special circumstances exist which require that a stay should nonetheless be refused.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion and costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 For the reasons set out above, I consider that Malaysia is clearly and distinctly the more appropriate forum for the trial of OC 385. I therefore allow the appeal for the proceedings in OC 385 to be stayed on the ground of <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The costs of SUM 2259 are to be reversed with the Claimants to pay the Defendants the costs of the application at S$9,000 (all-in).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In respect of the costs of the appeal payable by the Claimants to the Defendants, Appendix G of the Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021 provides that the costs to be awarded for an appeal before a Judge in the General Division to be in the range of S$5,000 to S$35,000. The Defendants submit that costs of the appeal should be fixed at S$15,000,
