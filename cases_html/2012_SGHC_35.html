<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal by the Applicant against the
                    decision (“the Decision”) of the Deputy Registrar of Patents and
                    the Principal Assistant Registrar of Patents (“the Tribunal”)
                    dated 3 November 2009, holding that the Respondent succeeded in its
                    application to revoke the Applicant’s Singapore Patent No. 42669
                    (“the Patent”). This is the second appeal by the Applicant from a
                    decision of a tribunal of the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore
                    (“IPOS”). The first concerned another patent, Singapore Patent
                    P-No. 49307, which the respondent had similarly applied to revoke and in respect
                    of which I delivered judgment in <em>Martek Biosciences
                        Corporation v Cargill International Trading</em> [2011]
                    4 SLR 429 (“<em>Martek v Cargill (No
                        1)</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       For the reasons which follow, I allow the
                    Applicant’s appeal against the Decision here and dismiss the
                    Respondent’s appeal insofar as it relates to certain aspects of the
                    Decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Unless otherwise indicated, all references to
                    statutory sections below are to the Patents Act (Cap 221, 2005 Rev Ed)
                    (the “Act”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The parties are the same as in <em>Martek v Cargill (No 1)</em>. The Applicant is Martek
                    Biosciences Corporation, a company incorporated under the laws of the State of
                    Delaware of the United States of America. The Respondent is Cargill
                    International Trading Pte Ltd, a company incorporated in
                Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Applicant is the proprietor of the Patent,
                    which is entitled “Arachidonic Acid and Methods for the Production and
                    Use Thereof”. The Patent was granted by IPOS on 30 March
                    1999.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 20 January 2006, the Respondent filed an
                    application to revoke the Patent on the following grounds:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_A"></a>A)     That the invention was not a
                        patentable invention under section 80(1)(a) of the Act;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_B"></a>B)     Insufficiency, i.e. that the
                        specifications of the Patent did not disclose the invention clearly and
                        completely for it to be performed by a person skilled in the art as required
                        by section 80(1)(c) of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Applicant filed an application to amend the
                    claims of the Patent on 6 September 2006. The amendments were advertised in
                    the Patents Journal on 30 October 2006 and no opposition was received by
                    IPOS within the period during which they were open for opposition. The
                    allowability of these amendments is not in issue. They were not challenged by
                    the Respondent. The Tribunal held that the amendments were allowable as they did
                    not result in the specifications disclosing any additional matter nor extending
                    the protection conferred by the Patent. The proceedings before IPOS and before
                    me therefore proceeded on the basis of the claims as amended.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       At a Case Management Conference on 28 April
                    2008, IPOS Hearing Officers informed the parties of their intention to cause the
                    Patent to be re-examined under s 80(2) of the Act. The Respondent followed
                    by filing the request for re-examination and the Patent was subsequently
                    re-examined by an examiner from the Australian Patent Office of IP Australia who
                    then produced a report (“the Re-examination Report”). The
                    Re-examination Report dated 24 October 2008 was made available to parties
                    on 6 November 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The matter was heard before the Tribunal from 9
                    to 12 February 2009. It was agreed that the Evidence Act (Cap 97,
                    1997 Rev Ed) and the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Ed) would
                    apply to the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Patent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Patent is comprehensively summarised by
                    the Tribunal in the Decision at [13]-[24]. I do not
                    propose to repeat it here but will merely highlight the essence of the
                    Patent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Patent, as mentioned above, is entitled
                    “Arachidonic Acid and Methods for the Production and Use Thereof”.
                    The published extract reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The present invention relates to processes for the production of
                        arachidonic acid containing oils, which preferably are free of
                        eicosapentaneoic acid. This invention also relates to compositions
                        containing oils of very high amounts of arachidonic acid in triglyceride
                        form, and to uses of such oils. In a preferred embodiment, <em>Mortierella </em><em>alpina</em> is
                        cultivated using conditions which yield triglyceride oil having particularly
                        high levels of arachidonic acid residues, biomass is harvested and the oil
                        is extracted, recovered and used as an additive for infant formula.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Patent goes on to explain the context and
                    purpose of the invention. It explains that arachidonic acid
                    (“ARA”) is a long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid
                    (“PUFA”) of the omega-6 class and is important for the human body
                    in various ways. Despite its importance to human metabolism, however, ARA cannot
                    be synthesized in humans <em>de novo</em>. Therefore, most
                    ARA must be provided in the diet, especially during times of very rapid body
                    growth such as infancy. Accordingly, human breast milk (“HBM”)
                    contains high levels of ARA and is the most prevalent C<sub>20</sub>
                    PUFA in HBM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     However, many mothers do not breast feed their
                    infants or do not breast feed for the entire period of rapid infant growth,
                    choosing instead to use an infant formula. What this means is that there remains
                    a need for an economical, commercially feasible method of producing ARA,
                    preferably without concomitant production of eicosapentaneoic acid
                    (“EPA”). This is because high EPA levels in dietary supplements
                    result in a depression of the ability to form ARA from dietary linoleic acid
                    (“LOA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The problem is that of those fungal species
                    which have had their fatty acids characterised, it has been found that most do
                    not make ARA. Of those which do make ARA, many produce significant quantities of
                    EPA in addition to ARA. Accordingly, while the fungal species producing both ARA
                    and EPA can be utilised in the process of this invention, it is preferable to
                    use species which do not produce significant quantities of EPA, such as
                        <em>Pythium </em><em>insidiosum</em> and <em>Mortierella
                        </em><em>alpina</em>. Further, the oil from
                        <em>Mortierella </em><em>alpina</em> is likely to be more economical to produce.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The object of the present invention is to
                    satisfy that need. The invention contemplates the use of any microbial oil which
                    contains sufficient ARA to overcome the negative effects of dietary EPA.
                    Typically, in HBM, the ratio of ARA to EPA is about 20 to 1. Preferably, the
                    invention contemplates that an ARA: EPA ratio of at least 5:1 should be
                    achieved. More preferably, the ratio will be at least 10:1. Ideally, it should
                    be at least about 20:1. The higher the amount of ARA in the end product relative
                    to the EPA, the more desirable the result.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     A further object of the invention is to
                    provide an additive and a source for that additive for use in infant formula
                    such that the ARA levels in the formula approximate those levels in HBM. It is
                    an additional object of this invention to provide an ARA-containing fungal oil
                    for use in enteral, parenteral or dermal products. The method of this invention
                    provides triglycerides having the desired composition by extraction from natural
                    sources. The Patent specifications state that no commercial infant formulas
                    known to the applicant contain triglyceride form.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Of the claims in the Patent, only claims 1, 2,
                    20 and 35 are independent claims and the rest are dependent on one or more of
                    these four claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The prior art</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The prior art cited before the Tribunal were
                    referenced as D1 to D10, with D1, D4, D7 and D10 assuming particular
                    significance before the Tribunal and before me:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_A"></a>A)     D1 refers to “Production of
                        Arachidonic Acid by <em>Mortierella </em><em>alpina</em> ATCC 3222” by Bajpai <em>et al</em>, published in the Journal of Industrial
                        Microbiology, 8 (1991) 179-186;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_B"></a>B)     D4 refers to Japanese Patent No 64-38007, published in
                        1989 and entitled “External Preparation for Skin” (D4a refers
                        to the English translation thereof and it is this translation that I shall
                        refer to in this Judgment);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_C"></a>C)     D7 refers to International Patent No WO 92/13086,
                        entitled “Arachidonic Acid and methods of the production and use
                        thereof”, published in 1992;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_D"></a>D)     D10 refers to International Patent No WO 94/28913,
                        entitled “Method and Pharmaceutical compositions useful for treating
                        neurological disorders”, published in 1994.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     A useful summary of the prior art can be found
                    at [100] of the Tribunal’s Decision. I will analyse the contents of the
                    respective prior art below when I address the validity of the
                Patent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The witnesses before the Tribunal</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Respondent’s witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The two expert witnesses for the Respondent
                    (which was the applicant below) were the same as in <em>Martek v
                        Cargill (No 1</em>). I should clarify at this point that
                    chronologically, the proceedings that are the subject of this appeal took place
                    before the proceedings that were the subject of the appeal in <em>Martek v Cargill (No 1)</em>. However, this appeal happened to be
                    fixed before me later than the other appeal. The expert witnesses for the
                    Respondent were Dr Puah Chum Mok (“Dr Puah”) and
                    Dr Nga Been Hen (“Dr Nga”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Dr Puah</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     At the time of the hearing below, Dr Puah
                    headed the Technological Centre for Life Sciences in the Singapore Polytechnic.
                    He made three statutory declarations in relation to this matter dated
                    5 December 2006, 17 October 2008 and 3 December 2008. In his
                    statutory declaration dated 5 December 2006, he claims at paragraph 3 that
                    his specialisation is in Cell Culture and Bioprocess Technology including
                    fermentation technologies and that his industrial experience encompasses
                    research in the field of fermentation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Both at the hearing below and before me, the
                    various alleged deficiencies of Dr Puah’s expert testimony were a
                    significant part of the Applicant’s case. In particular, the Applicant
                    submitted and continues to submit on appeal that, <em>inter
                        alia</em>: (a) Dr Puah lacked the relevant expertise;
                    (b) his evidence pertained to areas outside his area of expertise;
                    (c) his evidence was based on assertions suggested to him by the Respondent
                    and its agents; (d) he was unable to differentiate between total lipids,
                    fatty acids and oil; (e) he had no relevant knowledge of pH profiling and
                    culture conditions; (f) he was not an expert in the strains of <em>Mortierella</em>; (g) he did not understand what a
                    fungal oil was; (h) his second and third statutory declarations were unreliable;
                    (i) he did not understand the textbook references and had not formed an
                    independent view of the textbook references; and (j) as a witness, he was
                    generally evasive and unwilling to answer questions directly. In its submissions
                    before me, the Applicant frequently referred to portions of the transcript of
                    Dr Puah’s cross-examination to make the points above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Tribunal declared itself “inclined
                    to share the general thrust of the [Applicant’s] submission to exercise
                    caution in relation to Puah’s evidence”, and found that he
                    “did not appear to possess the relevant expertise” to assist the
                    Tribunal in the hearing or to testify with confidence on the matters in
                    question. As such, the Tribunal held itself unable to draw much assistance from
                    Dr Puah’s evidence (Decision at [37]). Dissatisfied with this, the Applicant argues before me
                    that the Tribunal should have gone even further and completely disregarded
                    Dr Puah’s evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     I do not think it necessary for me to do this
                    for the purposes of the appeal. As will be apparent later when I analyse the
                    Tribunal’s Decision, the Tribunal did not rely on Dr Puah’s
                    evidence in making its findings. Furthermore, at the hearing before me, the
                    Respondent confirmed that it was not relying on Dr Puah’s evidence
                    and that it was relying only on Dr Nga’s evidence and the objective
                    text of the prior art documents. It follows that Dr Puah’s evidence
                    is not relevant for the purposes of the issues in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Dr Nga</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Dr Nga was, at the time of the hearing
                    below, a Research Fellow at the Department of Chemistry, National University of
                    Singapore. At the time of the hearing below, he had 38 years of working
                    knowledge in microbial fermentation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Applicant argued, both at the hearing
                    below and before me, that Dr Nga’s evidence should also be
                    disregarded. The basis for this argument in relation to Dr Nga’s
                    evidence was different from that in relation to Dr Puah’s evidence:
                    the Applicant argued that Dr Nga’s views were made solely with the
                    benefit of hindsight whereas the question of the inventiveness of a Patent must
                    be assessed from the point of view of a skilled person without any knowledge of
                    the alleged invention (<em>Windsurfing International Inc v Tabur
                        Marine (Great Britain) Ltd</em> [1985] RPC 59 at [73]). Further to this, the Applicant also
                    alleged that Dr Nga was evasive and unreliable in the sense that he was
                    more than ready to read teachings into the prior art despite already admitting
                    that his views on the prior art were based on hindsight.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The Tribunal held that while it did not share
                    the Applicant’s characterisation of Dr Nga as an evasive witness, it
                    nonetheless “treaded with caution” in relying on his evidence
                    (Decision at [43]), given that
                    Dr Nga himself had admitted during cross-examination that his views were
                    made with the benefit of hindsight. Once again, as with Dr Puah’s
                    evidence, the Applicant argued before me that the Tribunal should have
                    completely disregarded Dr Nga’s evidence rather than merely
                    “treaded with caution”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Applicant’s witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Two expert witnesses testified for the
                    Applicant (which was the respondent below). They were Dr William R. Barclay
                    (“Dr Barclay”) and Dr David Kyle
                    (“Dr Kyle”). Dr Kyle was also one of the
                    Applicant’s two expert witnesses in <em>Martek v Cargill
                        (No 1)</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Dr Barclay</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     At the time of the hearing, Dr Barclay
                    had been the Applicant’s Director of Discovery and Chief Intellectual
                    Property Officer for the Applicant since 1987, in which capacity he had isolated
                    and developed microbial strains for use in the production of omega-3 and omega-6
                    highly saturated fatty acids. He represented his expertise to be in
                    polyunsaturated fatty acid fermentation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Respondent submitted below that
                    Dr Barclay was not an objective witness because he was one of the founders
                    of the Applicant and remains an employee and therefore had a direct commercial
                    interest in the Patent. The Applicant rebutted the Respondent’s contention
                    and argued that there was no basis for the Respondent to challenge
                    Dr Barclay’s objectivity when it had not challenged the objectivity
                    of his evidence under cross-examination before the Tribunal. The Tribunal
                    “reminded” itself that Dr Barclay was “an expert with
                    an interest in the proceedings” by virtue of his relationship with the
                    Applicant and that it therefore had to scrutinise his evidence with greater care
                    and limit its consideration of Dr Barclay’s testimony to the
                    technical and scientific aspects of the invention as such (Decision at [48]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Dr Kyle</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Dr Kyle is the sole inventor of the
                    Patent. He was employed by the Applicant since 1985 but left in October 2001 to
                    start his own company and was therefore no longer employed by the Applicant at
                    the time of the hearing below. He testified that his expertise was in lipid
                    biochemistry and single cell oil production.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     As in <em>Martek v Cargill (No
                        1)</em>, the Respondent argued below that Dr Kyle could not be
                    considered an objective witness because he was the sole inventor of the Patent
                    and therefore had an interest in the Patent. As he was a former employee of the
                    Applicant, he also had a pre-existing close relationship with the Applicant.
                    While the Tribunal agreed with the Applicant that there was no basis for the
                    Respondent to allege that Dr Kyle had a pre-existing close relationship
                    with the patentee, it limited its consideration of his testimony to the
                    technical and scientific aspects as such, as it did with Dr Barclay’s
                    evidence (Decision at [54]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Tribunal’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The Tribunal held that the Respondent
                    succeeded in its application to revoke the Patent under s 80(1)(a) of the
                    Act and ordered the Applicant to pay the Respondents’ costs, save for the
                    costs arising out of a letter submitted by the Respondent to the Tribunal after
                    the conclusion of the hearing but before submissions were made. In reaching this
                    conclusion, the Tribunal analysed each independent claim, <em>i.e.</em> claims 1, 2, 20 and 35, in turn and concluded that all four
                    claims were novel over the prior art cited. However, the Tribunal held that each
                    of the four claims respectively lacked the element of inventive step because it
                    would have been obvious to a skilled person to combine the teachings in the
                    relevant prior art to reach the claims in the Patent (Decision at [139], [148],
                    [198] and [241]; see also summary of Tribunal’s findings in Decision at
                    [215]). Specifically, in relation to claim 1, it would have been obvious to a
                    skilled person to combine the teachings of D4 and D7 or D4 and D10; in relation
                    to claim 2, it would have been obvious to a skilled person to combine the
                    teachings of D4 and D5 or D4 and D7; in relation to claim 20, it would have been
                    obvious to a skilled person to combine the teachings of D7 and D10; and in
                    relation to claim 35, it would have been obvious to a skilled person to combine
                    the teachings of D4 and D5 or D4 and D7. Given that the four independent claims
                    were found to lack inventive step, the remaining claims also failed and the
                    Patent was found to fail on the ground of patentability; however, the Tribunal
                    did go on to consider the dependent claims separately and held them to lack
                    inventive step as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Therefore, despite the significant length of
                    the Decision, the Tribunal’s Decision was actually quite a narrow one. The
                    only reason the Patent was found to lack patentability was because of the
                    principle in the law of patents that it is permissible in the inquiry for
                    inventiveness to construct a "mosaic" out of the various pieces of prior art
                        (<em>Muhlbauer AG v Manufacturing Integration Technology
                        Ltd</em> [2010] 2 SLR 724 at [93] (“<em>Muhlbauer</em>”)), unlike in the inquiry for novelty
                        (<em>Trek Technology (Singapore) Pte Ltd v FE Global
                        Electronics Pte Ltd</em> [2005]
                        3 SLR(R) 389 ("<em>Trek
                    Technology</em>") at [87]). I will consider below whether, even given this
                    mosaicing” of prior art, the Patent could be said to lack inventiveness.
                    However, as the Respondent also appeals against certain aspects of the Decision
                    which the Tribunal ruled in the Applicant’s favour, particularly with
                    regard to the novelty of the Patent’s claims, it is also necessary for me
                    to consider these other issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issue before the Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The only issue before me is the patentability
                    of the Patent under s 80(1)(a) of the Act. Although the Respondent framed
                    an alternative issue, <em>i.e.</em> whether the Patent
                    discloses the invention clearly and completely for it to be performed by a
                    person skilled in the art as required by s 80(1)(c) of the Act (the
                    “insufficiency” issue), I find that the Respondent is not entitled
                    to challenge the sufficiency of the Patent before me. The Tribunal held at [216]
                    of the Decision that although this ground was initially pleaded by the
                    Respondent, it was subsequently not pursued before it. The Respondent before me
                    argues that the Tribunal was wrong to make this finding – it points out
                    that it made detailed written submissions to the Tribunal both in its Closing
                    Submissions and Reply Submissions below.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> However, this does not
                    address the Applicant’s arguments that the Respondent’s Opening
                    Statement below was completely silent on the insufficiency issue<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and that the
                    Respondent did not challenge the Applicant’s expert witnesses on this
                    point during cross-examination<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>, only belatedly attempting to
                    revive its challenge by way of closing submissions and reply
                        submissions<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. I agree with the
                    Applicant that, if the Respondent were to be allowed to rely on this ground in
                    this appeal, the Applicant would be irremediably prejudiced in a way that cannot
                    be compensated for by costs – because the Respondent only canvassed the
                    insufficiency issue in its closing and reply submissions, the Applicant was
                    deprived of the opportunity to lead evidence from its own witnesses or
                    cross-examine the Respondent’s witnesses on this issue during the
                        hearing.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> In fact, going one step
                    further, I fail to see how the Respondent can canvass the insufficiency issue
                    without having led evidence from its own expert witnesses as to the sufficiency
                    of the Patent. This is because the test of sufficiency is <em>from the point of view of the person skilled in the art</em>. Not
                    only is this plain on the face of s 80(1)(c) itself, the very cases cited
                    by the Respondent demonstrate this (see <em>Genelabs
                        </em><em>Diagnoistics Pte Ltd v Institut Pasteur and
                        another</em> [2000] 3 SLR(R) 530 at [59] and <em>Kirin-Amgen v
                        Hoechst Marion Roussel</em> [2005] 1 All ER 667 at
                        [103])<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. The Respondent’s
                    submissions on insufficiency are made completely without any basis in evidence
                    given by persons skilled in the art.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> For
                    all the above reasons, I find that the Respondent is not entitled to challenge
                    the Patent on the basis of insufficiency under s 80(1)(c) and that the only
                    issue before me is therefore the issue of patentability under
                    s 80(1)(a).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I should also note that unlike in <em>Martek v Cargill (No 1)</em> where a substantial part of the
                    dispute revolved around <em>what</em> the inventive
                    concepts in the patent were (see <em>Martek v Cargill (No
                        1)</em> at [33]-[51]), there is no such dispute here. There is
                    no dispute that the inventive concepts of the Patent are as set out at [12]-[16] above. Despite the more voluminous testimony and more
                    involved scientific arguments in this case as compared to <em>Martek v Cargill (No 1)</em>, therefore, the issue here is actually
                    more straightforward, <em>i.e.</em> the comparison of the
                    Patent and the prior art to see if the Patent is novel and inventive over the
                    prior art.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     To constitute a patentable invention under
                    s 80(1)(a), an invention must: (1) be new (the “novelty”
                    condition); (2) involve an inventive step (the “inventive step”
                    condition); and (3) be capable of industrial application (s 13(1)). The Tribunal
                    laid out the relevant legal principles at significant length at [70]-[98] of its Decision but there is no
                    dispute as to the applicable legal principles in this case and they are
                    relatively straightforward. The novelty condition is satisfied if the invention
                    “does not form part of the state of the art” (s 14(1)). The
                    “inventive step” condition is satisfied if the step is “not
                    obvious to a person skilled in the art” (s 15).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Claim 1</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     As clarified above at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>, all references are to the claims as amended by the 2006
                    amendments. Claim 1 of the Patent reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A composition for enteral or parenteral administration to a human
                        comprising an unmodified fungal triglyceride oil obtained from <em>Mortierella </em><em>alpina</em>
                            (<em>M. alpina</em>), wherein at least 50% of the
                        fatty acid residues are arachidonic acid (ARA) residues present in
                        triglyceride form, wherein the oil comprises no more than one tenth as much
                        eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) as ARA and wherein the oil comprises at least
                        50% ARA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The Tribunal broke this claim down into its
                    individual features as follows (Decision at [108]), the accuracy of which is not
                    disputed by either party:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_A"></a>A)     a composition suitable for enteral or
                        parenteral administration to a human;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_B"></a>B)     unmodified fungal triglyceride oil obtained from
                            <em>Mortierella </em><em>alpina</em> (<em>M.
                    alpina</em>);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_C"></a>C)     at least 50% of the fatty acid residues are ARA residues present in
                        triglyceride form;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_D"></a>D)     the EPA level of the oil is no more than one tenth of the ARA
                        level;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_E"></a>E)     the oil
                        comprises at least 50% ARA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Novelty</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The Tribunal held that claim 1 was novel
                    because none of the prior art disclosed all five features. The relevant prior
                    art documents here were D1, D4, D7 and D10.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The Tribunal found that, while D1 disclosed
                    features B, D and E, it did not disclose features A and C. There was no dispute
                    that D1 does teach the production of ARA-containing oils by fermentation of
                        <em>M. </em><em>alpina</em> and
                    that Table 1 of D1 discloses an oil with at least 50% ARA. The dispute was over
                    whether the extracted ARAs disclosed in Table 1 were <em>in
                        triglyceride form</em>,<em>i.e.</em> feature C.
                    The Applicant argued below that the oil in Table 1 was extracted by the mixed
                    solvent procedure of Bligh and Dyer which would yield not only triglycerides but
                    also other glycerol esters such as phospholipids, cholesterol and mono- and
                    di-glycerides, without any indication as to which of these forms would be
                    predominant. The Re-examiner accepted this argument, as did the Tribunal which
                    therefore found that the Patent was novel over D1 (Decision at [116]). As for D7
                    and D10, the Tribunal found that neither of them teaches a yield of ARA of at
                    least 50% (<em>i.e.</em> feature E or that at least 50% of
                    the fatty acid residues are ARA residues in triglyceride form (<em>i.e.</em> feature C) (Decision at [126] and
                [127]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     On appeal, the Respondent does not appear to
                    challenge the Tribunal’s findings with regard to D1, D7 and D10. Rather
                    its challenge to the Tribunal’s finding of novelty is limited to
                        D4a<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> which is the
                    prior art that comes closest to claim 1. The dispute here is with regard to
                    feature A <em>i.e.</em> whether D4a teaches a composition
                    suitable for enteral or parenteral administration to humans.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     On its face, there certainly is no indication
                    that D4 should be suitable for enteral or parenteral administration to humans.
                    The title of D4a, as explained above at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>, is “”External Preparation for Skin”. The
                    claims are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1. A skin cosmetic characterised by containing an arachidonic
                        acid-containing lipid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2. A skin keratin improver characterised by containing an arachidonic
                        acid-containing lipid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3. A skin acne treatment characterised by containing an arachidonic
                        acid-containing lipid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     As the Applicant strenuously highlights, D4a
                    is concerned with the <em>topical</em> treatment of skin
                    conditions. However, the Respondent submits that just because D4a is <em>intended</em> for topical application does not necessarily
                    mean that it is not in fact suitable for enteral and parenteral administration.
                    To this end, the Respondent cites the European Patent Office Guidelines for
                    Examiners, C-III at paragraph 4.13 where it states that “… if the
                    known product is in a form in which it is in fact suitable for the stated use,
                    though it has never been described for that use, it would deprive the claim of
                        novelty.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> I
                    accept this guideline as a correct test for novelty. The issue is therefore
                    whether the composition in D4a is <em>in fact</em> suitable
                    for enteral and parenteral administration, despite appearing on its face to be
                    merely for topical administration. In particular, the onus is on the Respondent,
                    as the party challenging the validity of the Patent, to prove
                this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I find that the Respondent has not discharged
                    its burden of proving that D4 teaches a composition suitable for enteral or
                    parenteral administration. The Respondent submits that the triglyceride oil in
                    D4a is purer in triglycerides and ARA than that taught in any of the examples of
                    the Patent, the oil of D4a having been deodorised to remove phospholipids and
                    de-colorised to remove pigments and impurities. It further argues that the
                    Applicant presented no evidence that oxidation of the oil of D4a would lead to
                    it being unsuitable for enteral administration and that it was an unfounded
                    assertion on the Applicant’s part that the fungal triglyceride oil from
                        <em>M. </em><em>alpina</em> was
                    unsuitable for enteral/parenteral administration in its unmodified form and had
                    to be turned into fatty acid ethyl esters<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. However, in my view, these arguments
                    made by the Respondent are not sufficiently borne out by the evidence. As stated
                    above, the onus is on the party challenging the validity of the Patent to adduce
                    evidence to refute the novelty of the claims. However, critically for the
                    Respondent, Dr Puah admitted under cross-examination that the composition
                    of D4a could have large proportions of contaminants which were arguably toxic
                    and as such, the composition in D4a could not be suitable for enteral or
                    parenteral administration.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>
                    This is in contrast to the evidence of Dr Barclay<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> and Dr Kyle<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>. Both maintained under cross-examination
                    – in my view, convincingly – that the skilled reader would have
                    understood from the necessity of a subsequent ester exchange step that such a
                    composition was not necessarily suitable for enteral or parenteral
                    administration. In conclusion, while the ethyl esterification step might have
                    eliminated some of the potential impurities, D4a remains silent on whether there
                    were any toxic components in the total lipid extract. In fact, the
                    cross-examination of Dr Barclay and Dr Kyle by the Respondent’s
                    agent below (who was not the counsel for the Respondent before me) merely
                    revealed that the Respondent’s agent appeared to have confused edibility
                    with suitability for enteral administration.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Here, I should address the issue of the
                    reliability of the Applicant’s witnesses. As explained above at <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> and <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a>,
                    the Respondent challenged the reliability of the Applicant’s witnesses on
                    the basis of their lack of objectivity. However, as I similarly held in
                        <em>Martek v Cargill (No 1)</em> at [41], for the purposes of determining whether
                    the evidence of an expert should be discounted, the relevant test is one of
                    actual partiality rather than apparent partiality (<em>Muhlbauer</em> at [46]-[47]). Similarly,
                    as in <em>Martek v Cargill (No 1)</em>, the Respondent did
                    not adduce any evidence of actual partiality here. Furthermore, as the Tribunal
                    rightly noted, this is one of those cases with a high degree of specificity and
                    expertise in the technology involved and where it is therefore not surprising if
                    only a limited number of experts are available, such that pre-eminent experts
                    may have certain work experience which might at first sight appear to threaten
                    their independence (Decision at [58]).
                    The Tribunal was therefore right not to dismiss the testimonies of
                    Dr Barclay and Dr Kyle. It did limit its consideration of
                    Dr Barclay’s testimony to the “technical and scientific
                    aspects of the invention as such” (Decision at [48] and [54]). It was therefore for the Respondent to challenge and
                    disprove the technical and scientific aspects of Dr Barclay’s and
                    Dr Kyle’s evidence. Insofar as the novelty of claim 1 is concerned, I
                    find that the Respondent has failed to do so (see <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The Respondent also cites in its support the
                    Re-examination Report, which (as set out in the Decision at [118]), states as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A)    Composition suitable for enteral or parental
                                [<em>sic</em>] administration to a
                        human</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Solvent extraction of <em>Mortierella </em><em>alpina</em> biomass by non-polar solvent such as hexane
                        produces an arachidonic acid product suitable for administration to a human
                        (see current application page 4 lines 24-26, page 13 line 15 to page 16 line
                        9). Note: Although ‘enteral’ is a term commonly used to mean
                        ‘tube feeing’ in the context of the current application it also
                        includes capsules etc (page 19) and thus the term has the broader meaning of
                        oral or tube administration. <em>As D4a also teaches solvent
                            extraction of</em> Mortierella alpina <em>biomass
                            by hexane to produce an arachidonic acid product (see D4a example 1),
                            D4a has made available to the public a composition which is suitable for
                            enteral administration to a human. In the submissions made on behalf of
                            the patent holder there was reliance on the fact that in D4a the
                            composition is subsequently derivatised for subsequent topical
                            application. However I consider that it is enough that prior to that
                            step the composition is suitable for enteral administration</em>.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     However, as with a similar re-examination
                    report in <em>Martek v Cargill (No 1)</em> (see at
                        <em>Martek v Cargill (No 1)</em> at [42]), it is common ground that the
                    Re-examination Report in this case is not binding on this court. Furthermore, as
                    in <em>Martek v Cargill (No 1)</em>, the Re-examination
                    Report was made based on the statutory declarations of the various witnesses
                    taken at face value, without taking into account the witnesses’
                    performance under cross-examination, in particular the concessions made by
                    Dr Puah and the course of cross-examination of Dr Barclay and
                    Dr Kyle (see above at <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Inventive Step</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Having found that claim 1 meets the
                    requirement of novelty, I now examine whether it meets the requirement of
                    inventive step. As I have already noted, this was the heart of the
                    Tribunal’s finding that claim 1 is not patentable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     With regards to the test for inventive step,
                    the Court of Appeal in <em>Muhlbauer</em> at [20] adopted the four-step formulation of the
                    Singapore High Court in <em>Trek Technology (Singapore) Pte Ltd v
                        FE Global Electronics Pte Lt</em>d [2005] 3 SLR(R) 389
                    of the test established in <em>Windsurfing International Inc v
                        Tabur Marine (Great Britain) Ltd</em> [1985] RPC 59 (commonly
                    known as “the <em>Windsurfing</em> test”),
                    thus:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_A"></a>A)     Identify the inventive concept
                        embodied in the patent in suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_B"></a>B)     The court then assumes the mantle of the normally skilled
                        but unimaginative addressee in the art at the priority date, imputing to him
                        what was, at that date, common general knowledge in the art in
                        question.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_C"></a>C)     Identify what, if any, differences exist between the matter cited as being
                        "known or used" and the alleged invention.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_D"></a>D)     The court then asks itself the question whether,
                        viewed without any knowledge of the alleged invention, those differences
                        constitute steps which would have been obvious to the skilled man or whether
                        they require any degree of invention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The Tribunal identified this as the four-step
                    test (Decision at [131]). There is no real dispute as to the inventive concept
                    in the Patent or that the prior art constituted common general knowledge in the
                    art at the priority date. The crux of the issue is simply whether the
                    differences between the various prior art and the invention in the Patent would
                    have been obvious to the skilled reader as at the priority date. In this
                    respect, the reasoning of the Tribunal was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Finally, the fourth step in Windsurfing [supra] requires the court to ask
                        itself whether, viewed without any knowledge of the alleged invention, those
                        differences constitute steps which would have been obvious to the skilled
                        man or whether they require any degree of invention. <em>Our
                            answer is yes. As mentioned above, D4a already discloses features B, C,
                            D, and E in claim 1. D7 and D10 also teach features A, B and D. It would
                            have been obvious for him to combine the teachings in D4a with D7 or D4a
                            with D10 and any of these combinations will result in the skilled man
                            meeting all the features of claim 1</em>. Claim 1 lacks inventive
                        step accordingly. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Therefore, the basis upon which the Tribunal
                    arrived at the conclusion that claim 1 lacked inventive step was an assertion
                    that it would have been obvious to a skilled reader to combine the different
                    features of the various prior art. With respect, the Tribunal erred in doing so.
                    The Tribunal did not possess the expertise to determine for itself, on the face
                    of the prior art and the Patent, whether the invention would have been obvious
                    to a skilled reader without any basis in evidence as to what a skilled reader
                    would have known or understood. The test of whether a claim involves an
                    inventive step is premised on the viewpoint of the skilled reader. As the
                    English Court of Appeal articulated in <em>Mölnlycke AB v
                        Procter &amp; Gamble</em> [1994] RPC 49:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In applying the statutory criterion and making these findings the court
                        will almost invariably require the assistance of expert
                            evidence. <em>The primary evidence will be that of
                            properly qualified expert witnesses who will say whether or not in their
                            opinions the relevant step would have been obvious to a skilled man
                            having regard to the state of the art.</em> All other evidence is
                        secondary to that primary evidence [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This was cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in <em>Muhlbaeur</em> at [19].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     If we look at the evidence before the Tribunal
                    and before me, however, it is clear that there is no evidential basis for the
                    Respondent’s assertions. Dr Nga had admitted under cross-examination
                    that his views were made with the benefit of hindsight and, on this basis, the
                    Tribunal already considered that it must treat Dr Nga’s evidence with
                    “caution”. It is true that the Tribunal did not go as far as urged
                    by the Applicant, <em>i.e.</em> to find that Dr Nga
                    was an evasive and unreliable witness and indeed I too find it unnecessary to
                    make such a finding for the simple reason that the fact that Dr Nga’s
                    evidence is based on hindsight is already fatal to his evidence as to the
                    inventiveness of the Patent. It is trite law that <em>hindsight
                        must be avoided in assessing whether an invention involves an inventive
                        step</em> (see for example <em>Windsurfing</em>
                    at [71] and [73]). As for the Respondent’s only other witness, the
                    Tribunal had already held itself unable to draw much assistance from
                    Dr Puah’s evidence because he “did not appear to possess the
                    relevant expertise” to assist the Tribunal in the hearing or to testify
                    with confidence on the matters in question. As I explained above at <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a>, counsel for the Respondent confirmed at the
                    hearing before me that the Respondent was not relying on Dr Puah’s
                    evidence but only on Dr Nga’s evidence and that they were primarily
                    relying on the documents in their own right. I have already explained why
                    Dr Nga’s evidence cannot be relied upon to determine whether the
                    invention in the Patent would have been obvious to the skilled reader. Neither
                    is it possible to merely look at the documents on their face and speculate what
                    would have been obvious to a skilled reader – the Respondent’s
                    submissions in this regard<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> are insufficient insofar as
                    they are made completely on the basis of the documents on their face and without
                    any reference to evidence from experts who would be able to assist the court in
                    adopting the mantle of the skilled reader.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     “Mosaicing” of prior art may
                    well be allowed in assessing whether or not there is an inventive step; however,
                    as explained in Ng-Loy Wee Loon, <em>Law of Intellectual Property
                        of Singapore</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, Rev Ed, 2009) at
                    para 30.1.50:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the skilled addressee assesses the obviousness of an invention by
                        reference to the whole of the state of the art relevant to this invention,
                        whereas he assesses the novelty of the invention by reference to each
                        individual piece of prior art in this state of the art. There is, however,
                        an exception to this scenario: <em>'mosaicing' is not
                            permitted in the obviousness inquiry if it would not be obvious to the
                            skilled addressee to 'mosaic' the different pieces of prior
                            art</em> [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     As the evidence stood before the Tribunal and
                    now stands before me, therefore, the Respondent proffered no basis – and
                    the Tribunal therefore had no basis – on which to conclude that it would
                    have been obvious to the skilled reader to “mosaic” the teachings
                    in D4 with D7 or D4 with D10. On the other hand, Dr Barclay and
                    Dr Kyle testified that the Patent in general and claim 1 in particular
                    involved inventive steps. Even confining their evidence to the technical and
                    scientific aspects of the Patent as such on the basis that they may be
                    interested parties in respect of the Patent (see above at <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> and <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a>), the inventiveness of the Patent is one such technical and
                    scientific aspect – if the Respondent alleges that Dr Barclay’s
                    and Dr Kyle’s evidence on this point must be disregarded because they
                    were biased, it is for the Respondent to either make out a case for actual bias
                    (see above at <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a>) and put this case to the
                    witnesses under cross-examination or adduce their own expert evidence to
                    scientifically disprove their testimony, neither of which the Respondent has
                    done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In conclusion, I find that the Tribunal erred
                    in finding that claim 1 lacked inventive step when there was no evidential basis
                    for it to so hold. The Tribunal canvassed at length the qualities of the
                    “skilled person” in which the test for inventive step was rooted
                    (see Decision at [84]-[93]) but appeared to have made its eventual finding of
                    fact completely outside this frame of reference. Of course, I do not mean to say
                    that the Tribunal, or indeed any court, is entirely at the mercy of expert
                    witnesses when determining issues of patentability. As I affirmed in <em>Martek v Cargill (No 1)</em> at [43], a court is always entitled to examine an expert’s
                    evidence based on logic and rationality. However, this does not mean that a
                    court, when called upon to apply a test rooted in the perspective of a skilled
                    reader in the art, will simply substitute its own judgment in the complete
                    absence of any evidence as to whether something would or would not have been
                    obvious to the skilled reader. This is especially when the deficit of evidence
                    is on the part of the party attacking the validity of the Patent and therefore
                    on whom the onus lies to show that there was no inventive step involved (see
                        <em>Muhlbauer</em> at [19]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     I therefore find claim 1 is both novel and
                    involves an inventive step and that it is patentable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Claim 2</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Claim 2 reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Infant formula comprising triglyceride containing ARA in an amount
                        comparable to the amount in human breast milk wherein the ARA is provided by
                        adding to infant formula a sufficient amount of an unmodified fungal
                        triglyceride oil obtained from <em>Mortierella
                            </em><em>alpina (M. alpina)</em>, wherein at
                        least 50% of the fatty acid residues are arachidonic acid (ARA) residues
                        present in triglyceride form, wherein the oil comprises no more than one
                        tenth as much eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) as ARA and wherein the oil
                        comprises at least 50% ARA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The Tribunal broke claim 2 down into its
                    components as follows – as with the breakdown of claim 1 above at
                        <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a>), this is not disputed):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_A"></a>A)     infant formula comprising
                        triglyceride containing ARA in an amount comparable to the amount in human
                        breast milk wherein the ARA is provided by adding to infant
                    formula</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_B"></a>B)     unmodified
                        fungal triglyceride oil obtained from <em>Mortierella
                            </em><em>alpina</em></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_C"></a>C)     at least 50% of the fatty acid residues
                        are ARA residues present in triglyceride form</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_D"></a>D)     the EPA level of the oil is no more than one
                        tenth of the ARA level</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_59-p2_E"></a>E)     the oil comprises at least 50% ARA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     As the Tribunal pointed out (Decision at
                    [142]), claim 2 mirrors claim 1 in all its features except that while the first
                    feature of claim 1 is “a composition suitable for enteral or parenteral
                    administration to a human”, the first feature of claim 2 is
                    “infant formula comprising triglyceride containing ARA in an amount
                    comparable to the amount in human breast milk wherein the ARA is provided by
                    adding to infant formula”. The only question is therefore whether any of
                    the prior art teaches this first feature – if they do not, then claim 2
                    must be novel and inventive for the same reasons that claim 1 is new and
                    inventive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The prior art that is relevant to the analysis
                    of claim 2 are D5 and D7. The Tribunal found that, while D5 teaches artificial
                    milk with a trace fatty acid composition that approximates that of HBM and D7
                    teaches the provision of an additive for use in infant formula such that the ARA
                    levels in the formula approximates those levels in HBM, neither D5 nor D7
                    discloses all the features of claim 2. Therefore, the Tribunal found claim 2 new
                    over D5 or D7. However, the Tribunal then found that claim 2 lacked inventive
                    step because it would have been obvious to the skilled man to combine the
                    teachings of D4a with D5 or D4a with D7 (Decision at [148]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     On appeal before me, the Respondent did not
                    seem to challenge the novelty of claim 2 based on D5 – its challenge is
                    confined, rather, to D7. In particular, it submits that claim 2 is anticipated
                    by the infant formula taught in D7 notwithstanding that the product in claim 2
                    is obtained by a process of adding the defined triglyceride oil (<em>i.e.</em> as defined by features B to E).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> It makes this submission on
                    the basis that claim 2 is a “product-by-process” claim and
                    therefore it is the product <em>per se</em> that needs to
                    be novel, not the process from which the infant formula is produced<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> and to this end it cites
                        <em>inter alia</em> the UK Manual of Patent Practice
                    – Patents Act 1977 at [2.15] and the PCT International Search and
                    Preliminary Examination Guidelines at para 5.26 where they explain that a
                    “product-by-process” claim is not rendered novel merely by the
                    fact that it is produced by means of a new process; rather, such a claim lacks
                    novelty if a prior art product appears to be inherently the same as, or
                    indistinguishable from, the claimed invention, even if made by a different or
                    undisclosed process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The assumption in the Respondent’s
                    argument is that the product in claim 2 is inherently the same as the product in
                    D7 and that the addition of the triglyceride oil as defined by features B to E
                    is merely a different process by which this same product is obtained. In my
                    view, this ignores the fact that the product in claim 2 is not merely an infant
                    formula product that closely approximates the ARA levels in HBM. This ARA must
                    be in triglyceride form – this is plain even from A2 itself. In my view,
                    the teaching of the addition of triglyceride oil of a very particular
                    specification (<em>i.e.</em> as specified by features B to
                    E) makes the product in claim 2 a different product from that taught in D7 and
                    not merely a different process of obtaining the same product. This is borne out
                    by the evidence of the Applicant’s witnesses – again unrebutted
                    given the problems with the testimony of the Respondent’s witnesses
                    – that the invention in claim 2 was based on the finding that beneficial
                    effects are observed when the oil used to supplement infant formulas is
                        <em>in triglyceride form</em> and <em>contains at least 50% ARA residues</em> and <em>where
                        there are low levels of EPA</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Turning now to the question of whether claim 2
                    involves an inventive step, the Tribunal merely asserted, similarly to what it
                    did with claim 1, that it would have been obvious to the skilled man to combine
                    the teachings of D4a with D5 or D4a with D7. For the same reasons as elaborated
                    upon at <a href="#p1_52">[52]</a>-<a href="#p1_55">[55]</a> above, I find that the Tribunal erred in doing so because
                    there was no evidence before it upon which it could base such a
                finding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     I should also note at this point that, at the
                    hearing before me, the Respondent alluded to the similarity between D7 and the
                    Patent, the fact that the Applicant was the proprietor of D7 as well and that
                    the validity period of D7 was expiring soon. The Respondent suggested that the
                    Patent could be the Applicant’s attempt to “extend” the
                    validity of D7 by registering another patent over essentially the same
                    invention. However, the truth of this suggestion hangs on the Respondent proving
                    that there is nothing new and inventive in the Patent over D7 and, for the
                    reasons above, I find that it has not discharged its burden to do
                so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     For the above reasons, I find that that claim
                    2 is new and inventive over the prior art.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Claim 20</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Claim 20 reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A method for the production of an ARA-containing oil, said oil containing
                        triglycerides wherein at least 25% of the fatty acid residues are ARA and
                        the amount of EPA residues in the oil is no more than one-fifth the amount
                        of ARA residues, comprising:</p>

                            nitrogen source in an amount equivalent to at least 15g/L yeast extract
                            are added to said growth medium over the course of the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The dispute between the parties revolves
                    around the pH features disclosed in claim 20, <em>i.e.</em>
                    (B) and (C). It is common ground that claim 20 meets the requirement of novelty
                    because none of the prior art discloses its pH features as specified in (B) and
                    (C) – the closest prior art is D7 which, at least according to the
                    Respondent and the Tribunal at [193], discloses all the features of claim 20
                    except (B) and (C). The Respondent did challenge the novelty of claim 20 below
                    but, on appeal, agrees with the Tribunal’s finding that claim 20 is new
                    (see Decision at [191]).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>
                    The dispute is therefore confined to whether these pH features involve an
                    inventive step.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     This was the subject of fierce dispute below
                    as well as before me, with the Respondent arguing that “pH
                    profiling” was already part of the common general knowledge whereas the
                    Applicant argued that the pH features as specified in (B) and (C) would not have
                    been obvious to the skilled person. The extent of the dispute can be seen from
                    the Tribunal’s summary of the parties’ various arguments (Decision
                    at [172]-[181]) as well as in the length of the parties’ written
                    submissions before me. It seems to me, however, that parties are really arguing
                    at cross-purposes. At the hearing before me, the Applicant submitted that the
                    issue was confused by the Respondent’s blanket reference to “pH
                    profiling” which the Respondent then submitted was already part of the
                    common general knowledge when “pH profiling” could refer to a
                    range of things. I agree. The evidence pointed out by the Respondent to
                    demonstrate that “pH profiling” was part of the common general
                    knowledge merely shows that pH values <em>have an
                        effect</em> on the cultivation/production of fungal organisms or
                        <em>M. alpina</em> or triglyceride oils (as the case
                    may be)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>:</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2__2"></a>•    that Dr Kyle acknowledged that pH profiling was
                        known in the art and was part of the “toolbox” of available
                        steps to the engineer when producing triglyceride oils;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2__3"></a>•    references to textbooks which state
                        that there is an optimal value at which maximum rates of growth of fungal
                        organisms are observed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The Applicant’s case, however, is that
                    the invention in claim 20 is to provide the skilled person with the specific pH
                    profile necessary to achieve increased levels of ARA in the triglycerides. This
                    is something the Respondent’s arguments do not address. Indeed, the
                    Tribunal acknowledged this distinction in the Decision at [195]-[196]: it
                    highlighted the difference between, on the one hand, deciding the pH at which to
                    start the cultivation (as in D1) or at which to maintain culture during the
                    whole cultivation (as in D2) and, on the other hand, <em>controlling the pH at two different values during the fermentation
                        process</em> which is what claim 20 teaches. The question before the
                    Tribunal was thus whether this difference constituted steps which would have
                    been obvious to the skilled man or whether it required a degree of invention,
                        <em>i.e.</em> the last step in the <em>Windsurfing</em> test (see above at <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Cutting through the myriad of arguments on
                    this issue, therefore, the issue really boils down to something quite narrow:
                    whether the difference as highlighted by the Tribunal –
                    <em>i.e.</em> between the specific pH features in (B) and
                    (C) of claim 20 and other pH profiling already disclosed by the prior art
                    – would have been obvious to a skilled reader. The basis of the
                    Tribunal’s decision was actually very narrow. The Tribunal held that the
                    specific pH features in (B) and (C) would have been obvious to the skilled man,
                    purely on the basis of Example 5 of D10 (see Decision at [197]-[198]). In the
                    Tribunal’s view:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In view of the teachings in D10 on setting the pH level at the start of
                        the cultivation process, and subsequently allowing the pH level to drift and
                        fluctuate before controlling it during the process, <em>we
                            find that the skilled person would be motivated to achieve the pH
                            features in claim 20</em>, which is in essence the dynamic control
                        of pH setting through the cultivation process [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     With respect, this finding is problematic for
                    the same reasons as explained at <a href="#p1_52">[52]</a>-<a href="#p1_55">[55]</a> above. Once again,
                    the Tribunal was merely speculating as to the state of mind of a skilled reader
                    without any evidence before it that could support this conclusion. The mere fact
                    that both claim 20 and Example 5 of D10 exhibit a process whereby the pH level
                    is set at the start of the cultivation process and subsequently allowed to drift
                    and fluctuate before controlling it during the process does not necessarily lead
                    to the conclusion that there was nothing inventive in claim 20. In the first
                    place, they pertain to different <em>specific</em> sets of
                    pH values – this may well be material if the cultivation processes and/or
                    what is being cultivated are different between that taught in claim 20 and that
                    taught in Example 5 of D10. Claim 20, on its plain reading, pertains to the
                    production of an ARA-containing oil containing triglycerides with specified
                    characteristics (see above at <a href="#p1_67">[67]</a>). Example
                    5 in D10 is entitled “Preparation of <em>Mortierella
                        </em><em>alpina</em> lipid” but it is far
                    from clear whether this lipid would have the same characteristics as specified
                    in claim 20. Indeed, it appears otherwise. Whereas claim 20 is quite specific
                    that the ARA is in triglyceride form, D10 at p 7 explains that
                    “[p]referably the DHA and ARA are in the form of triglycerides, although
                    they also may be in the form of phospholipids”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     For the above reasons, I find that the
                    Tribunal erred in finding that claim 20 does not involve an inventive
                    step.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Claim 35</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Claim 35 reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A method of providing triglyceride containing ARA to an infant formula
                        which comprises adding to an infant formula, in an amount sufficient to
                        provide an ARA content which corresponds to the amount of ARA in human
                        breast milk, an unmodified fungal triglyceride oil obtained from <em>M. alpina</em>, wherein at least 50% of the fatty acid
                        residues are ARA residues present in triglyceride form, wherein the oil
                        comprises no more than one tenth as much eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) as ARA
                        and wherein the oil comprises at least 50% ARA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The Tribunal broke down claim 35 into its
                    component parts (see Decision at [211]) and concluded that the component parts
                    of claim 35 corresponded to features B to E of claim 1 (see above at <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a>) except that claim 35 has the extra feature
                    of “a method of providing triglyceride containing ARA to an infant
                    formula which comprises adding to an infant formula, in an amount sufficient to
                    provide an ARA content which corresponds to the amount of ARA in human breast
                    milk”, which, the Tribunal suggested, corresponded to claim 2 (see
                    Decision at [213]). This appears to be a more complicated way of crystallising
                    claim 35 as the claim to the <em>method</em> by which the
                    infant formula in claim 2 is produced. Indeed, the reasoning of the Tribunal
                    seems to indicate that it held claim 35 to lack inventive step for the same
                    reasons that it held claim 2 to lack inventive step (see Decision at
                    [213]-[214]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The Respondent is not challenging the
                    Tribunal’s finding that claim 35 is new<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>, so the only live issue is whether
                    claim 35 involves an inventive step. I find that the Tribunal erred in holding
                    that claim 35 lacked inventive step for the same reasons I held that it erred in
                    holding that claim 2 lacked inventive step. I need not repeat the points I have
                    already made in relation to the centrality of expert evidence to the test of
                    inventive step (see above at <a href="#p1_52">[52]</a>-<a href="#p1_55">[55]</a>), except to note that the Respondent’s
                    submissions on the inventiveness of claim 35 are, insofar as they are made
                    without any reference to any evidence as to the state of mind of a skilled
                    reader, mere assertions that claim 35 lacks inventiveness.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     For the reasons set out above, I find that
                    claims 1, 2, 20 and 35 are patentable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     As noted above, the Tribunal went on to assess
                    the patentability of each of the dependent claims after assessing the four
                    independent claims. However, as the Tribunal rightly noted, this was technically
                    unnecessary given that the patentability of these claims would depend on the
                    patentability of claims 1, 2, 20 or 35, as the case may be. Given that I have
                    already held all four independent claims to be patentable, it follows that all
                    claims in the Patent are therefore patentable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     I therefore allow the Applicant’s appeal
                    against the Tribunal’s Decision and dismiss the Respondent’s
                    cross-appeal. The Respondent is to pay the Applicant its costs of these
                    proceedings here and before the Tribunal, with such costs to be taxed if not
                    agreed.</p>
