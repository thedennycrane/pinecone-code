</div> Again, it was not the defendants’ pleaded case that Song had obtained the 2009 PPM from his father. Li also did not make this allegation in his AEIC or supplementary AEIC (“SAEIC”). In any event, Li’s suggestion that Song had obtained the 2009 PPM from his father was just another bare allegation. There was no evidence that Song even knew that Li had handed a copy of the 2009 PPM to Song’s father. Li himself said that Song was not present when he met with Song’s father.

The fact remained that having been made aware of the condition imposed by Contact Singapore, Li did not change the 2009 PPM (dated 1 February 2009) until almost a year later when he came up with the 2010 PPM. Instead, Li even showed the 2009 PPM to Dr Xing and “a few selected potential investors”.

I realised subsequently that this may not have been correct and asked parties to clarify. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 On 12 May 2021, I heard the parties on costs. I also sought clarification as to when the fund started. The defendants confirmed that the fund was formally started on 28 May 2009. This meant that the representations (that Sunmax was principal-guaranteed and that its minimum fund size was $300m)  were representations as to existing facts. These representations were thus actionable if they were false and relied upon by Song. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 It was clear that the two representations were false, and that Li knew that they were false. The misrepresentations were thus fraudulent. It was also clear that Song relied on the misrepresentations when he decided to invest in Sunmax. I rejected Li’s assertion that Song agreed to invest $1.5m without looking at the terms because $1.5m was “too small”.

</div> In my view, this was unlikely to have been the case. In the circumstances, Song was in fact entitled to judgment on his claim for misrepresentation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The judgment had not been extracted on 12 May 2021 and the parties agreed that I had the power to change my previous decision.

As for the representation that the fund was principal-guaranteed, Song submitted that his claim was for his full investment of $1.5m. I disagreed. It was clear from the 2009 PPM that the amount guaranteed excluded the management fees. Song’s loss was therefore $1,257,500, being the principal amount of $1.5m less the management fee of 3.5% per annum as provided in the 2009 PPM. Accordingly, I awarded Song damages in the sum of $1,257,500. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether Sunmax was liable for breach of contract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Sunmax submitted that Song had not sufficiently pleaded a claim for breach of contract.

First, Sunmax was not entitled to rely on Article 11(d) because it was not part of the pleaded defence. Sunmax had merely pleaded that  the investments that it had made were approved in accordance its AOA; this was in response to an allegation by Song that Sunmax had made investments in breach of its investment strategy as stated in the 2009 PPM.

</div> Clearly, what Sunmax had pleaded was wholly inadequate to support a defence based on its interpretation of Article 11(d). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Second, in any event, Sunmax’s interpretation of Article 11(d) was incorrect. Article 11(d) did not provide for distribution upon redemption to be at such valuation as the directors may think fit. Article 11(d) expressly recognised that the directors of Sunmax may pay preference shareholders the “issue price”. It then provided that the issue price may be paid in cash or, at the discretion of the directors, by distribution of Sunmax’s assets in-specie at such valuation as the directors may think fit. The words “at such valuation as the Directors may think fit” applied only to the valuation of the assets to be distributed in-specie. Although the directors had the discretion to pay the issue price by distribution in-specie, Article 11(d) did not say that Sunmax could redeem preference shares at a price lower than what Sunmax had agreed to under the 2009 PPM. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In my view, nothing in Article 11(d) precluded or was inconsistent with the redemption of Song’s preference shares at $1,237,500 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, at issue price less management fees) based on the terms provided in the 2009 PPM. Article 11(d) permitted Sunmax to pay the amount of $1,237,500 in cash or in-specie but that was not the issue in dispute. Sunmax’s case was that its liability to Song was not $1,237,500 but an amount comprising cash of $224,510 and a distribution in-specie having an estimated value of $195,815.90 (see [22] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on Song’s claim for breach of contract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Accordingly, I concluded that Song had proved his claim for breach of contract against Sunmax and was entitled to damages in the sum of $1,237,500.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the defendants were liable for conspiracy to injure</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Song’s case was that the defendants conspired to injure him by making the Representations.

Unfortunately, there was an omission to revoke my previous order dismissing the conspiracy claim, which should have been substituted with a finding that the conspiracy claim had been made out. I would only add that the omission made no difference to what Song was entitled to since the damages for the conspiracy claim and the misrepresentation and breach of contract claims were the same.

</div>
</div> I disagreed with the defendants’ submission. In my view, the principle in <span class="font-italic">Houldsworth </span>had no application to the facts of the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In <span class="font-italic">Houldsworth</span>, the plaintiff bought stock from the defendant, which was a co-partnership registered under the Companies Act 1862 (c 89) (UK). The plaintiff was registered (and acted) as a partner and received dividends. Subsequently, the defendant went into liquidation. As the defendant was an unlimited company, the plaintiff (being a contributory) paid for calls. The plaintiff sued the liquidators to recover damages in respect of the sum he paid for the stock, the money he had paid in calls and the estimated amount of future calls. The plaintiff based his claim on the ground of fraudulent misrepresentation made by the defendant’s directors and other officials. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The House of Lords held that the plaintiff could not maintain his claim for damages; his only remedy was <span class="font-italic">restitution in integrum</span> and rescission of his contract to purchase the stock. However, as the winding-up had commenced, it was too late for rescission and <span class="font-italic">restitutio in integrum</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The fact that the defendant was an unlimited company and the plaintiff therefore had a proportionate liability to contribute towards payment of the defendant’s liabilities (if the assets were insufficient) was a factor that influenced the House of Lords’ decision in <span class="font-italic">Houldsworth</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Earl Cairns LC was of the view (at 324–325) that the contract among the partners/shareholders was that the assets of the company would be applied towards meeting the liabilities of the company and any deficiency would be made good by the partners proportionately; it could not have been intended that such a contract would include any application of the assets and contributions to pay the new partner damages for a fraud committed on himself by the company, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by himself and his co-partners, in inducing him to enter into the contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Lord Selborne also referred (at 329) to the contract among the shareholders that they should all contribute equally to the payment of the company’s debts. His Lordship considered that the plaintiff’s claim for damages was in reality against all the members except the plaintiff and it threw upon the other members the plaintiff’s share of the company’s debts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Lord Hatherley was of the view (at 333) that allowing the plaintiff’s claim could lead to “interlacing claims on the part of misled shareholders <span class="font-italic">inter se</span>” and concluded that the plaintiff was trying to reconcile two inconsistent positions, namely that of a shareholder (who bore an aliquot share of the company’s debts) and that of creditor of the whole body of shareholders including himself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Lord Blackburn noted (at 337) that the plaintiff’s contract with the company was an agreement to become a partner in the company on terms that he would, in common with all his co-partners for the time being, contribute to make good all liabilities of the co-partnership.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In <span class="font-italic">In re Addlestone Linoleum Company</span> [1887] 37 ChD 191 (“<span class="font-italic">Addlestone</span>”), Lindley LJ described the principle in <span class="font-italic">Houldsworth</span> as follows (at 206):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The principle on which the House of Lords decided <span class="font-italic">Houldsworth v City of Glasgow Bank</span>: (1) was that a shareholder contracts to contribute a certain amount to be applied in payment of the debts and liabilities of the company, and … it is inconsistent with his position as a shareholder, while he remains such, to claim back any of that money––he must not directly or indirectly receive back any part of it … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Lindley LJ’s formulation of the principle in <span class="font-italic">Houldsworth</span> similarly acknowledged the shareholder’s liability, under his contract with the company, to contribute towards payment of the company’s debts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 It should be noted that both <span class="font-italic">Houldsworth </span>and <span class="font-italic">Addlestone </span>were decided before the landmark decision in <span class="font-italic">Salomon v A Salomon &amp;

The courts in those cases had to interpret statutory provisions that subordinated claims by a person, in his character or capacity as a member of the company, to claims by other creditors.

There is much to be said for Professor Gower’s criticism that the decision in <span class="font-italic">Houldsworth </span>does not recognise fully the separation between the corporate entity and the member. Further, as Gleeson CJ pointed out in <span class="font-italic">Sons of Gwalia </span>(at [5]), the “reality of modern commercial conditions [is that] assets and liabilities usually are more significant for creditors than paid-up capital”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In any event, in my judgment, the principle in <span class="font-italic">Houldsworth</span> had no application to the present case. To the extent that the decision in <span class="font-italic">Houldsworth</span> was influenced by the fact that the company was a partnership and the shareholders had unlimited liability, it is distinguishable. In the present case, Sunmax is a limited company and its preference shareholders (including Song) were liable only for the value of the preference shares that each had subscribed for. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 To the extent that the decision in <span class="font-italic">Houldsworth</span> is to be explained on the ground that an award of damages to a shareholder would be tantamount to an impermissible return or reduction of share capital, it is also distinguishable. In the present case, Sunmax was a fund in which investments were made by way of redeemable preference shares. Sunmax had expressly agreed that, at the end of five years, Sunmax would pay Song at least the principal amount invested (less management fees). Sunmax accepted Song’s investment on this very basis. It was known to all that the preference shares were to be redeemed at the end of five years. Sunmax was contractually bound to pay Song his capital investment of $1.5m less management fees. I could see no reason why the principle in <span class="font-italic">Houldsworth </span>should apply to preclude Song from being awarded what Sunmax had expressly agreed to pay him.

It was not disputed that on 15 March 2019, UC’s Hong Kong subsidiary company, International Alliance Financial Leasing Co Ltd (“IAFL”), was listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange.
