These summonses arose from Suit No 750 of 2012 (“Suit 750/2012”) and Suit No 751 of 2012 (“Suit 751/2012”) (collectively, “the Main Suits”). The defendants instituted SUM 5327/2016 and SUM 5328/2016 under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”) to strike out the Statement of Claims and the Main Suits altogether. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The plaintiff in the Main Suits, Mdm Chan Gek Yong, was the appellant in these Registrar’s Appeals (“RAs”). She was unrepresented. The defendants in the Main Suits were the respondents in these RAs. They were Violet Netto, a lawyer practising in M/s L F Violet Netto, and Ravi s/o Madasamy (“Mr Ravi”) who was also a practising lawyer. In these RAs, they were represented by two lawyers, namely Mr Christopher Anand Daniel and Mr Asik Sadayan (“Mr Asik”) from M/s Advocatus Law LLP. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The central thrust of the defendants’ striking out applications was that it would be an abuse of the process to allow the Main Suits to continue as the parties had already reached an amicable settlement at the Singapore Mediation Centre (“SMC”). The parties had signed a Settlement Agreement titled “Settlement Deed Suit No 750/2012/G and Suit No 751/2012/L”, Mediation No. SMC/MC-225 of 2016, on 29 September 2016 (“the Settlement Agreement”) before two SMC-appointed mediators, Dr Joseph H H Sheares (“Dr Sheares”), a medical practitioner from Mount Elizabeth Hospital and Mr Lim Tat, a lawyer from M/s Aequitas Law LLP.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 On 11 July 2018, after hearing the parties’ arguments I dismissed the appeals. The plaintiff filed a notice of appeal on 13 August 2018.

Arising from the same dispute in Suit 750/2012, the plaintiff commenced another suit, namely Suit 751/2012, also on 7 September 2012, against the defendants. Suit 751/2012 was for breach of trust and breach of statutory duty in respect of S$207,000, being money which the plaintiff claimed belonged to her that the defendants had transferred from the defendants’ client account to their office account without the plaintiff’s consent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 On 15 September 2016, four years later, the plaintiff and the defendants agreed to attempt to resolve the Main Suits through mediation scheduled for one day.

In brief, she argued that the AR should not have struck out the Main Suits for two main reasons: (1) the Settlement Agreement was invalid; and (2) the Settlement Agreement was not binding because the defendants in the first place did not and had no intention to abide by the terms of the Settlement Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 On the invalidity of the Settlement Agreement the plaintiff made several assertions. First, the plaintiff argued that on the day of the mediation she was unwell and was under medication which made her drowsy. Thus she was not mentally and fully alert when she signed the Settlement Agreement. The plaintiff averred that she did not understand what she was signing on 29 September 2016. She also claimed that one of the mediators, Dr Sheares, had noticed that she was anxious.

The mediators also told her that if the parties could not settle the Main Suits at the mediation, the case would have to go back to the court for further directions for the Main Suits to proceed to trial. This would result in the plaintiff incurring further costs to litigate the Main Suits.

</div><span class="font-italic"> </span>The defendants further submitted that the three further affidavits were irrelevant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I disagreed with the defendants. It is well-established that an appeal from a Registrar to a Judge in Chambers is dealt with by way of a rehearing. The evidence at the Registrar’s Appeal should be the same as it was before the Registrar. However, the Judge hearing the appeal is nonetheless entitled to treat the matter afresh as though it was before him for the first time. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lian Soon Construction Pte Ltd v Guan Qian Realty Pte Ltd</span> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 1053 (“<span class="font-italic">Lian Soon Construction</span>”) at [37] to [38] held that the Judge has a discretion to admit fresh evidence and he frequently does so in the absence of special reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 It is not mandatory for a Judge in Chambers hearing a Registrar’s Appeal to apply the <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall</span> test to determine whether to grant leave to file further affidavits or adduce fresh evidence. However, the <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall</span> test would apply in cases where the hearing before the Registrar at first instance has the characteristics of a full trial or where oral evidence has been recorded (for example, in proceedings of inquiries, taking of accounts or as in <span class="font-italic">Lassiter Ann </span><span class="font-italic">Masters</span>, in a hearing for assessment of damages). This was the position arrived at by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lassiter Ann Masters</span><span class="font-italic"> v To Keng Lam (alias Toh Jeanette)</span> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 392 at [20] to [26] (“<span class="font-italic">Lassiter (CA decision</span>)”). The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lassiter (CA decision) </span>stated at [24] that in such situations, the discretion rests with the judge as to whether to allow fresh evidence to be adduced, subject to certain conditions. First, the applicant must provide sufficiently strong reasons for why the new evidence was not adduced at the assessment before the Registrar, although this condition is not to be as stringent as the first condition under <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall</span>. Second, the applicant must satisfy the second and third conditions in the <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall</span> test.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In <span class="font-italic">WBG Network (S) Pte Ltd v Sunny Daisy Ltd </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 1133 (“<span class="font-italic">WBG Network</span>”) the Court of Appeal further explained the above distinction. Choo Han Teck J, who delivered the decision of the Court of Appeal in that case stated at [7] that the Court of Appeal’s decision in<span class="font-italic"> Lassiter </span><span class="font-italic">(CA decision)</span> recognised a distinction between the standard to be applied in appeals where the hearing before the Registrar had the characteristics of a full trial or where oral evidence had been recorded and hearings before the Registrar that were interlocutory in nature. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 It was unfortunate that the defendants’ counsel had overlooked the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Lassiter (CA decision)</span> when they cited only the first instance decision of <span class="font-italic">Lassiter Ann Masters</span>. Hence they failed to appreciate the distinction between the admission of fresh evidence for Registrar’s Appeals arising from hearings before a Registrar of interlocutory matters and Registrar’s Appeals arising from hearings before a Registrar which had the characteristics of a full trial or where oral evidence was recorded. On the above principles, I found that the AR had correctly exercised his discretion to grant the plaintiff leave to file further affidavits to explain her medical conditions at the mediation. The AR’s decision also did not prejudice the defendants. The plaintiff’s further affidavits were not totally irrelevant to the determination of the validity of the Settlement Agreement. She had stated in her affidavit dated 21 April 2017 that she was suffering from a number of medical problems and was on medication prior to the mediation that caused her to suffer giddiness and drowsiness during the mediation.

In addition, the plaintiff could recall that the mediation was conducted on 29 September 2016 and that the two defendants were represented by their lawyers. She also had the presence of mind to call her friend, Mdm Tan, who herself had acted in person against her ex-lawyer in her own suit, to accompany her in the morning. In the afternoon, the plaintiff asked Mr Chia to accompany her as Mdm Tan could not accompany the plaintiff in the afternoon.

It is natural that parties feel anxious during court proceedings and mediation as each party will try to get the best deal for himself.

The mere fact that the plaintiff was not represented by a lawyer during the mediation while the other party had lawyers was insufficient to show that there was pressure exerted on her.

</div> Neither Mdm Tan nor Mr Chia stated on affidavit that the plaintiff was pressurised by either the defendants, their lawyers or the mediators.

If it was not to render informal advice, it must be for support and confidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I also observed that the plaintiff is not someone who is weak-willed and timid. She was also unrepresented when she argued the RAs against the two lawyers of the defendants. However, at the appeals before me, she pugnaciously argued her case and persistently averred that the Settlement Agreement was invalid. I therefore found that the plaintiff was capable of looking after her own interests. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56  I have observed above at [44] that the plaintiff was able to negotiate adamantly with the opposing party who are lawyers to raise the offer significantly from S$100,000 to S$150,000 before she finally accepted the offer. This showed that the defendants had not exerted any pressure on the plaintiff who was unrepresented and even if there was pressure, the plaintiff was not affected by it. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic"> Allegations that the mediators pressurised her to sign the Settlement Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 As mentioned, the plaintiff did not allege that the defendants and their lawyers pressurised her. She directed this allegation against the mediators who are professionals and had no personal interest in this case. The plaintiff contended that she was persuaded and urged by the mediators to sign the Settlement Agreement. I agreed with the AR that the mediators were well entitled to inform the plaintiff that if she refused to sign the Settlement Agreement, parties would have to go back to Court for the Main Suits to continue. This is actually how it will normally pan out should mediation fail. There is no reason for anyone to feel pressurised by this, much less the party who commenced the suits in the first place. In fact, it is right for mediators to inform and educate parties before them that mediation is a lower cost alternative as a dispute resolution mechanism as compared to court litigation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The plaintiff alleged that the mediators pressed her to sign the Settlement Agreement as it was already late in the day. Hence she had no time to consider the Settlement Agreement. I was not persuaded by this allegation. If she truly needed more time to read the Settlement Agreement she could have asked for it. In this case she did not. During the hearing of the RAs before me, the plaintiff admitted that the mediators had not forced her to sign the Settlement Agreement because there was no time.

If the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum</span> is allowed to be invoked liberally, then anyone who is not satisfied with the contract that he has entered into will easily renege on his contractual obligations by invoking the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum</span>.

</div> Furthermore, her conduct in the Main Suits, the affidavits she had filed in preparation of these applications as well as her arguments before me, showed that, although unrepresented, she is intelligent and capable of understanding the documents before her. For instance, she was able to keep up and hold her own in the hearing of these RAs which went on for more than two hours during which she made substantial arguments. Her two affidavits filed in SUM 5327/2016 and SUM 5328/2016 and her 6th Affidavit were substantial with numerous supporting documents ranging from court documents to medical memos. This only showed that she is more than capable of understanding the nature and effect of the Settlement Agreement which was only about three pages long with only seven clauses and written in simple English. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The plaintiff had also failed to show that she had exercised reasonable care before she signed the Settlement Agreement. The plaintiff <span class="font-italic">had</span> every opportunity to read and understand the Settlement Agreement before signing it. Furthermore, the terms of the Settlement Agreement were explained to her. However, for reasons only known to her, she did not use that opportunity to read the Settlement Agreement and object to it or even refuse to sign it if she so disagreed with it. Therefore, she could not invoke the defence of <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum </span>to invalidate the Settlement Agreement.

</div> In my view, this was not a material fact. The pertinent facts were that the terms of the Settlement Agreement were explained to her by the mediators, she understood them and she was not denied an opportunity to read the Settlement Agreement before signing it. Therefore, it did not matter whether she was given a draft agreement prior to the signing of the Settlement Agreement. What was undisputed was that she did not sign the Settlement Agreement blindly. She had the document before her and she signed it. In any case she held on to the original Settlement Agreement after she signed.

</div>
</div> In my view it did not matter whether the Settlement Agreement was in the form of a deed or a normal contract. There are no statutory requirements that settlement agreements after mediation must be in the form of a deed. This ground is irrelevant. The key inquiry must be whether the Settlement Agreement was a valid contract. I found that the Settlement Agreement was a binding contract between the plaintiff and the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 For the above reasons, I found that there was no mental incapacity on her part, duress or <span class="font-italic">non</span><span class="font-italic"> est factum</span>. Hence I was satisfied that the plaintiff had voluntarily signed the Settlement Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I also placed little weight on her complaint that the terms of the Settlement Agreement were unfair. This was an afterthought. She agreed with the terms of the Settlement Agreement when the offer was raised from S$100,000 to S$150,000. Having voluntarily entered into the Settlement Agreement, she cannot now renege on the valid agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Summary of findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In summary, I found that the Settlement Agreement was a valid agreement entered into voluntarily by the plaintiff and the defendants in the presence of the mediators. The plaintiff was not mentally incapacitated and she could understand the terms of the Settlement Agreement when she signed it. I also found that she did not sign the Settlement Agreement under duress and that the argument of <span class="font-italic">non est</span><span class="font-italic"> factum</span> was not made out on the facts. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue (c) : Whether the Settlement Agreement should be set aside as the parties did not intend to be bound by the terms of the Settlement Agreement </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Despite the Settlement Agreement being valid, the plaintiff argued that it was nonetheless not binding because the defendants did not and had no intention to abide by the terms of the Settlement Agreement in the first place. Since the plaintiff also had no intention to be bound by the Settlement Agreement, it should not be binding on the parties and the Main Suits should be allowed to proceed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77  The plaintiff also submitted that it was not agreed under the Settlement Agreement that the first payment of S$50,000 pursuant to cl 1(1) of the said agreement was to be paid by the defendants’ insurers. She expected this sum to be paid by the defendants.

First, it is irrelevant how the defendants intended to source for the funds to pay the S$150,000 to the plaintiff under the Settlement Agreement. Therefore, it was inconsequential that the first payment of S$50,000 was made by the defendants’ insurers and not by the defendants themselves.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Second, in my view the difference between the amount stated on the defendants’ post-dated cheques and in cl 1(2) of the Settlement Agreement was a very minor discrepancy and was unimportant because the plaintiff would still receive the total sum promised to her under the Settlement Agreement, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, S$100,000. In fact, the total sums payable from the 17 post-dated cheques were higher than the amount stated in the Settlement Agreement. Thus there was no breach of the Settlement Agreement. In any event, her rights under the Settlement Agreement were secured by the acceleration clause under cl 1(3) of the Settlement Agreement whereby it was agreed that should any instalment payment not be paid on time, all the remaining unpaid instalment payments become immediately due and payable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Third, the  first defendant had sworn on affidavit that her firm, M/s L F Violet Netto, is still a fully functioning law practice and that she is still a registered Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore.
