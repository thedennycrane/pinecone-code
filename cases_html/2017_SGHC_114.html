</div> Ms Neo cited Dyson LJ’s comments on the position under the English equivalent of the Act, in <span class="font-italic">Amec Capital Projects Ltd v Whitefriars City Estates Ltd</span> [2004] EWCA Civ 1418 (“<span class="font-italic">Amec</span>”) at [22]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is easy enough to make challenges of breach of natural justice against an adjudicator. The purpose of the scheme of the 1996 Act is now well known. It is to provide a speedy mechanism for settling disputes in construction contracts on a provisional interim basis, and requiring the decisions of adjudicators to be enforced pending final determination of disputes by arbitration, litigation or agreement. <span class="font-italic">The intention of Parliament to achieve this purpose will be undermined if allegations of breach of natural justice are not examined critically when they are raised by parties who are seeking to avoid complying with adjudicators' decisions</span>. It is only where the defendant has advanced a properly arguable objection based on apparent bias that he should be permitted to resist summary enforcement of the adjudicator's award on that ground.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I accept that allegations of breach of natural justice against SOPA adjudicators must be critically examined, so that unmeritorious allegations do not stymie the Act’s aim of ensuring the timely settlement of payment disputes on an interim basis. In my judgment, in appropriate cases, such critical examination will additionally include examining the issue of waiver (see [49] – [53] below). But the test for apparent bias remains the same. The court applies the reasonable suspicion test to determine whether apparent bias is established on the facts of the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 If the reasonable suspicion test is made out, the court may set aside the adjudication determination. This is clear from <span class="font-italic">Citiwall Safety Glass Pte Ltd v Mansource Interior Pte Ltd</span> [2015] 1 SLR 797, where the Court of Appeal (“the CA”) recognised at [47] that an adjudication determination may be set aside if the adjudicator had violated the rules of natural justice. However, our courts have also held that not every such violation will justify setting aside an adjudication determination. Only material breaches of natural justice will suffice: see <span class="font-italic">Aik Heng Contracts and Services Pte Ltd v Deshin Engineering &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2015] SGHC 293 (“<span class="font-italic">Aik Heng</span>”) at [24] and <span class="font-italic">Metropole</span> at [62].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Our courts have not considered whether or how the material breach requirement applies in cases of apparent bias under the Act. At this point, I note that no allegation of apparent bias was made in <span class="font-italic">Aik Heng</span>. Although an allegation of apparent bias was made in <span class="font-italic">Metropole</span> (based on the adjudicator’s conduct), Coomaraswamy J, having found that no reasonable suspicion of apparent bias arose, did not proceed to discuss the material breach requirement in the context of the allegation of apparent bias. Again, in <span class="font-italic">JRP</span>, Chan Seng Onn J did not consider the material breach requirement in dismissing the apparent bias allegation. As will become clear, it is also unnecessary for me to decide in this case whether or how the material breach requirement applies when the reasonable suspicion test is made out against a SOPA adjudicator. I therefore leave this issue for another occasion when it can be fully argued.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Bias by Association</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 While the reasonable suspicion test is well-established in our law as the test for apparent bias, our courts have not elaborated on how the test applies where apparent bias is said to have arisen from the tribunal’s relationship with a party to a dispute or a party’s representative (as is the case here). These are cases of “disqualification by association”, where apparent bias may arise from “some direct or indirect relationship, experience or contact with a person or persons interested in, or otherwise involved in, the proceedings”: see <span class="font-italic">Webb v The Queen</span> (1993-1994) 181 CLR 41 at 74, <span class="font-italic">per</span> Deane J. In my view, the Australian jurisprudence on this category of cases is instructive. I note that the reasonable suspicion test is also the test for apparent bias in Australia.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The starting point is that the mere fact that a tribunal is associated with a party to the dispute before it, or a representative of a party, does not suffice to raise a reasonable suspicion of bias. In <span class="font-italic">Aussie Airlines Pty Ltd v Australian Airlines Pty Ltd and Another</span> (1996) 135 ALR 753 (“<span class="font-italic">Aussie Airlines</span>”), the respondents’ counsel had a personal, professional and financial relationship with the judge (Merkel J): see <span class="font-italic">Aussie Airlines</span> at 755 to 756. First, the pair had shared a close personal relationship. Each had been signatories to each other’s bank accounts and directors of each other’s family trust companies (albeit that these matters had ended after Merkel J’s judicial appointment). Secondly, the pair had shared an extended professional relationship which involved sharing chambers, along with other counsel, for 12 to 13 years. Thirdly, as members of chambers, the pair had interests in the trust administering the chambers, in investment properties and in a hotel business. After Merkel J and counsel had disclosed this relationship to parties, the applicant applied for Merkel J to disqualify himself for apparent bias. Merkel J rejected the application. A crucial step in Merkel J’s reasoning appears in the following passage, at 761:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [The cases] appear to accept that the reasonable bystander would expect that members of the judiciary will have had extensive professional associations with clients but that <span class="font-italic">something more than the mere fact of association is required</span> before concluding that the adjudicator might be influenced in his or her resolution of the particular case by reason of the association. Although the test is one of appearance, it is <span class="font-italic">an </span><span class="font-italic">appearance that requires a cogent and rational link between the</span> <span class="font-italic">association and its capacity to influence the decision to be made in the particular case</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Merkel J then analysed two cases in which apparent bias was made out. The first involved a close and continuing personal relationship between a judge and a solicitor. Merkel J reasoned that the relationship “would be perceived to involve an emotional or relational inter-dependence”, which might reasonably be understood as having the capacity to affect the judge’s decision in the case: see <span class="font-italic">Aussie Airlines</span> at 761. The second case involved a prosecution where the prosecuting solicitor was the acting head of a department to which the special magistrate belonged. Merkel J reasoned that it was the prosecutor’s power over the magistrate and the latter’s career that gave rise to apparent bias: see <span class="font-italic">Aussie Airlines</span> at 763. Merkel J then concluded as follows, at 763:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In my view the two cases again demonstrate the requirement for a cogent and rational link between the association and its capacity to influence the decision to be made in the particular case. <span class="font-italic">It is the capacity of the association to influence the decision rather than the association as such that is disqualifying</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I agree. Where apparent bias is said to arise from the tribunal’s associations, a rational connection must be shown between the associations and the prospect of bias. This flows from the very idea of a reasonable suspicion. (It is notable that the rational connection test is now part of the overarching test for apparent bias in Australia: see the majority judgment in <span class="font-italic">Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy</span> (2000) 205 CLR 337 at 345.) A suspicion is reasonable if and only if it is founded on a reason which is supported by the evidence. This is akin to the definition of a reasonable doubt, in the context of the criminal standard of proof, as a doubt “for which there is a reason that is, in turn, relatable to and supported by the evidence presented”: see <span class="font-italic">Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v </span><span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 45, at [61]. Therefore, in my view, a party who alleges apparent bias based on a tribunal’s associations must show that there is reason to hold that the tribunal’s associations might influence its decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The Australian jurisprudence also provides guidance on how a rational link between the tribunal’s associations and the prospect of bias might be established. In <span class="font-italic">S &amp; M Motor Repairs Pty Ltd and Others v Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd and Another</span> (1988) 11 IPR 97 (“<span class="font-italic">Caltex Oil</span>”), the appellants ran a petrol station under a franchise agreement with the second respondent (“Caltex”). A dispute arose. The first appellant gave an undertaking to the court not to pass off any petrol which the respondents had not supplied as Caltex petrol. The respondents then brought proceedings for contempt of court, alleging that the appellants had breached the undertaking. After the trial, but before the judge rendered judgment, the appellants learnt that that the judge had regularly acted for Caltex and other associated companies before his appointment to the Bench. The appellants applied for the judge to disqualify himself from hearing the case. Upon hearing the application, the judge disclosed that he had represented Caltex and associated companies on even more occasions than those which had been known to the appellants. The association had lasted for at least a decade, spanning public inquiries and two celebrated and protracted proceedings, up to November 1984: see <span class="font-italic">Caltex Oil</span> at 103. (The trial before the judge began in February 1987). However, the judge dismissed the application and found that the appellants had committed contempt. The appellants then appealed to the New South Wales Court of Appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The court unanimously allowed the appeal. However, the court was split on the issue of apparent bias. By a majority, the court held that a reasonable and informed observer would not have apprehended possible bias on the judge’s part. With respect, I pause here to note that it is unclear whether our courts would have reached the same conclusion. Plainly, the trial judge’s association with Caltex and its related companies was close and prolonged; this was the foundation of Kirby P’s detailed and forceful dissent. However, what is relevant here is Kirby P’s statement of the factors which are relevant to the issue of whether apparent bias arises from a tribunal’s association(s) at 107:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In so far as such bias is said to arise from a relationship between the parties, it is clearly relevant to know the <span class="font-italic">duration of that relationship</span>, <span class="font-italic">its intensity and nature and the time that has elapsed between its last renewal and the performance of judicial functions said to be affected by it</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In my judgment, the factors identified by Kirby P in <span class="font-italic">Caltex Oil</span> are relevant in determining whether there is a rational link between a tribunal’s associations and the prospect of bias. In approaching that enquiry, the court should consider the duration, intensity and nature of the tribunal’s relevant associations, along with the time which has passed since the last renewal of the associations. Apparent bias is established if there is reason to hold, upon analysing the tribunal’s associations through the prism of these factors, that those associations might influence the tribunal’s decision. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Relevance of Non-Disclosure</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In this case, the Adjudicator did not fully disclose his associations with Mr Foo, EPPL and RH. The Plaintiff relied on this to submit that apparent bias was established. In this regard, the Plaintiff argued that a failure to disclose could “in and of itself” give rise to a reasonable suspicion of bias.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This raises the question of the relevance of disclosure, or the lack thereof, to apparent bias. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I should perhaps start with what a tribunal should disclose, if at all, and how disclosure should be made. In<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Taylor and another v Lawrence and another</span> [2003] QB 528 (“<span class="font-italic">Taylor</span>”), Lord Woolf CJ made the following apposite comments at [64]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A further general comment which we would make, is that judges <span class="font-italic">should be circumspect about declaring the existence of a relationship where there is no real possibility of it being regarded by a fair-minded and informed observer as raising a possibility of bias</span>. If such a relationship is disclosed, it unnecessarily raises an implication that it could affect the judgment and approach of the judge. If this is not the position no purpose is served by mentioning the relationship. On the other hand, if the situation is one <span class="font-italic">where a fair-minded and informed person might regard the judge as biased, it is important that disclosure should be made</span>. <span class="font-italic">If the position is borderline, disclosure should be made</span> because then the judge can consider, having heard the submissions of the parties, whether or not he should withdraw. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Aussie Airlines</span>, Merkel J observed at 759 that “the facts to be disclosed are those that <span class="font-italic">might</span> found or warrant a bona fide application for disqualification” [emphasis in original]. With respect, I agree with Woolf CJ’s and Merkel J’s observations on the scope of the duty to disclose. A tribunal should disclose facts which might found a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> case of apparent bias. Moreover, in a borderline case, a tribunal should err on the side of disclosure. But disclosure is unnecessary if the facts patently will not raise a reasonable suspicion of bias. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 However, if disclosure should be made, it is good practice to make full disclosure because partial disclosure is likely to reduce public confidence in the administration of justice. As Lord Woolf CJ observed, partial disclosure is “naturally likely to excite suspicions in the mind of the litigant concerned even though those concerns are unjustified”: see <span class="font-italic">Taylor</span> at [65]. In <span class="font-italic">Jones v DAS Legal </span><span class="font-italic">Expenses Insurance Co Ltd and Others</span> [2003] EWCA Civ 1071, the Court of Appeal made the following comments on full disclosure at [35]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">iv) A full explanation must be given to the parties. That explanation should <span class="font-italic">detail exactly what matters are within the judge's knowledge</span> which give rise to a possible conflict of interest. <span class="font-italic">The judge must be punctilious in setting out all material matters known to him</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I endorse these observations as a statement of good practice which should be followed by a tribunal in disclosing facts which might found a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> case of apparent bias.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 If a tribunal fails to make full disclosure of facts which it should have disclosed, how is this relevant to apparent bias? In <span class="font-italic">Aussie Airlines</span>, Merkel J stated his views on this point at 758 – 759:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Secondly, the failure to disclose, of itself, can be <span class="font-italic">one of the circumstances which together with others</span> may give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias: <span class="font-italic">S &amp; M Motor Repairs</span> per Kirby P at 374. A party or the public may well be left with the impression that there was <span class="font-italic">intentional concealment or non-disclosure</span>, or that something was “wrong about it all”. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I agree. A tribunal’s failure to (fully) disclose its associations with a party or a party’s representative is one factor which may lead to a reasonable suspicion of bias. Nonetheless, as Merkel J suggested, a failure to disclose will only give rise to apparent bias if there are other circumstances which support such a finding. Crucially, in my view, the tribunal’s associations must be sufficiently material or significant for lack of disclosure of the same to support a reasonable suspicion of bias. I draw support for this proposition from Kirby P’s reasoning on the topic of non-disclosure in <span class="font-italic">Caltex Oil</span> at 113, as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… To the reasonable observer, even one knowledgeable about our system of appointing judges, <span class="font-italic">the duration, variety, intensity and proximity of his Honour's connection with the “Caltex interests” would, I believe, raise a reasonable apprehension of bias</span> on the basis that his Honour had been the “Caltex barrister”. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This apprehension would be <span class="font-italic">stimulated</span>, in my respectful view, by the failure to disclose such a <span class="font-italic">long, recent and varied connection</span> with the first appellant <span class="font-italic">at the outset of the proceedings</span>, as would, I think, have been normal. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It is implicit in this reasoning that a fair-minded observer would generally not hold a reasonable suspicion of bias on the basis of a tribunal’s non-disclosure of insubstantial or limited associations with a party or a party’s representatives. This is because a fair-minded observer would generally not suspect that non-disclosure in such circumstances was due to bias, even if he or she considered that disclosure was warranted on the facts. Instead, the natural view would be that the tribunal had not made disclosure due to an honest and objective (albeit mistaken) judgment that disclosure was unnecessary. Thus, non-disclosure where a tribunal’s associations with a party or its representatives were insubstantial or limited would generally not support a reasonable suspicion of bias. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Thus, the nature and extent of a tribunal’s associations is a crucial factor in determining whether the failure to disclose the same supports a reasonable suspicion of bias. Additionally, in my view, there is a second key factor, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the nature of the partial disclosure; and, in particular, whether it gives rise to an impression that the tribunal had intentionally concealed or not disclosed any relevant associations to put forward a different picture (see Merkel J’s observations at [42] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In some cases, partial disclosure would falsely downplay the nature and extent of the tribunal’s associations: <span class="font-italic">suppressio veri, suggestio falsi</span>. This might occur, for example, if a tribunal revealed to the parties that it had links with one party, and disclosed a fleeting and trivial connection, <span class="font-italic">eg, </span>having represented the party’s relative as counsel many years ago, while omitting to mention a more substantial tie, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, a prolonged personal friendship with the party. In such cases, upon discovering the truth, a fair-minded and reasonably informed observer might justifiably suspect that the tribunal had intentionally concealed the more significant association due to bias. In such circumstances, the partial disclosure would strongly support a reasonable suspicion of bias. However, in other cases, partial disclosure may not falsely suggest that the tribunal’s associations were more limited than they actually were. In these cases, therefore, a fair-minded observer, upon discovering the full extent of the tribunal’s associations, would not obtain the impression of intentional concealment or non-disclosure. Hence, the fact of partial disclosure would not lend great weight to a reasonable suspicion of bias in such cases. For these reasons, the nature of the partial disclosure made is relevant to whether it supports a reasonable suspicion of bias.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Relevance of the Tribunal’s Response to Inquiries</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I now turn to the relevance of the tribunal’s response to inquiries from a party, for information as to the tribunal’s associations, to apparent bias. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The Plaintiff submitted that the Adjudicator was not forthcoming in responding to the Plaintiff’s solicitors’ requests for information, and that this is further basis for finding apparent bias on his part.

</div>
</div> On this point, the Plaintiff relied on <span class="font-italic">Cofely Ltd v Anthony Bingham and Knowles Ltd</span> [2016] BLR 187 (“<span class="font-italic">Cofely</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In <span class="font-italic">Cofely</span>, the first defendant was appointed as the arbitrator of a dispute between the claimant and the second defendant. Subsequently, the claimant’s solicitors sought clarification from both defendants regarding their professional relationship. The first defendant was defensive and evasive in his responses to the claimant’s queries. He then convened a hearing during which he questioned the claimant’s counsel aggressively and in a hostile manner. Thereafter, even though neither the claimant nor the second defendant had sought a ruling, the first defendant ruled that there was no apparent bias. The claimant then applied to the court for the first defendant to be removed. In his witness statement in the court proceedings, the first defendant stated that the information which the claimant had sought from him was irrelevant and also described the claimant’s behaviour as “assertive/challenging/perhaps even bullying”. In ordering that the first defendant be removed, Hamblen J held, at 204 – 205, that his evasiveness in replying to queries, aggressive conduct during the hearing and continued lack of objectivity in his witness statement were grounds, among others, which established apparent bias. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I agree that a tribunal’s responses to a party’s inquiries for information about its associations can lend weight to a reasonable suspicion of bias. But the evidence must be carefully sifted and weighed to determine whether the tribunal’s replies support a finding of apparent bias. In this regard, the detail, speed and tone of the tribunal’s responses are relevant considerations. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Waiver</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The Defendant submitted that, even if apparent bias arose, the Plaintiff had waived its right to challenge the Adjudication Determination on that basis. The Defendant noted that, while the Adjudicator had told the parties that he had previous dealings with Mr Foo, the Plaintiff did not challenge his impartiality during the proceedings, and had only made queries about the Adjudicator’s relationship with Mr Foo after the release of the Adjudication Determination.

</div> Here, the Plaintiff relied on <span class="font-italic">Smith v Kvaerner Cementation Foundations Ltd (General Council of the Bar intervening)</span> [2007] 1 WLR 370 (“<span class="font-italic">Smith</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Smith</span>, Lord Phillips CJ, delivering the English Court of Appeal’s judgment, articulated three requirements for a party to waive its right to raise an allegation of apparent bias: “the party waiving should be aware of all the material facts, of the consequences of the choice open to him, and given a fair opportunity to reach an unpressured decision”: see <span class="font-italic">Smith</span> at [29]. The Plaintiff argued that, as the Adjudicator did not fully disclose the nature and extent of his associations with Mr Foo at the material time, there had been no waiver because it had not been aware of all the material facts.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I endorse the general principle that a party will only waive a right by a free and informed choice. But, in my judgment, that principle must be qualified in a way which does not enable a party to hold back an apparent bias challenge, and subsequently brandish it as a trump card against the tribunal’s decision if it is adverse to the party. This is especially so in relation to challenges of apparent bias against SOPA adjudicators. The aim of the Act is to ensure the timely settlement of payment disputes on an interim basis; an aim which will only be achieved if adjudication determinations are generally promptly enforced, unless there are good reasons otherwise. If parties were allowed to reserve apparent bias challenges for the setting aside stage, tactical manoeuvring would ensue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 These considerations lead me to conclude that, while the requirements for waiver in <span class="font-italic">Smith</span> are generally sound, the first requirement, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, knowledge of all the material facts, should be qualified in the following way, at least where allegations of apparent bias are made against SOPA adjudicators. In some cases, a party will be put on notice that an issue of apparent bias may lie because the tribunal has disclosed sufficient information to the party to alert it to the facts underlying the issue, even if the tribunal has not fully disclosed every material detail. In these cases, it is up to the party to decide whether to pursue the point by requesting the tribunal to elaborate on the details of the relevant facts. However, in my judgment, if the party chooses not to make the relevant inquiries immediately or without undue delay, it should not be allowed, without strong reasons, to later allege, upon raising a challenge on the basis of apparent bias, and upon being met with the objection of waiver, that there was no waiver because it did not have knowledge of all material facts at the relevant time. For, having been put on notice, it was the party’s responsibility to enquire into those relevant facts. If it fails to do so, the party should be deemed to have had sufficient knowledge of all the material facts such that the first element of waiver will be fulfilled. In my judgment, this caveat to the test for waiver stated in <span class="font-italic">Smith</span> is necessary to afford “critical examination” of apparent bias challenges against SOPA adjudicators (see Dyson LJ’s comments quoted at [30] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I hasten to add that whether “sufficient information” was given to put a party on notice is heavily fact-sensitive and may, at times, be a fine balancing exercise. Presently, two considerations strike me as relevant. First, the tribunal’s disclosure must not misrepresent the material facts. To return to the example given at [44] above, it is unlikely that a tribunal would be held to have disclosed sufficient information if, having had a sustained personal friendship and trivial business dealings with one party, it disclosed the latter but kept (completely) mum on the former. In such a case, it seems that the aggrieved party could legitimately complain that, while it had waived its right to raise an apparent bias challenge on the basis of the business dealings, it had not done so regarding the personal friendship, for nothing suggesting that had been disclosed. Secondly, in my view, another key consideration is whether the party to whom disclosure was made had legal representation at the material time. If not, I consider that a higher threshold might have to be surpassed to establish that the party had sufficient information to put it on notice. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Application of the Law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I now apply the law to the facts and turn first to the substantive issue of apparent bias. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Adjudicator’s Associations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The Plaintiff’s case on apparent bias was founded on the Adjudicator’s associations with Mr Foo. The Adjudicator was associated with Mr Foo in two ways (see [21]–[25] above). First, he had represented RPPL, when Mr Foo was the MD of RPPL, and EPPL, a company linked to RPPL, as counsel. Secondly, he had been a non-executive director of RH while Mr Foo was the CEO and EC of RH. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I turn first to the Adjudicator’s associations <span class="font-italic">qua</span> counsel. In terms of his representation of EPPL, the evidence merely discloses that the Adjudicator had acted for EPPL on two occasions, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, in 1998 and 2006 (see [25(a)] above). Furthermore, when the Adjudicator was appointed on 3 October 2016 (see [6] above), about a decade had elapsed since the Adjudicator had last acted for EPPL. Moreover, and most significantly, it was unchallenged evidence that Mr Foo had never been involved in EPPL or its matters.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Foo’s Affidavit at para 34.3.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I accordingly find that negligible weight can be placed on the Adjudicator’s prior representation of EPPL.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The Adjudicator had also acted for RPPL on two occasions. However, in comparison with the Adjudicator’s connection to EPPL, less time had elapsed since his last association with RPPL: he had last acted for RPPL in August 2013. Moreover, Mr Foo had instructed the Adjudicator in his capacity as the MD of RPPL; thus, the Adjudicator had been directly associated with Mr Foo in acting for RPPL. I also note that the Adjudicator’s dealings with RPPL had spanned about 12 years, as he had first acted for RPPL in 2002 (see [23(a)] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In my view, a reasonably informed member of the public would be aware of the following and appraise the Adjudicator’s dealings with Mr Foo accordingly. Many SOPA adjudicators are experienced practitioners at the construction bar, who would naturally have dealt with many members of the construction industry during the course of their practice. Thus, it is likely that SOPA adjudicators would have had dealings with the parties who come before them and their representatives. A fair-minded and reasonably informed member of the public would bear this reality in mind in assessing the Adjudicator’s dealings with RPPL. I draw support for this line of reasoning from the New Zealand Court of Appeal’s approach in <span class="font-italic">Man O’War Station Ltd v Auckland City Council</span> [2001] 1 NZLR 552. In that case, a surveyor had testified for a city council at a trial. On appeal, the New Zealand Court of Appeal upheld the trial court’s decision in favour of the council and allowed the council’s cross-appeal. It then transpired that a member of the appellate court had been associated with the surveyor. In particular, the firm which the judge had been a member of had acted for the surveyor’s firm before. An application was then made for the Court of Appeal’s judgment to be set aside. In dismissing the application, Gault J, delivering the court’s judgment, observed at [33] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Senior legal practitioners with busy commercial and conveyancing practices</span> <span class="font-italic">must come into contact and establish business associations with a considerable proportion of the professional practitioners in related fields such as surveying and civil engineering</span>. The proposition that because of such an association they should be regarded as in danger of failure to carry out judicial functions impartially, eight years after retiring from practice, is unreal. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis<span class="font-italic"> </span>added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In my judgment, a fair-minded and reasonably informed observer, bearing in mind that a SOPA adjudicator would likely have had dealings with the disputing parties or their representatives, would not place much weight on the Adjudicator’s associations with Mr Foo through RPPL:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a)  First, in terms of the intensity of his associations with RPPL, the Adjudicator had acted for RPPL twice over 12 years. Moreover, it was unchallenged evidence that, during this period of time, four other lawyers had acted for companies in the same group as RPPL, in “13 different matters”.

The evidence was that the Adjudicator had only interacted with Mr Foo at board meetings, and that there were no more than four such meetings.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Foo’s Affidavit at para 32.3.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, at the time of his appointment as the Adjudicator, close to seven years had passed since the Adjudicator had relinquished his position as non-executive director of RH (see [25(b)] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Having separately analysed the Adjudicator’s relevant associations in terms of their duration, intensity, and the time which had passed since they ended, I now consider them together in the main. The picture which emerges is this. The Adjudicator had an intermittent professional association with Mr Foo which involved representing RPPL twice over 12 years, and serving as a non-executive director on the same board as Mr Foo for a fairly short time. The Adjudicator was not the only lawyer used by the above companies. His last association with Mr Foo ended more than three years before the adjudication. In his emails, the Adjudicator stated that he had not acted for Mr Foo personally and had never had a personal or social relationship with Mr Foo; there was no evidence before me to contradict these claims, nor did the Plaintiff seek to dispute them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In this light, a fair-minded and informed observer would have no reason to suspect that the Adjudicator’s associations with Mr Foo might influence his decision. In other words, there is no rational link between the Adjudicator’s associations and any prospect of bias. Thus, without more, on the basis of the Adjudicator’s associations alone, the reasonable suspicion test is not fulfilled.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Nonetheless, the Plaintiff’s case is not founded on the Adjudicator’s associations alone. The Plaintiff argued that the Adjudicator’s lack of full disclosure and the nature of his responses to queries for information support a reasonable suspicion of bias. I turn now to these arguments. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Lack of Full Disclosure</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The threshold question is whether the Adjudicator should have (fully) disclosed his associations with Mr Foo, RPPL and RPPL’s related companies at all. In my view, the answer is in the affirmative. This is not a case where the facts patently do not raise a reasonable suspicion of bias. The Adjudicator’s associations suffice to found a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> case of apparent bias (see [40] above). Thus, the Adjudicator should have fully disclosed his associations to the parties as a matter of good practice (see [41] above). Moreover, since the Adjudicator learnt that Mr Foo was one of the Defendant’s representatives through the Defendant’s solicitors’ email one day before the Preliminary Conference (see [14] above), he should have made disclosure to the parties at the commencement of the Preliminary Conference.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 However, I do not regard the Adjudicator’s associations with Mr Foo, RPPL and RPPL’s related companies as sufficiently material such that apparent bias is established based on those associations and non-disclosure of the same. In my view, the Adjudicator fell short of best practices in failing to disclose his associations to the parties. But given the sporadic and limited nature of those associations, a fair-minded observer would not consider that he did so because of bias. Instead, one would consider, and I so find, the non-disclosure to be an honest, non-partisan misjudgement by the Adjudicator regarding the necessity of disclosure (see [42] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Furthermore, in my judgment, this is not a case in which the Adjudicator’s partial disclosure gives rise to an impression of intentional concealment or non-disclosure (see [44] above). I have found that the Adjudicator informed the parties that he had previous dealings with Mr Foo at the beginning of the Merits Conference (see [20] above). In my view, such partial disclosure did not falsely downplay the nature and extent of the Adjudicator’s dealings with Mr Foo. For stating that one has previous dealings with a party does not suggest anything about the nature and extent of those dealings. Thus, on these facts, a fair-minded observer would not conclude that the Adjudicator was attempting to conceal his previous associations with Mr Foo. Hence, a fair-minded observer would not entertain a reasonable suspicion of bias on the basis that the Adjudicator had deliberately concealed his associations with Mr Foo.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 For these reasons, the Adjudicator’s omission to fully disclose his associations with Mr Foo does not support a reasonable suspicion that he was biased. Hence, I reject the Plaintiff’s submission that the lack of full disclosure bolsters its case on apparent bias. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Adjudicator’s Responses to Queries Regarding His Associations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The Plaintiff submitted that the Adjudicator’s responses to the Plaintiff’s solicitors’ queries, regarding his associations with Mr Foo, support a reasonable suspicion of bias. The Plaintiff relied on the fact that the Adjudicator had failed to disclose the fees which his firm had billed RPPL and his independent non-executive directorship in RH in his two email responses. The Plaintiff argued on this basis that the Adjudicator’s responses “were far from forthcoming and showed his lack of awareness of the unconscious bias that could arise [given] his associations”, and thus supported a reasonable suspicion of bias.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I cannot criticise the Adjudicator’s refusal to disclose his professional fees. As the adjudicator explained in his email dated 15 November 2016, this is confidential information. While the Adjudicator did not mention his directorship in RH, this was an explicable slip given the remoteness of that association with Mr Foo (see [60] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b)  Secondly, in terms of the speed of the Adjudicator’s responses, the Adjudicator did not delay in replying to the queries for information. His first response was sent on the same day as the Plaintiff’s solicitors’ first query. His second response was sent one day after the Plaintiff’s solicitors’ second query. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, the tone of the emails, while firm and direct, was also objective and tempered. The Adjudicator provided the requested-for information without challenging the propriety of the requests. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The facts above are a far cry from those in <span class="font-italic">Cofely</span> where the arbitrator had been evasive, dilatory and partisan upon receiving a request for information. They do not suggest a reasonable suspicion of bias on the Adjudicator’s part.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In summary, the Plaintiff’s substantive case on apparent bias is not made out. This suffices to dispose of the first ground of challenge to the Adjudication Determination. However, for good measure, I now consider the issue of waiver.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Waiver</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 While the parties presented differing accounts of what the Adjudicator had stated at the Conferences, it is undisputed that the Adjudicator did not reveal full details of his associations with Mr Foo. As stated above, in my judgment, the Adjudicator thus fell short of good practice in failing to fully disclose his associations with Mr Foo at the Merits Conference (see [65] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 But I have also found that the Adjudicator stated that he had “previous dealings” with Mr Foo at the start of the Merits Conference (see [20] above). In my judgment, the reference to “previous dealings” was sufficient to place the Plaintiff on enquiry for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, “dealings” connotes business relations or transactions. I note that, in <span class="font-italic">The Oxford English Dictionary</span> vol IV (Clarendon Press, 2nd Ed, 1989), “dealing” is defined at p 297 as “Intercourse, friendly or business communication, connexion”. But other dictionaries define the term more specifically. For example, the<span class="font-italic"> Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary of Current English</span> (Oxford University Press, 5th Ed, 1995) defines “have dealings (with sb)” at p 298 as “to have relations with sb, <span class="font-italic">esp in business</span>” [emphasis added]; again, <span class="font-italic">Chambers English Dictionary </span>(Chambers, 1990) defines “dealing” at p 363 as “manner of acting towards others: intercourse <span class="font-italic">of trade</span>” [emphasis added]. In my judgment, in the context in which the Adjudicator made his disclosure, the Plaintiff would have understood “previous dealings” in this more restricted sense. That the Plaintiff was represented by solicitors at the Merits Conference fortifies this conclusion (see the second factor identified at [53] above). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, the Adjudicator did not misrepresent his relationship with Mr Foo by describing it in terms of “previous dealings”. If I had found that the Adjudicator had simply said “we have met before” or similar words, I would have had little hesitation in finding that insufficient information had been disclosed to put the Plaintiff on notice. Similarly, if the Adjudicator’s association with Mr Foo had also involved a personal relationship, which the Adjudicator had made no mention of to the Plaintiff, I would also have found that insufficient information had been disclosed to put the Plaintiff on notice (see the first consideration noted at [53] above). But these are not the facts here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Thus, the Plaintiff was put on notice that an issue of apparent bias might lie because the Adjudicator had disclosed sufficient information to the Plaintiff to alert it to the facts, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, previous (business) dealings, underlying this issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Having concluded that the Plaintiff was put on inquiry, I now consider whether there are any strong reasons why it should nonetheless be allowed to contend, upon being met with the Defendant’s argument on waiver, that it did not have knowledge of all the material facts at the relevant time, such that it did not waive its right to raise an apparent bias challenge. In my judgment, there are no such strong reasons. The Plaintiff had no satisfactory explanation why it had not made inquiries into the Adjudicator’s associations with Mr Foo once the Adjudicator had disclosed that he had previous dealings with Mr Foo. When I pressed Mr de Vaz on this point, his telling answer was: “[f]or expediency, we raised the challenge later”.

</div> When I then asked Mr de Vaz if I should conclude that his client had only raised queries about the Adjudicator’s associations with Mr Foo because it was unhappy with the Adjudication Determination, he said candidly that such unhappiness was “true in every case where one seeks to set aside the AD”.

</div> I therefore conclude that the “strong reasons” exception to the rule stated at [52] above does not apply here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Thus, applying that rule, the Plaintiff is deemed to have full knowledge of all the material facts at the relevant time such that the first element of waiver is fulfilled. Accordingly, the Plaintiff’s argument on the waiver point falls away.

In particular, they disputed whether the word “days” in Para 2h should be interpreted in accordance with the Statutory Definition so as to exclude public holidays. This was crucial because 12 September 2016 was Hari Raya Haji, a public holiday within the meaning of the Holidays Act (Cap 126, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the Holidays Act”): see s 2(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with the Schedule to the Holidays Act. If 12 September 2016 is not included in the calculation of 21 days after 25 August 2016, when the Payment Claim was submitted (see [4] above), the Payment Response Deadline was 16 September 2016; if 12 September 2016 is accounted for, the Payment Response Deadline was 15 September 2016.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The Adjudicator held that the Statutory Definition applied to the word “days” in Para 2h, on the basis that, by cl 19.1, the parties had expressly agreed that the Statutory Definition should apply to the Sub-Contract in respect of the deadline for payment responses.

While the CA allowed Grouteam’s appeal against my decision (see <span class="font-italic">Grouteam Pte Ltd v UES Holdings Pte Ltd</span> [2016] 5 SLR 1011 (“<span class="font-italic">Grouteam (CA)</span>”), the CA did not comment on my interpretation of cl 19.1. Rather, the CA allowed the appeal on the basis that the provision governing the submission of payment claims was not the provision which I had identified; it followed that the payment claim had been served in time (see <span class="font-italic">Grouteam</span> <span class="font-italic">(CA)</span> at [44]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In my judgment, cl 19.1 did not incorporate the Statutory Definition into the Sub-Contract (in respect of payment responses) for the following reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First and foremost, on a plain and natural reading, cl 19.1 merely states the parties’ acknowledgment that the relevant provisions of the Act govern the Sub-Contract: it does not purport to incorporate any provision of the Act into the Sub-Contract. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, to depart from this plain reading, by holding that cl 19.1 incorporates provisions of the Act into the Sub-Contract, would not make sense. Under s 4(1) of the Act, the provisions of the Act apply to the Sub-Contract regardless of whether parties incorporate them into their contractual arrangements. Thus cl 19.1 would be superfluous if it incorporated any provisions of the Act into the Sub-Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Thus, cl 19.1 does not incorporate the Statutory Definition into the Sub-Contract (in respect of payment responses): the parties did not expressly agree, by cl 19.1, that the Statutory Definition should apply in respect of payment responses. In that light, I turn to the true interpretation of the word “days” in Para 2h of the 2015 Letter. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Interpretation Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In <span class="font-italic">Fujitec Singapore Corp Ltd v GS Engineering &amp; Construction Corp</span> [2016] 1 SLR 1307 (“<span class="font-italic">Fujitec</span>”), the construction contract provided that payment responses would be issued within “21 calendar days of receipt of the progress claims”. In interpreting this clause, Lee Seiu Kin J remarked at [10] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">While the word “day” is defined in the Act, that definition is meant to apply to that word wherever it is found in the Act.

In appropriate circumstances, in interpreting a construction (or supply) contract the payment terms of which falls within the purview of the Act, it could be possible to hold that the same interpretation was meant in the contract. But this depends on the circumstances. The respondent submitted that it was appropriate to do it in the present case. <span class="font-italic">If the term concerned was “day”, I would have little hesitation to do so</span>. Unfortunately for the respondent it is not. Instead, the Contract uses “calendar day”. The counter-submission advanced by the applicant was that there must have been a reason for the use of a different term in the Contract. The applicant submitted that the reason was because <span class="font-italic">the Contract intended a different concept for “calendar day” compared to “day” simpliciter</span>, and this was that public holidays would also be counted.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Both parties relied on this passage in their submissions.

In Kim Lewison, <span class="font-italic">The Interpretation of Contracts</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Lewison</span>”), the relevance of statutory definitions to the interpretation of contractual terms is discussed at para 5.16 at p 289, as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The mere fact that a contract uses a word that is defined by statute does not make that word a legal term of art. Thus where the holder of an option agreed to apply for planning permission for “development” of property it was held that the word “development” was to be construed in a non-technical sense rather than in accordance with its statutory definition in town and country planning legislation. <span class="font-italic">However, where an agreement has been drawn with the provisions of statutorily defined words in mind, some particular context is required before the court can attribute to the parties an intention to use such a term in a different sense to that which it has in the legislative context</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100  In <span class="font-italic">Castlebay Limited v Asquith Properties Limited</span> [2005] EWCA Civ 1734 (“<span class="font-italic">Castlebay</span>”), which <span class="font-italic">Lewison</span> cites for the italicised proposition in the extract above, the English Court of Appeal considered the true interpretation of the phrase “application for planning permission” in an option to purchase. At the material time, Asquith had obtained outline planning permission. However, its application for approval of certain reserved matters was pending. Under the planning legislation, “application for planning permission” denoted application for outline planning permission and did not refer to application for approval of reserved matters. The question arose as to whether the phrase “application for planning permission” in the option should be interpreted in accordance with its statutory meaning. In answering that question in the affirmative, Chadwick LJ, delivering the court’s principal judgment, reasoned at [46] – [47] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">46 … <span class="font-italic">this is clearly an agreement which has been drawn with the provisions of the planning legislation fully in mind. In those circumstances, I would expect the parties to have intended, by the phrase "application for planning permission", the meaning which that phrase has long been recognized to bear in the context of planning legislation</span>. If there were a context which required that meaning to be enlarged, the court would give effect to that requirement, as it did in the <span class="font-italic">Hargreaves</span> case. But, <span class="font-italic">absent any context which requires some larger meaning</span>, I am left with an agreement which is intended to strike a balance between the interests of the owner and the interests of the grantee. And I am left with the firm conclusion that, <span class="font-italic">if these parties had intended some meaning to be given to the phrase, "any application for planning permission" wider than the meaning which that phrase normally bears, they would have made that clear</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">47. <span class="font-italic">The parties have not made that clear. So I am left with the meaning which the judge gave to that phrase; which is the meaning which it bears in planning legislation</span>. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I agree. When parties contract with the provisions of a statute in mind, and when the terms of those statutory provisions are defined by that statute, then generally, if the contract uses the same terms, the terms should be interpreted in accordance with the statutory definitions, unless the context yields a different interpretation. This is simply an application of the principle of contextual interpretation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 In this case, it is beyond doubt that the parties contracted with s 11(1) of the Act, which provides for the timeline for payment responses, in mind. For by cl 19.1, the parties expressly acknowledged that s 11(1), which is one of the “relevant provisions” of the Act which cl 19.1 refers to (see [94] above), would apply to the Sub-Contract. Section 11(1) uses the word “days” which is defined in s 2 of the Act to exclude public holidays. Moreover, the word “days” is a fundamental operative word in s 11(1) because s 11(1) is concerned with the calculation of the timeline for payment responses. I now turn to consider the phrase “twenty-one (21) days” in Para 2h of the 2015 Letter. The word “days” here is also being used in the context of determining the timeline for payment responses, because it affects the Payment Response Deadline. In the light of the foregoing, in my judgment, the word “days” in Para 2h should be interpreted in accordance with the Statutory Definition unless the context indicates otherwise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 But there is nothing which indicates that a different interpretation of the word “days” in Para 2h is appropriate. During oral submissions, Mr de Vaz brought my attention to a letter from the Plaintiff to the Defendant dated 20 June 2016 (“the 2016 Letter”). The material terms of the 2016 Letter are as follows:

</div> some of which do not support the Plaintiff’s case. For example, the 2016 Letter suggests that the Plaintiff envisaged that, in deciding the contractually stipulated deadline for submitting payment claims, public holidays should not be included. This would arguably be consistent with applying the Statutory Definition in interpreting the word “days” in Para 2h, for that would ensure consistency between the contractually stipulated deadlines for payment claims and payment responses to this extent: both timelines would not account for public holidays. In sum, there is nothing in the 2016 Letter which indicates that the word “days” in Para 2h of the 2015 Letter should not be interpreted in accordance with the Statutory Definition.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 I conclude that the word “days” in Para 2h of the 2015 Letter should be interpreted in line with the Statutory Definition to exclude public holidays.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the Timing Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The parties did not expressly agree that the Statutory Definition should apply to the word “days” in the Sub-Contract.

The Plaintiff recognised this point, and argued that reg 7(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) was such a fundamental provision.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 In <span class="font-italic">Aik Heng</span>, the applicant argued that the adjudication determination should be set aside because the notice of intention to apply for adjudication (“the s 13(2) notice”) breached, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, reg 7(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(iii) of the Regulations. The notice did not state the date of the contract, as required under reg 7(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(iii), <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the date on which the Letter of Award was accepted, but the date of the Letter of Award. However, Lee Seiu Kin J held that the breach did not warrant setting aside the adjudication determination and reasoned at [12] – [14] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">12 I considered <span class="font-italic">Australian Timber</span> in <span class="font-italic">Progressive Builders Pte Ltd v Long Rise Pte Ltd</span> (“<span class="font-italic">Progressive Builders</span>”), in which I held at [58] that a payment claim would only be invalidated for failure to comply with s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Act <span class="font-italic">where that failure impeded the adjudication process</span>. While <span class="font-italic">Australian Timber</span> and <span class="font-italic">Progressive Builders</span> related to the validity of a payment claim and not a notice of intention under s 13(2) of the Act, i<span class="font-italic">n my view, that reasoning was equally applicable</span>. It is one thing to suggest that a failure to notify a respondent under s 13(2) of the Act deprives an adjudicator of any jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter<span class="font-italic">; it is another thing altogether to say that any deficiency whatsoever in that notice would render it invalid</span>. There is no doubt that the service of a notice of intention under s 13(2) of the Act is a jurisdictional requirement. What founds the jurisdictional nature of the requirement under s 13(2), in the sense that the condition is essential to the existence of an adjudicator’s determination, is that a respondent must know of the case he has to meet and be allowed to prepare his response.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">13 … I was of the view that the breach of reg 7(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] in the present case (ie, stating the date of the Letter of Award and not the date of the acceptance) was a technical breach which was insufficient to invalidate the notification. <span class="font-italic">The formal requirements in reg 7(1) were clearly intended to ensure that a respondent has sufficient notice under s 13(2) of the Act</span>. As I had stated in <span class="font-italic">Progressive Builders</span> at [58], the Act, characterised by speed and informality, should not be countenanced by an excessively technical approach.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14 In the present case, counsel for the respondent conceded that the respondent was able to identify the subcontract in dispute, despite the fact that the date of the Letter of Award (and not the date the subcontract was made) was stated in the NOI. <span class="font-italic">There was no doubt that it had, by way of the NOI, been notified of the applicant’s intention to apply for adjudication of the payment claim dispute, and that it was able to prepare its substantive response accordingly</span>. This reinforced my finding that breaches of this nature do not render a notice of intention invalid. I therefore rejected the respondent’s submission on this ground.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This passage establishes the following two propositions:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a)  First, the touchstone for whether an adjudication determination should be set aside, on the basis that the s 13(2) notice which gave rise to the adjudication did not comply with the Regulations, is whether “that failure impeded the adjudication process”. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, a key consideration is whether, notwithstanding the failure to comply with reg 7 of the Regulations, the respondent was still notified for the applicant’s intention to apply for adjudication and was able to prepare its substantive response accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 I note that the discussion of reg 7(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) in Chow Kok Fong, <span class="font-italic">Security of Payments and Construction Adjudication</span> (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2013) (“<span class="font-italic">Chow</span>”) at para 8.28 may appear to support the Plaintiff’s case:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">The requirement that the adjudication notice should contain a ‘brief description of the payment dispute’ is of considerable practical significance</span>. Both [the Act] and Regulations are silent on the matters to be included in the description but it is considered that it should take the form of a statement of the claimant’s reasons in law and in fact supporting the payment claim. Where the adjudication application concerns a relatively small matter, the adjudicator may decide to proceed on the basis of the documents submitted. In such a situation, this <span class="font-italic">description may serve as a brief statement of the case for the payment claim</span>. Where the dispute involves substantial amounts or relatively more complex issues, the adjudicator may call for further submissions or convene a conference. In these situations, <span class="font-italic">the description is still tactically important as it encapsulates the thrust of the claimant’s arguments before the main submissions</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 However, I do not consider that reg 7(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) is such a key provision that an adjudication determination may be set aside for breach of reg 7 (1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) alone:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, applying the two propositions stated at [109] above, I do not consider that a notice issued in breach of reg 7(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) will impede the adjudication process. Even if it does not contain “a brief statement of the case for the payment claim” or “the thrust of the claimant’s arguments” (which, in my view, is the basis for the comment in <span class="font-italic">Chow</span> that reg 7(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) “is of considerable practical significance”), the notice will effectively communicate the claimant’s intention to the respondent (insofar as the other requirements of reg 7(1) are satisfied). Therefore, the s 13(2) notice will still serve its core function under the Act; hence, breach of reg 7(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) will not impede the adjudication process. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, the Plaintiff’s argument that fulfilling reg 7(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) is important to apprise a respondent of the nature of the claim, in order that the latter may decide whether to pursue settlement or adjudication (see [108] above), is not compelling. Generally, by the time that the s 13(2) notice is served, the Plaintiff will have received the payment claim. Under reg 5(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), this will contain details such as a breakdown of the items constituting the claimed amount, a description of the items, the quantity or quantum of each item and the calculations showing how the claimed amount was derived. Thus, the Plaintiff will generally have sufficient information to decide whether to pursue settlement or adjudication before receiving a s 13(2) notice. I do not consider that the failure to provide even more information, due to breach of reg 7(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>), should be sufficient basis to set aside an adjudication determination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 More importantly, in this case, the Notice indicated that the Defendant intended to apply for adjudication in respect of the Payment Claim which it had submitted on 25 August 2016 (see [106] above). The Payment Claim included a breakdown of the items, the quantum claimed, and showed how the total claimed amount was derived. The Notice further indicated that the Defendant disagreed with the Payment Response, which itself contained details supporting the position set out therein. Thus, the Plaintiff must have been well aware of the nature of the dispute between the parties and the case which it had to meet during the adjudication proceedings. Plainly, any failure by the Defendant to comply with reg 7(1)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) did not cause the Plaintiff any prejudice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 For the reasons, I reject the Plaintiff’s final challenge to the Adjudication Determination.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Each ground of challenge to the Adjudication Determination fails.
