<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In this originating summons, the plaintiff
                    applied to set aside an adjudication order (“the Adjudication
                    Order”) dated 12 February 2009 made by Mr Koh Lee Meng James
                    (“the Adjudicator”) in SOP Application No SOP/AA08 of 2009.
                    The Adjudication Order was made pursuant to an application by the defendant
                    under the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act
                    (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Act”). On
                    9 October 2009, I allowed the plaintiff’s application and set
                    aside the Adjudication Order on the ground that the defendant had not served a
                    payment claim under s 10 of the Act (“Payment Claim”), and
                    therefore, the Adjudication Order was null and void. I ordered the defendant to
                    pay the plaintiff costs fixed at $10,000. The defendant had since filed a notice
                    of appeal and I now give the grounds for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       There was some dispute as to the circumstances
                    of the commencement of the matter and I shall deal with this later, at
                    para 6. What was not in dispute is the following. The plaintiff was a
                    subcontractor engaged by M+W Zander – Samsung JV, the main contractor in
                    the construction of a wafer plant at Tampines Industrial Avenue (“the
                    Project”). In March 2007 the plaintiff entered into a subcontract
                    with the defendant (“the Contract”) to provide services for the
                    chilled water piping of the Project, which included testing and commissioning,
                    and supply of management and other staff (“the Contract Works”).
                    The contract sum was $1.5m (“the Contract Sum”). The terms of
                    payment in the Contract states: “No down payment. Progress claim 30 Days
                    Nett”. This meant that the defendant was to submit progress claims which
                    the plaintiff would pay within 30 days of submission. The Contract
                    commenced on 1 March 2007 and from April to July 2007, the
                    defendant submitted five “progress claims” in the form of
                    invoices. The first invoice, dated 13 April 2007, was for $78,750; the
                    second dated 18 May 2007, was for $594.30; the third dated 23 May
                    2007, was for $315,000; the fourth dated 20 June 2007, was for $472,500 and
                    the fifth dated 27 July 2007, was for $401,250. For each of these five
                    invoices, the plaintiff made payments within the 30 day period stipulated
                    in the Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Around September 2007 a dispute arose
                    between the parties. The defendant claimed that it had carried out variation
                    works (“the Variation Works”) under the Contract pursuant to
                    instructions from the plaintiff. However the plaintiff alleged that it was the
                    defendant who had breached the Contract; the defendant had delayed carrying out
                    the works due to financial difficulties and the plaintiff had to advance monies
                    to the defendant’s subcontractors to enable the works to be completed. The
                    plaintiff accordingly informed the defendant that it would not pay on its
                    claims. The defendant took this as a repudiatory breach, accepted it and
                    terminated the Contract. The defendant left the work site at the end of
                    September 2007. Thereafter the defendant submitted four further invoices.
                    The first of these, which was the sixth invoice submitted, was dated
                    5 October 2007, for the sum of $256,919.84 for part of the Variation
                    Works carried out. The seventh invoice, dated 26 October 2007, was for
                    $321,000 being the balance works under the Contract that the defendant claimed
                    had been completed by that date. The eighth invoice dated 1 December 2007
                    was for $97,750.00 and the ninth invoice, also dated 1 December 2007, was
                    for $448,603.92. These last two invoices were for the remainder of the Variation
                    Works. Not unexpectedly the plaintiff did not make any payment on these last
                    four invoices. The plaintiff’s position was that it was not liable under
                    the Contract to pay the seventh invoice as the defendant had not completed all
                    its works under the Contract and had in fact been paid in excess of its
                    entitlements under the Contract. As for the three invoices relating to Variation
                    Works, the plaintiff’s position was that it had not authorised those
                    works. The defendant’s position was that the plaintiff had given written
                    instructions in respect of the “additional/variation works” and
                    these had been carried out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 6 December 2007, the
                    defendant’s solicitors, M/s Tan Lim &amp; Wong (“TLW”)
                    wrote a letter to the plaintiff demanding payment under the sixth and seventh
                    invoices within seven days, failing which the defendant would institute legal
                    proceedings. On 13 December 2007, the plaintiff replied to TLW,
                    denying liability to pay the invoices on the ground that the defendant had
                    failed to complete the works under the Contract. On 19 December 2007,
                    the plaintiff wrote to the defendant requesting an explanation for the delay and
                    giving notice that the plaintiff would take over the outstanding works if the
                    defendant did not revert by 23 December 2007. The plaintiff
                    claimed that it thereafter engaged other subcontractors to complete the Contract
                    Works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 30 July 2008 the defendant filed
                    the writ in Suit No 529 of 2008 (“the Suit”) in the High
                    Court, claiming for payment under the sixth to ninth invoices. The plaintiff
                    entered appearance in the Suit on 7 August 2008 and filed its Defence
                    and Counterclaim on 25 August 2008. On 8 October 2008, the
                    plaintiff filed further and better particulars of its Defence and Counterclaim
                    in response to the defendant’s request by its letter of
                    5 September 2008. On 11 November 2008, the plaintiff filed
                    an amended Defence and Counterclaim and on 25 November 2008 the
                    defendant filed the Reply. Then on 9 December 2008 the defendant filed
                    a notice of change of solicitors as well as an amended Statement of Claim. The
                    discovery process was commenced on 19 December 2008 with the filing of
                    an affidavit and list of documents by the defendant, followed by the filing of
                    the corresponding affidavit and list of documents by the plaintiff on
                    22 December 2008. On 23 December 2008, the defendant filed
                    further and better particulars of its amended Statement of Claim pursuant to the
                    plaintiff’s request in its letter of 17 December 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       This was the status of the matter before the
                    defendant fired the first salvo. I say “allegedly” because, as I
                    had alluded in para 2, there was a dispute between the parties on this
                    point. The defendant’s position was that on 26 December 2008, it
                    served on the plaintiff a Payment Claim. This was in the form of a letter dated
                    23 December 2008 together with accompanying documents (collectively,
                    “the 2008 Letter”). The defendant’s engineer, Ngo King Hwa
                    (“Ngo”) deposed on affidavit that on 26 December 2008,
                    he personally handed the 2008 Letter to the plaintiff’s agent, Kim Jin
                    Yong (“Kim”). However Kim, in his affidavits, strenuously denied
                    that this was done. Both sides drew attention to various factors supporting its
                    position: the plaintiff said, <em>inter alia</em>, that by
                    that time the parties were already embroiled in a suit in the High Court over
                    the same subject matter and were represented by solicitors who would have
                    undertaken the task of serving any Payment Claim; the defendant said, <em>inter alia</em>, that the plaintiff had not raised the issue
                    of non-service to the Adjudicator. The ferocity of the allegations that the
                    other side is lying would certainly call for cross-examination of the deponents
                    to determine the truth in this respect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Whatever the dispute between the parties
                    concerning the service of the 2008 Letter, the parties agreed that there did not
                    exist a written response of any kind to it by the plaintiff. The following facts
                    were also agreed upon. On 16 January 2009, the defendant lodged an
                    adjudication application (“the Adjudication Application”) under
                    s 13 of the Act at the Singapore Mediation Centre (“SMC”).
                    The SMC is an authorised nominating body (“ANB”) under the Act. On
                    the same day, the defendant served on the plaintiff a notice of intention to
                    apply for adjudication under the Act. In the Adjudication Application the
                    defendant asserted that a Payment Claim had been served on the plaintiff on
                    26 December 2008 in the sum of $1,124,192.29 and that no payment
                    response had been given by the plaintiff. The Adjudicator was appointed on
                    22 January 2009 and the plaintiff filed the adjudication response on
                    23 January 2009. After considering the submissions of the parties the
                    Adjudicator made his determination on 12 February 2009. He found that
                    the plaintiff was not liable in respect of the seventh invoice for $321,000
                    which was for the balance works under the Contract and the ninth invoice for
                    $448,603.92 which was for part of the Variation Works. The Adjudicator found the
                    plaintiff liable in respect of the sixth and eighth invoices totalling
                    $354,588.37. On 25 February 2009 the plaintiff filed this originating
                    summons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">First issue: whether the 2008 Letter served</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The first question to be determined was an issue
                    of fact: Whether Ngo had served the 2008 Letter on Kim. If the plaintiff’s
                    version is true, then the defendant did not serve a Payment Claim and this would
                    invalidate the Adjudication Order which was made pursuant to a Payment Claim
                    purported to be served on 26 December 2008. This was a substantial
                    dispute of fact that would require cross-examination of the principal witnesses
                    of fact, Kim and Ngo, as well as the defendant’s director, Moon Chang
                    Gook. However I was of the view that I could dispose of this application on the
                    basis of my finding on the next question: whether the 2008 Letter amounted to a
                    Payment Claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Second issue: whether the 2008 Letter a Payment Claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The second issue was therefore this: assuming
                    that the 2008 Letter was served on the plaintiff on 26 December 2008
                    as the defendant claimed, did it constitute a Payment Claim? To throw light on
                    this question it is necessary to consider the relevant provisions of and
                    background to the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Scheme of the Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The long title to the Act states that it is
                    “[a]n Act to facilitate payments for construction work done or for
                    related goods or services supplied in the building and construction industry,
                    and for matters connected therewith”. In moving the second reading of the
                    Bill in Parliament on 16 November 2004, the Minister of State for
                    National Development set out the background to and scheme of the Act in the
                    following manner <em>(Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (16 November 2004) vol 78 at cols
                    1112–1120 (Cedric Foo Chee Keng, Minster of State for National
                    Development)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the construction industry is going through a difficult time.
                        … while the construction pie has shrunk by more than half, the number
                        of contractors has increased by 8.5%. … With too many firms
                        chasing too few projects, the result is severe price competition, with
                        firms prepared to accept marginal profits or even losses in order to remain
                        in business. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The financial problems affecting some construction firms have in turn
                        affected sub-contractors and suppliers further downstream along the
                        construction value chain. They face delays or non-payments for work done or
                        materials supplied.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… whilst the Security of Payment (SOP) Bill will not resolve the
                        structural problem of overcapacity in the construction industry, it will
                        address payment problems. The SOP Bill will create a more conducive
                        operating environment and a level playing field for all parties in the
                        industry. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Progress payments are made periodically throughout the
                            project's duration</em>. Parties lower down the value chain
                        usually fund their work in advance and collect payments thereafter.
                            <em>These downstream players will therefore be adversely
                            affected if those upstream fail to make prompt payment for work done or
                            materials supplied</em>. Contractual terms also tend to favour
                        those higher up the chain. For example, parties downstream are subject to
                        the "pay when paid" clause, whereby they get paid only when those upstream
                        have been paid. <em>The parties who have not been paid for
                            work done are also not permitted to suspend work</em>. In some
                        instances, they are also required to pay liquidated damages if they suspend
                        work.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The SOP Bill … facilitates cash flow by establishing a fast and low
                        cost adjudication system to resolve payment disputes. <em>Affected parties will have the right to suspend work or withhold the
                            supply of goods and services, if the adjudicated amount is not
                            paid</em> in full or not paid at all. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Under the Bill, a claimant, ie, the party who is entitled to progress
                        payment for work done or goods supplied, serves the progress payment claims
                        for work done to the respondent. The respondent must then respond by stating
                        the amount he will pay. If the respondent does not wish to pay the full
                        amount claimed, he must give reasons in his response. This is similar to the
                        current practice of issuing the Architect's Certificate to main contractors
                        for private sector projects, or the issuing of the Superintending Officer's
                        Certificate for public sector projects. The Bill requires the respondent to
                        issue the payment response within 21 days of receiving the payment claim. If
                        the response period is not specified in a contract, a default period of
                        seven days has been prescribed in the Bill. This will ensure timely response
                        to the claims. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The claimant will have a valid reason to make an adjudication
                        application under the following situations:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    Payment response has not been received from
                                the respondent within the specified period; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    Amount in a payment response is disputed;
                                or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    Payment is not received by the due
                                date.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Adjudication does not require the consent of both parties to proceed. The
                        entire process will be completed within three weeks after application unless
                        the parties agree to a longer period. The adjudicator will determine the
                        amount to be paid by the respondent to the claimant, the pay-by date
                        and the adjudication fees payable by both parties. The adjudicator's
                        decision on the particular progress payment in dispute is binding. The
                        respondent could apply for the decision to be reviewed only if the
                        adjudicated sum differs by more than $100,000 from the amount that he is
                        willing to pay in his response to the claimant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, the adjudicated sum must be paid up first prior to
                        the review so that payment to the claimant will not be delayed further.
                        Although the adjudicator's decision is binding, it is not final. Parties may
                        still pursue their right under the contract to challenge the adjudication
                        determination in any court proceedings or arbitration. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… to expedite cashflow, the respondent has up to seven days after
                        the adjudicator's decision to pay the claimant the adjudicated amount.
                        Otherwise, the claimant can suspend work or stop supply. A supplier may also
                        exercise a lien on unfixed goods supplied under the contract, if the goods
                        have not been paid. In addition, the claimant can file the adjudicated
                        amount as a judgement debt in court. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The speedy and low cost adjudication process will expedite the
                        resolution of genuine payment disputes so that cashflow will not be
                        disrupted. It will identify contractors who are facing financial
                        difficulties early, before they cause more problems downstream.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The provisions of the Act are in accord with
                    the stated objectives of fast and low cost adjudication. The process is
                    commenced by service of a Payment Claim under s 10 of the Act, which
                    provides that a claimant may serve a payment claim on any person liable to make
                    a progress payment under a construction contract. The Payment Claim must state
                    the claimed amount and be in the form and contain the information prescribed in
                    the regulations. Within seven days (or up to 21 days if so provided in the
                    contract) of such service, the respondent is required by s 11 of the Act to
                    provide a payment response to the claimant. The payment response may be in the
                    form of payment of the claimed amount or the response amount which is any lesser
                    sum that the respondent is prepared to pay. If the payment response is not by
                    way of payment of the claimed amount, it must be in the form and manner
                    prescribed and must state, <em>inter alia</em>, the
                    response amount and the reason for the difference with the claimed amount. If
                    the claimant disputes a payment response provided by the respondent, or the
                    respondent fails to provide a payment response within the seven to 21 day
                    period, s 12 of the Act provides that the claimant may, within seven days
                    of such failure, make an adjudication application under s 13 to an ANB.
                    Under s 14(3) of the Act, within seven days of receipt of the adjudication
                    application, the ANB is required to serve a copy of it on the respondent and
                    appoint an adjudicator. The respondent is required by s 15(1) of the Act to
                    lodge a response (“adjudication response”) to the adjudication
                    application within seven days. The adjudication response cannot include, as a
                    reason for refusing payment, anything that was not stated in the payment
                    response (see para 13 below). The adjudicator is required under
                    s 16(3) of the Act to act, apart from the usual attributes of impartiality
                    and natural justice, in a timely manner and to avoid incurring unnecessary
                    expense. He is certainly required by s 17(1)(a) of the Act to make a
                    decision within seven to 14 days after the commencement of the adjudication.
                    There is provision in s 18 of the Act for review of the
                    adjudicator’s decision by a single adjudicator or a panel of adjudicators
                    and this process is also required by s 19 of the Act to adhere to strict
                    timelines.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     It may be seen, from the second reading speech
                    in Parliament and the provisions of the Act set out above, that the objective of
                    the Act is to ensure that the cash flow of the claimants are not disrupted by
                    disputes concerning liability and quantum so that construction works can proceed
                    smoothly. The Act seeks to achieve this primarily by putting in place a fast,
                    cheap and, hopefully, effective process whereby a neutral party would adjudicate
                    on the disputed Payment Claim and impose a temporary finality on his
                    determination. Timelines for the various steps are kept short and both claimant
                    and respondent are required to state their positions at the outset and are
                    prohibited from deviating from it in order for the adjudication to proceed with
                    expedition. This, no doubt, goes a long way in ensuring that the process does
                    not become bogged down by amendments to the claim or to the response midway in
                    the adjudication.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Section 15(3) of the Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It bears emphasising that s 15(3) of the
                    Act provides a very important constraint on the contents of the adjudication
                    response. It provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The respondent shall not include in the adjudication
                        response, and the adjudicator shall not consider, any reason for withholding
                        any amount, including but not limited to any cross-claim, counterclaim and
                        set-off, unless —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    where the adjudication relates to a
                                construction contract, the reason was included in the relevant
                                payment response provided by the respondent to the claimant;
                                or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    where the adjudication relates to a supply
                                contract, the reason was provided by the respondent to the claimant
                                on or before the relevant due date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This subsection prohibits the respondent from
                    including in the adjudication response any reason for non-payment unless such
                    reason has been stated in the payment response. To ensure its effectiveness, it
                    further provides that even if such reason is included, the adjudicator is
                    prohibited from considering it. It is therefore very important for a respondent
                    who disputes a Payment Claim or any part thereof to provide a payment response
                    because if he does not do so, then he will have no ground to resist payment
                    before the adjudicator. An omission on the part of the respondent to provide a
                    payment response to a Payment Claim within the time allowed would tantamount to
                    conceding to an adjudication order on the Payment Claim. The next point to note
                    is that the respondent has as little as seven days to provide a payment response
                    (and up to 21 days if the contract provides for it). So while the claimant has
                    as much time as he wishes to prepare the Payment Claim, and there is no
                    obligation on his part to inform the respondent in advance, once he has served
                    the Payment Claim on the respondent, the latter has to not only find out the
                    nature of the claim and consider it, but also, in the event that he disputes it,
                    to decide on the grounds for rejection and to ensure that all the grounds are
                    stated in the payment response because he will not be able to rely on any
                    additional ground before the adjudicator. This part of the adjudication process
                    has such great consequences that any interpretation of the provisions of the Act
                    must take this into consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 2008 Letter</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The 2008 Letter that the defendant claimed it
                    had delivered to the plaintiff on 26 December 2008 comprised a
                    one-page covering letter and accompanying documents numbering some 164 pages.
                    These accompanying documents included a copy of the Contract documents, and the
                    four invoices described in para 3 above along with purchase orders,
                    quotations, letters, site instructions, work orders and other documents in
                    support of the defendant’s claim for payment under those invoices. It is
                    important to set out the entirety of the one-page covering letter which is on
                    the defendant’s letterhead. This reads as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 2008 Letter does not state it is Payment Claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The plaintiff contended that the 2008 Letter
                    did not amount to a Payment Claim within the meaning of s 10 of the Act as
                    there was no indication that this was a payment claim under the Act. The
                    defendant’s position was that the 2008 Letter amounted to a Payment Claim
                    because it complied with all the requirements in s 10(3) of the Act which
                    provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A payment claim —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    shall state the claimed amount, calculated by
                                reference to the period to which the payment claim relates;

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     With respect to sub-para (a), the defendant
                    contended that the 2008 Letter had stated the claimed amounts and the attached
                    invoices showed the period to which they relate. As for sub-para (b), the
                    defendant contended that it complied with all the requirements prescribed in
                    R 5(2) of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment
                    Regulations (RG1, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Regulations”) which
                    provides:</p>

                                    claimed amount is derived.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The defendant contended that there was no
                    requirement for the 2008 Letter to contain a statement that it was a payment
                    claim under the Act for it to amount to one. I agreed that there was no such
                    requirement. This is because one of the models of the Act, the New South Wales
                    Building &amp; Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 1999 (“the
                    NSW Act”), contains such a requirement. This is found in s 13 of the
                    NSW Act, which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>13     Payment
                            claims</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)     A person … who claims to be
                        entitled to a progress payment (the "claimant") may serve a payment claim on
                        the person who, under the construction contract concerned, is or may be
                        liable to make the payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)     A payment claim:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    must identify the construction work (or
                                related goods and services) to which the progress payment relates,
                                and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    must indicate the amount of the progress
                                payment that the claimant claims to be due (the "claimed amount"),
                                and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    must state that it is made under this
                                Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)     The claimed amount may
                        include any amount:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    that the respondent is liable to pay the
                                claimant under section 27 (2A), or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    that is held under the construction contract
                                by the respondent and that the claimant claims is due for
                                release.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)     A payment claim may be
                        served only within:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    the period determined by or in accordance with
                                the terms of the construction contract, or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    the period of 12 months after the construction
                                work to which the claim relates was last carried out (or the related
                                goods and services to which the claim relates were last
                                supplied),</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">whichever is the later.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5)     A claimant cannot serve more than one
                        payment claim in respect of each reference date under the construction
                        contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(6)     However, subsection (5) does not prevent
                        the claimant from including in a payment claim an amount that has been the
                        subject of a previous claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     It can be seen that s 13(2)(c) of the NSW
                    Act specifically provides that the payment claim must state that it is made
                    under the NSW Act. As there is no similar provision in the Act, the absence of
                    such a statement in the 2008 Letter does not, of itself, preclude it from being
                    a payment claim under the Act. This departure from the NSW Act is not explained
                    anywhere in the Bill nor the Parliamentary debates. However there is an
                    interesting comment in Chow Kok Fong: <em>Security of Payments
                        and Construction Adjudication</em> (LexisNexis 2005) at p 134.
                    After noting that there is no requirement in our legislation, unlike the NSW
                    Act, to declare that the claim is made under the Act, the learned author
                    said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is understood that, during consultations leading to the drafting of the
                        [Building Construction Industry Security of Payment] Bill, the Building and
                        Construction Authority accepted the suggestion from the subcontractors and
                        suppliers lobby that such a requirement may conceivably result in creating a
                        contentious atmosphere in the relationships between a main contractor and
                        subcontractors straight away. It is difficult to follow this line of
                        argument. It will be appreciated that, in the normal course of a business,
                        various letters, claims, quotations, negotiation proposals and exchanges
                        will be encountered between the parties. A claimant may submit a proposal
                        for a payment arrangement or furnish a draft progress payment claim as a
                        template for working through the computations and prices with the quantity
                        surveyor on a project. In the absence of a definitive statement of
                        intention, it is conceivable that a payment claim may be mistaken by the
                        respondent for any one of these exchanges.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     I agreed fully with the comment at the second
                    half of that passage that much confusion will arise from this omission in the
                    Act. Given the short timelines under the Act for a respondent to come out with a
                    payment response once a Payment Claim is served, the suggestion by the
                    subcontractors and suppliers lobby does not bear scrutiny. I cannot see how the
                    omission of a requirement to state that the document is a payment claim under
                    the Act furthers the aim of promoting a non-contentious atmosphere when that
                    would force a potential respondent to scrutinise every document submitted to him
                    by a potential claimant to determine whether it falls within the definition of
                    payment claim under s 10 of the Act. Such an exercise would have to be
                    carried out in the manner that the defendant has submitted in paras 15 to
                    16 above for every document that is potentially a Payment Claim, a most
                    impractical situation for a potential respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Intention and communication necessary to be Payment Claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Be that as it may, since it is not a
                    requirement under the Act, the absence of a statement that a document is a
                    Payment Claim does not of itself preclude that document from being one. But the
                    defendant’s contention that any document that satisfies all the
                    requirements under the Act and the Regulations as to how it is made and what it
                    must contain would amount to a Payment Claim is quite another manner. This would
                    mean that a document containing all such information but also containing the
                    statement “This is not a payment claim under the Act” would be a
                    payment claim under the Act, which would be contrary to commonsense. To the
                    argument that in such a situation the claimant is estopped from relying on it as
                    a Payment Claim, there are two responses. The first is that this argument will
                    not address the situation where the respondent, out of an abundance of caution,
                    submits a payment response and therefore has not been prejudiced. The second is
                    a matter of principle: surely intention must be a necessary element and such a
                    document cannot be a Payment Claim even if it contains all the prescribed
                    requirements for one, simply because it was not intended to be one by the maker
                    of the document. In my view, for a document to amount to a payment claim under
                    the Act, the party submitted it must intend it to be such, and I so
                hold.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Further, as the respondent is given a limited
                    period under the Act to make a payment response failing which he would
                    effectively be precluded from any defence he might have to the claim (see
                    para 13 above), subjective intention alone is not sufficient. As a matter
                    of policy, such intention must be communicated to the respondent. Otherwise, the
                    Act could be used as an instrument of oppression against potential respondents,
                    who would then have to scrutinise any document that can possibly amount to a
                    payment claim under the Act and decide if it amounts to one. Any document, no
                    matter how voluminous (as is the case with the 2008 Letter), would have to be
                    carefully studied, page by page, to determine if it contains all the prescribed
                    requirements in the Act for a Payment Claim. And upon determining that it does
                    constitute one, the respondent would then have to check on the claim and produce
                    a payment response. All this would have to be done within as little as seven
                    days. And even if the respondent does not think it amounts to a Payment Claim,
                    so long as he is uncertain about it, he would be well advised to make a payment
                    response given the dire circumstances of being caught out without one. At the
                    end of every such exercise, all would have been in vain if it turns out that the
                    party submitting the documents had not intended it to be a Payment Claim in the
                    first place. I cannot see how Parliament could have intended such a chaotic
                    situation to be the result of an Act enacted to promote cash flow in the
                    construction industry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I would therefore hold that for any document
                    to amount to a Payment Claim, not only must it comply with the prescribed
                    requirements for a Payment Claim, it must be intended to be such by the party
                    submitting it and, importantly, such intention must be communicated to the
                    recipient. Whether or not this communication has taken place in each case would
                    be a question of fact to be determined according to the circumstances of that
                    case. Evidence of such communication may come from covering letters, email
                    exchange referring to the document in question or even oral communication.
                    Evidence could well come from the manner in which the respondent had dealt with
                    the document, <em>eg</em> he gives a payment response. It
                    would not be possible to set out all the circumstances under which a court would
                    hold that such intention has been communicated and each case would have to be
                    determined on the basis of its unique facts. But certainly a statement in the
                    document that it is a payment claim under the Act would be the most effective
                    manner of communicating this intention.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was the 2008 Letter a Payment Claim?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     On the facts of the present case, I did not
                    consider that the 2008 Letter was a Payment Claim even though, arguably, it
                    contained the information prescribed in the Act and Regulations. The reasons are
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     The defendant did not communicate
                        its intention to the plaintiff that it was a payment claim under the
                        Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        plaintiff did not treat it as a Payment Claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_c"></a>(c)     Events prior to the service of the 2008 Letter
                        suggested that this was not a Payment Claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_d"></a>(d)     The contents of the covering letter did not
                        suggest it was Payment Claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_e"></a>(e)     Public policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     On reason (a), there was clearly no
                    communication from the defendant, whether written or oral, that the 2008 Letter
                    was a payment claim under the Act. Firstly, there was no mention in the covering
                    letter of it being a payment claim under the Act. Secondly, Ngo, the
                    defendant’s engineer who handed the 2008 Letter to the plaintiff’s
                    representative on 26 December 2008, deposed that he merely handed the
                    documents over. There was no prior or subsequent communication from the
                    defendant to the plaintiff as to the nature of this document.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     On reason (b), the fact remained that the
                    plaintiff did not provide a payment response at all. If the defendant had
                    considered it to be a Payment Claim, it is inconceivable that the plaintiff
                    would not have provided a payment response because such omission would
                    tantamount to conceding to an adjudication order being made (see para 13
                    above). Therefore even if the plaintiff had received the 2008 Letter on
                    26 December 2008 as the defendant had alleged, the evidence was that
                    the plaintiff did not consider it to be a Payment Claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     With respect to reason (c), it is necessary to
                    go further back in the development of the dispute. As suggested on the face of
                    the 2008 Letter, 26 December 2008 was not the first time that the
                    defendant had submitted a claim to the plaintiff on the four invoices. Indeed
                    all four invoices were issued more than a year earlier; they were submitted by
                    the defendant to the plaintiff between 5 October and
                    1 December 2007. If the defendant’s position on the issue of
                    what constitutes a Payment Claim is correct, then each invoice would have
                    constituted a Payment Claim in respect of the invoiced sum. It would follow that
                    the defendant would have been entitled to make an adjudication application in
                    respect of each of those invoices. That the defendant did not do so was either
                    because the defendant did not consider them to be Payment Claims, or decided not
                    to do so for whatever reason. The evidence of the parties did not go into
                    whether any payment response was given by the plaintiff, although there was
                    certainly no payment response by way of payment of a response amount under
                    s 11(3) of the Act. The fact of the matter is that the defendant had not
                    proceeded to adjudication in respect of the first time it had submitted each of
                    the four invoices to the plaintiff. The defendant’s solicitors had written
                    a letter of demand to the plaintiff claiming payment for the four invoices on
                    19 December 2007. Again, on the defendant’s position, this would
                    be a Payment Claim. And yet no adjudication application was made. The matter
                    dragged on until 30 July 2008 when the writ in Suit No 529 of 2008 was
                    filed. Parties filed pleadings over the next three months and it was after the
                    defendant had filed an amended Statement of Claim on 9 December 2008
                    and just before the plaintiff filed the amended Defence and Counterclaim on
                    29 December 2008 that the defendant delivered the 2008 Letter on
                    26 December 2008. It can be seen that the defendant had submitted
                    requests for payment of the four invoices individually and collectively more
                    than a year prior to the delivery of the 2008 Letter. A suit in the High Court
                    had been commenced and the parties were in the thick of settling the pleadings
                    when the 2008 Letter was delivered. The events leading to the delivery of the
                    2008 Letter do not lead to the conclusion that it was a Payment
                Claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     On reason (d), the 2008 Letter begins with a
                    reference to the Project and attaches the relevant contract documents. After
                    this, it goes on to “assure” the plaintiff that work in respect of
                    the four unpaid invoices had been done and the defendant “claim for
                    payment for such work …”. The 2008 Letter goes on to set out the
                    five earlier invoices and then reiterates that work for the last four invoices
                    had been completed and these were therefore due and payable. Reference is then
                    made to supporting invoices and approval for variation works, and it concludes
                    with the following words:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please therefore let us have your payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Finally, we wish you greetings of the season!</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There is a signature at the bottom of the letter which is
                    unintelligible and the signatory is not identified in the text of the 2008
                    Letter. The only date that appears on it is handwritten after the signature. The
                    overall appearance of the 2008 Letter is that it is of an informal nature.
                    Although it is on the defendant’s letterhead, the proper name of the
                    plaintiff, which is “Sungdo Engineering &amp; Construction (S) Pte
                    Ltd”, is not stated as the addressee. Indeed the only link to the
                    plaintiff is the word “Sungdo” in the first line “Letter
                    from Italcor to Sungdo”. This informality is enhanced by the fact that
                    the person signing it is not identified and the date is handwritten. The 2008
                    Letter concludes with a cheerful greeting for the Christmas and New Year season,
                    the levity of which is enhanced by the exclamation mark. It should be noted that
                    26 December 2008 was a Friday, and presumably employees would have
                    just returned to work from the Christmas public holiday the day before. The
                    weekend was the following day, with another public holiday,
                    1 January 2009, six days after that. Further, this was a season where
                    many employees would be on leave between Christmas and New Year. If there was an
                    intention to give the plaintiff seven days to provide a payment response, it was
                    certainly masked by the text of the 2008 Letter and the timing of its
                    delivery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     This leads to reason (e). If the
                    defendant’s position as to what constitutes a Payment Claim is correct, it
                    had made four prior demands for payment of the four invoices after which it did
                    not proceed to apply for adjudication. It then attempted to claim payment
                    through its solicitors, which was also not followed up with an adjudication
                    application. The defendant even commenced a suit to pursue in the High Court the
                    payment it was unable to persuade the plaintiff to pay by way of its four
                    invoices and its solicitors’ letter of demand. And well into the pleadings
                    stage, between two public holidays – Christmas and New Year – the
                    defendant delivered the 2008 Letter which did not, on its face, state that it is
                    a payment claim under the Act. That letter was written in an informal manner
                    without the sense of urgency that a Payment Claim demands of a respondent. To
                    hold that a document such as the 2008 Letter amounts to a Payment Claim under
                    these circumstances would leave ample scope for potential claimants to ambush
                    respondents by submitting document after document and applying for adjudication
                    the minute the respondent fails to provide a payment response. It cannot be the
                    intention of Parliament for the Act to operate in this manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Jurisdiction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     There is no provision in the Act for any
                    appeal; however the High Court has power of judicial review over statutory
                    tribunals by virtue of s 18(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act
                    (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”) read with para 1 of
                    the First Schedule relating to prerogative orders. Before me, the parties did
                    not dispute that the court had such power. Indeed this position is envisaged in
                    s 27(5) of the Act which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where any party to an adjudication commences proceedings to set aside the
                        adjudication determination or the judgment obtained pursuant to this
                        section, he shall pay into the court as security the unpaid portion of the
                        adjudicated amount that he is required to pay, in such manner as the court
                        directs or as provided in the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5),
                        pending the final determination of those proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Brodyn Pty Ltd t/as Time Cost and Quality v
                        Davenport &amp; Anor</em> [2004] NSWCA 394, the New South
                    Wales Court of Appeal considered this issue in relation to the NSW Act which was
                    one of the models for the Act. Section 25(4) of the NSW Act is similar to
                    s 27(5) of the Act, and the former provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the respondent commences proceedings to have the judgment
                        set aside, the respondent:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    is not, in
                                those proceedings entitled:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">(i)    to bring any cross-claim against the
                                claimant, or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">(ii)   to raise any defence in relation to matters
                                arising under the construction contract, or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">(iii)   to challenge the adjudicator’s
                                determination, and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    is required to pay into the court as security
                                the unpaid portion of the adjudicated amount pending the final
                                determination of those proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">After stating that NSW Act appeared strongly against
                    the availability of judicial review on the basis of non-jurisdictional
                    error of law, the judgment went on to state as follows at [52]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, it is plain in my opinion that for a document purporting to [be]
                        an adjudicator's determination to have the strong legal effect provided by
                        the Act, it must satisfy whatever are the conditions laid down by the Act as
                        essential for there to be such a determination. If it does not, the
                        purported determination will not in truth be an adjudicator's determination
                        within the meaning of the Act: it will be void and not merely voidable. A
                        court of competent jurisdiction could in those circumstances grant relief by
                        way of declaration or injunction, without the need to quash the
                        determination by means of an order the nature of certiorari.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     This court therefore has power to quash an
                    Adjudication Order or declare it null and void on grounds of an error of law
                    going to the jurisdiction of the statutory tribunal. In view of my finding that
                    the 2008 Letter did not amount to a payment claim under Act, there was no
                    Payment Claim served by the defendant. Accordingly the Adjudication Application
                    and the Adjudication Order of 12 February 2009 were void as they were
                    made on the basis of the 2008 Letter being a payment claim under the
                Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Subsequent to my decision on this originating
                    summons on 9 October 2009, there have been three written decisions of
                    the High Court relating to adjudications under the Act, namely <em>Chip Hup Hup Kee Construction Pte Ltd v Ssangyong Engineering &amp;
                        Construction Co Ltd</em> [2010] 1 SLR 658 (“<em>Chip Hup Hup Kee</em>”), <em>SEF
                        Construction Pte Ltd v Skoy Connected Pte Ltd</em> [2010]
                    1 SLR 733 (“<em>SEF
                    Construction</em>”) and <em>AM Associates
                        (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Laguna National Golf and Country Club Ltd</em>
                    [2009] SGHC 260 (“<em>AM
                    Associates</em>”). I turn to consider them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In <em>Chip Hup Hup
                        Kee</em>, the court held that the jurisdiction of an adjudicator stems
                    from his appointment by an ANB and not from a properly completed and served
                    Payment Claim. The court there stated at [56]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… under our legislation, the jurisdiction of an adjudicator stems
                        from his appointment. It does not stem from a properly completed and served
                        payment claim. The powers and functions of the adjudicator come from
                        s 16 of [the Act] and not from any action on the part of the claimant.
                        The respondent’s argument in respect of the Adjudicator’s
                        jurisdiction was analogous to an argument that the High Court’s
                        jurisdiction to hear any particular dispute depends on whether the writ of
                        summons or other originating process is in proper form when in fact the
                        court’s jurisdiction comes from the provisions of the SCJA or other
                        relevant legislation, depending on the nature of the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">While I agree that the jurisdiction of the adjudicator is not vested
                    until his appointment by an ANB, I am, with respect, unable to agree that
                    jurisdiction is not affected by an invalid Payment Claim or service thereof. The
                    power of the ANB to appoint an adjudicator arises from the receipt of an
                    adjudication application from a claimant, and that is predicated by a whole
                    chain of events initiated by the service of a Payment Claim by the claimant on
                    the respondent under s 10 of the Act. It must follow that if the claimant
                    had failed to serve a Payment Claim, or to serve something that constitutes a
                    Payment Claim, the power to appoint an adjudicator for that particular claim has
                    not arisen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Indeed, this was the position in the next
                    case: <em>SEF Construction</em>. There the court held that,
                    given that the legislative intention of the Act was to establish a speedy and
                    economical procedure and the fact that there is provision for Adjudication
                    Orders to be reviewed by a panel of review adjudicators, the court would
                    not review the merits of an Adjudication Order. Instead (at [42]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the court’s role must be limited to supervising the
                        appointment and conduct of the adjudicator to ensure that the statutory
                        provisions governing such appointment and conduct are adhered to and that
                        the process of the adjudication, rather than the substance, is proper. After
                        all, in any case, even if the adjudicator does make an error of fact or law
                        in arriving at his adjudication determination, such error can be rectified
                        or compensated for in subsequent arbitration or court proceedings initiated
                        in accordance with the contract between the claimant and the respondent and
                        intended to resolve all contractual disputes that have arisen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The court then considered and endorsed the decision in <em>Brodyn</em> and held that an application to the court under
                    s 27(5) of the Act must be limited to the determination of the following
                    (at [45]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a>(a)     The existence of a contract between
                        the claimant and the respondent, to which the Act applies
                    (s 4).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        service by the claimant on the respondent of a Payment Claim
                        (s 10).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_c"></a>(c)     The making of an adjudication application by the claimant to an ANB
                        (s 13).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_d"></a>(d)     The reference of the application to an eligible adjudicator who agrees to
                        determine the adjudication application (s 14).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_e"></a>(e)     The determination by the adjudicator
                        of the application within the specified period by determining the
                        adjudicated amount (if any) to be paid by the respondent to the claimant;
                        the date on which the adjudicated amount is payable; the interest payable on
                        the adjudicated amount and the proportion of the costs payable by each party
                        to the adjudication (ss 17(1) and (2)).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_f"></a>(f)     Whether the adjudicator acted independently and
                        impartially and in a timely manner and complied with the principles of
                        natural justice in accordance with s 16(3).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_g"></a>(g)     In the case where a review
                        adjudicator or panel of adjudicators has been appointed, whether the same
                        conditions existed, <em>mutandis mutandi</em>, as under
                        (a) to (f) above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The holding relevant to the present case is
                    sub-para (b) in para 33 above, which is that the court may examine the
                    validity of the service of a Payment Claim. However the court elaborated at [46]
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… although [the Act] requires a payment claim to be served, whether
                        or not the <em>document purporting to be a payment
                            claim</em> which has been served by a claimant is actually a
                        payment claim is an issue for the adjudicator and not the court. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In principle, if the validity of a Payment Claim goes to jurisdiction,
                    I do not see how a court is precluded from examining this issue on
                    judicial review and I would, with respect, disagree with this.
                    Notwithstanding this, the 2008 Letter did not purport to be a payment claim
                    under the Act as nothing therein states that it is so. Therefore <em>SEF Construction</em> does not stand in the way of my
                    decision in the present case. However I should state that in practice, where a
                    document purports to be a Payment Claim, then unless the adjudicator has made an
                    unreasonable finding on the evidence (unreasonableness as in <em>Associated Provincial Picture Houses v Wednesday Corporation</em>
                    [1948] 1 KB 223), his decision that it satisfies all the requirements
                    of a Payment Claim may not be interfered with by the court when exercising its
                    powers of judicial review. This appears to be the offset of the following
                    passage in <em>Brodyn</em> (at [66]), which was cited in
                        <em>SEF Construction</em> at [46]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… If there is a document served by a claimant on a respondent that
                        purports to be a payment claim under the Act, question as to whether the
                        document complies in all respects with the requirements of the Act <em>are generally, in my opinion, for the adjudicator to
                            decide</em>. Many of these questions can involve doubtful
                        questions of [f]act and law; and as I have indicated earlier, in my opinion
                        the legislature has manifested an intention that the existence of a
                        determination should not turn on answers to questions of this kind. However,
                        I do not need to express a final view on this. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In <em>AM
                    Associates</em>, the court followed <em>SEF
                        Construction</em> on the issue of whether it could review the
                    adjudicator’s finding that the Payment Claim was valid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In view of my finding that the 2008 Letter
                    does not amount to a payment claim under the Act, it would follow that the
                    appointment of the adjudicator and the determination that he made was null and
                    void. This court, in exercise of its powers of judicial review over a
                    tribunal established under the Act, has powers to make a determination on its
                    jurisdiction and, having found that the Adjudication Order was null and void as
                    the defendant had not served a valid payment claim under the Act, set it
                    aside.</p>
