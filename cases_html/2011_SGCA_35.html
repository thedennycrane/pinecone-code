        Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal arises from the decision of the High
                    Court judge (“the Judge”) in <em>Ng Joo Soon (alias
                        Nga Ju Soon) v Dovechem Holdings Pte Ltd and another suit</em> [2011]
                    1 SLR 1155 (“the Judgment”), where he gave judgment for Ng
                    Joo Soon alias Nga Ju Soon (“NJS”), the plaintiff in Suit
                    No 59 of 2009 (“S 59/2009”) consolidated with Suit
                    No 140 of 2009 (“S 140/2009”), against Dovechem Holdings
                    Pte Ltd (“DHPL”), the sole defendant in S 59/2009 and the
                    first defendant in S 140/2009. <em>Vis-à-vis</em>
                    S 59/2009, the Judge’s decision (“the Directorship
                    Decision”) was that the purported removal of NJS as a director of DHPL
                    was invalid and void, and that (<em>inter alia</em>):
                    (a) DHPL was to rectify its records with the Accounting and Corporate
                    Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) within five days of the
                    court’s order to reflect that NJS remained a director of DHPL; and
                    (b) NJS was to be allowed to inspect the accounting and other records of
                    DHPL. <em>Vis-à-vis</em> S 140/2009, the Judge’s
                    decision (“the Payment Decision”) was that DHPL was liable to NJS
                    for breaching various agreements to pay him certain monthly sums (“the
                    Payment Agreements”), but NJS was not entitled to the further reliefs
                    sought against the second to the fifth defendants in that suit (namely, Andrew
                    Ng Iet Pew (“Andrew”), Anta Ng (“Anta”), Ng Ju Aik
                    alias Ng Ju Goh (“Ju Aik”) and Ng Ju Lak alias Ng Joo Tian
                    (“Joo Tian”), who will hereafter be referred to collectively as
                    “the Other Directors”) for inducing DHPL to breach its contractual
                    obligations to NJS and for conspiring with each other to cause DHPL to commit
                    such breach. (The Other Directors are all family members of NJS. They are, along
                    with NJS, the sole directors and shareholders of DHPL.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Dissatisfied with the Judge’s decision in
                    these two consolidated suits, DHPL and the Other Directors (collectively,
                    “the Appellants”) filed the present appeal. At the hearing of the
                    appeal, the Appellants’ counsel informed the court that the Appellants
                    were no longer pursuing the Payment Decision. Accordingly, this judgment will
                    deal with only the Directorship Decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Despite coming from a humble background and
                    receiving little formal education, NJS founded a business which eventually grew
                    to become a successful conglomerate (“the Group”). Over the years,
                    he invited several members of his family (“the Ng Family”),
                    including the Other Directors, to join him in the business. DHPL is the holding
                    company of the Group’s Singapore subsidiaries and associated companies in
                    Indonesia and China. (The Group also has a number of associated companies in
                    Malaysia (see <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>–<a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> below).) Until 2002, NJS was the managing
                    director and chairman of DHPL, holding 52% of the shares in the company. He was
                    the leader and public face of DHPL, with the Other Directors each holding less
                    than 17% of the shares in the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       When the Asian financial crisis struck in 1997,
                    DHPL encountered financial difficulties. NJS advanced a total of S$6.1m (using
                    credit facilities which he obtained from his banks) to DHPL to rescue it. That
                    amount (“the S$6.1m advance”) was the largest contribution from
                    among all the directors of DHPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       As at 14 January 2002, out of the S$6.1m
                    advance, a sum of S$5,050,001.55 (“the Outstanding Loan”) remained
                    due to NJS. In order to repay the Outstanding Loan, DHPL entered into the
                    Payment Agreements with NJS, under which various monthly sums were to be paid to
                    the latter, including:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     a monthly sum of S$25,000
                        (“the Monthly Interest Reimbursement”), representing the
                        interest incurred by NJS on the credit facilities which he took out in order
                        to extend the S$6.1m advance to DHPL;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     a monthly allowance of US$20,000 or S$35,000 (“the
                        Monthly Life Allowance”), which was based on the agreed exchange rate
                        of US$1 to S$1.75;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a>(c)     beginning in December 2007, a monthly instalment of S$13,750 for 24
                        months (“the Deduction Repayment Instalment”), representing
                        the balance of a sum of S$429,998.45 (“the Mistaken
                        Deduction”) which DHPL had wrongfully deducted and omitted in
                        calculating the quantum of the Outstanding Loan; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_d"></a>(d)     also beginning in December 2007, a
                        monthly instalment of S$140,278 for 36 months (“the Loan Repayment
                        Instalment”) in respect of repayment of the Outstanding
                    Loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Monthly Interest Reimbursement and the Loan
                    Repayment Instalment were to be paid by DHPL until the Outstanding Loan had been
                    fully repaid to NJS, while the Deduction Repayment Instalment was to be paid
                    until the Mistaken Deduction had been fully accounted for. As for the Monthly
                    Life Allowance, it was to be paid to NJS for the rest of his life.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis,
                    DHPL was pressured by its banks to enter into schemes of arrangement which would
                    require a personal guarantee from each of the Other Directors. As the Other
                    Directors were not prepared to provide personal guarantees on the basis of their
                    then shareholdings in DHPL, NJS was obliged and agreed to dilute his
                    shareholding in the company and effect generational management succession. The
                    following changes (among others) were reflected in a restructuring agreement
                    dated 8 July 2002 between NJS and the Other Directors (“the 2002
                    Restructuring Agreement”):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     NJS would give up his 52% majority
                        shareholding in DHPL for a diluted stake of 24%, with Andrew having a 25%
                        shareholding and Ju Aik, Joo Tian and Anta each having a 17%
                        shareholding.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     Andrew was to manage DHPL and the Group, while NJS was to become the
                        non-executive chairman of DHPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In December 2002, schemes of arrangement
                    acceptable to the Group’s creditors were approved by the court. NJS was
                    appointed as the non-executive chairman of DHPL on 6 January 2003, and
                    Andrew was appointed as its managing director and chief executive officer on
                    3 February 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 11 March 2003, at a meeting between NJS
                    and the Other Directors to discuss the affairs of the Group, Andrew suggested
                    drawing up a remuneration and benefits scheme to regulate the pay and other
                    benefits given to members of the Ng Family who worked in the Group. This was
                    recorded on pp 7–8 of the minutes of that meeting (“the
                    11 March 2003 meeting”) as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     NJS turned 70 on 4 March 2008. However,
                    as before, he attended a meeting of the board of directors (the
                    “Board”) of the Group on 7 April 2008, and the notes of that
                    meeting did not disclose any questions having been raised by any Board member as
                    to his entitlement to attend the meeting or his retirement from either the Board
                    of DHPL or that of any other company in the Group. However, the meeting notes
                    disclosed that there was a heated discussion over NJS’s request for a
                    13th month payment, which led to NJS walking out of the
                        meeting.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The tension and acrimony between NJS and the
                    Other Directors escalated to such an extent that on 11 June 2008, NJS sent
                    a letter to Thiam Joo (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd (“TJ Malaysia”), one
                    of the Group’s associated companies in Malaysia, stating that he wished to
                    exercise his right as a director of the company to appoint a public accountant
                    to inspect the accounting and other records of TJ Malaysia. He explained
                    that he had discovered in May 2008 that TJ Malaysia’s funds had been
                    misused. He said that Andrew had purported to purchase shares in another company
                    using those funds, while disguising the payment as being made to a supplier. On
                    the same day (<em>ie</em>, 11 June 2008), NJS also
                    sent a letter to DHPL stating his intention to similarly exercise his right to
                    appoint a public accountant to inspect DHPL’s records. Further, NJS filed
                    police reports against Andrew in Malaysia, and against Andrew and Anta in
                    Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 19 June 2008, NJS received a letter
                    from Dovechem Holdings (M) Sdn Bhd (“Dovechem Malaysia”), the
                    holding company of the Group’s associated companies in Malaysia, signed by
                    the Other Directors, notifying him of his removal as a director of
                    TJ Malaysia and another of the Group’s associated Malaysian
                    companies, Dovechem Terminals Sdn Bhd (“Dovechem Terminals”), with
                    immediate effect. The letter also stated that since NJS had been removed as a
                    director of TJ Malaysia, TJ Malaysia would not be responding to his
                    letter of 11 June 2008 requesting for inspection of its
                records.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 20 June 2008, NJS received a further
                    letter from Dovechem Malaysia informing him that he had been removed as a
                    director of yet another of the Group’s associated Malaysian companies,
                    Imperial Steel Drum Manufacturers Sdn Bhd (“Imperial Steel”), with
                    immediate effect. Apparently in retort, NJS wrote to the aforesaid Malaysian
                    companies’ bankers demanding his release from the personal guarantees
                    which he had given in respect of the companies, an act which allegedly caused
                    several bankers to reduce their credit lines to the companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 24 June 2008, NJS instituted
                    Originating Summons No 841 of 2008 (“OS 841/2008”)
                    seeking an order that he be allowed to inspect DHPL’s accounting and other
                    records. OS 841/2008 was converted to a writ action (<em>ie</em>, S 59/2009) by a court order made on 20 January
                    2009. Subsequently, NJS commenced S 140/2009 on 16 February 2009,
                    claiming that DHPL had breached the Payment Agreements, and that the Other
                    Directors had induced and/or had conspired with each other to induce DHPL to
                    commit such breach. S 59/2009 and S 140/2009 were consolidated by a
                    court order made on 3 June 2009, and were heard by the Judge, who granted
                    to NJS substantially the reliefs which he had prayed for (see <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In the meantime, no action was taken by DHPL
                    to exclude NJS from its Board until 14 July 2008, when the other members of
                    its Board excluding NJS (<em>ie</em>, the Other Directors)
                    passed a Board resolution in writing to the following effect:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Also on 4 August 2008, NJS’s
                    lawyers wrote to the Appellants’ lawyers on a “without
                    prejudice” basis proposing, pursuant to cl 4.1 of the 2002
                    Restructuring Agreement, the appointment of a new director in NJS’s place
                    on the Boards of various companies in the Group, including DHPL. Under this
                    proposal, NJS would immediately resign from his directorships in the companies
                    concerned and would deliver a letter to appoint a director of his choice for
                    each of the companies. Thereafter, the other shareholders of each of the
                    companies would in turn appoint directors of their choice to the
                    companies’ Boards. The letter from NJS’s lawyers included a request
                    for confirmation that the new director appointed by NJS to DHPL’s Board
                    could exercise his right to inspect the financial records of DHPL. This proposal
                    by NJS was rejected by the Other Directors on the grounds that NJS’s
                    intention was to inspect the records of DHPL through the new director nominated
                    by him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     As for ACRA’s queries, the
                    Appellants’ lawyers responded to ACRA on 26 August 2008 as

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In reply to paragraph 3(a) of your said letter, please be informed
                        that Ng Joo Soon @ Nga Ju Soon (“Joo Soon”) was not removed as

                        well as all the other directors of [DHPL], Joo Soon automatically retired as
                        a director of [DHPL] with effect from 5/3/2008 after attaining the age of 70
                        on 4/3/2008. Enclosed herewith is a photocopy each of the [Remuneration

                        retirement of Joo Soon as a director of [DHPL].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In reply to paragraph 3(b) of your said letter, we reiterate

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     With respect to S 59/2009, the
                    Judge’s decision (<em>ie</em>, the Directorship
                    Decision mentioned at <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above) was that NJS
                    remained a director of DHPL even after he turned 70, and was thus entitled to
                    inspect DHPL’s records pursuant to s 199 of the Companies Act
                    (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Act”). Further, ACRA’s
                    records should be rectified to reflect NJS’s status as a director of DHPL.
                    The Judge made the Directorship Decision on the following bases:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     NJS had neither resigned from his
                        office of director by notice in writing, nor had he been removed from office
                        by a shareholders’ resolution, which was the proper mechanism for the
                        removal of directors as set out in DHPL’s memorandum and articles of
                        association (“DHPL’s Articles”). There were also no
                        Board or shareholders’ resolutions or minutes of Board or
                        shareholders’ meetings which showed that DHPL’s Articles had
                        been amended to provide for directors to automatically retire upon reaching
                        the age of 70.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     None of the landmark contracts between the parties (<em>ie</em>, the 2002 Restructuring Agreement and the Payment
                        Agreements) provided that NJS was obliged to retire as a director upon
                        reaching the age of 70.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>(c)     The express language of the Remuneration Plan meant that
                        NJS was to remain as a Ruling Member and a member of both DHPL’s Board
                        as well as the Group’s Board until he reached the age of 70, following
                        which he would automatically be converted to a Founding Member and take on a
                        non-executive role. There was no retirement age for Founding
                    Members.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_d"></a>(d)     Although
                        NJS had reached the age of 70 on 4 March 2008, no action was taken by
                        DHPL to notify ACRA of the purported cessation of his directorship until
                        15 July 2008, and that was only after NJS had written to DHPL to
                        request for inspection of its records under s 199 of the
                    Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_e"></a>(e)     Even after
                        turning 70, NJS continued to attend Board meetings of both DHPL and the
                        Group as before, and none of the Other Directors raised any questions as to
                        his continued attendance at or the capacity in which he attended those
                        meetings.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_f"></a>(f)     Nothing in the express contents of the Remuneration Plan, as authenticated
                        and assented to by all the parties, provided that NJS was to retire as a
                        non-executive director of DHPL upon reaching the age of 70. Accordingly, NJS
                        remained a director of DHPL, and as a director, he had a statutory right to
                        inspect DHPL’s records under s 199 of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_g"></a>(g)     There was no evidence that NJS’s
                        request for inspection of DHPL’s records was detrimental to
                        DHPL’s interests or was made <em>mala
                        fide</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The arguments on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Appellants’ arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The Appellants’ submission before this
                    court is that an objective and straightforward reading of the Remuneration Plan
                    shows that directors of companies in the Group are to retire as directors upon
                    attaining the age of 70.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     According to the Appellants, the fact that the
                    Remuneration Plan states that Ruling Members may become Founding Members does
                    not undermine the aforesaid contention because a Founding Member is not a
                    director. Instead, a Founding Member is a special type of member who assumes a
                    non-executive role, <em>ie</em>, he is a member who is not
                    active in any of the companies in the Group, whether as a director or as a
                    Working Member. The Appellants submit that since NJS has attained the age of 70,
                    he has, under the Remuneration Plan, become a Founding Member, and as a Founding
                    Member, he can no longer be a director.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Appellants further contend that NJS is
                    bound by the Remuneration Plan because he voluntarily and expressly consented to
                    its terms, and there is no proof of misrepresentation or fraud. Accordingly,
                    there ought to be little difficulty in applying the principle laid down in
                        <em>In re Duomatic Ltd</em> [1969] 2 Ch 365
                    (“the <em>Duomatic</em> principle”),
                        <em>viz</em>, the principle that “where it can
                    be shown that all shareholders who have a right to attend and vote at a general
                    meeting of the company assent to some matter which a general meeting of the
                    company could carry into effect, that assent is as binding as a resolution in
                    general meeting would be” (at 373). Applying the <em>Duomatic</em> principle, the Appellants submit that the unanimous
                    assent of the signatories to the Remuneration Plan (<em>ie</em>, NJS and the Other Directors, who, as mentioned at <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above, are the sole directors and shareholders
                    of DHPL) would essentially be equivalent to the unanimous assent of all the
                    shareholders of DHPL, and such assent would be as binding as a resolution passed
                    at a general meeting of DHPL’s shareholders.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">NJS’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In contrast, NJS’s position in this
                    appeal (just as in the court below) is that he remains a director of DHPL as his
                    purported removal was not in accordance with DHPL’s
                Articles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     With respect to the Remuneration Plan, NJS
                    argues that its express words do not provide that he was to retire as a director
                    upon turning 70. Moreover, the context and the factual matrix surrounding the
                    Remuneration Plan support the Judge’s interpretation that he (NJS) did not
                    agree to automatically retire as a director upon turning 70. Accordingly, the
                    Judge did not err in finding that the <em>Duomatic</em>
                    principle did not apply to the facts of the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     NJS submits that even if the Remuneration Plan
                    did provide that he was to retire as a director at the age of 70, he is not
                    bound by that provision by virtue of the doctrine of <em>non est
                        factum</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     There are two issues before this court,
                    namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether NJS remains a director of
                        DHPL; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether NJS is entitled to inspect DHPL’s records.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We will deal with these issues in turn in the discussion which
                follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether NJS remains a director of DHPL</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Remuneration Plan</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The central document upon which the issue of
                    whether NJS remains a director of DHPL turns is the Remuneration Plan. It is
                    thus pivotal to have a proper appreciation of that document and, in turn,
                    determine its proper construction. The Appellants’ position is that the
                    Judge erred in fact and in law in his interpretation of that document. They
                    contend that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Remuneration Plan provides for
                        the automatic retirement of all directors of companies in the Group at the
                        age of 70;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        terms of the Remuneration Plan are binding on NJS; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_c"></a>(c)     the said terms are automatically
                        enforceable even in the absence of any further “activation”
                        steps.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Judge’s interpretation of the Remuneration Plan</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In the Judgment, the Judge set out the way in
                    which he construed the Remuneration Plan as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">57    The … Remuneration Plan reveals several
                            critical features. …
                            <em>Critically, the Remuneration Plan expressly states
                                that for Founding Members, the Retirement age is “Not
                                Applicable” (see p 2). What this means</em>, ex
                                facie<em>, is that NJS was to remain a Ruling Member
                                and member of [DHPL’s] Board and [the] Group until he reached
                                the age of 70, following which, in accordance with p 1
                                …, he would be automatically converted to a Founding Member
                                and would take on a non-executive role for which there was no
                                retirement age. NJS would have automatically qualified by virtue of
                                his having joined the Group for 30 years or before 1980</em>.
                            Whilst NJS is not here classified as a Founding Member but rather as a
                            Ruling Member, the retirement age of Ruling Members is set out as 70[,]
                            whereupon he is automatically converted to a Founding Member and retains
                            his personal life entitlements. All other Ruling Members are to retire
                            at 70 and do not become Founding Members unless they qualify as having
                            worked with the Group for 30 years or before 1980.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">58    Notwithstanding the express language of the
                            Remuneration Plan to the contrary, [Joo] Tian explained his view that
                            “Non-Executive” in the Remuneration Plan means that they
                                [<em>ie</em>, Founding Members] are no longer
                            involved in any capacity (be it as director, employee or otherwise). He
                            is of this view because he notes that none of the members described as
                            Founding Members in the Remuneration Plan were currently directors of
                            [DHPL]. <em>In essence he is of the view that
                                “Non-Executive” means no position, whether executive
                                or non-executive corporate position. However, his view is at
                                variance with what the Remuneration Plan sets out expressly.
                                “Non-Executive” as used in the Remuneration Plan has
                                no meaning save in relation to employment and remuneration arising
                                out of executive or non-executive corporate
                            positions</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The Appellants claim that the Judge’s
                    approach was wrong as it is clear from what is stated on p 2 of the
                    Remuneration Plan that Ruling Members –
                    <em>ie</em>, directors – are to retire as directors
                    at the age of 70 without exception and there is no provision for extending a
                    director’s service. In essence, the point which the Appellants seek to
                    make is that upon NJS attaining the age of 70 and being converted from a Ruling
                    Member to a Founding Member, he ceased to be a director of DHPL. The rationale
                    of the Appellants’ argument is that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Founding Members are merely a special category given to the
                        relatives of the Ng Family who never really took part in the management of
                        [DHPL], and who require some honorary role as a sign of respect for elders
                        and a form of ‘pension’ for life under the [r]emuneration
                        [s]cheme envisaged by the [Remuneration] Plan. The [Remuneration] Plan
                        however required all directors to retire on attaining 70 years of
                        age.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In this regard, the Appellants reiterate the point that all parties to
                    the Remuneration Plan had agreed that, moving forward, DHPL should be led by the
                    younger generations of the Ng Family. It would, the Appellants submit, be
                    inconsistent with that objective to have an arrangement whereby directors can
                    continue in office in perpetuity until they decide to quit on their own volition
                    as this will preclude the younger generations of the Ng Family from filling up
                    vacancies in DHPL’s Board.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Principles governing documentary construction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     It is a settled principle of documentary
                    construction that in construing a document, it is permissible for the court to
                    take into account the surrounding circumstances and the factual matrix which
                    constitute the background in which the document was prepared and executed (see
                    this court’s decision in <em>Zurich Insurance (Singapore)
                        Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 at [131]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In <em>Straits Advisors Pte Ltd
                        v Behringer Holdings (Pte) Ltd and another and another
                        application</em> [2010] 1 SLR 760, this court emphasised the
                    importance of construing contractual terms in the light of the context in which
                    those terms were drafted (at [8]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [W]e must first emphasise that contractual terms must be
                        construed in the light of the <em>context</em> in which
                        they were drafted (see generally the decision of this court in <em>Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design
                            &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029). Narrow
                        and technical constructions which are inconsistent with the whole scheme of
                        a given contract and the circumstances in which it was concluded must be
                        eschewed. We would also add that a contextual understanding is especially
                        important in the instant case, where the relevant agreements can, with
                        respect, hardly be said to be models of precise – let alone exemplary
                        – draftsmanship. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is clear from the aforesaid authorities that in this case, the
                    court is entitled, in construing the Remuneration Plan, to examine the
                    background leading to it, including the rationale for the 2002 Restructuring
                    Agreement. This, the Judge did in the proceedings below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Our interpretation of the Remuneration Plan</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     As we see it, there are a number of
                    difficulties with the interpretation which the Appellants seek to place on the
                    Remuneration Plan. First, it is plain that nowhere in the Remuneration Plan is
                    it expressly provided that NJS was to retire as a director of DHPL upon reaching
                    the age of 70. The Remuneration Plan also does not contain a provision stating
                    that all directors of DHPL (as well as all directors of the other companies in
                    the Group) are to retire as directors upon turning 70. The table on p 2 of
                    the Remuneration Plan appears to indicate that a Ruling Member (and at p 4,
                    NJS is listed as a Ruling Member since the Remuneration Plan was drawn up when
                    he was still under the age of 70) is to retire as a Ruling Member upon reaching
                    the age of 70. Such a Ruling Member can then become a Founding Member if he
                    either: (a) has worked in the Group for at least 30 years; or
                    (b) started to work in the Group before 1980. Significantly, as the Judge
                    pointed out at [57] of the Judgment
                    (reproduced at <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> above), no retirement
                    age is prescribed for a Founding Member.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Our second difficulty with the
                    Appellants’ interpretation of the Remuneration Plan lies with the word
                        “[n]on-[e]xecutive”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> in the table on
                    p 2 of the plan. This was touched on by the Judge at [58] of the Judgment
                    (likewise reproduced at <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> above). One of
                    the common business meanings of the word “executive”, as used in
                    respect of an officer of a company, is an officer who has an active day-to-day
                    role in the management of the company. The term “non-executive”
                    would, accordingly, mean an officer who has a relatively “back
                    seat” role (so to speak) in the management of the company. From this
                    perspective, being a director of a company is not tantamount to holding an
                    executive position – in other words, a person may be a director of a
                    company even if his position in the company is said to be a
                    “non-executive” one. Thus, when NJS became a Founding Member upon
                    turning 70, the fact that his position in DHPL became
                    “non-executive” in nature does not entail that he therefore
                    automatically ceased to be a director of the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Third, given the exceptional and unique role
                    of NJS in DHPL and the Group as a whole, the Appellants’ contention that
                    pursuant to the Remuneration Plan, NJS was automatically retired as a director
                    upon turning 70 is, in our view, not at all credible. NJS was undoubtedly the
                    real founder of both DHPL and the Group. Although he is not among the Founding
                    Members listed on p 4 of the Remuneration Plan, that is because (as we
                    pointed out at <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a> above) the Remuneration
                    Plan was drawn up at a time when NJS had yet to reach the age of 70 (the minimum
                    age prescribed for Founding Members). There is no question that NJS’s
                    contributions to DHPL and the Group far surpass those of the three persons
                    listed on p 4 of the Remuneration Plan as Founding Members (namely, Ng Ju
                    Chin, Wong Wei Wai and Ng Yik Lai): the latter are, in the Appellants’
                    words, merely “elders”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> who
                    “never really took part in the management of [DHPL]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>
                    The special position of NJS in DHPL and the Group is also evidenced by the
                    remuneration provisions on p 3 of the Remuneration Plan. Under those
                    provisions, Ruling Members are entitled to a monthly salary of S$11,000 and a
                    monthly allowance of S$1,000, whilst Founding Members are entitled to a lifetime
                    monthly payment of S$2,000. Those provisions are, however, expressly stated to
                    be “[n]ot applicable”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> to NJS, who is to
                    receive a monthly payment of S$35,000 for life instead. In view of the special
                    status accorded to NJS by the express terms of the Remuneration Plan, it flies
                    in the face of reason to construe that document as requiring NJS to
                    automatically retire as a director of DHPL and all the other companies in the
                    Group upon reaching the age of 70.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The fourth flaw in the Appellants’
                    interpretation of the Remuneration Plan relates to a basic principle on the
                    contruction of documents, namely: since the Remuneration Plan was drawn up by
                    the Appellants (specifically by Anta, so it appears (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>–<a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above)), any
                    reasonable doubt as to its scope or meaning should, applying the <em>contra proferentem</em> rule, be resolved in favour of the
                    other party, <em>ie</em>, in favour of NJS (see <em>Chitty on Contracts</em> (H G Beale gen ed) (Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell, 30th Ed, 2008) (“<em>Chitty</em>”) at vol 1, paras 12-083–12-085). In
                    this regard, there can be no doubt that the Remuneration Plan lacks clarity in
                    so far as the retirement of directors (<em>ie</em>, whether
                    they are indeed obliged to retire as directors at the age of 70 as the
                    Appellants contend) is concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Fifth, the Remuneration Plan is, to say the
                    least, informal and cryptic. Yet, if the Appellants’ contention is
                    correct, this document has a serious impact as it requires all directors of DHPL
                    (and, indeed, all directors of the other companies in the Group) –
                    including its very founder, NJS – to retire as directors on attaining the
                    age of 70. There is, however, no requirement in DHPL’s Articles that a
                    director must retire at the age of 70. Instead, Art 71 of DHPL’s
                    Articles provides (<em>vis-à-vis</em> the removal of
                    directors) that “[DHPL] may by ordinary resolution remove any director
                    before the expiration of his period of office and may by … ordinary
                    resolution appoint another person in his stead”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> If
                    NJS and the Other Directors intended to amend this Article by signing the
                    Remuneration Plan at the 27 May 2003 meeting (and for the purposes of this
                    paragraph as well as <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> below, we will
                    assume that the Remuneration Plan does indeed require all directors of DHPL and
                    the other companies in the Group to retire as directors upon turning 70), that
                    proposed amendment was clearly ineffectual in law. This is because s 37(1)
                    of the Act states that “[s]ubject to [the] Act … and to any
                    conditions in its memorandum, a company may by <em>special
                        resolution</em> alter or add to its articles” [emphasis added].
                    There is nothing in DHPL’s memorandum of association which dispenses with
                    the need for a special resolution where amendment of DHPL’s Articles is
                    concerned. Thus, since no special resolution to amend Art 71 of
                    DHPL’s Articles was passed either at the 27 May 2003 meeting or at
                    any time thereafter, the Remuneration Plan cannot be read as overriding that
                    Article so as to require NJS to retire as a director upon turning 70. We should
                    add that the absence of a special resolution amending Art 71 of
                    DHPL’s Articles <em>cannot</em> be
                    “cured” (so to speak) by applying the <em>Duomatic</em> principle –
                    <em>ie</em>, it <em>cannot</em> be
                    said that although no special resolution was passed to amend Art 71 of
                    DHPL’s Articles, based on the <em>Duomatic</em>
                    principle, that Article was nonetheless amended at the 27 May 2003 meeting
                    when NJS and the Other Directors, who are the sole shareholders of DHPL,
                    unanimously assented to the Remuneration Plan. It bears emphasis that the facts
                    in the present case are far removed from those in <em>In re
                        Duomatic Ltd</em>, where the irregularity to which the <em>Duomatic</em> principle was applied was relatively minor (the
                    irregularity there concerned the payment of salaries to the directors of a
                    company, who were also its sole shareholders, without the prior passing of the
                    requisite resolution by the company in general meeting). What the Appellants are
                    attempting to do in the present case is to rely on the <em>Duomatic</em> principle to enforce an alleged agreement relating to
                    directors’ retirement which is contrary to the express provisions of
                    DHPL’s Articles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In the light of the provisions of the Act and
                    DHPL’s Articles, it is, to our minds, an utter exaggeration to say that
                    when NJS and the Other Directors signed the Remuneration Plan on 27 May
                    2003 (assuming the plan does indeed require all directors of companies in the
                    Group to retire as directors upon turning 70, as the Appellants contend), they
                    intended it to constitute a definitive agreement between them which was to be
                    given effect forthwith without further ado. The fact that the Remuneration Plan
                    was expressed to have retrospective effect from 1 May 2003 onwards does not
                    necessarily entail that no further steps were required to implement it,
                    especially given that it has the serious impact (based on the Appellants’
                    interpretation) of requiring all directors of DHPL and the other companies in
                    the Group – including the founder, NJS – to retire as directors on
                    attaining the age of 70 and, furthermore, is inconsistent with the express
                    provisions of DHPL’s Articles. To construe the Remuneration Plan as having
                    the definitive and immediate effect contended for by the Appellants is
                    unwarranted. In our view, this extremely informal document was obviously
                    presented merely for discussion purposes at the 27 May 2003 meeting, even
                    though it was signed by NJS and the Other Directors at the meeting itself and
                    was stated as operating retrospectively from 1 May 2003 onwards. It
                    constitutes, at most, an in-principle agreement, with further steps required to
                    implement it, including, in particular, making the necessary amendments to
                    DHPL’s Articles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     We would further add that the evidence shows
                    that the Remuneration Plan was originally intended to address the issue of
                    remuneration only (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above). It appears
                    that it was Anta who decided to include provisions on directors’
                    retirement in his proposed draft of the Remuneration Plan, and that none of the
                    Other Directors or NJS asked him to come up with such provisions. The only
                    evidence which shows that there might have been an intention on the part of the
                    Other Directors and NJS for Anta to also make provision for directors’
                    retirement in the Remuneration Plan is Anta’s 17 March 2003 e-mail,
                    which stated, <em>vis-à-vis</em> Ruling Members, that
                    “[a]ll members above 70 years old must retire”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> However, the
                    problems with adopting this view of that e-mail are twofold. First, the e-mail
                    did not say that Ruling Members would also have to retire as members (whether
                    executive or non-executive) of DHPL’s Board on reaching the age of 70.
                    Second, there is no evidence that the e-mail was circulated to the Other
                    Directors and NJS and that all of them knew about its contents (although we note
                    from the last sentence of the e-mail that it was to be printed out for NJS, Ju
                    Aik and Joo Tian to comment on); there is also no evidence of what each of them
                    had in mind in asking Anta, at the 11 March 2003 meeting, to come up with
                    “a continuous remuneration and benefits scheme for the [Ng]
                        Family”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> Accordingly, Anta’s 17 March
                    2003 e-mail can only represent Anta’s subjective viewpoint or intention,
                    and cannot form part of the factual background relevant to the interpretation of
                    the Remuneration Plan. In any case, it is questionable whether Anta’s
                    subjective intention in coming up with the Remuneration Plan was indeed to also
                    make provision for directors’ retirement (in addition to making provision
                    for the remuneration of those members of the Ng Family who worked in the Group).
                    It would appear from the tenor of Anta’s 17 March 2003 e-mail, which
                    referred to how, during the Ming and the Qing dynasties in China, “the
                    benefits for royal members bankrupted the countr[y] as the number of offspring
                    grows [<em>sic</em>]”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> that Anta’s concern at
                    the material time was limited to putting in place a standard regime for
                    remunerating those members of the Ng Family who worked in the Group so as to
                    avoid the Group being similarly “bankrupted”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>
                    by unlimited payments to an increasing number of family members.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The sixth flaw in the Appellants’
                    interpretation of the Remuneration Plan is that, interestingly, the Other
                    Directors, like NJS, took the position that NJS could continue as a director of
                    DHPL after he attained the age of 70. This was highlighted by the Judge at
                        [22] and [50] of the Judgment, where the following
                    circumstances were alluded to:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_a"></a>(a)     NJS attended the Group’s Board
                        meeting on 7 April 2008, and the notes of that meeting did not disclose
                        any questions having been raised as to his attendance at that meeting or his
                        retirement from either DHPL’s Board or the Board of any other company
                        in the Group (see also <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>
                        above);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_b"></a>(b)     NJS did
                        not tender a written notice of resignation (which was required of directors
                        resigning from DHPL’s Board (see Art 74(e) of DHPL’s
                        Articles)) when he reached the age of 70, and this was not merely an
                        oversight of a formality; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_c"></a>(c)     DHPL’s Articles were not amended to insert a new
                        provision that upon a director reaching the age of 70, he would
                        automatically be retired or his directorship would automatically become
                        vacant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In this regard, it is equally pertinent that
                    on 19 June 2008, well after NJS turned 70, Dovechem Malaysia purported to
                    terminate NJS’s directorships in TJ Malaysia and Dovechem Terminals
                    on the basis that (<em>inter alia</em>) NJS’s request
                    to inspect TJ Malaysia’s records “[would] be the beginning of
                    internal strife and infighting among members of the Ng
                        Family”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> Dovechem Malaysia’s termination
                    letter, which was signed by all the Other Directors, made no reference to the
                    fact that NJS had already automatically retired as a director of
                    TJ Malaysia and Dovechem Terminals upon turning 70 on 4 March 2008
                    (which would be the position based on the Appellants’ interpretation of
                    the Remuneration Plan). Indeed, if NJS had already automatically retired as a
                    director of those two Malaysian companies on 4 March 2008, there would have
                    been no need to terminate him as a director.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     For all these reasons, we agree with the Judge
                    that the Remuneration Plan did not require NJS to retire as a director of DHPL
                    (or as a director of any other company in the Group) upon attaining the age of
                    70, nor did it mean that NJS was automatically deemed to have retired as a
                    director on reaching that age. In other words, NJS is currently still a director
                    of DHPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether NJS consented to retire from DHPL’s Board at the age of
                70: The issue of non est factum</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Even if we were to hold that the Remuneration
                    Plan does (as the Appellants contend) require every Ruling Member, including
                    NJS, to retire as a director upon attaining the age of 70, a corollary question
                    to consider would be whether NJS signified that a concluded agreement to that
                    effect came into being when he signed the Remuneration Plan. In this regard, NJS
                    has raised, <em>inter alia</em>, the plea of <em>non est factum</em>, contending that he was misled by Anta,
                    who drew up the document, into thinking that what was set out therein only
                    related to the remuneration to be paid to the various categories of family
                    members who were involved in or working for the Group.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     A party can plead <em>non est
                        factum</em> in respect of a deed executed or a document signed by him
                    where he “has been misled into executing a deed or signing a document
                    essentially different from that which he intended to execute or sign”
                    (see <em>Chitty</em> at vol 1, para 5-101). If
                    this plea is successfully made out, “[t]he deed or writing is completely
                    void in whosesoever hands it may come” (see likewise <em>Chitty</em> at vol 1, para 5-101). In the present case, the
                    notes of the 27 May 2003 meeting (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above) do not indicate that there was any mention or
                    discussion at that meeting of the retirement of directors or of the retirement
                    of officers of DHPL and/or the Group generally. It is not in dispute that NJS is
                    illiterate as far as the English language is concerned. He did not appear to be
                    careless in signing the Remuneration Plan as he trusted Anta. The Judge did not
                    make any ruling on NJS’s plea of <em>non est
                        factum</em> as it was not necessary for him to do so in view of his
                    ruling on the scope and effect of the Remuneration Plan. While we can take a
                    similar stance, we feel compelled to observe that there are certainly grounds
                    upon which NJS can raise the plea of <em>non est
                        factum</em>. We would therefore hold that NJS is not bound by the
                    Remuneration Plan, at least in so far as the question of mandatory retirement as
                    a director upon reaching the age of 70 is concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether NJS is entitled to inspect DHPL’s records </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     We now turn to the second issue outlined at
                        <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> above, <em>viz</em>, whether NJS is entitled to inspect the accounting and other
                    records of DHPL. Here, s 199 of the Act is germane. It reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    Every company and the directors and managers
                            thereof shall cause to be kept such accounting and other records as will
                            sufficiently explain the transactions and financial position of the
                            company and enable true and fair profit and loss accounts and
                            balance-sheets and any documents required to be attached thereto to be

                            such manner as to enable them to be conveniently and properly
                            audited.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    The records referred to in subsection (1)
                            shall be kept at the registered office of the company or at such other
                            place as the directors think fit and shall at all times be open to
                            inspection by the directors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5)    The Court may in any particular case order that
                            the accounting and other records of a company be open to inspection by a
                            public accountant acting for a director, but only upon an undertaking in
                            writing given to the Court that information acquired by the public
                            accountant during his inspection shall not be disclosed by him except to
                            that director.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     As held by this court in <em>Wuu Khek Chiang George v ECRC Land Pte Ltd</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R)
                    352 (“<em>Wuu Khek Chiang</em>”) at [25] and [33] <em>vis-à-vis</em> the then equivalent of s 199 of the
                    Act (namely, s 199 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 1994 Rev Ed)), a
                    director of a company has an absolute right under s 199 of the Act to
                    inspect the accounting and other records of the company so long as the right is
                    exercised by him to enable him to discharge his duties as a director. It is
                    clear that a director does not need to furnish any particular reason for his
                    request for inspection (see <em>Wuu Khek Chiang</em> at
                        [27]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Given our ruling that NJS remains a director
                    of DHPL (see <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> above), he is entitled to
                    inspect DHPL’s records pursuant to s 199 of the Act unless the
                    Appellants are able to prove that his request for inspection lacks <em>bona fides</em>. In this regard (see <em>Wuu
                        Khek Chiang</em> at [34]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is for those who oppose [a] director’s right to inspect to show
                        “clear proof” and to satisfy the court
                        “affirmatively” that the grant of the right of inspection
                        would be for [a] purpose which would be detrimental to the interests of the
                        company. There must be a “real ground” that the right would be
                        abused and that substantial harm would be caused to the company
                        thereby.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">At the trial, the Judge noted (see [37] of the Judgment) that the Appellants had failed to adduce
                    any evidence to show that NJS’s request for inspection of DHPL’s
                    records was made <em>mala fide</em> or that the request, if
                    granted, would be detrimental to DHPL’s interests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Before this court, the Appellants argued that
                    the following circumstances showed that NJS’s request to inspect
                    DHPL’s records was made <em>mala fide</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_a"></a>(a)     The timing of NJS’s request to
                        inspect DHPL’s records coincided with the period when NJS was slowly
                        being removed as a director of several of the Group’s associated
                        companies in Malaysia (namely, TJ Malaysia, Dovechem Terminals and
                        Imperial Steel). It also coincided with the time when he was vigorously
                        pursuing the issue of DHPL’s repaying him the amounts which he claimed
                        he was entitled to.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_b"></a>(b)     The above factors, compounded with the hostile legal threats and
                        disruptive behaviour of NJS, “painted a picture of suspicion clouded
                        with reasonable beliefs of the ill intentions of NJS”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_c"></a>(c)     With the conclusion of the trial, it was clear
                        that NJS wanted to see DHPL’s records to ensure that personal payments
                        due to him would be forthcoming.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In our opinion, the Appellants’
                    allegations are without any merit. First, it is clear that the purported removal
                    of NJS as a director of the aforesaid Malaysian companies occurred only after he
                    requested to inspect TJ Malaysia’s records. As mentioned earlier (see
                        <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above), on 11 June 2008, NJS
                    wrote to TJ Malaysia setting out his inspection request. It was in response
                    to this request that Dovechem Malaysia sent NJS letters on 19 June 2008 and
                    20 June 2008 removing him as a director of TJ Malaysia, Dovechem
                    Terminals and Imperial Steel (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>–<a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     As for the other two points relied on by the
                    Appellants as “evidence” of NJS’s <em>mala
                        fides</em> in requesting for inspection of DHPL’s records (see
                    sub-paras (b) and (c) of <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a> above),
                    they are, in our view, bare assertions which are not supported by any shred of
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In the circumstances, we find that the Judge
                    did not err in allowing NJS access to DHPL’s records.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In the result, we find that there are no
                    merits in this appeal, which we hereby dismiss with costs and the usual
                    consequential orders.</p>
