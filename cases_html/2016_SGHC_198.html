According to Yeo, Weng and his second brother Chia Kok Chiong (“Chiong”), who were helping their Late Father with his business, suggested that he purchase the Late Father’s one-third share of the Property to help alleviate his father’s financial burden. At this point, their Late Father was in semi-retirement. Two more sons had moved out of the property, but his parents, his mother’s sister Mdm Chong Yee Yong, and other siblings, including Weng, Chris, Hung Lin, Hung Mei still lived there, aside from himself. The agreed purchase price was stated as $150,000.

</div> While it is not disputed that Yeo did not pay this $150,000, Yeo’s contention is that he provided consideration for the Late Father’s one-third share by redeeming his Late Father’s existing Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation (“OCBC”) overdraft debt, which stood at about $250,000 at the time. He raised the money by taking up a new mortgage loan in his own name with OCBC.

It follows from this that the Estate argues that Angie’s one-third share, received from Yeo, is held as a constructive trustee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Disagreeing with the Estate that his one-third share acquired in 1978 was held on trust for the Late Father, Weng followed on to file S 89/2016 on 16 January 2016. By this suit, Weng sues Yeo and Angie seeking a declaration that a one-third share of the Property is held on trust by Yeo and/or Angie for him. As the plaintiff in Suit 89 of 2016, he contends that he transferred his one-third share to Yeo in 1987 to be held on trust and now seeks the return of his share, whether from Yeo or from Angie (arising from Yeo’s transfer of a one-third share to Angie in 1991). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Yeo and Angie contend that all the transfers of title were made for good consideration, without any intention or agreement to create a trust, and without any notice of a trust.

</div>; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Yeo and Angie’s titles to the Property are indefeasible and cannot be defeated by the alleged unregistered beneficial interests. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Legal context of registered title</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Yeo and Angie are the registered proprietors of the Property. Section 46(1) of the Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 2004 Rev Ed) (“LTA”) confers indefeasibility of title to registered proprietors. In the present case, Yeo and Angie rely on indefeasibility as a <span class="font-italic">legal </span><span class="font-italic">defence</span> against the possibility of the plaintiffs asserting <span class="font-italic">any unregistered interest</span> against their registered title. Leaving aside, for the moment, the extent to which indefeasibility of title completely precludes, as a matter of law, the assertion of unregistered interests against a registered proprietor’s title, indefeasibility is also of <span class="font-italic">evidential significance</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In <span class="font-italic">Loo </span><span class="font-italic">Chay Sit v Estate of Loo Chay Loo, deceased</span> [2010] 1 SLR 286 (“<span class="font-italic">Loo </span><span class="font-italic">Chay Sit</span>”), the Court of Appeal established that the indefeasibility of a registered proprietor’s title has, at the very least, an effect on <span class="font-italic">who bears the</span> <span class="font-italic">burden of proof</span> in legal proceedings. In <span class="font-italic">Loo </span><span class="font-italic">Chay Sit</span> at [14], the Court of Appeal held:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">While the respondent, as the party bringing the counterclaim, bears the legal burden of establishing Loo Chay Loo’s title to the Property, <span class="font-italic">it is entitled to rely on the presumption of indefeasibility of title to the Property accorded to Loo </span><span class="font-italic">Chay Loo as registered owner of the Property to discharge this burden</span> (see s 46 of the Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 2004 Rev Ed) (“LTA”)). Therefore, to establish Loo Chay Loo’s title to the Property, the respondent need not prove that Loo Chay Loo had paid for it; all it needs to show is that Loo Chay Loo was the registered owner of the Property. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Thus, a registered proprietor enjoys a “presumption of indefeasibility of title” and can rely on such to establish, <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>, that it holds absolute title to the property in question. The “legal burden” is on the parties asserting an unregistered interest against the registered proprietor’s title to “prove the exceptional circumstances in the LTA, as a result of which the presumption of indefeasibility of title is displaced” (<span class="font-italic">Loo </span><span class="font-italic">Chay Sit</span> at [14]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34  Applying the above to the present case, the presumption is that Yeo and Angie own the Property absolutely in equal shares. The legal burden is on the Late Father’s estate and on Weng to demonstrate that they have a beneficial interest in the Property under constructive and/or resulting trust. It should be noted that even if they can prove that a trust arises in their favour, there remains the question whether the trust proven falls within the “exceptional circumstances in the LTA” (per <span class="font-italic">Loo </span><span class="font-italic">Chay Sit</span> at [14]) such as to be <span class="font-italic">legally capable</span> of defeating Yeo and Angie’s registered title.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The two suits before me essentially turn on a determination of who holds beneficial interests in the disputed two-thirds share of the Property. It is not in dispute that the one-third share purchased by Yeo and Angie from Chris at the price of $1.7m pursuant to the High Court’s order is held by Yeo and Angie absolutely. The question is whether Yeo and Angie hold the <span class="font-italic">remaining </span><span class="font-italic">two-thirds</span> of the Property absolutely, or on trust for the Late Father and/or Weng. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In this regard, the following issues must first be determined: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In relation to the first one-third share:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Following the 1984 transfer from the Late Father to Yeo, did Yeo hold the Late Father’s one-third share on trust for him? </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) If so, is the Estate prevented by reasons of illegality from so claiming?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In relation to the second one-third share:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Did Weng hold the one-third share of the Property that was in his name on trust for the Late Father? </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Following the 1987 transfer from Weng to Yeo, did Yeo hold the one-third share on trust, either for Weng or the Late Father? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Following the 1991 transfer from Yeo to Angie, did Angie hold the one-third share on trust for Weng or the Late Father? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 If a trust is found over either Yeo’s or Angie’s one-third share of the Property, the court must then determine whether either or both of them may rely on the indefeasibility of their registered title, and/or any estoppel arising as a result of the family’s acceptance of Yeo and Angie’s contribution to the rebuilding of the Property in 1999/2000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I now consider each of the one-third shares in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The first one-third share</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 While an express trust was pleaded by the Estate, during the trial, counsel for the Estate informed the court that the Estate was no longer pursuing the claim that there was an express trust created in favour of the Late Father. The plaintiff’s case in S 767/2015, and as seen in counsel’s closing submissions, is therefore premised on the existence of either a resulting trust or a common intention constructive trust in favour of the Late Father.

And even though Yeo did extinguish the Late Father’s debt of $250,000 to OCBC by taking up a new mortgage loan (see [12] above), Yeo did not single-handedly do so because Weng and the Late Mother co-signed the mortgage, and Yeo was not <span class="font-italic">in fact</span> financially responsible for repaying the loan

</div> The Late Mother and Weng only signed the mortgage documents as co-mortgagors; they were <span class="font-italic">not </span>co-borrowers. This means that Yeo <span class="font-italic">alone</span> undertook <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">personam</span> liability to the bank to repay the debt. By signing the mortgage, the Late Mother and Weng merely consented to the bank registering a charge over their<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">interests in the Property</span>; they did not undertake any personal liability to repay the loan.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In my judgment, the above facts show that Yeo provided full consideration for the Late Father’s one-third share of the Property. In <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan </span><span class="font-italic">Chye Terence</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 (“<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>”) at [112], the Court of Appeal held that parties’ contributions to the purchase of the property must be determined <span class="font-italic">at the time of acquisition</span>. Where liability is assumed by a mortgagor at the time of the purchase of the property and the monies borrowed are used on the purchase, “the mortgagor is treated as having provided the proportion of the purchase price attributable to the monies so borrowed” (<span class="font-italic">Curley v </span><span class="font-italic">Parkes</span> [2004] EWCA Civ 1515 at [14], cited in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen </span><span class="font-italic">Lan v See Fong Mun</span> [2014] 3 SLR 1048 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen </span><span class="font-italic">Lan</span>”) at [53]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 As for the Estate’s claim that Yeo was not <span class="font-italic">in fact</span> financially responsible for the loan, no evidence was adduced to support this assertion. While it is not disputed that Yeo did not thereafter make payment on the outstanding loan, his proprietary interest would have crystallised at the point the property was transferred. In its submissions, the Estate relies on Yeo’s equivocal assent under cross-examination to the Estate’s counsel, Mr Peter Gabriel’s (“Mr Gabriel”) suggestion that the bank only gave Yeo the loan because “the bank still trusted [the Late Father]”. In my view, the bank could have given Yeo the loan for a variety of reasons: for example, it was secured by a mortgage over the Property, Yeo was an engineering graduate who would likely have secure income in the future; certainly, the Late Father’s credit history and long-standing relationship with the bank would also have mattered. Nevertheless, Yeo’s assent to Mr Gabriel’s questioning, <span class="font-italic">at its highest</span>, only demonstrates that Yeo did not obtain the loan on his own credit worthiness. It does not establish that the Late Father was in any way <span class="font-italic">still</span><span class="font-italic"> legally responsible</span> to the bank for the loan. The documents unequivocally suggest that Yeo <span class="font-italic">alone</span> was personally liable to repay the loan. The evidence was clear that by the 1980s, the Late Father was in semi-retirement, much of the business was left to Weng and Chiong

With the plumbing business failing, the mantle and responsibility of the loan was put on Yeo’s shoulders: as a graduate, it was expected that he would soon have steady employment and with that promise of future capacity to pay, the ability to stave off foreclosure from the bank. This security from the threat of foreclosure was important because his parents, his aunt and some of his siblings still lived at the Property. The new loan arrangement allowed the family to remain in their home and, in Weng’s words, to be “spared from any hardship”

Only Chia Hung Lin, the eldest daughter who lived at the Property while the parents were alive, gave evidence on behalf of the Estate. Unfortunately, she had very little personal knowledge of the factual matrix of the transactions. She provided little factual basis for the Estate’s claim, and her responses to many of the questions in cross-examination was that she did not know or was not aware. In addition, she contended during her cross-examination that Yeo and Angie had rebuilt the Property because of their “use of the Property”. This contention was not coherently explained, in the light of the fact that no other member of the family appeared to pay for their “use” of the property; conversely, it was largely undisputed that Yeo paid the household expenses at the Property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The Estate sought mainly to establish its case through cross-examination.

I fail to see how the subsequent transfer from Weng to Yeo is at all relevant to whether the Late Father and Yeo shared a <span class="font-italic">common intention</span> that the beneficial interests in the Property should remain with the Late Father. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Consistent with his case,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Yeo denies any such common intention. Subsequent events and the parties’ course of conduct are consistent with Yeo having acquired the Late Father’s one-third share of the Property <span class="font-italic">absolutely</span>. First, Yeo went on to discharge his share of the mortgage through his and Angie’s CPF contributions, over the years. Secondly, after the Late Father’s discharge from bankruptcy in August 2000, the trust was not raised by the Late Father; no one saw fit to transfer the one-third share back to him on the ground that it was held on trust. Third, it was clear that the family accepted that Yeo owned his share, just as they accepted that Chris owned hers. The Property was rebuilt on the basis of that family acceptance. When the Late Father passed away on 4 August 2001, still no assertion was made about his ownership of two-thirds of the Property. Application for Letters of Administration was filed for his Estate in September 2014, some 13 years after his death, and four months after Yeo and Angie filed OS 422/2014 in May 2014. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 A trust of any kind was only raised for the first time by Chris in 2014 in response to OS 442/2014. In the context of Yeo, Angie and Chris’ dispute in 2013 over the payment of her share of the cost of re-construction of the Property, parties came to a tentative agreement at the end of a long series of emails where no trust was discussed. This then broke down because Chris wanted assurance of Yeo’s responsibility to pay for his Late Mother’s medical care. It was at this juncture that she raised the issue that she had discovered that Yeo had received assistance on paying down the loan, which she mentioned she learnt for the first time on 19 February 2013. When sued in OS 422/2014, she was only able to make vague assertions of a “family trust”. These were dismissed by the High Court. In this context, it is somewhat disingenuous of Chris to have commenced S 767/2015 as administratrix of the Late Father’s estate given that she clearly took the position in her previous correspondence with Yeo and Angie (about the sale of the Property) that the three of them were the absolute owners of the Property. I entirely agree with the High Court’s observation in the judgment for OS 422/2014 that “if there was really a family trust of some sort, why did Chris not mention the trust at all when she was negotiating, through Hong, with Angie about the sale of the Property and the use of the net sale proceeds?” (<span class="font-italic">Chia Kwok Yeo and another v Chia Hang </span><span class="font-italic">Kiu</span> [2014] SGHC 197 at [43]) The fact that Chris chose not to testify on behalf of the Estate in the present proceedings to explain herself is also telling.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Illegality</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The issue of illegality only arises if the Estate is able to rely on evidence that a common intention trust was created as part of a plan by the parties to avoid having the Property seized by the Late Father’s creditors. In the light of my finding that there was no such trust, this argument does not arise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the first one-third share</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 To conclude, I find that there is no trust over the one-third share of the Property which was transferred from the Late Father to Yeo in 1984. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The second one-third share</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 This second one-third share was registered in Weng’s name when the Property was acquired in 1978. It is first relevant to determine whether Weng held his original one-third share of the Property on trust for the Late Father as alleged by the Estate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Did Weng hold his one-third share on trust for the Late Father?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 It is not disputed that Weng did not pay for the one-third share held in his name. In September 1978 when the Property was first acquired, the Late Father and Late Mother paid the entire purchase price (see [6] above). Weng started employment with the Late Father in his business in December 1978. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>at [34], the Court of Appeal affirmed the holding in <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche</span><span class="font-italic"> Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council</span> [1996] AC 669 that “where A makes a voluntary payment to B or pays (wholly or in part) for the purchase of property which is vested either in B alone or in the joint names of A and B, there is a presumption that A did not intend to make a gift to B”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In this case, a presumption of resulting trust arises in favour of the Late Father from the fact that Weng gave no consideration for his one-third share of the Property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In response, Yeo’s counsel, Mr Daniel John (“Mr John”), and Weng’s counsel, Mr Kelvin Lee (“Mr Lee”), submit that the presumption of resulting trust is rebutted by the presumption of advancement in favour of Weng. In <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>at [56] and [57], the Court of Appeal held:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">56 The presumption of advancement is an antidote to the rigid injustice periodically occasioned by the mechanical application of the presumption of resulting trust: In limited circumstances where a person voluntarily transfers property into the name of another, or contributes to its purchase, the law presumes that a gift was intended and that the transferor or contributor did not intend to retain any interest in the property concerned...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">57 ... The unrebutted presumption of advancement mandates that the legal title of property reflects the beneficial interests of the parties involved... </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Court of Appeal affirmed that the presumption of advancement arises between a father and son, and stated that it was “more inclined” to the view that it could also extend to independent adult children (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [67]–[68]). In this case, in any event, and for reasons that I elaborate upon below, I hold that the Late Father intended to gift this one-third share to Weng. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 For the avoidance of doubt, I note that no argument was made that this one-third share of the Property was held on trust for the <span class="font-italic">Late Mother</span> despite her contribution of more than one-third of the purchase price. For completeness, I note that even if there was a possibility that part of Weng’s share is attributable to the Late Mother, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> showed a clear willingness to extend the presumption of advancement to include mother-child relationships given the “the obvious logical flaws in the rejection of the presumption of advancement in the case of a mother and her child” (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> at [64]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60    Weng’s explanation of the factual context for the share was that by 1978, the Late Father had looked for a successor amongst his six sons, but none stepped up, save for Weng. This is not disputed by any of the witnesses. Weng’s position was that the beneficial interest in the one-third share was his because of his commitment to his father’s business. He only joined his Late Father’s business, however, in December 1978. The house was purchased in September 1978. His contribution could not form consideration for the transaction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Mr Gabriel relies on Weng’s evidence under cross-examination that his one-third share of the Property was not a gift from the Late Father. In considering this suggestion, it is critical to appreciate the context in which this was said

Weng therefore felt that he had earned it because of his undertaking to carry on his father’s business. Chris’ affidavit, dated 25 June 2014 and filed in support of OS 422/2014, reflects the same understanding at [9]: “Weng’s name was included on the title of the Property as he had contributed to [the Late Father’s] business”. I hold that the Late Father gave Weng the one-third interest as Weng was heavily involved in the Late Father’s business and had agreed to take over the business.

</div> As mentioned at [16] above, Yeo contributed a total of $11,000 in cash and CPF, as well as jointly undertook a fresh loan of $130,000 with Chris. Therefore, if half of the fresh loan is attributed to Yeo, he would have made a contribution of $76,000 to the discharge of the existing $206,000 overdraft loan. Yeo’s case is therefore that he did give valuable consideration to Weng for the one-third share of the Property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 At this juncture, it is essential to pay close attention to the $206,000 loan which Yeo and Chris discharged on 21 January 1987. This appears to have been the <span class="font-italic">same</span> overdraft debt <span class="font-italic">Yeo</span> undertook when purchasing the Late Father’s one-third share in 1984 (see [12] and [41] above).

</div> However, as I found at [42] above, Yeo <span class="font-italic">alone</span> undertook personal liability for repaying the loan. This is corroborated by the OCBC credit note dated 27 January 1987 (see [77] above). Weng’s only “liability” (loosely speaking) is that his interest in the house was subject to OCBC’s charge which may be enforced against <span class="font-italic">his share of the Property</span> if Yeo defaults on the loan. Weng was under no legal obligation as a principal to repay the $206,000 overdraft loan. Therefore, I reject Mr John’s submission that Weng benefited from Yeo’s contribution to redeeming the $206,000 overdraft loan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 A point to note is that by signing the sale and purchase agreement, Yeo had given Weng a <span class="font-italic">legally binding contractual promise</span> that he would pay Weng $126,000. It is not disputed that this sum was not paid (similarly Chris did not pay her Late Mother the stipulated $126,000 mentioned in their sale and purchase agreement).

It is not clear, however, <span class="font-italic">why</span> Yeo and Weng decided to enter into a sale and purchase agreement rather than to effect an outright transfer. While a variety of possible reasons exist, I do not find it necessary to make a finding on this. In my judgment, there is not enough evidence to establish dishonesty on the part of Yeo or Weng (given their motive for creating the appearance of a sale and purchase agreement is unclear). I find, however, that the common understanding between them at that time was that the purchase price of $126,000 did not actually have to be paid by Yeo. Similarly, there is no evidence that Chris paid the $126,000 she promised in her sale and purchase agreement to her Late Mother. To this extent, I accept Weng’s position that Yeo’s contractual promise to pay him $126,000 was a sham in that both parties never intended it to be enforced. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 My finding is reinforced by Yeo’s conduct in the present proceedings.

</div> the $76,000 contribution Yeo made to the running down of the $206,000 overdraft loan was referred to as the “valuable consideration” he gave in exchange for Weng’s one-third share in the Property.

First, I observe that the legal conclusions to be drawn from material facts need not be pleaded (<span class="font-italic">MK (Project Management) Ltd v Baker Marine Energy Pte Ltd </span>[1994] 3 SLR(R) 823 at [26]). There is therefore no need for Yeo to specifically plead that the presumption of resulting trust, if it arises, is rebutted. While Yeo did not specifically deny the assertion that Weng lacked an intention to benefit Yeo with the transfer in his defence, it is sufficient in my view that Yeo denied all the allegations in the statement of claim that were not expressly admitted. From the statement of claim, it is clear that Yeo was disputing the assertion that Weng lacked an intention to benefit Yeo in the transfer, or that the transfer from Weng to him was anything but an outright transfer of both legal and beneficial interests.  More importantly, both plaintiffs fully understood Yeo’s case and were not prejudiced in any way. Thus, it is open to the court to determine whether the presumption of resulting trust is rebutted. In my judgment, <span class="font-italic">Weng did intend an o</span><span class="font-italic">utright transfer</span> to Yeo, for the reasons that follow.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 First, Weng applied for a Housing Development Board (“HDB”) flat in April 1992.

</div>
</div> Nevertheless, while Weng now retrospectively claims that he was not telling the truth in his HDB application, his <span class="font-italic">own </span>declaration to HDB is still, in my view, evidence which undermines his present claim that he had retained an interest in the Property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Secondly, Weng’s factual case is premised on Yeo knowing and agreeing to hold the one-third share of the Property on trust for Weng. Yeo’s subsequent conduct, however, is more consistent with him acting as absolute proprietor of the Property rather than as a trustee. First, Yeo invested a substantial amount of money into rebuilding the Property. It is unlikely that Yeo would have been willing to invest so heavily in improving the Property if he did not view it as belonging to him. Second, Yeo or Angie did not seek to reclaim any rebuilding costs from Weng, but instead only sought to claim a third of the costs from Chris whom they viewed to be a one-third owner of the Property. All this shows, <span class="font-italic">at the very least</span>, that Yeo must have viewed himself as an absolute owner of the Property even prior to this litigation. This is inconsistent with the alleged common understanding and agreement between Weng and Yeo that Yeo would hold Weng’s share on trust for him.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Weng was unable to give a good explanation as to why he would transfer his share on trust to Yeo. He suggested that, having helped his father with his bankruptcy, he became afraid that the same fate would befall him. Security for the family home, however, could just as easily have been protected by a transfer of his interest (in like manner to what the Late Father did when the Late Father sought to protect the family home). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Weng’s own conduct prior to this litigation has been consistent with Yeo being the absolute proprietor of the second one-third share. Contrary to Mr Lee’s submissions, I do not find Weng’s silence equivocal in the circumstances. He contended he had no knowledge that Yeo transferred a one-third share to Angie in 1991. He was still living at the Property at this point (his application to the HDB was made in 1992). Yet, his explanation, “after 1987, after I transferred to Yeo, I got nothing to do with it”, belies his claim to ownership. When the family moved out of the Property for the renovation in 1999, Weng assisted. His contention on cross-examination that he had no idea about the redevelopment but assisted at his Late Mother’s request smacks of the incredible. Throughout Yeo’s renovation costs dispute with Chris, and during the OS 442/2014 litigation, Weng failed to make his claim. On the stand, he said “I don’t remember” about the previous lawsuit and claimed he was not aware that Chris had filed an affidavit suggesting the Property was a family asset. These contentions were not persuasive. Even after the demise of the Late Mother in October 2014, Weng did not seek to stake a claim to the one-third share he transferred to Yeo in 1987. His contention was first raised with Angie and Yeo in July 2015, in separate telephone calls. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Finally, Weng relies heavily on a contribution of $70,000 or $100,000 to the discharge of the overdraft loan sometime in 1986. I note as an aside that a voluntary injection of funds to help mortgage repayments does not, on its own, establish Weng’s proprietary interest in the Property: the capital injection is, at best, only relevant as evidence that Weng may have still treated the Property as his. Weng, however, admitted that the money originated from his Late Father’s business, although he contended on the stand that the Late Father had given the sum to him. Weng was only receiving a minimal allowance when he worked for the Late Father. After his Late Father’s bankruptcy, he worked alone as a plumber without a registered business and was not in a stable financial condition. The evidence was clear that the $100,000 came from the sale of a property (“the Lichfield property”) that was owned by a company in which the Late Father had a 60% share, and Weng and Chia Kwok Kee had a 40% share.

</div>
</div> It appears more likely that at that point, Weng simply viewed the overdraft debt as part of the debts chalked up by his and the Late Father’s business, and tried to do what he could to repay the loan owed to the bank. The payment of the $100,000 is also consonant with Yeo’s evidence that when Chiong and Weng had initially asked him to take over the overdraft as borrower with the bank in 1984 (when the market value of the property was estimated at about $150,000), Chiong had promised that they would try to help repay the amount owing on the overdraft, which at the time of their conversation stood at $250,000. The Estate chose not to rebut this contention by calling Chiong, although Yeo raised the point even in his Defence

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> Yeo’s Defence in S 89, at [23(f)].</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 To conclude, I find that the evidence irresistibly points to the conclusion that Weng intended to transfer his share in the Property <span class="font-italic">absolutely</span> to Yeo. Both the documentary evidence and the parties’ conduct through the years are consistent with that conclusion. Weng’s surrender of his beneficial interest, while a “gift” in strict legal nomenclature, was a logical decision to make in the light of his financial situation at the time, and was not without wider benefit to him. It freed him of worry that his business debts could deprive his parents, himself and other members of their family of their home, it released him from any moral obligation he may have felt as a co-owner living in the Property to help to pay the mortgage outstanding, and subsequently, it allowed him to pursue other options for housing with the HDB.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Chris’ conduct is also relevant in considering the intentions of the various actors. Although Yeo was the sole borrower under the fresh loan he took up in 1984, Chris used her CPF money to run down Yeo’s debt on the transfer of the Late Mother’s share to her in 1987. Over the years, she also used her CPF to contribute to running down the overdraft debt. It appears to me that the intention of the family, from 1984, was to secure the home for the parents and the members of the family who lived there. <span class="font-italic">This was the family compact</span>. It actuated the father’s first transfer in 1984, and forms the foundation as to why Yeo is the sole borrower on the loan secured in 1984. Prior to the second series of transfers to Yeo and Chris in 1987, Weng had sought to use his CPF but was not allowed to do so. Thus, he would not be able to help with the repayments that, in the longer run, could secure the home for the family. He therefore looked to Yeo to do so. Yeo and Chris then followed up to maintain the payments, later with the aid of Angie’s CPF contribution as well. The family compact also explains why the Lichfield Property proceeds were used to pay down the debt outstanding on the overdraft even though, as a legal matter, Yeo was the sole borrower on the bank loan. In the face of his father’s and brothers’ business debt, Yeo took on the liability in 1984 in order to protect the family home. As a fresh graduate, it was clear that he did not quite have the means to do so. Chris, Weng and Chiong, being aware of the risk of foreclosure, subsequently came in to help, with Chris also taking on part of the mortgage. Indeed, these are siblings who have borne much adversity together for the greater good of the family. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 While all had a part to play, the facts surrounding the rebuilding of the Property show that throughout, Chris, Yeo and Angie were looked upon by the rest as owners of their shares, both legally and beneficially. Chris, Yeo and Angie also behaved as such. While the rebuilding was in progress, the Late Father was discharged from bankruptcy; yet, no mention was made of any return of a share to him. While there was an expectation that their parents would live in the home, <span class="font-italic">this was on the premise that </span><span class="font-italic">Chris, Yeo and Angie were both the legal and beneficial owners</span> of their shares of the Property. On the part of Chris, Yeo and Angie, <span class="font-italic">t</span><span class="font-italic">heir conduct was founded upon filial expectations, not legal obligations</span>. Hence Angie’s evidence - which was not contradicted - was that there was, prior to the rebuilding, a discussion about whether a pair of semi-detached homes should be built instead of a single bungalow. This was a logical query because the owners were Chris, on the one hand, and Yeo and Angie, on the other. Respecting the wishes of their Late Mother, a single bungalow was built.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The claims against Angie; indefeasibility of Yeo and Angie’s title; estoppel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The claims against Angie were premised on a trust being established over either of Yeo’s two one-third shares of the Property. With my conclusion that there is no trust in relation to either one-third share, there is no need to consider if Angie holds her one-third share on trust for the Late Father or Weng. Yeo, as legal and beneficial owner of his then two-thirds share of the Property, had the right to dispose of the Property to whomever he wished and Angie received good title following that transfer. In any event, I accept Angie’s evidence that she believed Yeo held his two-thirds absolutely, and she sought to purchase a one-third share so that she could help shoulder the mortgage with her CPF money. In that regard, she would have no notice of any trust arrangement (which I have held does not exist). Given the absence of any evidence as to expressions of a trust made by the various parties (and the lack of any direct assertion based on personal knowledge from the Estate’s sole witness), any contention that she ought to have known would also be without any basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In addition, with my finding that the plaintiffs are unable to establish that a trust arises in their favour <span class="font-italic">on the evidence</span>, there is no necessity for me to consider whether they can assert their alleged unregistered beneficial interests against Yeo’s and Angie’s registered titles. The discussion, which on the facts before me I find unnecessary to deal with, would have involved three Court of Appeal authorities that do not sit easily with each other: <span class="font-italic">United Overseas Bank Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Bebe bte Mohammad</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 884; <span class="font-italic">Ho </span><span class="font-italic">Kon Kim v Lim Gek Kim Betsy and others and another appeal</span> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 220; and <span class="font-italic">Loo </span><span class="font-italic">Chay Sit</span>.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Finally, Yeo and Angie rely upon estoppel as a last-stop defence in the event that they are held to be trustees. The estoppel defence is premised upon the circumstances surrounding the rebuilding of the Property. It is not clear which kind of estoppel Yeo and Angie intend, and the plaintiffs submit that no estoppel can be made out. Given the nature of the evidence adduced, it is not surprising that Yeo and Angie had difficulty articulating the category and factual premise of any estoppel. In any event, on the facts as I have found, there is no need for this issue to be dealt with.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In conclusion, I dismiss Suits 767/2015 and 89/2016. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 As requested, I will hear parties on costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"> </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Valerie Thean<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Gabriel Peter and Pravin Thevar (Gabriel Law Corporation) for the plaintiff in S 767/2015;<br/>Daniel John and Kevin Cheng (Goodwins Law Corporation) for the first defendant in S 767/2015 and S 89/2016;<br/>Eddie Koh (S H Koh &amp; Co) for the second defendant in S 767/2015 and S 89/2016;<br/>Kelvin Lee (WNLEX LLC) for the third defendant in S 767/2015 and the plaintiff in S 89/2016.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
