The applicant and a co-accused claimed trial in the General Division of the High Court to charges of serious sexual offences in HC/CC 40/2019 (“CC 40”). Before the trial had even commenced, the applicant and the co-accused filed HC/CM 20/2021 and HC/CM 28/2021 respectively, seeking that the Prosecution disclose witness statements of the complainant and her boyfriend. The High Court judge (“the Judge”) refused to grant the motions. The applicant thus filed CA/CM 19/2021 (“CM 19”) pursuant to s 397(1) of the CPC (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the present application) seeking leave to refer a question of law of public interest to the Court of Appeal. The co-accused did not make a similar application. The question that the applicant seeks to refer is: “Whether the Public Prosecutor should disclose to the Defence the witness statements of prosecution witnesses who are also witnesses to be called at a criminal trial”. The applicant alternatively asks this court to direct the Prosecution to refer the question to the court pursuant to s 397(2) of the CPC. In response, the Prosecution argues that CM 19 should be summarily refused under s 397(3B) of the CPC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The relevant parts of s 397 of the CPC read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Reference to Court of Appeal of criminal matter determined by General Division of High Court in exercise of its appellate or revisionary jurisdiction</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">397.</span>—(1) When a criminal matter <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">has been determined</span> by the General Division of the High Court <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">in the exercise of its</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">appellate or revisionary jurisdiction</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">and</span> a party to the proceedings wishes to refer any question of law of public interest which has arisen in the matter and the determination of which by the Judge has affected the case, that party may apply to the Court of Appeal for leave to refer the question to the Court of Appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) The Public Prosecutor may refer any question of law of public interest without the leave of the Court of Appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3B) Where —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) a party applies under subsection (1) for leave to refer a question to the Court of Appeal; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) it appears to the Court of Appeal that the question is not a question of law of public interest which has arisen in the matter, and the determination of which has affected the case, to which the application relates, the application may, without being set down for hearing, be summarily refused by an order, under the hand of a presiding Judge sitting in the Court of Appeal, certifying that the Court of Appeal is satisfied that the application was made without any sufficient ground.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3C) A decision of the Court of Appeal to summarily refuse under subsection (3B) an application under subsection (1) can only be made by a unanimous decision of all the Judges sitting in the Court of Appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in bold in original; emphasis added in bold italics and underlined bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 It is of the first importance to note at the outset <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the context </span>in which the present application has been made. Put simply, this application has been made <span class="font-italic">in the context of the exercise of the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">original</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> jurisdiction </span><span class="font-italic">of the General Division of the High Court and, indeed, has been made even prior to the commencement of the trial itself</span>. It is clear, therefore, that the General Division of the High Court has <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not</span> made any determination <span class="font-italic">in the exercise of its </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">appellate or revisionary</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">jurisdiction </span>(which is a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">requirement that </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">must</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">be satisfied before an application can even be made pursuant to s</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> 397 of the CPC (“s 397”) in the first place</span>). The rationale for an application pursuant to s 397 is to allow the Court of Appeal to consider a question of law of public interest that would affect the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">determination </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">of a case before the General Division of the High Court from which there is no further right of appeal</span>. This occurs where the General Division of the High Court has considered an <span class="font-italic">appeal </span>from a decision in the State Courts <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">or </span>has exercised its <span class="font-italic">revisionary </span>jurisdiction. Section 397 provides that in <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">very limited</span> <span class="font-italic">situations</span>, the reference of a point of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">law</span> of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">public interest</span> might be permitted in order that the Court of Appeal, which is the final appellate court in the land, might, <span class="font-italic">notwithstanding</span> that there is no further right of appeal in the particular case, consider the question as the court’s determination of that point of law of <span class="font-italic">public</span> interest would, by its very nature, be of relevance to future cases (see also, for example, the decisions of this court in <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Faizal bin </span><span class="font-italic">Sabtu and another v Public Prosecutor and another matter </span>[2013] 2 SLR 141 at [20]–[22]; <span class="font-italic">Huang </span><span class="font-italic">Liping v Public Prosecutor </span>[2016] 4 SLR 716 at [20]–[22]; and <span class="font-italic">Tang </span><span class="font-italic">Keng Lai v Public Prosecutor </span>[2021] SGCA 52 at [1]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 In the present case, there has been <span class="font-italic">no</span> determination <span class="font-italic">whatsoever </span>by the General Division of the High Court in the exercise of either its <span class="font-italic">appellate or </span><span class="font-italic">revisionary</span> jurisdiction. Indeed, it is a case which engages the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">original</span> <span class="font-italic">jurisdiction </span>of the High Court instead. For this reason alone, the present application is not only misconceived but is also <span class="font-italic">an abuse of process</span> <span class="font-italic">of the court</span>. Quite apart from the clear and unambiguous language of s 397(1) (which meaning would have been obvious to any reasonably competent lawyer), counsel for the applicant, Mr Wong Siew Hong (“Mr Wong”), himself <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">admitted</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>during a Case Management Conference (“CMC”) conducted on 24 May 2021 that there is <span class="font-italic">no recourse</span> to s 397 when the General Division of the High Court is exercising its <span class="font-italic">original </span>jurisdiction. He further admitted that the General Division of the High Court in CC 40 was exercising its original jurisdiction. It therefore beggars belief that Mr Wong, an experienced criminal law counsel, would nevertheless proceed to file the present application when it was clear beyond all reasonable doubt that <span class="font-italic">the Court of Appeal did </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not possess the necessary </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">jurisdiction</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">to even entertain the application to begin with </span>(also bearing in mind the fact that the Court of Appeal is a creature of statute and is hence only seised of the jurisdiction that has been conferred upon it by the relevant provisions, whether derived from the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) or elsewhere (see, for example, the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Chye Huey and another v Public Prosecutor </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 106 at [17])). In the premises, the present application <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">must fail </span><span class="font-weight-bold">in </span><span class="font-weight-bold">limine</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 We therefore dismiss the present application summarily pursuant to s 397(3B) of the CPC. It is clear that the determination by the Judge has <span class="font-italic">not</span> affected the case within the meaning and scope of s 397 (unlike, for example, <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Li </span><span class="font-italic">Weiming and others </span>[2014] 2 SLR 393, which Mr Wong relies upon). Indeed, as already observed, the trial itself has not even commenced. The Judge’s determination was <span class="font-italic">an interlocutory order</span> made in the exercise of his original jurisdiction in the course of a criminal matter. It is clear law that such an order generally cannot be appealed (see the decision of the General Division of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Xu </span><span class="font-italic">Yuanchen v Public Prosecutor and another matter </span>[2021] SGHC 64 (“<span class="font-italic">Xu </span><span class="font-italic">Yuanchen</span>”) at [10]). As Sundaresh Menon CJ observed, “in the course of a typical trial, the trial judge can be expected to make numerous interlocutory rulings and it would impose impossible difficulties for the expeditious conduct of the trial if each and every one of these could be appealed” (at [10]). This rationale applies to both the Prosecution and the Defence alike.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In the context of the present case, the applicant’s claim that the failure to disclose the relevant witness statements would affect his preparation for trial is purely speculative because he has not seen those statements and therefore does not know whether the contents of the statements would have any impact on how he would conduct his case. These are precisely the “inchoate circumstances” referred to in <span class="font-italic">Xu </span><span class="font-italic">Yuanchen </span>(at [12]) which would have prohibited an <span class="font-italic">appeal</span> against the Judge’s order. Looked at in this light, the present application is, in substance, a “backdoor appeal” against the Judge’s order and reinforces the point (already made above) that the present application is an abuse of the process of court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Finally, the applicant’s alternative prayer that this court direct the Public Prosecutor to refer the question at [1] above to it is fatally flawed since, as already explained above, this court does not possess the requisite <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">jurisdiction to consider that question to begin with.</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> Further, s 397(2) of the CPC provides that “[t]he Public Prosecutor may refer any question of law of public interest without the leave of the Court of Appeal”. It is evident from this provision that the discretion to refer is conferred on the Public Prosecutor and the court cannot compel him to exercise it.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 For the reasons set out above, the application is summarily dismissed. We are minded to order costs in this application against Mr Wong. He was alerted by the Assistant Registrar during the CMC to the Court of Appeal’s lack of jurisdiction to hear the application, and was also given the opportunity to reconsider his position. Yet, he decided to proceed with this unmeritorious application. We therefore direct Mr Wong to tender submissions, within ten days from the date of this Judgment, as to why a costs order should not be imposed personally upon him, and as to the quantum of costs if a costs order is in fact imposed. If the Prosecution wishes to respond, whether on the issue of Mr Wong’s personal liability or on the quantum of costs, it shall file and serve its submissions within 7 days after Mr Wong has filed and served his submissions.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Andrew Phang Boon Leong<br/>Justice of the Court of Appeal</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Tay Yong Kwang<br/>Justice of the Court of Appeal</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Steven Chong<br/>Justice of the Court of Appeal</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Wong Siew Hong, Lee Peng Khoon Edwin, Charles Ng and Clarence Cheang Wei Ming (Eldan Law LLP) for the applicant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kumaresan Gohulabalan, Sruthi Boppana and Tay Jia En (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
