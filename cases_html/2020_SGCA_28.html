In the main, the underlying dispute concerned a distributorship and its related agreements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Owing to the intricate web of agreements, by the time the arbitration was commenced, a dispute had arisen in relation to the respondent’s (the claimant in the arbitration) right to bring the arbitration proceedings against the appellant. The appellant elected not to participate in the arbitration proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 While it is uncontroversial that an assignment of an agreement containing an arbitration clause is effective to assign the right to arbitrate to the assignee, the respondent nonetheless argued that it was entitled to commence arbitration proceedings against the appellant (in relation to a specific debt) on the premise that it was an original party to the underlying agreement. We have no difficulty in agreeing with the High Court Judge’s rejection (“the Judge”) of this argument since such an argument, if accepted, would mean that the legal right to arbitrate would be vested <span class="font-italic">simultaneously</span> in both the assignor and assignee. This is plainly wrong. Notwithstanding the rejection of this argument, this appeal has raised a number of novel issues arising from the assignment, novation and reassignment agreements. First, is a dispute relating to the right of suit following an assignment of the underlying agreement, a dispute that pertains to the <span class="font-italic">scope or existence</span> of an arbitration agreement under the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (“the Model Law”)? Second, can such a notice of assignment be validly sent by the assignee instead of the assignor? Third, if a debt is reassigned to the claimant only <span class="font-italic">after</span> the commencement of the arbitration, would the arbitrator have jurisdiction over the dispute given that the arbitrator’s jurisdiction is rooted in the consent of the parties? These are some of the interesting issues that will be examined in this judgment.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Background to the dispute</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The respondent, BXI, is a developer and manufacturer of consumer goods. It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of a Singapore company (“the Parent Company”). The appellant, BXH, distributes and markets the respondent’s goods in Russia. The two parties (“the parties”) possess, in the words of  the Judge, a “complicated legal relationship”. In order to understand this relationship, regard must be had to eight related contracts, all of which involved at least one of the parties. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Distributor Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In December 2010, the appellant and the Parent Company entered into the Distributor Agreement.

We note that while the respondent contends that invoices C94 and C95 were not assigned to the Factor, it accepts their classification as part of Debt B. Apart from this, neither party has taken issue with this categorisation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Judge’s findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 After considering the numerous arguments raised by the parties, the Judge decided in favour of the respondent – that the tribunal did possess jurisdiction over the parties’ dispute. In reaching his conclusion, the Judge made a number of findings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 First, despite the apparent contradiction between cll 25.8 and 25.9 of the Distributor Agreement, the two clauses did not give rise to an irreconcilable inconsistency. According to the approach adopted by Steyn J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith Ltd v H&amp;S International Holding Inc</span> [1991] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 127 (“the <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith</span> approach”), where there is a clear intent to arbitrate disputes in a commercial contract, such an intent should be upheld. The parties were thus bound by the arbitration agreement contained in cl 25.9 of the Distributor Agreement (see the Judgment at [233]–[245]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Second, despite the use of the word “assigns”, cl 1 of the Assignment and Novation Agreement effected a novation of the Distributor Agreement from the Parent Company to the respondent. There is no general requirement for notice to be given to an obligor before an obligee, whose rights arise by a novation, may enforce those rights. The requirement of notice only arose due to the express terms of cl 1 requiring that notice had to be given by the Parent Company to the appellant and respondent (see the Judgment at [113]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Third, a valid contractual notice was given by the Parent Company to the appellant pursuant to cl 1 of the Assignment and Novation Agreement. The requisite notice did not have to be issued only after cl 1 acquired contractual effect – an email sent by the Parent Company to the appellant before the agreement came into effect sufficed (see the Judgment at [118]–[123]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Fourth, the right to arbitrate disputes in relation to Debt B, as well as Debt B itself, was assigned to the Factor by the respondent. However, given that various substantive rights remained in force under the Distributor Agreement between the appellant and respondent, this assignment of Debt B went towards the issue of scope, rather than the existence of an arbitration agreement between the parties (see the Judgment at [138]–[142]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Fifth, the right to arbitrate in relation to Debt B was re-assigned to the respondent through the Buy Back Agreement. The contractual purpose of the Buy Back Agreement was to give effect to the intention to sever any legal link between the Factor and the respondent’s distributors, as indicated by the Factor’s withdrawal from operations in Russia. This could only be achieved by a repurchase of the debt (see the Judgment at [157]). Reliance was also placed on the decision of <span class="font-italic">Lanxess</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v APP Chemicals International (Mau) Ltd</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 769 (“<span class="font-italic">Lanxess</span>”) in finding that an email dated 18 June 2015 sent by the respondent constituted notice of assignment to the appellant, despite the lack of the word “assignment” in said email (see the Judgment at [172]–[173]). The fact that the respondent only repurchased invoices C3 to C6 (under Debt 1B) after the commencement of arbitration was also not fatal (see the Judgment at [191]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Sixth, the Debt Transfer Agreement, on its proper interpretation, did not relieve the appellant entirely of its obligation to pay the Open Debt.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Reliance was placed on the decisions of <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith </span>([42] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) and <span class="font-italic">EJR Lovelock </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd v Exportles</span> [1968] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 163 (“<span class="font-italic">Lovelock</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 As noted by the Judge, prior to this case, the only local decision addressing the construction of a contract containing both jurisdiction and arbitration clauses appears to be that of <span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Tri-MG Intra Asia Airlines v Norse Air Charter Limited</span> [2009] SGHC 13 (“<span class="font-italic">PT Tri-MG</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The defendant in <span class="font-italic">PT Tri-MG</span> sought a stay of proceedings pursuant to s 6 of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”). A key issue before the assistant registrar was “[w]hether a stay under s 6 of the IAA ought to granted when the Agreement <span class="font-italic">ex facie</span> contains an arbitration clause as well as a jurisdiction clause” (see <span class="font-italic">PT Tri-MG</span> at [3(a)]). After conducting a review of various English authorities, the learned assistant registrar decided to apply the <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith</span> approach to reconcile the arbitration and jurisdiction clauses – he read the latter as “a submission to the Singapore court’s supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration” (see <span class="font-italic">PT Tri-MG</span> at [46]). The Judge affirmed the assistant registrar’s use of the <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith</span> approach and applied it to the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith</span>, Steyn J was faced with an arbitration clause entitled “Settlement of Disputes”. It provided as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… If any dispute or difference shall arise between the parties hereto concerning the construction of this Agreement or the rights or liabilities of either party hereunder the parties shall strive to settle the same amicably but if they are unable to do so the dispute or difference shall be adjudicated upon under the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more Arbitrators appointed in accordance with those Rules.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The parties’ agreement also contained a clause entitled “Language and Law”, which purported to set out a governing law and jurisdiction. It stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… This Agreement is written in the English language and shall be interpreted according to English law. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The courts of England shall have exclusive jurisdiction over it to which jurisdiction the parties hereby submit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 As the Judge observed (at [237] of the Judgment), Steyn J rejected the plaintiff’s argument that the parties’ arbitration agreement was invalid due to the inconsistency between the two clauses, holding that it would be drastic and very unattractive to find a total failure of the agreed method of dispute resolution in an international commercial contract. Steyn J preferred to interpret the “Language and Law” clause as applying to the parties’ arbitration itself, such that the English courts had supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration. Such an approach was preferable to treating the arbitration clause as <span class="font-italic">pro non </span><span class="font-italic">scripto</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, as if it had never been written. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 When assessing the effect of purportedly inconsistent clauses, one should always start with their plain language. As stated by the Judge at [242]–[243] of the Judgment:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">242 As the authorities acknowledge, the <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith</span> approach to construing arbitration and jurisdiction clauses together is not perfect. In particular, in this case, the parties agreed in cl 25.8 that “[t]he jurisdiction and venue for any legal action … <span class="font-italic">arising out of or connected with this Agreement, or the Services and Products furnished hereunder</span>” shall be the Singapore courts. On the face of it, this clause envisages that substantive disputes surrounding the Distributor Agreement, and not only matters of curial review of an arbitration under cl 25.9, will be determined by the Singapore courts.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">243 Nonetheless, a dispute over the parties’ substantive rights and obligations arising out of or connected with the Distributor Agreement cannot obviously be the subject of <span class="font-italic">both</span> litigation and arbitration. The only practical – thought [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] not entirely satisfactory – solution is to adopt the <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith</span> approach and hold that the parties intended to resolve substantive disputes in arbitration under cl 25.9 and to resolve disputes arising out of any such arbitration in the Singapore courts in the exercise of their supervisory jurisdiction under cl 25.8.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 We agree with this approach. Where parties evince a real intention to have matters resolved by arbitration, the court ought to give effect to that intention. Minor inconsistencies between clauses cannot be allowed to detract from the parties’ agreement to arbitrate. Instead, a generous and harmonious interpretation should be given to the purportedly conflicting clauses such as to give effect to the parties’ true intention.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 We do not think that the wording of the two clauses preclude an adoption of the <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith</span> approach. We are fortified in reaching this conclusion given the amount of detail provided by the parties in cl 25.9. The clause painstakingly provides for the binding effect of the award on parties, the manner in which the award was to be made, the manner in which the arbitrators were to be appointed, the number of arbitrators, as well as the language of the proceedings. This is in contrast to cl 25.8, which simply provides for the applicability of Singapore law and the jurisdiction of the courts located in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 While the appellant sought to rely on the decision of <span class="font-italic">Lovelock</span> ([53] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) to further its case, we are of the view that it has little applicability here. The court in <span class="font-italic">Lovelock</span> was faced with a dispute resolution clause that consisted of two parts. The first provided for arbitration before English arbitrators. The second provided for the referral of the dispute to the USSR Chamber of Commerce Foreign Trade Arbitration Commission in Moscow, in accordance with the law of the USSR. The court eventually found the parties’ dispute resolution clause to be meaningless, and had to be rejected, as it was not possible to discern whether a dispute would fall within the first or second part of the clause – both parts provided for arbitration (see <span class="font-italic">Lovelock</span> at 166). The present case, in contrast, is more akin to the situation in <span class="font-italic">Paul Smith</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether valid notice was given under the Assignment and Novation Agreement </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The appellant argues that the Judge erred in finding that an email sent to the appellant prior to the execution of the Assignment and Novation Agreement cannot suffice as valid notice, and that as a result, the right to arbitrate under the Distributor Agreement remained with the Parent Company rather than the respondent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 It is clear that under cl 1 of the Assignment and Novation Agreement, valid notice had to be given to the appellant and the respondent. To reiterate, cl 1 states that the Parent Company:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… hereby assigns, conveys, transfers and delivers all of its rights and obligations in and under the Agreements to [the respondent] effective on a date between January 1, 2013 and June 30, 2013, as notified by [the Parent Company] to [the appellant] and [the respondent] not less than thirty (30) days prior to such date (“Effective Date”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The parties agree that following an initial email dated 1 November 2012, the Parent Company had sent an email dated 14 December 2012 to the appellant, which was titled “Assignment and Novation to [the respondent] – transition will occur on 14 January 2013”.

We agree with the Judge at [118], that nothing in the plain wording of cl 1 suggests that the notification is only effective after a certain date or event. All cl 1 states is that the Parent Company’s rights and obligations would be transferred to the respondent “effective on a date between January 1, 2013 and June 30, 2013, as notified” by the Parent Company to the appellant and respondent. There is no reason to read the term “as notified” as prescribing a specific timeframe for the Parent Company to give notice – such a finding would simply go against the text of the parties’ agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 We thus find that the 14 December 2012 email constituted the requisite contractual notice under cl 1 such that the novation of the right to arbitrate from the Parent Company to the respondent was effective.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the respondent possessed the right to arbitrate in relation to Debt B</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The appellant mounted two arguments in relation to the respondent’s purported inability to arbitrate in relation to Debt B specifically. First, that the respondent had assigned away its right to arbitrate over Debt B to the Factor when it entered into the Participation Agreement. Second, this right to arbitrate was not reassigned to the respondent through the Buy Back Agreement. Any reassignment would only have taken effect in 2017, through the 2017 letter. According to the appellant, the respondent thus lacked “the right to start the proceedings” in relation to Debt B when it filed its notice of arbitration in 2015.

An arbitration agreement does not have a purpose or a life independent of the substantive obligations that it attaches to.

This was accepted by the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The parties, however, differ as to whether the right to arbitrate in relation to Debt B would fall to be considered under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) or Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii). The respondent argues that this dispute is one of scope under Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii), which was not pleaded by the respondent. On this basis, the appellant’s arguments should be disregarded by the court. The appellant naturally takes issue with such a characterisation, arguing that the present issue is more properly considered as one relating to the existence of an arbitration agreement – whether there was a valid and subsisting arbitration agreement between the parties in respect of the disputes arising out of Debt B.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The Judge had found that Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii), rather than Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i), was engaged on the present facts. He stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">140 … The Distributor Agreement governs the overarching business relationship between the [appellant] and the [respondent]. <span class="font-italic">As a result, it confers rights on the </span><span class="font-italic">[respondent] which are wholly unrelated to its right to payment under an invoice which it issues to the [appellant] within that overarching business relationship.</span> These unrelated rights include, among others, a right to review the [appellant’s] records for compliance with the Distributor Agreement (cl 4); a right to require protection of its confidential information (cl 8); and a right to adjust prices or terminate the Distributor Agreement for non-payment by the plaintiff (cl 13). It cannot have been the parties’ intention that these rights should be assigned to the Factor together with the invoices. Those rights are relevant only to the [respondent] as against the [appellant], in their capacity as supplier and distributor respectively, within the framework of the Distributor Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">141 <span class="font-italic">The parties obviously continued to be parties to the arbitration agreement in cl 25.9 of the Distributor Agreement in relation to these unrelated substantive rights.

The question of whether the respondent possessed the right to arbitrate in relation to Debt B was, accordingly, a question relating to the scope of the arbitration agreement between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 We take a differing view. As stated above at [75], an arbitration agreement does not have a purpose or a life independent of the substantive obligations that it attaches to. The right to arbitrate cannot be seen in isolation – it must necessarily attach to a specific right. We are concerned with <span class="font-italic">the existence of one’s right to arbitrate</span> in relation to Debt B.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Having assigned the right to Debt B to the Factor, the right to arbitrate in relation to that debt would subsist between the appellant and the Factor. The respondent would not be considered as a proper party to the agreement to arbitrate disputes arising over Debt B. The fact that there remains unrelated substantive rights between the respondent and the appellant (such as the right to require protection of confidential information under cl 8) cannot affect the nature of the inquiry. The question remains whether the respondent, at the relevant time, was able to commence arbitration in relation to Debt B pursuant to a valid arbitration agreement with the appellant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 This question is properly considered under the ground of Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i), which concerns the existence and validity of any alleged arbitration agreement.

It states that a court may refuse enforcement of a foreign award if the court is satisfied that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">the arbitration agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, in the absence of any indication in that respect, under the law of the country where the award was made; …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The learned judge held, at [63], that in order for s 31(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) to be satisfied, she would have had to be satisfied that “the arbitration agreement was invalid <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> [the second defendant] and that <span class="font-italic">the Arbitrator was not entitled to find that [the second defendant] was a party to the Agreement and the arbitration</span>” [emphasis added]. The question of whether one was a proper party to an arbitration agreement was not to be considered under s 31(2)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) (which instead concerns the scope of an arbitration agreement). Prakash J’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Aloe Vera</span> was subsequently cited and considered by this court in <span class="font-italic">Astro</span> ([79] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [153] – we had affirmed her views on the inapplicability of Art V(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the New York Convention to issues relating to the existence of an arbitration agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 We went on to state, in <span class="font-italic">Astro</span>, our views on the applicability of Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) to issues concerning the existence of the arbitration agreement, despite its wording possibly suggesting otherwise:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">156 That said, there is no doubt some difficulty with the express language of [Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i)]. As Lord Collins JSC in [<span class="font-italic">Dallah</span><span class="font-italic"> Real Estate and Tourism Holding Co v Ministry of Religious Affairs of the Government of Pakistan</span> [2011] 1 AC 763] observed at [77], the words used in the first ground suggest that its purpose is limited to issues of validity of an arbitration agreement which at least once existed (in addition to any issue of capacity which is not relevant for present purposes). Nevertheless, in our view, the question of the existence of an arbitration agreement can be subsumed within the issue of the validity of an arbitration agreement. In addition to Lord Collins JSC’s observations (at [77]) that this interpretation of the first ground is ‘consistent international practice’, we would add some further observations.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">157 The existence or, more accurately, <span class="font-italic">formation</span> of a contract has not always been considered as part of the basket of issues concerned with the material <span class="font-italic">validity</span> of a contract. This is not unexpected as the notion of validity of a contract might be conditioned on the supposition of a contract which at least once existed. However, as the development of the law in the area of the conflict of laws has shown, this fine divide can be bridged … In the latest edition of the same treatise, now known as <span class="font-italic">Dicey, Morris &amp; Collins on The Conflict of Laws</span> vol 2 (Lord Collins gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 15th Ed, 2012) at para 32-107, r 225 which prescribes the choice of law rule for material validity of a contract is introduced as such:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This Rule is based on Art. 10 of the [Rome I] Regulation, which is headed ‘consent and material validity.’ … <span class="font-italic">The reference in Art. 10(1) to existence and validity thus includes such matters as formation</span> (including the effect of silence), absence of consideration, fraud, duress, mistake, and also the legality of a contract.

While there was initially some confusion during the hearing as to whether the 2017 letter by the Factor constituted notice of an assignment that took place in 2015 (via the Buy Back Agreement), or whether the letter itself effected a reassignment in 2017, the respondent eventually accepted that, assuming that the Buy Back Agreement in 2015 did not reassign the right to arbitrate back to the respondent, that right would only have been reassigned in 2017.

This was despite the fact that there was no reference or use of the terms “assignment”, “reassignment” or “buy back” in the Buy Back Agreement itself.

The Judge proceeded to state at [155] of the Judgment:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Instead, cl 4.3.1 on its face provides that the [respondent’s] repurchase obligation arises only in the two specific situations set out in the clause: (a) if the cause of non-payment is a breach of the [respondent’s] representations and warranties; and (b) if the distributor disputes the debt and fails to pay it within 180 days. There is no suggestion by the [respondent] that it repurchased the debt under the Buy Back Agreement because either situation (a) or (b) had arisen. To that extent, the repurchase in this case was voluntary rather than obligatory. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 We agree – cll 4.3.1 and 4.3.3 are inapplicable to the present circumstances and do not assist the respondent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 We note, however, that while the Judge disagreed with the respondent’s use of the Participation Agreement to support its case, he nevertheless found that the Buy Back Agreement did reassign the right to Debt B to the respondent. The Judge applied the contextual approach to contractual interpretation, finding that there was evidence that by the end of 2014, “the Factor was trying to withdraw entirely from operations in Russia”. He held at [157] that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Although the Buy Back Agreement was entered into voluntarily rather than pursuant to an obligation under cl 4.3.1 of the Participation Agreement, the Factor’s decision to terminate its Russian business indicates to me an intention to sever entirely any legal link between the Factor and the defendant’s distributors. <span class="font-italic">That could be achieved only by a repurchase of the debt in the true sense of the word, </span><span class="font-italic">ie a legal assignment of the debt under which the Factor drops out completely</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another appeal</span> [2013] 4 SLR 193 (“<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span>”), we explained the applicability and utility of the contextual approach of interpretation in allowing the court to ascertain the parties’ objective intentions. We stated at [71]–[72]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">71 In our judgment, <span class="font-italic">courts must achieve</span><span class="font-italic"> justice and fairness by protecting the individual against an unduly strict construction of a document that does not fairly represent the intentions of the parties</span>. However, this worthwhile objective can be perverted if the proverbial grain is not separated from the chaff. As Spigelman CJ has cautioned in another article, “Extrinsic Material and the Interpretation of Insurance Contracts” (2011) 22 Insurance Law Journal 143 at 145, the greater the scope of materials relevant to an issue of construction that can be taken into account, the greater the scope for differences between legal advisors charged with the task of construing a contract when a dispute is looming. This, in turn, causes greater uncertainty for the parties and increases the time and cost of legal proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">72 From this perspective, a robust approach unaccompanied by sufficient safeguards may be counterproductive. More fog, not less, might ensure. In our judgment, it is time to refine our approach by synchronising our rules of pleading and evidence with the contextual approach to contractual construction laid down in <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span> ([34] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). This is necessary because the broad language associated with the contextual approach is susceptible to being misunderstood and misapplied. <span class="font-italic">The utility of the contextual approach is to place the court in the best possible position to ascertain the parties’ objective intentions by interpreting the express</span><span class="font-italic">ions used by the parties in the relevant instrument in their proper context</span>; it is not a license to admit all manner of extrinsic evidence …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The court is ultimately concerned with the parties’ objective intentions. While the court will not adopt an unduly strict construction of a document that does not fairly represent the intentions of the parties, the primary use of the contextual approach is to ascertain the parties’ objective intentions by “interpreting the expressions used by the parties in the relevant instrument in their proper context”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 However, the Judge did not actually interpret <span class="font-italic">the</span><span class="font-italic"> wording</span> of the Buy Back Agreement in reaching his decision. Instead, he took an overly broad brush approach – excessive weight was placed on the extrinsic evidence of the Factor’s planned exit from Russia without regard for the plain text of the Buy Back Agreement itself. As stated above at [94] and [97], there was no mention of any terms relating to “assignment”, “reassignment”, or “buy back” in the Buy Back Agreement. Instead, the Buy Back Agreement was squarely focused on the With Recourse obligations that were owed to the Factor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 In such a situation, it would be inappropriate to wholly disregard the terms of the parties’ contractual agreement in favour of an independent finding of intention. Extrinsic evidence ought to guide the court’s interpretation of the terms contained in an agreement – it cannot take on a life of its own and overshadow the written contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 We are thus of the view that the Buy Back Agreement did not reassign the rights to Debt B to the respondent. As Mr Toh acknowledged during the hearing, the right to Debt B was instead reassigned to the respondent in <span class="font-italic">April</span><span class="font-italic"> 2017</span>, via the 2017 letter, which confirmed that “any rights which [the Factor] may have under the Distributor Agreement between [the respondent] and [the appellant] dated 24 December 2010 and any further rights which it may have had to collect payment from [the appellant] in respect of invoices for [the respondent’s products] have been assigned to [the respondent]”.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Respondent’s Further Submissions at para 39.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 At the conclusion of the hearing, we directed the parties to file further submissions on the applicability of <span class="font-italic">Jarguh</span><span class="font-italic"> Sawit</span> to the present case, taking into account the fact that an arbitrator’s jurisdiction is rooted in the parties’ consent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Before delving into our discussion on the state of the law on this issue, we pause to note that while the case of <span class="font-italic">Jarguh</span><span class="font-italic"> Sawit</span> was raised before the Judge, the specific nuances of how the principle laid down by this court in <span class="font-italic">Jarguh</span><span class="font-italic"> Sawit</span> might not be applicable in the context of arbitration was not raised before him. To put it another way, the Judge was not asked to consider whether the consensual nature of arbitration would affect the principle that <span class="font-italic">Jarguh</span><span class="font-italic"> Sawit</span> purportedly stands for – that there can be a retrospective vesting of a cause of action in an assignee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 In <span class="font-italic">Jarguh</span><span class="font-italic"> Sawit</span>, the respondent, Navigation Maritime Bulgare (“NMB”) had agreed to sell to Oxford Jay International Pte Ltd (“OJI”) a vessel (“the vessel”). The vessel was to be sold fully as a Lloyd’s Register Class vessel. However, NMB failed to deliver the vessel as required – it had not been upgraded to comply with Lloyd’s classification requirements. It subsequently agreed to modify the vessel to reclass it, with the costs of this modification being shared in agreed proportions. A dispute subsequently arose between NMB and OJI over OJI’s purported failure to pay an instalment that was due. As NMB and OJI were unable to reach a compromise, NMB commenced legal action against OJI and arrested the vessel. By this time, ownership of the vessel had been transferred to the appellant – Jaguh Harimau Sdn Bhd. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 In the course of court proceedings, the appellant filed a defence and counterclaim alleging, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that the court did not have jurisdiction as NMB did not have an admiralty <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> or <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">personam</span> claim against the appellants. NMB applied for, and obtained before an assistant registrar, summary judgment and an order striking out the paragraphs alleging lack of jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Subsequent to the assistant registrar’s orders, OJI assigned all its rights, title and interest under the memorandum of agreement to the appellant by a deed of assignment. The appellant then appealed to the High Court to amend their counterclaim – their original counterclaim was confined to a claim for damages for wrongful arrest of their vessel, but they wanted to include an additional claim against NMB for its failure to deliver a fully classed Lloyd’s vessel. The High Court judge made a number of orders, including a dismissal of the appellant’s application to amend its counterclaim. He did so on the basis that the causes of action sought to be introduced arose after the filing date of the counterclaim. The appellant then appealed against the High Court judge’s orders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 This court in <span class="font-italic">Jarguh</span><span class="font-italic"> Sawit</span> found that the High Court judge had erred in his dismissal of the appellant’s application to amend their counterclaim. This court held at [62] that since OJI’s claim for damages against NMB was already accrued at the date of the writ, it did not matter that the cause of action was only vested in the appellant subsequent to that date. This was because the vesting of OJI’s rights would have retrospective effect. As stated in <span class="font-italic">Jarguh</span><span class="font-italic"> Sawit</span> at [63]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]his vesting has retrospective effect: see <span class="font-italic">Read v Brown</span> (1888) 22 QBD 128. Thus, the 1997 White Book [<span class="font-italic">The Supreme Court Practice</span>] states, at para 20/5–8/16 that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">An assignment whether legal or equitable, of a subsisting and viable claim against the defendant or what is sometimes called ‘a right of subrogation’ is not in itself, and does not create a cause of action against the debtor and therefore the plaintiffs would be allowed to re-amend their writ and statement of claim so as to include a claim by them as legal or equitable assignees of the various rights of cargo owners in respect of lost cargo and to join the assignors if necessary, since such a claim did not assert retrospectively a new or different cause of action, although such amendments are made after the expiry of the current period of limitation, since the action was brought within such period (<span class="font-italic">Central Insurance Co Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Seacalf Shipping Corp</span> [1983] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 25, CA).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The cases of <span class="font-italic">Read v Brown</span> (1888) 22 QBD 128 (“<span class="font-italic">Read v Brown</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Central Insurance Co Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Seacalf Shipping Corp </span>[1983] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 25, CA (“<span class="font-italic">Central Insurance</span>”) were thus crucial to the court’s decision. In our view, both of these decisions do not actually establish that an assignment can retrospectively vest rights in the assignee. We begin with the decision of <span class="font-italic">Central Insurance</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 <span class="font-italic">Central Insurance</span> has to be seen in its context, namely a situation of subrogation. The appellant, Central Insurance, was an insurer. It became subrogated to the rights of 28 Taiwanese buyers when the latter purchased 30 policies of insurance covering quantities of soya-bean meal which had been consigned to the buyers. In its statement of claim, the appellant stated that it had become subrogated to the rights and entitlements of the buyers against the respondent, and pleaded that it had suffered damage as a result of the respondent’s failure to deliver. The appellant, however, did not add the buyers as plaintiffs at the outset. More than a year later, the appellant sought to amend its statement of claim to add the buyers as plaintiffs, and to add: first, a claim by it as an assignee of the rights of the cargo owners; and second, claims for damages in the alternative by the buyers. The respondent argued that such an amendment would be time barred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Oliver LJ framed the critical question before him in the following terms: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [D]oes the pleading of a title by assignment, whether or not accompanied by the joinder of the assignors, <span class="font-italic">constitute the assertion, retrospectively, of some new or different cause of action</span> which, were it not contained in a writ issued prior to the expiry of the limitation period, would otherwise be barred? [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In deciding to allow the amendment, Oliver LJ stated that subrogation “is not itself and does not create a cause of action against the debtor”, and does not alter the nature of the claim made against the defendant. There “could not be any doubt at all about what the claim was that was being asserted” – it was a claim for short delivery of cargo, full particulars of which had already been delivered and referred to in the indorsement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 It is hence clear that the focus of the English Court of Appeal was placed on the nature of subrogation, rather than whether a free-standing principle of retrospective vesting applied in the context of assignments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The decision of <span class="font-italic">Read v Brown</span> ([117] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) is also of limited assistance as the court was unconcerned as to whether an assignment had retrospective effect. Rather, it was focused on the significance of an assignment in determining a plaintiff’s cause of action. The plaintiff had brought an action as an assignee of a debt alleged to be due in respect of the price of goods sold and delivered to the defendant by the assignor. The sale and delivery of the goods had taken place in Surrey, but the assignment of the debt took place in the City of London, which was within the jurisdiction of the Mayor’s Court. The defendant took the position that the plaintiff was prohibited from bringing an action in the Mayor’s Court as the “mere fact” that the assignment took place within the jurisdiction of the Mayor’s Court was insufficient.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 The Court considered, at 131, that the question before the court was “whether any part of the cause of action arose in the City [of London]”. This required the Court to analyse the nature of an assignment. It stated at 132 that upon assignment:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The debt is transferred to the assignee and becomes as though it had been his from the beginning; it is no longer to be the debt of the assignor at all, who cannot sue for it, the right to sue being taken from him; the assignee becomes the assignee of a legal debt and is not merely an assignee in equity, and the debt being his, he can sue for it, and sue in his own name … he must, if suing, prove the assignment to himself in order to recover judgment, and <span class="font-italic">the fact of the assignment is therefore part of his cause of action. In the present case part of the cause of</span><span class="font-italic"> action has arisen in the City</span> … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The fact that the assignment took place in the City of London was sufficient for the Mayor’s Court to exercise its jurisdiction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 The respondent, in its further submissions,

</div>
</div> sought to highlight that the Court in <span class="font-italic">Read v Brown</span> had stated that the debt “is transferred to the assignee and becomes as though it had been his from the beginning”. On the respondent’s case, this demonstrates a clear affirmation of the retrospective vesting effect of assignments. We disagree. The Court’s statement has to be seen in context – the statement that the debt “becomes as though it had been [the assignee’s] from the beginning” was made to emphasise that an assignor would no longer possess a cause of action against the debtor. In fact, as seen above at [123], the issue of retrospective vesting was not before the Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Irrespective of our views as to the significance of <span class="font-italic">Central Insurance</span> and <span class="font-italic">Read v Brown</span> on the principle of retrospective vesting for an assignment, such a principle should not, in any event, apply in the present case as it concerns arbitration proceedings, as opposed to court proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Litigation and arbitration are founded on fundamentally different bases. As noted by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">JVL </span><span class="font-italic">Agro Industries Ltd v Agritrade International Pte Ltd</span> [2016] 4 SLR 768 at [174], “[u]nlike litigation, which is founded on the State’s coercive power, arbitration is founded entirely upon the parties’ consent”. The differences between litigation and arbitration were further highlighted in Gary Born, <span class="font-italic">International Commercial Arbitration</span>, vol I (Wolters Kluwer, 2nd Ed, 2014) at p 256: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Simply put, absent an “agreement” to arbitrate, there is, by definition, obviously no “arbitration agreement”. Thus, although it is tautological, consensual arbitration is most obviously <span class="font-italic">not</span> national court litigation pursuant to mandatory jurisdictional rules. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 In the Singapore context, the High Court derives its powers from s 16 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“the SCJA”), which provides for the general civil jurisdiction of the courts. It states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16.–(1) The High Court shall have jurisdiction to hear and try any action in personam where — </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the defendant is served with a writ of summons or any other originating process — </div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) in Singapore in the manner prescribed by Rules of Court or Family Justice Rules; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) outside Singapore in the circumstances authorised by and in the manner prescribed by Rules of Court or Family Justice Rules; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the defendant submits to the jurisdiction of the High Court.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), the High Court shall have such jurisdiction as is vested in it by any other written law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 While s 16 of the SCJA does provide for the court’s jurisdiction where a defendant submits to jurisdiction, it is clear that the court’s power is not limited to such a circumstance. The court may possess and exercise jurisdiction over parties, whether willing or unwilling, as long as the requirements of s 16 are met.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 It is also clear that O 20 r 5 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) confers upon the court a general power to allow or order amendments to be made to pleadings (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 20</span><span class="font-italic">20</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>vol I (Chua Lee Ming gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2020) at para 20/8/2). In fact, <span class="font-italic">Jarguh</span><span class="font-italic"> Sawit</span> ([110] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) should be seen as a case that was decided in the context of Singapore procedural laws. As this court noted there at [57]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">At the heart of this issue is the question under what circumstances the court will grant leave to amend pleadings in a manner so as to introduce a new cause of action into the proceedings. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 It is clear that the procedural laws of a state do not apply to an arbitration simply because that state is the arbitral seat (see Gary Born, <span class="font-italic">International Commercial Arbitration</span>, vol II (Wolters Kluwer, 2nd Ed, 2014) at p 1623).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 There is good reason for this especially considering the distinct principles governing the court and the arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction. In <span class="font-italic">Kenya Railways v Antares Pte Ltd</span> <span class="font-italic">(“The Antares”) (Nos 1 and 2)</span> [1987] 1 Lloyd’s Law Rep 424 (“<span class="font-italic">Kenya</span>”), the English Court of Appeal considered the applicability of s 35(1) of the Limitation Act 1980 (c 58) (UK) (“UK Limitation Act”) to arbitral proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 In <span class="font-italic">Kenya</span>, MSC chartered the vessel <span class="font-italic">Antares </span>for the shipping of cargo. When damage to the cargo on board was discovered, the cargo owners, Kenya Railways, commenced arbitral proceedings against MSC in London, on the assumption that MSC were the owners of the vessel. Sometime later, MSC informed Kenya Railways of the true state of affairs, and Kenya Railways then put forward a claim against the true owners, who took the view that the claim was time barred. As s 35(1) of the UK Limitation Act allowed for any new claim made in the course of any action to be deemed as being made on the same date as the original action, Kenya Railways argued that it ought to be able to substitute a new party to an existing arbitration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 In holding that s 35(1) was inapplicable, the English Court of Appeal emphasised that allowing such a substitution would undermine the consensual basis of arbitration. Lloyd LJ stated at 432:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… I have great difficulty in seeing how s. 35 could ever apply to arbitrations. Arbitration is a consensual method of settling disputes. The arbitrator has no jurisdiction save what he derives from the contract between the parties. Section 35 covers the addition or substitution of new parties as well as the addition or substitution of new causes of action. <span class="font-italic">As for new parties, it would be contrary to the whole consensual basis of arbitration if the Court were to have power to ad</span><span class="font-italic">d or substitute a new party to an existing arbitration. I have equal difficulty in seeing how the Court could order the addition or substitution of a new cause of action, for the arbitrator’s jurisdiction is confined to the dispute or disputes which have been referred to him. </span>He has no jurisdiction to decide disputes which have not been referred to him even though they may arise out of the same facts or substantially the same facts … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 As alluded to by the English Court of Appeal, an arbitral tribunal would not possess such a free-standing power to allow for the addition of new causes of action that are independent from the parties’ arbitration agreement. The importance of the parties’ consent is such that the tribunal’s jurisdiction in respect of each cause of action should be jealously scrutinised by the tribunal – the tribunal has to satisfy itself that it possesses jurisdiction (based on party consent) in relation to each issue that is submitted for adjudication. The existence of an arbitration agreement between the parties cannot be taken to automatically confer jurisdiction on the arbitrator in respect of all causes of action that arise between them – the scope and content of the parties’ agreement must be taken into consideration. As noted in Andrea Marco Steingruber, <span class="font-italic">Consent in International Arbitration</span> (Loukas Mistelis ed) (Oxford University Press, 2012) at para 1.05:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The principal characteristic of arbitration is that it is chosen by the parties by concluding an agreement to arbitrate. <span class="font-italic">The arbitration agreement is considered the foundation stone of international (commercial) arbitration, as it records the mutual consent of the parties to submit to arbitration </span>– mutual consent which is indispensable to any process of dispute resolution outside national courts. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 The issue of party consent is also closely tied to the importance of ensuring that the proper parties are involved at the onset of arbitral proceedings. The decision of <span class="font-italic">Internaut Shipping GmbH and </span><span class="font-italic">another v Fercometal SARL (The “Elikon”)</span> [2003] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 430 (“<span class="font-italic">Internaut</span>”) amply demonstrates this point. In <span class="font-italic">Internaut</span>, there was a voyage charterparty between Fercometal as the charterer and Sphinx as the owner. Internaut Shipping had signed the charter-party under the heading “Owners” without qualification. It then started arbitral proceedings against Fercometal for a demurrage claim, but the points of claim as subsequently served by its lawyers were in the name of Sphinx. The arbitration was conducted in the name of Sphinx, with an interim award made in favour of Sphinx. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 A key question that the English Court of Appeal had to consider was whether the arbitral tribunal had the power to substitute Internaut Shipping for Sphinx, and whether the references to Sphinx were a mere misnomer. The Court of Appeal decided in the negative, stating at [87]–[88]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">87. In these circumstances, it seems to me that there are the <span class="font-italic">following theoretically possible alternative analyses of the situation</span>. (1) The arbitration started as one between Internaut and Fercometal, the naming of Sphinx was a mere misnomer, a mere case of falsa demonstratio, and can be cured, if the arbitrators see fit to do so, by a mere amendment of the title to the arbitration. That was the Judge’s solution. (2) The arbitration started as one between Internaut and Fercometal and, despite everything that has happened since, always remained (and still remains) an arbitration between Internaut and Fercometal. That is so, even though the naming of Sphinx was more than a mere misnomer. Despite that, the misnaming of Sphinx remains an incident of the arbitration which it is within the competence of the arbitrators to manage. … (3) The <span class="font-italic">arbitration started as one between Internaut and </span><span class="font-italic">Fercometal, but metamorphosed into one between Sphinx and Fercometal</span>. Such an arbitration is a <span class="font-italic">jurisdictional impossibility, either because the Court has now determined that the true owner under the charter-party is Internaut and not Sphinx or because in any event Ince &amp; Co were never instructed by Sphinx (albeit they now say that Sphinx has ratified an arbitration com</span><span class="font-italic">menced in its name), or for a combination of those reasons</span>. Since that is a matter going to jurisdiction, this Court is entitled to say, and should conclude, that the conduct of the arbitration in the name of Sphinx is a nullity. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">88. …[A]<span class="font-italic">lternative</span><span class="font-italic"> (3) is the correct one</span>. Once the decision has been taken that the identification (and acceptance) of Sphinx as the arbitrating party <span class="font-italic">goes beyond a case of mere misnomer</span>, then it seems to me that the <span class="font-italic">consequence must be that the further conduct of the arbitration in the name of a claimant who was never in truth a party to the charter-party or to the arbitration agreement was a nullity</span>, and it is for this Court to say so. <span class="font-italic">Sphinx therefore never had any possible role to play in the </span><span class="font-italic">arbitration, and cannot ratify what has been done in its name.</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 As the court held, it was irrelevant whether Sphinx wanted to ratify what had been done in its name. Given the misidentification of the parties at the outset of the arbitration, the entire set of arbitral proceedings were rendered a nullity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 Similarly, at the time the respondent in the present case commenced the arbitration in 2015, Debt B was still assigned to the Factor. There was thus only an agreement to arbitrate over disputes relating to Debt 1A. The respondent would not have been a proper party to any arbitration arising out of disputes over Debt B. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether notice ought to be given by an assignor or assignee</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 At this point, we pause to consider an ancillary matter: whether notice of assignment can effectively be given by a purported assignee instead of the assignor. While this was not a point expressly taken by the appellant (that notice was improperly given by the Parent Company instead of the respondent), Mr Toh did submit, as part of the respondent’s case that the Buy Back Agreement reassigned the right to arbitrate in relation to Debt B to the respondent, that valid notice of the assignment can be given by an assignee to the debtor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 We think that the question of whether notice ought to be given to the debtor by the assignor or the assignee is an issue of some significance, which deserves some ventilation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 We begin with the law on statutory assignment in Singapore. Section 4(8) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“CLA”) states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Any absolute assignment by writing under the hand of the assignor, not purporting to be by way of charge only, of any debt or other legal chose in action of which <span class="font-italic">express notice in writing has been given to the debtor, trustee or other person</span> from whom the assignor would have been entitled to receive or claim such debt or chose in action, shall be and be deemed to have been effectual in law, subject to all equities which would have been entitled to priority over the right of the assignee under the law … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 The wording of s 4(8) is substantially similar to s 136 of the Law of Property Act 1925 (c 20) (UK) (“the LPA”). Section 136 provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Any absolute assignment by writing under the hand of the assignor (not purporting to be by way of charge only) of any debt or other legal thing in action, of which <span class="font-italic">express notice in writing has been given to the debtor, trustee or other person</span> from whom the assignor would have been entitled to claim such debt or thing in action, is effectual in law (subject to equities having priority over the right of the assignee) to pass and transfer from the date of such notice … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 As can be seen above, while the CLA and LPA make clear that “express notice in writing” is a key requirement for a statutory assignment, neither statute provides guidance as to the party that ought to provide this notice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 Both Singapore and English case law suggest that valid notice may be provided by either the assignor or the assignee.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 In <span class="font-italic">Lanxess</span> ([46] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), Andrew Ang J (as he then was) stated at [25]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he requirement of notice does not oblige the assignor or assignee to follow a prescribed form or even make express, direct reference to the assignment. <span class="font-italic">All that the assignor or assignee must do under s 4(8) of the </span><span class="font-italic">[Civil Law] Act is to convey, in writing, information relative to the assignment that indicates to the debtor that by virtue of the assignment the assignee has the right to the benefit of the obligation in question</span> ... [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 A similar position was adopted by the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Bateman</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v Hunt</span> <span class="font-italic">and others </span>[1904] 2 KB 530, where the defendant took issue with the fact that the plaintiffs (the assignees) had given notice of the assignment. The applicable provision at the time was s 25(6) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 (36 &amp; 37 Vict, c 66) (UK) – it served as the predecessor provision to s 136 of the LPA. After reviewing the wording of s 25(6), which required “express notice in writing” to be given to the debtor, the English Court of Appeal held that the assignees were entitled to give the requisite notice. It stated at 538:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In order that this title should become effectual at law as well as in equity, all that the statute requires is that ‘express notice in writing’ should be given to the debtor, and such notice was given by the plaintiffs before action brought. The statute prescribes no limit of time within which notice must be given, <span class="font-italic">nor does it lay down that the notice must be given by any </span><span class="font-italic">particular person; and we can see no good ground for holding that the notice given by the plaintiffs was ineffectual</span>. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 The learned authors of <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> (John McGhee gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 33rd Ed, 2015) concur with this view, affirming at para 3-008 that “the section does not state by whom or at what time [notice] must be given”. Subsequent decisions such as <span class="font-italic">James</span><span class="font-italic"> Talcott Ltd v John Lewis &amp; Co Ltd and North American Dress Co Ltd</span> [1940] 3 All ER 592 and <span class="font-italic">Holt v </span><span class="font-italic">Heatherfield Trust Ltd and another</span> [1942] 2 KB 1 have also affirmed the ability of an assignee to provide valid notice of the assignment to the debtor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 It is thus clear that under s 4(8) of the CLA, notice can be given by either an assignor or an assignee. However, when notice is given by an assignee, the debtor faces the risk that the notice is false – a debtor may, in reliance of a false notice, make payment to a false assignee who is unable to give the debtor a good discharge of the debt. It is therefore open and undoubtedly advisable for the debtor to verify the fact of the assignment with the assignor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 A debtor would possess the right to request for evidence of the assignment when faced with a notice from a purported assignee. We agree with the statement of Lord Denning MR in <span class="font-italic">Van Lynn Developments Ltd v Pelias Construction Co Ltd</span> <span class="font-italic">(formerly Jason Construction Co Ltd)</span> [1969] 1 QB 607 at 613, that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… After receiving the notice, the debtor will be entitled, of course, to require a sight of the assignment so as to be satisfied that it is valid, and that the assignee can give him a good discharge. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This is crucial, in order that the rights of the debtor be protected. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 Multiple international instruments reflect this same concern. Article 9.1.12(1) of the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts 2016 provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If notice of the assignment is given by the assignee, the obligor may request the assignee to provide within a reasonable time adequate proof that the assignment has been made. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Similarly, Article 11.303(2) of the Principles of European Contract Law 2002 allows for a debtor to, “within a reasonable time request the assignee to provide reliable evidence of the assignment, pending which the debtor may withhold performance.” Finally, the Draft Common Frame of Reference: Principles, Definitions and Model Rules of European Private Law 2009 at III-5:120 allows for a debtor who has received a notice of assignment from the assignee, but not from the assignor, to request the assignee “to provide reliable evidence of the assignment”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 We thus affirm the right of a debtor to verify the fact of assignment prior to making payment to a purported assignee. This, we should add, is a risk management issue and does not mandate that notice must be provided by the assignor instead of the assignee.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether Debt 2B was novated to the Russian Corporation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 Given our finding that the arbitral tribunal acted beyond its jurisdiction when determining issues in relation to Debt B, the portion of the award dealing with Debt 2B would thus be set aside. Nevertheless, for completeness, we turn to address the appellant’s final argument. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 The appellant takes the position that the arbitral tribunal lacked jurisdiction over the parties’ dispute because: first, claims in relation to Debt 2B ought to have been brought against the Russian Corporation (rather than the appellant);

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 A review of the Debt Transfer Agreement, the Open Debt Agreement and the Gold Plan Agreement is in order.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The legal effect of the Debt Transfer Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 In order to address the appellant’s contention that the proper parties in relation to Debt 2B was the Parent Company and the Russian Corporation, we will analyse the wording and effect of the relevant clauses (cll 3 and 4) of the Debt Transfer Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 Clause 3 provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3. [The respondent] hereby consents to the assignment and transfer of all such obligations of [the appellant] in and under the [Distributor] Agreement to [the Russian Corporation] and agrees that [the appellant] <span class="font-italic">shall be released and discharged from all duties and obligations </span>in and under the [Distributor] Agreement related to payment to [the respondent] of the Open Debt <span class="font-italic">on the date when [the respondent] gets full amount of the Open Debt</span> to [the respondent’s] bank account as stipulated in section 2 above. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 Clause 4 states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4. [The appellant], [the Russian Corporation] and [the respondent] hereby agree that this Debt Transfer Agreement shall constitute a novation of the rights, duties and obligations of [the appellant] in and under the [Distributor] Agreement and accordingly, <span class="font-italic">all such rights, duties and obligations </span>of [the appellant] <span class="font-italic">shall be extinguished and of no force or effect on and after the Effective Date</span>. [The respondent] acknowledges and agrees that on and after the Effective Date [the Russian Corporation] shall be [the appellant’s] successor in duties and obligations related to payment to [the respondent] of the Open Debt in and under the [Distributor] Agreement. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 At first blush, cll 3 and 4 appear inconsistent. While cl 3 purported to release the appellant from its obligations under the Distributor Agreement only when the respondent received the “full amount of the Open Debt”, cl 4 appeared to allow for an immediate extinction of the appellant's obligations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 We however agree with the Judge below that the two clauses can and should be read harmoniously. As he held at [211] of the Judgment, cl 4 should be read to mean that the appellant’s obligation to pay the Open Debt is extinguished with immediate effect and transferred to the Russian Corporation <span class="font-italic">until the time stipulated for the Russian Corporation to pay the Open Debt</span><span class="font-italic"> under cl 2 of the Debt Transfer Agreement expires</span>. This obligation would then revive if the Russian Corporation fails to make full payment to the respondent in discharge of the Open Debt. Such an approach is infinitely preferable to disregarding one of the clauses altogether and rendering it otiose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 Clause 7 of the Open Debt Agreement should also be highlighted. It states as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7) In case [the Russian Corporation] fails to pay the amount of Open Debt, then [the appellant] agrees to pay [the Factor] immediately upon [the Factor’s] instruction to [the appellant].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 To our minds, the presence of cl 7 of the Open Debt Agreement, which is consistent with our interpretation of cll 3 and 4, further reinforces our view that the appellant would not be automatically let off the hook upon the conclusion of the Debt Transfer Agreement. Although there is a slight difference between cl 7 of the Open Debt Agreement and cl 3 of the Debt Transfer Agreement, in that the former relates to the Russian Corporation (or the appellant) paying the Factor as a result of the Factor’s purchase of the Open Debt from the respondent, this does not detract from the obligation in both provisions being on either the Russian Corporation or the appellant to pay the Open Debt. We thus affirm the Judge’s reading of the Debt Transfer Agreement – the appellant remained the proper party to Debt 2B, given that the Russian Corporation failed to fully discharge the Open Debt.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable dispute resolution clause for Debt 2B</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 The appellant argues that any reassignment of the Factor’s rights of action to the respondent would be of rights under the Open Debt Agreement, which arguably incorporates the dispute resolution provision under the Schedule to the Gold Plan Agreement (“the Gold Plan dispute resolution clause”), which provided for arbitration to be held in Vienna, Austria.

</div> Thus, the dispute resolution provisions under the Distributor Agreement, which provided for SIAC arbitration, would be inapplicable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 We were not convinced by this argument. The Gold Plan dispute resolution clause was never meant to apply to invoices issued by the respondent. This is made clear from its wording, which states, at the “GOVERNING LAW” section:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… All disputes under this Agreement in relation to a Supplier Invoice issued by [the Parent Company] or related to its violation, termination or nullity shall be finally settled under Rules of Arbitration and Conciliation of the Federal Economic Chamber in Vienna (Vienna Rules) by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with these rules. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 In addition, the respondent was, at all material times, not a party to the Gold Plan Agreement.

<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Steven Chong JA):</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Outcome: CA allows appeal in respect of Debts 1B and 2B, and the arbitral award is thus set aside in part under Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(i) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (“the Model Law”). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: black; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Pertinent and significant points of the judgment</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">A dispute relating to the right of suit following an assignment of the underlying agreement pertains to the existence, rather than the scope, of an arbitration agreement.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">A notice of assignment can be validly sent by either the assignor or the assignee.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Unlike litigation, which is founded on the State’s coercive power, arbitration is founded entirely upon the parties’ consent.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">An arbitrator would not have jurisdiction over a dispute if the claimant only obtained the right of suit after the commencement of the arbitration. </span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Introduction</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">1<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The respondent, BXI, developed and manufactured consumer goods. The appellant, BXH, distributed the respondent’s goods in Russia. The respondent was a wholly-owned subsidiary of a Singapore company (“the Parent Company”). The relationship between the appellant and the respondent had to be seen in light of eight related contracts, all of which involved at least one of the parties. These were the Distributor Agreement, the Transition Agreement, the Assignment and Novation Agreement, the Participation Agreement, the Gold Plan Agreement, the Debt Transfer Agreement, the Open Debt Agreement, and the Buy Back Agreement. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">2<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The Distributor Agreement contained an arbitration agreement (cl 25.9) between the parties. While the appellant had originally been dealing with the Parent Company, the latter’s rights and obligations were transferred to the respondent through the Assignment and Novation Agreement. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">3<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The debts that the appellant owed were classified into three categories: Debt 1A, Debt 1B and Debt 2B. Debts 1B and 2B (collectively “Debt B”), were assigned by the respondent to a third party (“the Factor”) through the Participation Agreement. They were, however, purportedly re-assigned back to the respondent through the Buy Back Agreement in April 2015 and a second buy back in December 2015.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Background to the appeal</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">4<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>In October 2015, the respondent issued a notice of arbitration to the appellant, seeking payment for Debts 1A and B. The appellant served a response to the notice of arbitration resisting the claim on various grounds, including that the tribunal appointed by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) did not have jurisdiction to hear the dispute. The appellant refused to nominate its arbitrator within the thirty-day period stipulated in the Distributor Agreement, but continued to mount challenges to the tribunal’s jurisdiction and purported lack of independence. The SIAC dismissed the appellant’s challenge on 4 May 2017. The tribunal issued its award on 28 July 2017, finding in favour of the respondent. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">5<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The High Court Judge (“the Judge”) found that the tribunal did possess jurisdiction over the parties’ dispute. The Judge also held that the arbitration agreement contained in the Distributor Agreement governed the parties’ dispute, and that the right to arbitrate in relation to Debt B had indeed been re-assigned to the respondent via the Buy Back Agreement. Although the right of suit for several debts were only re-assigned in December 2015, these rights were retrospectively vested in the respondent, such that the tribunal possessed the jurisdiction to adjudicate over the parties’ dispute. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The decision on appeal</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">6<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The Court of Appeal held that cl 25.9 of the Distributor Agreement, which contained the parties’ agreement to arbitrate, ought to be given effect. Although another clause, cl 25.8, appeared to suggest that disputes between the parties ought instead to be litigated in a Singapore court, the parties had demonstrated a real intention to have matters resolved by arbitration. In such a situation, a generous and harmonious interpretation ought to be given to purportedly conflicting clauses, such as to give effect to the parties’ true intention: at [60].  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">7<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The appellant argued that the right to arbitrate under the Distributor Agreement remained with the Parent Company as valid notice, which was required under cl 1 of the Assignment and Novation Agreement, had not been given. An email sent to the appellant prior to the execution of the Assignment and Novation Agreement could not suffice. The Court of Appeal disagreed with the appellant’s contention, as nothing on the plain wording of cl 1 suggested that notification would only be effective after a certain date or event. Valid notice could indeed have been given prior to the parties entering into the Assignment and Novation Agreement: at [63]–[69].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">8<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The Court of Appeal found that, as an arbitration agreement does not have a purpose or a life independent of the substantive obligations that it attaches to, the assignment of a debt from one party to another also results in an assignment of the right to arbitrate a dispute in relation to that debt: at [75]. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">9<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The right to arbitrate in relation to Debt B, which had been assigned from the respondent to the Factor, relates to the ground of setting aside under Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(i) of the Model Law, which concerned the <em>existence</em> of an arbitration agreement (or lack thereof) and not the <em>scope</em> of an agreement under Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iii). The question remains whether the respondent was, at the relevant time, able to commence arbitration in relation to Debt B pursuant to a valid arbitration agreement with the appellant: at [83]–[84].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">10<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The Court of Appeal held that the Buy Back Agreement in 2015 did not have the effect of reassigning Debt B back to the respondent. Instead, the Buy Back Agreement was primarily concerned with the discharge of certain “with recourse” obligations that the respondent owed to the Factor. This was consistent with the actions taken by the Factor in continuing to issue monthly statements of its accounts to the appellant, and the lack of reference or use of the terms “assignment”, “reassignment” or “buy back” in the Buy Back Agreement itself. Instead, Debt B was only reassigned in 2017, when the Factor sent a letter to the appellant confirming the fact of reassignment: at [95], [97] and [109].</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">11<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The Court of Appeal held that the sources relied on by the court in <em>The “Jarguh Sawit”</em> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 829 (“<em>Jarguh Sawit</em>”) did not stand for the proposition that an assignment can retrospectively vest rights in the assignee (“the retrospective vesting principle”): at [117]. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">12<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>In any case, the principles laid down in <em>Jarguh Sawit</em> were not applicable in the present context, which concerned arbitration proceedings. While litigation is founded on the State’s coercive power, arbitration is founded entirely upon the parties’ consent. At the relevant time, there was only an agreement between the parties to arbitrate over disputes relating to Debt 1A. The retrospective vesting principle could not apply to confer jurisdiction on the tribunal to adjudicate over Debt B when the parties had not consented for such a dispute to be referred at the time when the arbitration was commenced: at [125]–[126] and [138].  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">13<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>Notice of assignment may be provided by either the assignor or the assignee. A debtor would however possess the right to request for evidence of the assignment when faced with a notice from a purported assignee: at [144] and [149].       </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">14<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The Debt Transfer Agreement did not release the appellant from its obligation to pay the Open Debt. Properly construed, the appellant’s obligation to pay the Open Debt was extinguished with immediate effect and transferred to the Russian Corporation until the time stipulated for the Russian Corporation to pay the Open Debt. The appellant’s obligation would revive if the Russian Corporation failed to make full payment to the respondent in discharge of the Open Debt: at [159]–[160].         </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">15<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>The appellant argued that any reassignment of the Factor’s rights to Debt 2B would be of rights under the Open Debt Agreement, which arguably incorporates the dispute resolution provision under the Schedule to the Gold Plan Agreement (“the Gold Plan dispute resolution clause”). The Court of Appeal disagreed as the Gold Plan dispute resolution clause was never meant to apply to invoices issued by the respondent: at [162]–[164].</span></p>
