Why he made these references was disputed by the parties: the Prosecution argued that this showed the Accused’s knowledge that he was carrying controlled drugs, while the Defence contended that the reference was made because the officers from Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) opened some of the Bundles and informed the Accused that they contained drugs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Accused’s version of the facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The Accused denied knowing, at the material time of the offence, that the Bundles were controlled drugs.

When asked to repay the loan by Aya, the Accused initially sought to repay it by way of deductions from his salary. However as Aya did not agree to this, the Accused agreed to deliver “tembakau” (which the Accused understood as tobacco)

</div> There were also other suspicious circumstances suggesting that this was not an ordinary delivery. There was a short notice for the delivery despite there being no reason for any urgency; a Car was rented, the windows of the Car were tinted, and the Bundles were concealed. Furthermore, parts of the contents of the Bundles were clearly visible to the Accused and the Accused admitted to being able to distinguish between cannabis and tobacco by sight. The Accused also had no reason to trust Aya, whom he only knew from three months before. They had no personal relationship, only a working one. Tellingly, the Accused knew that Aya was a drug dealer. As the Accused had seen tobacco previously, there was no basis to think that tobacco packets would be packed as the Bundles were. The Accused also could not provide details of the runner who had told him about the smuggling of tobacco. The Accused’s excuse that he did not check as he wanted to avoid accusations of theft and complaint from the customer was unbelievable given that he was running the risk of the death penalty. Given the suspicious circumstances, the Accused should have checked; he had the opportunity to ask and the opportunity to check.

There was no independent identification of the Bundles containing drugs – the Accused used the word “drugs” in his statements because some of the Bundles were opened by the CNB officers and was informed by them that they contained drugs. In fact, one of the CNB officers, SSSgt Samir, accepted that this was the possible explanation for the Accused’s word choice. The Accused had no knowledge that the Bundles contained drugs because he could not see through the Bundles as they were wrapped.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In the present case, the Defence did not dispute the identity of the drugs found in the Bundles – the drug analysis, chain of custody, and integrity of the process were all not challenged. The act of importation was also not in issue: the drugs in question were driven into Singapore by the Accused. As the Accused admitted to driving the Car into Singapore, possession of the drugs by him was not in issue by virtue of s 18(1) of the MDA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Instead, what was hotly disputed was whether the Accused knew that what he was carrying in the Bundles was controlled drugs. The Prosecution invoked s 18(2) of the MDA, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, an accused is presumed to have known the nature of the drugs he possessed. As a result, the burden lay on the Accused to show, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not in fact know of the nature of the drugs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The Prosecution pointed to the contemporaneous and cautioned statements made by the Accused in which references were made to “drugs” being transported; this, it was said, showed the Accused’s knowledge. The Defence, on the other hand, argued that these references followed on from the Accused having been shown the contents of the Bundles and his being told that the Bundles contained drugs by the CNB officers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I was not satisfied that the Accused’s reference to drugs showed pre-existing knowledge. I accepted that there was a real possibility that his usage of the term “drugs” flowed from what he was shown or told by the CNB officers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 That conclusion, however, did not lead to the result that the Accused did not know of the nature of the drugs. The Defence still had to make this out on a balance of probabilities. The Defence pointed to the trust that the Accused reposed in Aya, and the various assurances given by Aya to the Accused (see [23] above). Parallels were drawn with a number of cases such as <span class="font-italic">Somchit</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Khor</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Lee</span>. However, these cases are distinguishable in terms of the degree of trust, and the circumstances giving rise to such trust. I accepted the Prosecution’s arguments that the Accused’s relationship with Aya was not of the same level, being one of only a few months’ duration even by the Accused’s own account. Aya’s known activity in smuggling drugs should also have made the Accused wary of any assurances given by Aya. Even if Aya was indeed involved in both drug and tobacco smuggling, in the overall circumstances of the case, it was not believable for the Accused to just accept at face value what Aya had told him, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the Accused was delivering tobacco only. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Other surrounding circumstances, including the lack of control over the Car and its contents overnight, and the measures taken in respect of the Car such as the fact that it had to be rented and the tinting of its windows, should have raised concerns which would have weakened substantially any assurance that was supposedly given. There was also the reward promised of S$5,000, agreed to by the Defence in the ASOF,

</div> which was significantly higher than the sale value of tobacco of that quantity, which, according to the Accused’s own evidence, was RM7,000. While the Accused gave a lower figure for his reward of RM2,000 at trial, his explanation for the change of figure from the ASOF was left wanting. Even if the quantum of his reward was only RM2,000, that was still a significant amount for a delivery of tobacco supposedly worth RM7,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Furthermore, given the available opportunities for the Accused to check and verify the contents of the Bundle with Aya and the absence of any reasonable basis for the Accused to rely on the assurances from and any relationship with Aya, I found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the Accused did actually know that the Bundles contained the controlled drugs for which he was charged with. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Analysis </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Following the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Ng Kwok Chun and </span><span class="font-italic">another v Public Prosecutor </span>[1992] 3 SLR(R) 256, the elements of a charge for importation into Singapore of a controlled drug under s 7 of the MDA are (at [39]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the bringing of the drugs into Singapore; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the accused knew or intended to bring the drugs into Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">On the second limb, the relevant <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> in this case was that of knowledge.

I found that the evidence disclosed showed actual knowledge, including wilful blindness; and that in any event, the evidence also led to the conclusion that the s 18(2) presumption was not rebutted. But as the Prosecution proceeded on the basis of the statutory presumption, whether the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA was rebutted will be considered first, before turning to the issue of actual knowledge and wilful blindness.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Section 18(2) of the MDA provides for a presumption of knowledge of the nature of the drug:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Where the presumption under s 18(2) applies, this has to be rebutted by the accused on the balance of probabilities: see <span class="font-italic">Muhammad </span><span class="font-italic">Ridzuan bin Md Ali v Public Prosecutor and other matters </span>[2014] 3 SLR 721 at [75] and <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic"> v Ilechukwu Chukwudi </span>[2015] SGCA 33 (“<span class="font-italic">Ilechukwu</span>”) at [30], referring to <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span><span class="font-italic"> a/l K Dharmalingam v Public Prosecutor </span>[2011] 4 SLR 1156 at [31]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The Defence argued that the Accused’s version, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, he had only agreed to bring in tobacco into Singapore, was credible and established on the balance of probabilities.

Still less will future courts countenance accused persons seeking to ‘manufacture defences’ in order to effect a similar fact pattern. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 A case in contrast was cited by the Prosecution: <span class="font-italic">Norasharee</span>. An allegation of trust being reposed by the accused there was rejected by the Court of Appeal as the object of that trust was involved in “a spectrum of illegal activities”, had previously threatened to beat the accused, and had shown himself to be “untrustworthy” (at [50]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In my judgment, the line between these cases is drawn simply on the basis that the relationship of trust must be one that is credible on the facts as alleged; where the description of the alleged relationship contains incongruities, the likely result will be that the version proffered by the accused will be rejected and the presumption will remain unrebutted. But where the description of the relationship is coherent, credible and there is nothing to cast doubt on what is testified, the court will conclude that there is sufficient support for the accused’s version and that the presumption has been rebutted on the balance of probabilities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In the present case, there was insufficient basis on the Accused’s own version for him to have reposed trust in Aya that all he was smuggling into Singapore was tobacco. First, there was little basis for the Accused to repose much trust in Aya because the Accused only knew Aya through a “friend’s friend” three months before the incident.

</div>
</div> Taken together, these factors should have made the Accused wary, if not, chary, of any contraband item which Aya would have paid the Accused to bring into Singapore given the circumstances of the request and their relationship. In the circumstances, the Accused’s reposing of trust in Aya defied credit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Against that context, the failure of the Accused to check the contents of the Bundles was also significant. There was nothing to support the passive posture purportedly taken by the Accused – all the circumstances pointed against the reposing of trust, and therefore active steps should have been taken to assure himself that what he thought was true. That the Accused did not check, despite these circumstances, militated in favour of rejecting his version. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Reward for smuggling </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The reward supposedly offered by Aya to the Accused to smuggle the tobacco was also disproportionately significant. As alluded to above at [32], there was a dispute as to the amount of reward actually offered. However, in the ASOF, which had been agreed to and signed by the Defence, there was a reference to the Accused receiving S$5,000. There was no move to have the ASOF set aside; in the circumstances, therefore, the ASOF was conclusive. Furthermore, even if there had been such an attempt, there was nothing before me to justify any such setting aside of the ASOF – short of the Accused being misled or misapprehending what he had agreed to, it is difficult to fathom what other grounds would justify discarding the ASOF.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Further, several other aspects rendered the Accused’s version incredulous. A car was <span class="font-italic">specifically rented</span> for the delivery even though the Accused already drove a car at the material time, which he used while serving as a personal driver of Aya.

</div> As will be seen below (at [69]), I rejected the allegation that he was not fit to give his statement. But aside from that, if he had been able to respond as he actually did regarding the reasons why he had given an adverse response in an earlier statement, he would also have reasonably been expected to explain and recount why he had thought that he was bringing tobacco into Singapore or at the very least state this defence upon being cautioned. This he did not do. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 For these reasons, I found that the Defence failed to rebut on the balance of probabilities the presumption of knowledge of the nature of drugs that arose under s 18(2) of the MDA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Actual knowledge </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The above conclusions on the Accused’s failure to rebut the s 18(2) presumption were also grounds for finding actual knowledge, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the deficiencies in the Accused’s evidence above also pointed to the conclusion that even apart from the statutory presumption, the Accused was not able to raise a reasonable doubt as to his knowledge of the nature of the drugs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In assessing the evidence as to whether the Accused actually knew that what he was transporting were drugs, the Prosecution need only prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, not beyond any shadow or trace of doubt. What amounts to reasonable doubt is usually more readily assessed from the perspective of the accused person, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether he has raised a reasonable doubt. On occasion, the reasonable doubt may be readily found where the Prosecution’s evidence is insufficiently strong, though all the elements of the charge are made out, there may be significant doubts about the credibility of the witnesses, for instance, or the chain of inferences pointing to the guilt of the accused. In these instances, there may be little need for the accused to do more than to raise questions about the Prosecution’s evidence. However, in other contexts, where the Prosecution has more substantive evidence, the accused, to raise a reasonable doubt, needs to put before the court some evidence. All the evidence, from both sides, is then assessed by the court, and a determination is ultimately made. If the Prosecution’s evidence is cogent and convincing, and meets the requisite standard, the accused is convicted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In the present case, the evidence recounted above, particularly the circumstances of the transaction, such as the preparations made in respect of the concealment of the Bundles, the steps taken to prepare the rented Car by tinting the windows, and the handing over of the Car keys to Aya overnight, indubitably pointed against the Bundles containing only tobacco. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The reward of S$5,000 offered to the Accused

The present case was not one in which the Accused denied all knowledge that he was carrying contraband. The Accused, knowing that there was contraband, had to raise a reasonable doubt about his knowledge of the nature of that contraband. The evidential burden lay upon him to adduce evidence that would have such an effect. His testimony, however, was at best not believable, and, at worst, incongruous.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Given the rejection of the Defence’s version, what was left was only the version put forward by the Prosecution, namely, that the Accused knew that he was carrying Class A controlled drugs into Singapore.

The Accused worked for Aya, as a bodyguard and driver, knew that Aya dealt in drugs, collected drug money for him and even smoked “ice” with him. Taken together with the elaborate preparations noted above (at [58]), carrying hidden contraband goods for smuggling in this context should have triggered a very high degree of suspicion on the Accused’s part. His decision not to inquire further, or to check, the contents of the Bundle could only be indicative of a desire not to uncover what he must have already known – the Accused was therefore wilfully blind. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The statements made by the Accused</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 To be clear, I did not in my conclusions rely on the references to “drugs” made in the contemporaneous and cautioned statements given by the Accused.

</div>
</div> In any event, this point was not strongly pursued by the Defence in its submissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The argument was also made that the statements were not recorded in compliance with the requirements of the CPC, in that the statements had not been read back to the Accused. There was nothing to show any reasonable doubt as to this: the recorders of these statements were not cross-examined on this matter. Neither was there anything compelling in the evidence of the Accused on this score. In any event, any non-compliance with the requirements does not necessarily lead to non-admissibility of the evidence: see Explanation 2, paragraph (<span class="font-italic">e</span>) to s 258 of the CPC. While the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Muhammad</span><span class="font-italic"> bin Kadar v Public Prosecutor </span>[2011] 3 SLR 1205<span class="font-italic"> </span>held that a residual discretion exists to exclude improperly recorded statements if its prejudicial effect exceeded its probative value, there was nothing in the present case to show that. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 However, as regards the more pertinent question of whether the statements showed that the Accused knew that the Bundles contained drugs, I was not satisfied that the statements pointed to this. There was ambiguity as the Accused could have used the term “drugs” in response to what he had perceived or heard from the CNB officers. It would have been otherwise had there been explicit or specific questions asking whether he knew or how he knew that the Bundles contained drugs. As it was, however, I was left with the statements on the one hand, and the distinct possibility that the Accused said what he said because he had been told by the CNB officers that the Bundles contained drugs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The Prosecution tried to head off this conclusion, arguing that the Accused independently identified the packages as containing drugs.

</div> However, the Prosecution’s submissions pointed instead to supposed inconsistences and embellishments in the Accused’s evidence which were alleged to render his evidence unreliable. In this regard, it was argued that the Accused was not able to properly and consistently identify the CNB officers who had supposedly torn open the Bundles and informed him of the contents; the Accused was also unable to identify the torn Bundles or how extensive the tearing was.

As alluded to above (at [71]), the ambiguity was inherent in the words used in the statement. Any inconsistency or other shortcomings in the Accused’s evidence could not establish that the Accused had by what he said admitted to having knowledge of the Bundles’ contents.

</div> whilst<span class="font-italic"> </span>perhaps technically correct, could not exclude an interpretation of the statements relied upon by the Prosecution itself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In the circumstances, I could not give weight to these statements insofar as they were relied upon to show the Accused’s knowledge of the nature of the drugs at the material time. There was sufficient doubt raised by the Defence that the Accused had mentioned “[d]rugs were found” only because he had witnessed what the CNB officers had found and/or told him after unwrapping the Bundles. I accordingly attached no weight to the statements as showing the Accused’s knowledge of the drugs. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Alternative charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 While the alternative argument made by the Defence contended that the Accused should be convicted of transporting Class C controlled drugs, there was nothing in his evidence alleging any belief or knowledge that he was involved with that lower class of drugs as opposed to Class A controlled drugs. The Defence’s arguments appeared to be inspired by the alternative conviction in cases such as <span class="font-italic">Gobi </span>or <span class="font-italic">Khor</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Lee</span>. But the circumstances in those cases were different. In <span class="font-italic">Khor</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Lee</span>, the Court of Appeal agreed with the Defence, based on a consistent pattern of conduct that was adduced by the accused, that the accused would only transport drugs which did not carry the risk of death penalty (at [27] and [29]). Similarly in <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>, an assurance had been given that the drugs were only “chocolate”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, less serious drugs. As the trial judge in <span class="font-italic">Gobi </span>accepted the version given by the accused there (at [34]), the reduction of the charge to a Class C controlled drug followed. In contrast, in the present case, there was simply no evidence that the Accused believed that he was carrying a <span class="font-italic">less serious drug</span>. Here, there was only a binary choice: either the Accused knew he was carrying cannabis and cannabis mixture, or he did not. Having failed to make out the latter to rebut the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA, the inexorable conclusion was that the Accused knew that he was carrying Class A controlled drugs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 For the foregoing reasons, the Accused was convicted of the two charges as framed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 For the purpose of sentencing, it was not disputed that the Accused’s involvement in the transaction was limited only to the transportation, sending, or delivery of a controlled drug. I therefore found the Accused to be a courier within the meaning of s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA. Further, as the Accused was granted a certificate of substantive assistance by the Prosecution under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA, he was eligible to be sentenced under s 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA to imprisonment for life and caning of not less than 15 strokes for each of the charges, instead of capital punishment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The Defence’s oral mitigation stated that the Accused had become involved in the transaction because he had to borrow money from Aya to pay for his son’s medical treatment. It was also highlighted that he had cooperated with the police and that he was heretofore untraced. The Defence thus submitted for the minimum sentence possible.
