<strong>Judgment</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1.    The appellant, Khwan-On Nattaphon, a Thai national, was

tried before the High Court on a charge that on 15 June 2000, between 12.48 am and 6.00 am, he

committed murder by causing the death of one Ong Huay Dee (the deceased), a part-time taxi

driver, at Pasir Ris Drive 1, Singapore, an offence under s 302 and punishable under s 300 of the

Penal Code (Cap. 224, 1985 ed). He was convicted and was sentenced to suffer death. He appealed

against his conviction. We heard the appeal and dismissed it for the reasons which we now give.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The facts</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.    The deceaseds body was discovered inside a NTUC Comfort

taxi (the taxi) at Pasir Ris Drive 1 at about 6 am on 15 June 2000. At about 9.15 am the

forensic pathologist, Dr Teo Eng Swee (Dr Teo), arrived at the scene. He noted blood sprays

and blood drips inside the taxi.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.    Dr Teo subsequently conducted a post-mortem. He found that

there were in the main four injuries on the deceaseds head: three lacerations and one bruise. In

his opinion, the cause of death was intracranial haemorrhage and cerebral contusions with

fractured skull, and there were at least four blows inflicted on the deceaseds head, which

accounted for the three lacerations and one bruise. In his report, he described them as follows:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) a 5.2 cm laceration on the back part of the head to the left, just left of

  the midline, which was consistent with being caused by the narrow surface of the flat handle of a

  hook hammer (a specimen being produced in court) with great and severe force being used;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) a 1.2 cm laceration on the back part of the head, also to the left, near

  the mastoid region, which was consistent with being caused by the hook part or the flat edge of

  the hook hammer with moderate force being used;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) a laceration on the back part of the head, again to the left, near the

  midline, which was consistent with being caused by the hook part or flat edge of the hook hammer

  with moderate force being used; and</p>
<p align="justify">(iv) a bruise on the back part of the head, at the lower right, which was

  consistent with being caused by the broader surface of the flat handle of the hook hammer with

  moderate force being used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.    Dr Teo said that the blows to the deceaseds head resulted

in injury to the deceaseds brain which was the cause of the death. The deceased would most likely

have died within minutes of the blows being inflicted. In his opinion, the injuries (i) and (iv)

above described were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of the deceased.

The injuries sustained by the deceased were probably caused by a blunt weapon. Although he suggested

in his report that a hook hammer was the likely weapon, he did not rule out a steel pipe with jagged

or sharp edges or even a spanner as being the weapon used. He added that the assailant was probably

behind the victim at the time the injuries were inflicted. He did not see any sign of struggle in

the taxi.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.    The other evidence tendered by the prosecution through Dr

Teo was that when he first arrived at the scene to examine the deceased, he found that although the

deceased had a handphone clip on his belt, no handphone was found either attached to it or nearby.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The appellants account</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.    The appellant was arrested on 16 June 2000. He provided the

police with an account of what had transpired. He said that, on the night of 14 June 2001, he was at

a park near Golden Mile Complex with his friend, Wanchai Meeying (Wanchai). They got into a

fight with a group of men from Thailand, in the course of which Wanchai was hurt and the appellant

picked up a metal object, which belonged to their assailants. They ran towards the main road heading

for the bus stop opposite Golden Mile Complex. When they reached the bus stop the appellant

concealed the metal object by tucking it at his right waist and covered it with his longsleeve

jacket. He then noticed his jacket was stained with Wanchais blood. At the bus stop, they parted

company, and the appellant decided to return to his living quarters at Pasir Ris. He hailed a taxi

and the deceaseds taxi came along and he boarded it. He gave the deceased directions and

continued to guide him on the route to be taken, as the latter was unfamiliar with the route.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7.    During the course of the journey, the appellant noticed the

deceased looking at him through the rear view mirror, and also turning his head round to look at the

appellant a few times. The deceased asked the appellant: You fighting? to which the appellant

replied: No. The appellant became worried about the bloodstains on his jacket. The deceased

asked a few more times but the appellant did not reply. He began to worry that the deceased would

report him to the police, as the deceased kept looking at him and even attempted at one point to use

his mobile phone. When the taxi reached Lorong Halus, the appellant did not stop the deceased, but

directed him instead to Pasir Ris Drive 1. When the taxi stopped, the appellant saw the deceased

pressing the meter and, at the same time, picking up his mobile telephone. The appellant then hit

the deceased two to three times on the head with the metal object he took along from the

fight, and after that he took the deceaseds mobile telephone and wallet, and fled.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The trial below</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8.    It was not disputed that the appellant inflicted the

injuries on the deceased; nor was it disputed that the injuries (i) and (iv) above described were

sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. The appellants defence was that he

was suffering from an abnormality of mind as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for

his acts in causing the death of the deceased. Alternatively, his defence was that the case against

him had not been proven beyond reasonable doubt on the ground that at the time he inflicted the

injuries on the deceased he lacked the requisite intention to commit murder.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The prosecution evidence</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9.    The prosecution called a succession of witnesses, including

the appellants friends, workmates and supervisors. The appellants friends and workmates

testified that they had not noticed any abnormal behaviour on the appellants part, and that he

socialised with them regularly. However, a fellow Thai worker, Samran Sathiakit, told the court that

on one occasion the appellant, after a drinking session, became annoyed with Samran as the latter

was questioning him about some missing monies; the appellant thereupon picked up a cooking knife and

used it to injure Samrans dog.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10.    The prosecution also called the appellants girlfriend,

Phensuwan Netnapha (Phensuwan). Phensuwan testified that the appellant generally acted

normally, but that he was occasionally temperamental and withdrawn and there were times when he was

only pretending to be happy.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11.    Another piece of evidence which was of some relevance was

that given by S/Sgt Raymond Tan. The sergeant testified that, whilst the appellant was in police

custody, he attempted to harm himself by knocking against the walls of the remand cell, and as a

result was transferred to a padded cell. There too he was observed to have attempted to remove the

wire casing of the padded wall and attempted to pull the wire close to his neck. S/Sgt Raymond Tan

confirmed that he also learnt that the accused later attempted to commit suicide whilst at the

Queenstown Remand Prison.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12.    In anticipation of the defence of diminished

responsibility, the prosecution called Dr Tommy Tan to give evidence on the mental condition and the

general disposition of the appellant. Dr Tan is presently a consultant of Woodbridge Hospital and

prior to that he was a psychiatrist attached to Changi General Hospital. He examined the appellant

on 19 July, 26 July and 2 August 2000. Arising from his examinations, Dr Tan prepared a report on

the appellant, which was admitted in evidence. In it he said, inter alia:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">In my opinion, he has a Depressive Episode, following his arrest and

  imprisonment. It is reactive to his current circumstances. He is fit to plead. He is fully aware

  of the charge against him and the consequence of pleading guilty. He is rational and lucid and

  will be able to instruct his counsel and follow proceedings in court.</p>
<p align="justify">In summary,</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">1. The accused was not of unsound mind at the time of alleged offence.</p>
<p align="justify">2. There was no mental illness before and during the alleged offence that

    would impair his mental responsibility at the material time.</p>
<p align="justify">3. He has a depressive episode following his arrest and imprisonment. His

    depressive symptoms have improved with medication.</p>
<p align="justify">4. He is fit to plead.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><i><b><br/>

The defence</b></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13.    The appellant gave evidence in his defence. His evidence

was briefly this. He was born in Thailand on 28 August 1974 and is the youngest in the family of

seven children. His father is a farmer and his mother is mentally incapacitated and is unable to

work. He studied at a Thai medium school and attained secondary six level. As a child he had been

abused by one of his brothers, and was unpopular in school. He left school at the age of 18 and

started working as a factory hand and later as a construction worker.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14.    His family has a history of mental illness. His mother has

been mentally ill for some time and is on medication. One of his brothers also suffers from mental

illness amounting to insanity. The appellant, when he was in Thailand, had mental problems. Whenever

he tried to think his head became hot. He suffered from bouts of stress, insomnia, paranoia

and forgetfulness. His father brought him to see a doctor, Dr Samsak, and he was given medication

for his symptoms. Since then he had been on medication to alleviate his mental conditions. He also

resorted to taking paracetamol tablets with a view to getting rid of his insomnia and other illness,

and the dosage he took on each occasion increased from initially three tablets to six or seven

later.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15.    He is married and has a child aged about three years old.

His wife left him for another man, which resulted in several suicide attempts by him. He was greatly

affected by the separation from his wife and also his son. He wanted to take care of his son, but

his mother-in-law would not allow him. At times, he was not conscious of what he was doing;

sometimes he went out naked, and he was forgetful. He became very suspicious for no apparent reason;

and he did not trust anyone. Before he came to Singapore he always carried guns. Quite often when he

was under stress, he used to shoot aimlessly into the sky.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16.    After the appellant came to Singapore in 1999, he worked

well until about May 2000, when he began losing concentration in his work and suffered constant

headaches and insomnia. He also drank a lot during this period. Referring to the incident in which

he hurt the dog, he said that at that time he was in the kitchen preparing food for himself and

others. His colleagues there included Samran who had a dog with him. He heard his workmates talking

about their families back in Thailand. At that point in time, while he was slicing meat, suddenly he

grabbed hold of the dog nearby and used the knife to slash its back. He did not know what he was

doing and regained his faculties only when he heard the dog crying. He did not know why he hurt the

dog.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The medical evidence in the defence</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17.    In support of his defence, the appellant called Dr Douglas

Kong Sim Guan (Dr Kong), a consultant psychiatrist in private practice. Dr Kong referred to

the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> (4<sup>th</sup> edition) (DSM-IV)

and took the view that, in the case of the appellant, the DSM-IV criteria for Major Depressive

Episode had been satisfied. DSM-IV requires that five or more of a given set of nine symptoms

must be present in the patient during the same two-week period. The symptoms must represent a change

from previous functioning, and at least one of the symptoms must be either a depressed mood or loss

of interest or pleasure. The nine symptoms are:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">

  (i)    a depressed mood;

  <p>(ii)    a diminished pleasure in daily activities;

  </p><p>(iii)    significant weight loss or weight gain;

  </p><p>(iv)    insomnia;

  </p><p>(v)    observable psychomotor retardation;

  </p><p>(vi)    fatigue;

  </p><p>(vii)    feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt;

  </p><p>(viii)    a diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness; and

  </p><p>(ix)    recurrent thoughts of death.

</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Dr Kong was of the view that all nine symptoms were present in the appellant,

although he was only about 50% sure of the presence of symptom (vii).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18.    According to Dr Kong, this Major Depression caused the

appellant to lose control of himself, such as in the incident with the dog. Moreover, the appellant

had developed a fear of the police as he had been convicted and caned for illegal entry into

Singapore in the past. The fight at Golden Mile Complex just before the appellant encountered the

deceased, combined with the deceaseds suspicions and the perceived likelihood of his calling the

police, caused a Paranoid Reaction that resulted in the attack on the deceased. The Major

Depression had impaired [the appellants] perception, judgment, concentration, and executive

function, such that he was not in full control of his mental faculties and was not aware of the

consequences of his actions.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19.    Based on his observation of the appellants testimony, Dr

Kong was of the further view that the appellant suffered from dissociative amnesia, and the

appellants account of events in the taxi was in actuality a reconstruction based on being told

the events by the police. Furthermore, the events in the taxi were the result of a brief psychotic

disorder on the appellants part. A psychotic disorder is defined in Kaplan &amp; Saddocks <i>Comprehensive

Textbook of Psychiatry</i> as:</p>

    (i)    delusions, hallucinations, disorganised speech or grossly

disorganised or catatonic behaviour;

<p xmlns="">    (ii)    lasting at least one day but less than one month; and

</p><p xmlns="">    (iii)    which is not better accounted for by a mood disorder

with psychotic features, schizoaffective disorder, or 

</p><p xmlns="">            schizophrenia, and is not due

to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Dr Kong was of the opinion that these criteria were met as appellant was deluded

as to the deceaseds suspicions of him, as well as exhibiting highly disorganised behaviour.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Rebuttal medical evidence</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20.    The prosecutions expert witness, Dr Tan was recalled to

give rebuttal evidence. He opined that although the appellant appeared to have developed a mild

depressive episode after his arrest, as evidenced by his suicide attempts after arrest, he did not

suffer from an form of mental or major depressive illness before his arrest. The diagnostic

guidelines in the <i>International Classification of Diseases</i> (ICD-10) state that for a

depressive episode to be diagnosed, there must be at least two of the following conditions present:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">

  (i)    depressed mood

  <p>(ii)    loss of interest and enjoyment

  </p><p>(iii)    increased fatigability

</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In addition, there must also be present at least two of the following:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">

  (i)    reduced concentration and attention

  <p>(ii)    reduced self-esteem and self-confidence

  </p><p>(iii)    ideas of guilt and unworthiness

  </p><p>(iv)    bleak and pessimistic views of the future

  </p><p>(v)    ideas or acts of self-harm or suicide

  </p><p>(vi)    disturbed sleep

  </p><p>(vii)    diminished appetite.

</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Dr Tan opined that, on the evidence, the ICD-10 criteria were not met, as the

appellant was able to function normally in the weeks before the murder, and had by his own admission

been actively helping his friend Wanchai to look for a job the week before the murder. Dr Tan also

placed reliance on the appellants ability to give clear and precise directions to the deceased

from Golden Mile Complex all the way to Pasir Ris. Dr Tans conclusion was that the appellant was

not suffering any mental illness that had impaired his mental responsibility for the offence which

he committed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21.    With leave of the court, the prosecution called one Noordin

bin Mohd Amin who was employed by the same employer Lian Hin Lee as the appellant. Noordin testified

that between May and June 2000 he was a construction carpenter with Lian Hin Lee at the work site at

Lorong Halus. The appellant was in his team and Noordins role was to direct the Thai workers in

the work they carried out. He spoke little Thai and the instructions were given to the Thai workers

by sign language. Noordin said that the appellant did not tell him that he (the appellant) was ill

or that his memory was so bad that he was unable to work. Noordin said that the appellant was able

to follow instructions and complete the job allocated to him. He described the appellants

standard of work as O K but the appellant was sometimes careless.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The decision below</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22.    The trial judge found that the defence of diminished

responsibility had not been made out on the balance of probabilities. The appellant was in

possession of all his mental faculties during the entire taxi journey, and the injuries inflicted on

the deceased were not inflicted while he was in a dazed and dissociative state; he was fully

conscious of what he was doing. In preferring Dr Tans testimony to Dr Kongs, the judge found

Dr Kongs evidence to be inconsistent and replete with over-generalisation, while Dr Tans

was both objective and consistent. As for the appellants own assertions as to his prior mental

illness, the judge was of the view that they could not lend weight to the appellants case as they

were unsupported by evidence and the appellant had had ample opportunity to procure evidence of it

from Thailand, but had not done so. The judge also found that the defence based on lack of requisite

intention was plainly unsustainable, as the appellant was not suffering from any abnormality

of mind at the time he committed the offence and instead, he carried it out in a cold-blooded

manner.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The appeal</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23.        Before us, there were only two

issues. The first was whether on the balance of probabilities the appellant had made out a case of

diminished responsibility, and the second was whether, on the evidence, the case against the

appellant had been proved beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
<b xmlns=""><i>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Diminished responsibility</p></i></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24.    We turn first to the defence of diminished responsibility.

In this defence, the evidence in support primarily came from two sources, namely the appellant

himself, and his expert, Dr Kong. In relation to the appellants own evidence of his mental

illness in Thailand, the judge did not accept it on the ground that there was nothing to corroborate

or confirm what he said. Turning to his evidence of his mental illness while he was in Singapore,

the judge found that it was totally inconsistent with the evidence given by his workmates and the

work records produced. The judge said at  104:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">[T]he accuseds claim was that during the months of May to June 2000, he was

  unable to concentrate on his work; he had frequent headaches; his brain was not functioning

  properly; he was suffering from extreme stress and as a result his work hours diminished. But the

  evidence of his colleagues and the work records produced . . . . . narrated a different story. It

  appeared from his work records that in the months of May and June he was working as usual. His

  records established that he had clocked three days overtime in June. However, it should be noted

  that he stopped work on 9 June 2000. His fellow workers at the worksite also testified that they

  did not notice that there was anything wrong with the accused either in relation to his work or in

  relation to his general disposition. The accuseds claim that he suffered from lack of

  concentration also did not tie up with his gambling success when the accused asserted that he was

  in fact netting about $4,000 to $5,000 a month from gambling alone and that he had lost only once

  on 9 June 2000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25.    These findings of the judge were fully justified. We for

our part did not find the appellants evidence of his mental illness whether in Thailand or here

credible. Like the judge, we found that the evidence adduced by the prosecution showed that the

appellant was not in a depressed state and was able to go about in his daily routine no different

than others and maintained the normal social ties with his co-workers and his girlfriend. In

particular, his girlfriend did not notice that the appellant was in low and depressed mood most of

the time. He was able to enjoy her company whenever they were together.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26.    As for the medical evidence given by Dr Kong, the judge

found that there were major inconsistencies in what Dr Kong said. The judge said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">105 Returning to Dr Kongs evidence, with respect, I must say that it

  contained some major inconsistencies. First of all Dr Kong who had earlier reported that the

  accused had been suffering from a major depression "<i>since the beginning of 2000</i>"

  modified it during cross-examination to read that the accused had been suffering from a major

  depression "which had its beginnings from January/February 2000.". Secondly, in his

  written report he did not mention that the accused was suffering from "dissociative

  amnesia", a clinical term which is quite distinct from the "dissociative state" he

  had mentioned in the report. Another notable inconsistency was in relation to the clinical term:

  Paranoid Reaction. Dr Kong said that although he had used the term Paranoid Reaction in his

  report, what he really meant was Brief Psychotic Disorder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27.    The judge found that Dr Kong relied only on the subjective

account given by the appellant himself and paid no attention to the objective facts that were before

the court. The appellant did not appear to have suffered any fatigue or loss of energy in carrying

out his work. His supervisor, Noordin bin Mohd Amin, testified that the appellant worked like any

other workers and was able to carry out his work and was not found to be lethargic.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28.    The judge found that despite Dr Kongs claims, the DSV-IV

criteria for Major Depressive Episode were not supported by evidence. The judge said at  106:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">[F]rom the evidence proffered by witnesses, such an opinion was not founded on

  any credible evidence. None of the witnesses had come across the accused being in a depressed mood

  nearly every day (symptom 1 of Major Depressive Episode in DSM-IV) nor did he appear to have

  suffered from a markedly diminished interest in all or almost all activities nearly every day

  (symptom 2). On the contrary, the evidence of his girlfriend, the accuseds colleagues and

  friends was that the accused was behaving no differently from the others. There was also no

  credible evidence to support the defendants assertion that the accused had a decrease or

  increase in his appetite nearly everyday (symptom 3), nor was there any evidence to suggest that

  he was suffering from any psychomotor retardation (symptom 5). In fact the facts pointed to the

  contrary since all his colleagues testified that they had not noticed anything abnormal about the

  accused and that there was nothing to suggest that his reflexes were slow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29.    Referring to Dr Tans evidence, the judge found that Dr

Tan took into account the objective facts in assessing whether a person was suffering from any

depressive episodes. Dr Tan said that for the appellant to qualify as suffering from Major

Depression, he had to satisfy five or more of the criteria stated in DSM-IV within the same two week

period. In his opinion, the appellant qualified only for symptom 4 which is insomnia; he did not

satisfy any other criteria as set out in the DSM-IV for Major Depressive Episode. Dr Tan was unable

to find any objective or independent evidence to support the appellants claim. Like the judge, we

also accepted Dr Tans evidence, which was far more objective than that of Dr Kong.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30.    There was also the evidence given by the appellant himself

that he did not work on 9 June 2000 onwards until the date of the offence, because he was busy

helping his friend, Wanchai, to look for employment. With reference to this evidence, Dr Tan pointed

out that if the appellants mental illness had come to a head on 15 June 2000, the appellant would

himself be in a poor state of health on 9 June 2000, and would have no will or capacity to help

actively his friend to look for a job one week before the incident.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31.    The judges final evaluation of the evidence on the

diminished responsibility was summed up by him at  121 as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">121 Reviewing the totality of the evidence, in my determination, the defence of

  diminished responsibility had not been made out on balance of probabilities. In this regard, I

  found the accused had not been truthful in his assertions. His claim in the witness box that he

  removed the metal object from his waist and hit the driver at the back of his head about two to

  three times in his statement of 15 June 2000 was not something reconstructed as claimed by Dr

  Kong. In my opinion, he appeared to be fully conscious and was in possession of all his mental

  faculties throughout the entire taxi journey to the extent that he could give the driver very

  clear instructions as to the path as well as the turnings to be taken throughout the entire

  journey. In my determination, the injuries inflicted on the accused were not something done in a

  moment of daze and dissociative state but in a moment of full clarity and consciousness. Dr Kongs

  evidence in my view suffered from lack of consistency and appeared to be replete with over-generalisation.

  In my opinion, Dr Tans analysis appeared to possess both objectivity and consistency. In the

  event, I accepted the evidence of Dr Tan that the accused was not suffering from any abnormality

  of mind as substantially impaired his mental responsibility that the time of the commission of the

  offence although he suffered a post-arrest depressive episode.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">We could find no reason to disagree with the judges conclusion, which was

amply supported by evidence. In our judgment, the defence of diminished responsibility failed.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Reasonable doubt</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32.    The appellants second ground of appeal was that due to

the depression from which he was suffering at the time of the offence, he could not have formed the

requisite intention to commit murder. The short answer is that there was no evidence that the

appellant was suffering from any depression at the time. Dr Tans evidence was that the appellant

was not suffering from any delusion or any grossly disorganised behaviour, and that the appellant

exhibited a purposive behaviour and knew what he was doing.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33.    In this case, the appellant admitted that he used a metal

object to hit the deceased two or three times on the head. It was the evidence of the forensic

pathologist, Dr Teo, that the four injuries as described in  3 above were inflicted on the

deceased, and it was not disputed that these injuries were inflicted by the appellant. The evidence

of Dr Teo was that, inter alia, two of the injuries inflicted on the deceased, namely, the

laceration and the bruise described as injuries (i) and (iv), in  3 above, were sufficient in the

ordinary course of nature to cause death. It was therefore proved beyond reasonable doubt that the

appellant was the one who inflicted the injuries on the deceaseds head intentionally, and not

accidentally; that two of the injuries were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause

death; and that they did cause the death of the deceased. Thus, the requirements of s 300(c) of the

Penal Code on which the prosecution relied had been satisfied: <i>Virsa Singh v State of Punjab</i>

AIR 1958 SC 465 at 467; <i>Mimi Wong and Anor v Public Prosecutor</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=883&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1972] 2 MLJ 75</a> at 78; and <i>Public

Prosecutor v Visuvanathan</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=1532&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1978] 1 MLJ 159</a> at 169.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The requisite intention</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34.    We found that the appellants contention that he lacked

the requisite intent to inflict the relevant injuries on the deceased to be plainly untenable. In

light of the whole circumstances in which the attack on the deceased was carried out, we had no

hesitation in agreeing with the following conclusion of the judge:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">122 In my determination, the prosecution had discharged its ultimate burden in

  proving the case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt and that the defence of diminished

  responsibility as well as the defence based on lack of requisite intention raised on behalf of the

  accused were plainly unsustainable. There was no evidence that the accused was suffering from any

  abnormality of mind prior to or at the time of the commission of the offence. In my view, the

  offence committed was willed and carried out in a cold-blooded manner. In the end, I was satisfied

  that the prosecution had indeed proven its case against him beyond a reasonable doubt and that he

  had not, on a balance of probabilities established his defence.</p>
</blockquote>

Conclusion</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35.    For the foregoing reasons, we dismissed the appeal.</p>
