<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal from the decision of the
                    Income Tax Board of Review (“the Board”) in Income Tax Board of
                    Review Appeal No 32 of 2007, where the Board held that gains obtained from
                    the exercise of share options by the estate of a deceased employee were subject
                    to income tax. It raises two questions, namely: (a) whether such a benefit
                    can be considered to arise from employment; and (b) whether the relevant
                    provisions of the Income Tax Act (Cap 134, 2004 Rev Ed) (“the
                    Act”), which provisions deem gains derived from share options to be
                    taxable income, apply to gains derived from share options permitted to be
                    retained, and subsequently duly exercised, by the estate of a deceased
                    employee.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The appellant is the widow of an employee
                    taxpayer (“the Taxpayer”) and brings this appeal in her capacity
                    as the executrix of his estate (“the Estate”). The respondent is
                    the Comptroller of Income Tax. Prior to his death, the Taxpayer was a senior
                    executive in a group of related companies (hereafter referred to collectively as
                    “the Companies” and individually as a “Company”). As
                    part of his remuneration, he was granted share options in each Company pursuant
                    to that Company’s share option plan. The terms of the share option plans
                    of the Companies (collectively, “the Share Option Plans”) are
                    substantially similar, and the most relevant provisions are the
                        following:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.1    Subject as provided in Rules 7 and 8, an
                            Option shall be exercisable, in whole or in part, during the Exercise
                            Period applicable to that Option and in accordance with the Vesting
                            Schedule and the conditions (if any) applicable to that
                        Option.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.3    In any of the
                            following events, namely:–</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    the death of a Participant [<em>ie</em>, a holder of share options granted pursuant to
                                the Share Option Plans];</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">an Option then held by that Participant shall, to the extent unexercised,
                            <em>lapse without any claim whatsoever against the
                            Company, unless otherwise determined by the Committee in its absolute
                            discretion</em>. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Executive Resource Compensation Committee of each Company is the
                    “Committee” referred to in the above provisions, and it is
                    responsible for administering that particular Company’s share option plan.
                    I will refer to the Executive Resource Compensation Committees of the Companies
                    collectively as “the Committees”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       It may be noted that the other events covered by
                    Rule 7.3 of the Share Option Plans include the bankruptcy of a holder of
                    share options granted pursuant to these plans (a “Participant”), a
                    Participant leaving the Companies due to ill-health, injury or retirement upon
                    reaching the legal retirement age, <em>etc</em>. This rule
                    further provides that the Committees, in exercising their discretion to allow a
                    Participant to retain share options which would otherwise have lapsed, can vary
                    the number of shares comprised in the share option and the period during which
                    they have to be exercised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       After the death of the Taxpayer in 2005, the
                    Committees exercised their discretion to allow the Estate to retain and exercise
                    the share options that had been granted to the Taxpayer prior to his death
                    (“the Share Options”), which would <em>prima
                        facie</em> have lapsed upon his death. In addition, the exercise
                    periods for certain of the Share Options which were not exercisable yet were
                    brought forward such that those share options could be exercised immediately by
                    the Estate. The Committees’ decision only restored the Share Options,
                    which (as just mentioned) would otherwise have lapsed due to the death of the
                    Taxpayer, and did not confer any new share options on the Estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Share Options were subsequently exercised by
                    the Estate in 2006, and the gains derived from the exercise of the options were
                    computed by the respondent as amounting to over $8m for the Year of Assessment
                    2007. The tax liability on the Estate from such gains was about
                $1.7m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The appellant disputed that the gains derived
                    from the exercise of the Share Options were subject to income tax and appealed
                    to the Board. The Board found that the retention of the Share Options by the
                    Estate was a benefit accruing to the Estate by reason of the Taxpayer’s
                    employment, and concluded that the gains derived from the exercise of these
                    share options were subject to income tax. Dissatisfied, the appellant now
                    appeals to this court against the Board’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The respondent subjected the gains derived by
                    the Estate from the exercise of the Share Options to income tax under
                        s 10(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Act, which reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Charge of income tax</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>10</b>.— (1) Income tax
                        shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be payable at the rate or
                        rates specified hereinafter for each year of assessment upon the income of
                        any person accruing in or derived from Singapore or received in Singapore
                        from outside Singapore in respect of —</p>

                                from any employment;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In addition to s 10(1)(<em>b</em>), two other provisions are also pertinent. The first is
                    s 10(6) of the Act, which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Any gains or profits, directly or indirectly, derived by any person from a
                        right or benefit granted on or after 1st January 2003, whether granted
                        in his name or in the name of his nominee or agent, to acquire shares in any
                        company shall, <em>where the right or benefit is obtained by
                            that person by reason of any office or employment held by
                        him</em>, be deemed to be income chargeable to tax under
                            subsection (1)(<em>b</em>) [<em>ie</em>, s 10(1)(<em>b</em>)] …
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The second provision is s 10(5) of the
                    Income Tax Act (Cap 134, 2001 Rev Ed) as it stood prior to the
                    amendments effected by the Income Tax (Amendment) Act 2002 (Act 37 of 2002)
                    (“the former s 10(5)”). The former s 10(5) is the
                    predecessor of s 10(6) of the Act and reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Any gains or profits directly or indirectly derived by any person by the
                        exercise, assignment or release of a right or benefit whether granted in his
                        name or in the name of his nominee or agent to acquire shares in a company
                        shall, <em>where the right or benefit is obtained by that
                            person by reason of any office or employment held by him</em>, be
                        deemed to be income … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Court of Appeal held in <em>Comptroller of Income Tax v HY</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 405
                    that s 10(5) of the Income Tax Act (Cap 134, 1996 Rev Ed), which
                    was <em>in pari materia</em> with both the former
                    s 10(5) and s 10(6) of the Act, was merely a deeming or definitional
                    provision which sought to include, as taxable income, gains derived from the
                    exercise of share options that had been granted to a taxpayer by reason of his
                    office or employment. By extension, the former s 10(5) and s 10(6) of
                    the Act would operate similarly. Both of these provisions are relevant in this
                    appeal because s 10(6) of the Act applies to share options granted on or
                    after 1 January 2003, while the former s 10(5) applies to share
                    options granted before 1 January 2003 (see s 10(6A) of the Act). Since
                    the Share Options were granted to the Taxpayer over a period from 1999 to 2004,
                    both s 10(6) of the Act and the former s 10(5) are
                applicable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Both the appellant and the respondent have
                    accepted that, for the purposes of this appeal, there is no material difference
                    between s 10(6) of the Act and the former s 10(5). What is more
                    important is that both of these provisions only operate in respect of share
                    options that are obtained <em>by reason of</em> any office
                    or employment held by the taxpayer. Counsel for the appellant, Mr Tan Kay
                    Kheng (“Mr Tan”), has also pointed out that neither
                    s 10(6) of the Act nor the former s 10(5) makes any express reference
                    to gains derived from share options that are allowed to be retained by the
                    estate of a deceased employee.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues arising in this appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In order to subject the gains obtained by the
                    Estate from the exercise of the Share Options to income tax under
                        s 10(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Act, the respondent
                    must show that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     the retention of the Share Options
                        by the Estate was a benefit extended by the Companies by reason of the
                        Taxpayer’s employment; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     s 10(6) of the Act and the former s 10(5) apply
                        to share options retained by a deceased taxpayer’s
                    estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">These are the two determinant issues in this
                    appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The first issue: Whether the retention of the Share Options by the
                Estate constituted a benefit arising from the Taxpayer’s employment</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Before I examine the relevant authorities, I
                    need to refer to the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>JD
                        Ltd v Comptroller of Income Tax</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 484,
                    where the court cautioned against the blind use of foreign case law in
                    elucidating tax principles, especially where the wording of the foreign tax
                    legislation was not <em>in pari materia</em> with the local
                    equivalent. I acknowledge that foreign tax statutes may be (and are often)
                    worded differently from our local tax legislation. However, for the purposes of
                    the present appeal, I find Commonwealth cases to be relevant, and even
                    persuasive, sources of authority in determining the issue of whether a
                    particular gain or benefit is one that was obtained by reason of the
                    taxpayer’s employment. This is because, as I will go on to show, the
                    question of whether a gain or benefit arose from employment is a very broad
                    inquiry that depends very much on the circumstances of each individual case. In
                    determining this question, the precise wording of the relevant tax statute would
                    be less crucial. What matters more are the factors which the courts in other
                    Commonwealth jurisdictions have considered to be germane in characterising
                    whether a gain falls within or outside employment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">General principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     I will begin my analysis of the first issue
                        (<em>viz</em>, whether the retention of the Share
                    Options by the Estate was a benefit obtained by reason of the Taxpayer’s
                    employment) by referring to the applicable general principles enunciated by
                    Upjohn J in <em>Hochstrasser (Inspector of Taxes) v
                        Mayes</em> [1959] Ch 22 (“<em>Hochstrasser (HC)</em>”), where he said at 33:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my judgment, the authorities show this, that it is a question to be
                        answered in the light of the particular facts of every case whether or not a
                        particular payment is or is not a profit arising from the employment.
                        … [N]ot every payment made to an employee is necessarily made to him
                        as a profit arising from his employment. Indeed, in my judgment, the
                        authorities show that to be a profit arising from the employment the payment
                        must be made in reference to the services the employee renders by virtue of
                        his office, and it must be something <em>in the nature of a
                            reward for services past, present or future</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Two points from the above passage by
                    Upjohn J should be noted. First, whether a particular gain can be treated
                    as having arisen by reason of employment depends on the facts and circumstances
                    of that individual case. Second, for the gain in question to be regarded as
                    having arisen from employment, it must be a reward for services past, present or
                    future. This “reward for services” test has also been quoted with
                    approval by local authors (see Pok Soy Yoong &amp; Damian Hong Chin Fock,
                        <em>Singapore Taxation</em> (Butterworths, 2nd Ed,
                    1989) at p 224 and Angela Tan, <em>Singapore Master Tax
                        Guide Handbook 2008/09</em> (CCH Asia Pte Limited, 27th Ed, 2008)
                    at ¶ 5-210).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It seems to me that, since the question of
                    whether a gain or benefit has arisen by reason of employment would depend on the
                    unique facts of each case, the “reward for services” test should
                    not be regarded as the only applicable test. The problem with the “reward
                    for services” test is that it focuses entirely on the services rendered
                    by the employee, whereas s 10(6) of the Act (and also the former
                    s 10(5)) requires the court to determine whether the benefit in question
                    arises from an employment relationship. It is not that the “reward for
                    services” test is wrong. But, there could be circumstances where a
                    benefit, although arising by reason of the taxpayer’s employment, has
                    nothing to do with the taxpayer’s services, past, present or future. The
                    “reward for services” test is, of course, a very useful test, but,
                    as I have just stated, it is not the only test. Indeed, in <em>Hochstrasser (Inspector of Taxes) v Mayes</em>
                    [1960] AC 376 (“<em>Hochstrasser (HL)</em>”), the House of Lords, while
                    affirming Upjohn J’s judgment in <em>Hochstrasser (HC)</em>, focused on the concept of employment
                    rather than that of services rendered. As Viscount Simonds held (at
                    390):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The question is one of substance, not form. I accept, as I am bound to do,
                        that the test of taxability is whether from the standpoint of the person who
                        receives it the profit accrues to him by virtue of his office
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Similarly, Lord Radcliffe said (at
                    391–392):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[W]hile it is not sufficient to render a payment assessable that an
                        employee would not have received it unless he had been an employee, it is
                        assessable if it has been paid to him <em>in return for
                            acting as or being an employee</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Later English cases have also affirmed the
                    principle that gains from employment are not restricted to payments (or other
                    benefits) received as a reward for services (see <em>Hamblett v
                        Godfrey (Inspector of Taxes)</em> [1987] 1 WLR 357 at 370
                    and <em>Wilcock (H M Inspector of Taxes) v
                        Eve</em> (1994) 67 TC 223 (“<em>Wilcock</em>”) at 237).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     While I recognise that there is considerable
                    overlap between the two tests –
                    <em>viz</em>, the “reward for services” test
                    and the “capacity as employee” test – and that, in most
                    circumstances, the application of the two tests would produce the same result,
                    they are certainly not identical. What cannot be disputed is that the real focus
                    of s 10(6) of the Act (and the former s 10(5) as well) is on whether
                    the share options in question were obtained by the taxpayer in his capacity as
                    an employee. This “capacity as employee” test at least clarifies
                    that a particular gain can be treated as having arisen from employment even if
                    it is not referable to services rendered by the employee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     At this juncture, I would like to refer
                    briefly to s 10(2)(<em>a</em>) of the Act, which gives
                    a general definition of the phrase “gains or profits from any
                    employment” for the purposes of s 10(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Act. Although s 10(2)(<em>a</em>) is not relevant in the present appeal, it is important to see
                    the difference in wording between this provision and s 10(6) of the Act
                    (and, by extension, the former s 10(5)) because all of these subsections
                    attempt to define when a particular gain or benefit should be treated as having
                    arisen from employment. Section 10(2)(<em>a</em>) of
                    the Act reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    In
                                subsection (1)(<em>b</em>) [<em>ie</em>, s 10(1)(<em>b</em>)], “gains or profits from any employment”
                            means —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    any wages,
                                salary, leave pay, fee, commission, bonus, gratuity, perquisite or
                                allowance (other than a subsistence, travelling, conveyance or
                                entertainment allowance which is proved to the satisfaction of the
                                Comptroller to have been expended for purposes other than those in
                                respect of which no deduction is allowed under section 15)
                                    <em>paid or granted in respect of the
                                    employment</em> whether in money or
                            otherwise;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     One would immediately notice that
                        s 10(2)(<em>a</em>) of the Act refers to payments
                    made “in respect of the employment”, whereas s 10(6) of the
                    Act refers to a right or benefit obtained “by reason of any office or
                    employment”. The question is whether this difference in wording should
                    affect the court’s approach in ascertaining whether the gain in question
                    arises from employment. In his article “Taxation of Employment
                    Benefits” (1993) 5 SAcLJ 219, Mr Liu Hern Kuan
                    (“Mr Liu”) argued (at p 223) that the phrase “in
                    respect of the employment” in s 10(2)(<em>a</em>) of the Income Tax Act (Cap 134, 1992 Rev Ed) (which
                    is <em>in pari materia</em> with s 10(2)(<em>a</em>) of the Act) connoted a wider test than gains or
                    benefits that were “caused” by the employment. Mr Liu found
                    support for this view in, <em>inter alia</em>, the Canadian
                    Supreme Court case of <em>Nowegijick v The Queen</em>
                    (1983) 144 DLR (3d) 193,where Dickson J said (at 200):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The words “in respect of” are, in my opinion, words of the
                        widest possible scope. They import such meanings as “in relation
                        to”, “with reference to” or “in connection
                        with”. The phrase “in respect of” is probably the
                        widest of any expression intended to convey some connection between two
                        related subject-matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On this view, the court should adopt a wider approach under
                        s 10(2)(<em>a</em>) of the Act. On the other hand,
                    the phrase “by reason of … employment” in s 10(6) of
                    the Act seems to require a causal link between the benefit obtained and the
                    employment. This requirement may not, however, narrow the inquiry. If something
                    happens by reason of an <em>event</em>, it is easy to find
                    a causal link between the event and the consequence. But, where a benefit arises
                    by reason of a <em>relationship</em>, it is much more
                    difficult to pinpoint the causal links between the relationship and the benefit.
                    The truth of the matter is that both the phrases “in respect of”
                    in s 10(2)(<em>a</em>) of the Act and “by
                    reason of” in s 10(6) of the Act are imprecise. Mr Liu himself
                    acknowledged in his article that the phrase “in respect of
                    employment” was “vague and greatly lacking in content” (at
                    p 227). As such, I am unable to see, from a practical point of view, how
                        s 10(2)(<em>a</em>) of the Act may be
                    distinguished from s 10(6) of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In my opinion, the court should adopt the same
                    approach to both ss 10(2)(<em>a</em>) and 10(6) of the
                    Act in deciding whether a particular gain is “from any employment”
                    for the purposes of s 10(1)(<em>b</em>). Essentially,
                    both provisions focus on whether the benefit arose out of an employment
                    relationship. Beyond that, it is not very useful to examine the exact
                    differences in wording between the two provisions. Ultimately, reverting to
                    Upjohn J’s judgment in <em>Hochstrasser (HC)</em>, the question of whether a benefit arises
                    from employment depends heavily on the facts of each case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I would also hasten to clarify that it does
                    not necessarily mean that, just because a benefit is somehow connected with
                    employment, it follows that the benefit constitutes a benefit obtained by reason
                    of employment. The facts of <em>Hochstrasser (HL)</em>
                    itself provide a good example. There, the taxpayer was required by his employers
                    to transfer from one part of the country to another. He sold his existing house
                    at a loss, which was indemnified by the employers. The House of Lords held that
                    the indemnity was not taxable. The taxpayer had incurred a personal loss because
                    of the requirements of his employment, and the indemnity provided by the
                    employers was nothing in the nature of income. Although the payment could be
                    said to have arisen in respect of the employment or by reason of the employment
                    in a very broad sense, it was really not in the nature of employment income to
                    be taxed. The nature of and the circumstances surrounding a benefit obtained
                    within the context of an employment relationship must be looked at holistically.
                    Thus, the gains or profits derived from a benefit conferred on an employee by
                    reason of his employment need not necessarily be income which is taxable as
                    “gains or profits from any employment” (<em>per</em> s 10(1)(<em>b</em>) of the
                    Act).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Gains from employment distinguished from gifts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     A gain from employment should be distinguished
                    from a mere gift which accrues to the taxpayer in his personal capacity and
                    which is hence not taxable. Admittedly, in particular circumstances, the line
                    may not be so easily drawn. However, that there is such a distinction was
                    alluded to by Viscount Cave LC in <em>Seymour v
                        Reed</em> [1927] AC 554 at 559:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]t must now (I think) be taken as settled that [gains or benefits from
                        employment] include all payments made to the holder of an office or
                        employment as such, that is to say, by way of remuneration for his services,
                        even though such payments may be voluntary, but that they do not include a
                        mere gift or present (such as a testimonial) which is made to him on
                        personal grounds and not by way of payment for his services.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Atkinson J illustrated the distinction
                    thus in <em>Calvert (Inspector of Taxes) v Wainwright</em>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Suppose somebody … has the same taxi every day, which comes in the
                        morning as a matter of course to take him to his work, and then takes him
                        home at night. The ordinary tip given in those circumstances would be
                        something which would be assessable, but supposing at Christmas, or, when
                        the man is going for a holiday, the hirer says: “You have been very
                        attentive to me, here is a … 10<em>l</em>.
                        note,” he would be making a present, and I should say it would not be
                        assessable because it has been given to the man because of his qualities,
                        his faithfulness, and the way he has stuck to the passenger. In those
                        circumstances, it would, in my opinion, be a payment of an exceptional
                        kind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Viscount Cave’s judgment in
                        <em>Seymour v Reed</em> is also significant for the
                    principle that the voluntary nature of a payment does not necessarily mean that
                    the payment arises outside employment. This principle was elaborated on by
                    Fullagar J in the Australian High Court case of <em>Hayes v
                        Federal Commissioner of Taxation</em> (1956) 96 CLR 47 at
                    54:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A voluntary payment of money or transfer of property by A to B is prima
                        facie not income in B’s hands. If nothing more appears than that A
                        gave to B some money or a motor car or some shares, what B receives is
                        capital and not income. <em>But further facts may appear
                            which show that, although the payment or transfer was a
                            “gift” in the sense that it was made without legal
                            obligation, it was nevertheless so related to an employment of B by A,
                            or to services rendered by B to A, or to a business carried on by B,
                            that it is, in substance and in reality, not a mere gift but the product
                            of an income-earning activity on the part of B, and therefore to be
                            regarded as income from B’s personal exertion</em>. A very
                        simple case is the case where A employs B at a salary of £1000 per
                        annum, and at the end of a profitable year “gives” him a
                        “bonus” of £100. Obviously the bonus is income. It is
                        paid without obligation, but it is clearly in truth part of what B has
                        earned during the year. [original emphasis omitted; emphasis added in
                        italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I respectfully agree with Fullagar J that
                    a gratuitous payment made without any legal obligation attached to it should not
                    automatically be considered as arising outside employment. Many forms of
                    employee remuneration nowadays, such as performance bonuses and “golden
                    handshakes”, are voluntary in that they involve an element of discretion
                    and are not strictly payable under an employment contract. Yet, it is impossible
                    to regard such payments as anything other than payments arising out of
                    employment. Thus, the voluntary nature of a payment (or other benefit) is a
                    factor to be considered in determining whether that payment arises from
                    employment, but it is not conclusive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In this regard, another principle to note is
                    that, in determining whether a payment (or other benefit) arises out of
                    employment, the court should look at the true nature of the payment and not the
                    parties’ description of it. As Viscount Simon held in <em>Inland Revenue Commissioners v Wesleyan and General Assurance
                        Society</em> [1948] 1 All ER 555 at 557:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he name given to a transaction by the parties concerned does not
                        necessarily decide the nature of the transaction. To call a payment a loan
                        if it is really an annuity does not assist the taxpayer, any more than to
                        call an item a capital payment would prevent it from being regarded as an
                        income payment if that is its true nature. The question always is what is
                        the real character of the payment, not what the parties call it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Viscount Simon’s <em>dictum</em> was
                    applied by the High Court in <em>Pinetree Resort Pte Ltd v
                        Comptroller of Income Tax</em> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 275, where
                    the court found that “initiation deposits” paid to a club were not
                    in the nature of interest-free loans.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As mentioned at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>–<a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above,
                    whether a particular benefit is a gift or whether it arises by reason of
                    employment is a question to be decided on the facts of each case, and the fact
                    that the benefit in question is a reward for services is one relevant factor to
                    be taken into account. I now turn to the authorities to see what other factors
                    the courts have considered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Other relevant factors which distinguish between gains from
                employment and gifts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In <em>Cowan v Seymour
                        (Surveyor of Taxes)</em> [1920] 1 KB 500, the taxpayer acted
                    without remuneration as a company secretary for a company from the date of its
                    incorporation to the date of its liquidation. After the company’s
                    liquidation, there was a sum in hand, which the company’s shareholders
                    voted to award to the secretary. The English Court of Appeal held that the
                    payment did not accrue to the secretary in respect of an office or employment.
                    Lord Sterndale MR (at 509) identified two factors which heavily
                    influenced his decision: first, the payment had been made after the
                    secretary’s office had ended; and, second, the payment came not from the
                    company as employer, but from its shareholders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Similarly, in <em>Bridges
                        (Inspector of Taxes) v Hewitt</em> [1957] 1 WLR 674, two
                    directors who wished to acquire shares in a company agreed with the future
                    shareholders to continue working for the company, in return for which shares
                    would be transferred to them at a later date. The English Court of Appeal held,
                    by a majority, that the shares did not constitute remuneration for employment.
                    In particular, Morris LJ held at 695:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The circumstance that a large payment is to be made by someone other than
                        an employer may be a considerable indication, though by no means a
                        conclusive one, that the payment is not by way of remuneration. Remuneration
                        is, as a rule, something that an employer has arranged or contemplated or at
                        least knows about. This is so even though payments may come other than from
                        the employer and may depend on the liberality of others.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The purpose of the payment (or other benefit)
                    is also a relevant factor. In <em>Seymour v Reed</em>, the
                    committee of a cricket club granted a “benefit match” to a
                    professional cricketer who had been in the employment of the club for many
                    years. The proceeds of the match were held by the House of Lords not to
                    constitute profits from employment because they amounted to a one-off payment
                    which was meant to express the gratitude of the cricketer’s employers and
                    the cricket-loving public for what the cricketer had done, as well as their
                    appreciation of his personal qualities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     A case in contrast to <em>Seymour v Reed</em> is <em>Moorhouse (Inspector of
                        Taxes) v Dooland</em> [1955] Ch 284 (“<em>Moorhouse</em>”). In <em>Moorhouse</em>, a professional cricketer was awarded the proceeds
                    from collections taken from spectators on days when his play had been
                    particularly commendable. However, unlike <em>Seymour v
                        Reed</em>, the proceeds in <em>Moorhouse</em>
                    were held to arise out of the taxpayer’s employment. Sir Raymond
                    Evershed MR (at 297–298) distinguished <em>Seymour v
                        Reed</em> on the grounds that, in <em>Moorhouse</em>, it was a term of the taxpayer’s contract that
                    the taxpayer was entitled to have a collection taken for him when his
                    performance was exceptional. Jenkins LJ said at 304:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the recipient’s contract of employment entitles him to receive
                        the voluntary payment, whatever it may amount to, that is a ground, and I
                        should say a strong ground, for holding that, from the standpoint of the
                        recipient, it does accrue to him by virtue of his employment, or in other
                        words, by way of remuneration for his services.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In <em>Ball
                        (H M Inspector of Taxes) v Johnson</em> (1971)
                    47 TC 155 (“<em>Ball</em>”), a bank
                    clerk (and others holding similar positions) was required by his employer bank
                    to sit for certain examinations in order to better qualify himself for his
                    duties. Failure to pass these examinations did not bar him from continued
                    employment, but, if he passed, a cash award would be given by the bank. The bank
                    clerk passed the examinations and duly received this cash award. The award was
                    held not to be remuneration for employment because the sole reason for its
                    payment was the bank clerk’s success in passing the examinations. The
                    common thread running through these three cases –
                    <em>viz</em>, <em>Seymour v Reed</em>,
                        <em>Moorhouse</em> and <em>Ball</em> – is that a one-off payment is more likely to be
                    considered not to be a payment arising from employment if its purpose was to
                    congratulate the taxpayer for a personal achievement rather than to reward him
                    for his work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In <em>Laidler v Perry
                        (Inspector of Taxes)</em> [1966] AC 16, it was the practice
                    of a group of companies to give a £10 gift voucher every Christmas to every
                    employee who had worked for the group for more than a year. The House of Lords
                    held that the voucher constituted a profit from employment. The salient factors
                    in <em>Laidler v Perry</em> were that: (a) the
                    vouchers were given regularly at Christmas year after year; and (b) they
                    were given to every qualifying member of the staff (the qualifying members
                    numbered about 2,000 in total). The judgment of Lord Denning MR in the
                    English Court of Appeal (see <em>Laidler v Perry (Inspector of
                        Taxes</em>) [1965] Ch 192 at 199) shows that the value of
                    the gift was also significant:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Suppose it had been £100 a year which had been given to all the staff
                        of these companies each year at Christmas. In that case it would clearly be
                        open to the commissioners to find that it was a reward, a remuneration or a
                        return for services rendered. But now suppose that, instead of £100, it
                        was a box of chocolates or a bottle of whisky or £2, it might be merely
                        a gesture of goodwill at Christmas without regard to services at all. So it
                        is a question of degree.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     
          <em>Moore v Griffiths
                        (Inspector of Taxes)</em> [1972] 1 WLR 1024 is another
                    important case. There, a football player received a bonus from the English
                    Football Association (“the English FA”) for being a member of the
                    English team which won the World Cup in 1966. Brightman J held that the
                    bonus had “the quality of a testimonial or [an] accolade rather than the
                    quality of remuneration for services rendered” (at 1034). In so deciding,
                    he pointed (at 1035) to six factors in support of his conclusion, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     the payment had no foreseeable
                        element of recurrence;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     there was no expectation of reward;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_c"></a>(c)     the payment was made only after the
                        English FA had dispensed with the player’s
                    services;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_d"></a>(d)     the
                        English FA’s principal function was to promote the sport of football
                        and not to derive a benefit from the services of
                    footballers;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_e"></a>(e)     the
                        purpose of the English FA in making the payment was to mark its pride in a
                        great achievement rather than to remunerate the meritorious execution of the
                        player’s services; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_f"></a>(f)     each team member had been awarded the same amount,
                        regardless of how many times he played in the course of the World Cup
                        tournament and whether he was a player or a reserve.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The
                    sum was therefore not linked with the quantum of any services rendered by the
                    player.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     A contrasting decision was reached in
                        <em>Brumby (Inspector of Taxes) v Milner</em> [1976]
                    1 WLR 1096. In that case, a company which had a profit-sharing scheme
                    for its employees decided to merge with a larger company. In view of the merger,
                    the trustees of the scheme thought that the scheme was no longer viable. They
                    thus wound it up and distributed the funds among the employees. The House of
                    Lords held that the distributions to the employees were taxable as profits from
                    employment. Lord Kilbrandon, in rejecting the argument that the payment had
                    nothing to do with employment, said at 1101:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Certainly the money forming the payment became available in consequence of
                        certain events and decisions connected with the structure of the company.
                        But the sole reason for making the payment to the [taxpayer] was that he was
                        an employee, and the payment arose from his employment. It arose from
                        nothing else, as it would have done, if for example, it had been made to an
                        employee for some compassionate reason.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Summary of the law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In the light of all the above authorities, the
                    applicable principles may be summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_a"></a>(a)     Any gain or benefit obtained by a
                        person in his capacity as an employee would constitute a gain or benefit
                        from employment and is taxable as income.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_b"></a>(b)     A gift made to an employee on personal grounds
                        is not a benefit from employment, but the voluntary or discretionary nature
                        of a payment (or other benefit) will not <em>ipso
                            facto</em> render that payment a gift.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_c"></a>(c)     In determining whether a benefit is
                        obtained by reason of employment, the court will look at the true nature of
                        the benefit and not what the parties call it.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_d"></a>(d)     Whether a benefit is one arising from employment
                        ultimately depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. The court
                        will consider the following factors in answering this question (bearing in
                        mind that no single factor is conclusive and that it is the overall picture
                        which emerges that will be determinant):</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_38-p2_d-p3_i"></a>(i)       the value of the
                            benefit;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_38-p2_d-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       the purpose of the benefit;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_38-p2_d-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       the class of persons to whom the
                            benefit was granted;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_38-p2_d-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       whether the benefit was granted by the employer
                            or a third party;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_38-p2_d-p3_v"></a>(v)       whether the employment had ceased when the
                            benefit was granted;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_38-p2_d-p3_vi"></a>(vi)       whether the benefit had a foreseeable element
                            of recurrence;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_38-p2_d-p3_vii"></a>(vii)       whether the benefit was granted pursuant to
                            the terms of the contract of employment; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_38-p2_d-p3_viii"></a>(viii)       whether the benefit was
                            granted voluntarily.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application of the law to the present appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Reverting to the instant case, counsel for the
                    appellant, Mr Tan, submitted that the retention of the Share Options by the
                    Estate was not a benefit obtained by reason of the Taxpayer’s employment.
                    He relied on the wording of Rule 7.3 of the Share Option Plans, which (as
                    mentioned earlier at <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above) states that
                    the share options given to a Participant (as defined at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above) would <em>prima facie</em> lapse
                    upon his death. Mr Tan therefore argued that the subsequent decision of the
                    Committees to restore the Share Options was in the nature of a gift to the
                    Estate (which, for practical purposes, meant the Taxpayer’s family)
                    because the Share Options had originally become void at the time of the
                    Taxpayer’s death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In contrast, counsel for the respondent,
                    Ms Joanna Yap (“Ms Yap”), argued that the Share Options
                    did not lapse upon the Taxpayer’s death because Rule 7.3 of the Share
                    Option Plans also provided that these options would lapse <em>unless</em> the Committees in their discretion determined otherwise.
                    Ms Yap submitted that, based on the wording of Rule 7.3, the decision
                    of the Committees effectively meant that the Share Options never lapsed upon the
                    Taxpayer’s death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     As I see it, the focus of the inquiry should
                    be on the substance of the transaction as a whole, rather than the exact
                    mechanism or the exact wording of the provision by which the Share Options were
                    conferred on the Estate. As mentioned earlier (at <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> above), in determining whether a payment (or other benefit)
                    arises from employment, the court should look at the true nature of the payment
                    and not what the parties call it. It would be most undesirable if an employer
                    and an employee can contractually determine the latter’s tax liability
                    through the use of appropriate labels. Ultimately, the Share Options were
                    retained by the Estate through the exercise of the Committees’ discretion.
                    Whether or not these options lapsed at the time of the Taxpayer’s death
                    and were subsequently restored, or whether they remained valid all along, is not
                    crucial to the overall picture. What matters more are the circumstances
                    surrounding the exercise of discretion by the Committees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     As I see it, in determining whether the
                    retention of the Share Options by the Estate should be considered a benefit or
                    gain arising from the Taxpayer’s employment, three factors are highly
                    pertinent. First, the value of the benefits derived by the Estate from the
                    exercise of the Share Options is very considerable – over $8m in total
                    (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above). The size of the benefits
                    seems more commensurate with their being remuneration to the Taxpayer as a
                    senior employee of the Companies, rather than a condolence gift or a token of
                    appreciation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Second, I find that the Committees’
                    purpose in allowing the Estate to retain the Share Options was to reward the
                    Taxpayer for the services which he had rendered. Rule 3 of the Share Option
                    Plans states <em>vis-à-vis</em> each Company’s
                        plan:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Plan is a share incentive scheme. The Plan is proposed on the basis
                        that it is important to retain staff whose contributions are essential to
                        the well-being and prosperity of the Group [<em>ie</em>, the Companies] and to give recognition to outstanding
                        executives and executive directors of the Group … The Plan will give
                        Participants an opportunity to have a personal equity interest in the
                        Company at no direct cost to its profitability …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Rule 3 of the Share Option Plans clearly
                    indicates that the object behind these plans was to grant share options to
                    Participants as a reward for their services rather than as a personal gift to
                    them. Although no evidence was called from the Committees’ members as to
                    their reason or purpose for exercising their discretion to allow the Estate to
                    retain the Share Options, there is nothing to suggest that their objective was
                    in any way different from that which underlies Rule 3. The sole function of
                    the Committees was to administer the Share Option Plans. It was certainly not
                    part of the mandate of the Committees to grant condolence gifts or any other
                    largesse to the Companies’ employees. Accordingly, there is no basis for
                    me to find that, in allowing the Estate to retain the Share Options, the
                    Committees intended to do something outside the objective of the Share Option
                    Plans. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is reasonable to presume
                    that the Committees’ reason or purpose for allowing the Estate to retain
                    the Share Options was to reward the Taxpayer for his past
                services.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Third and most importantly, the retention of
                    the Share Options by the Estate was something that was expressly contemplated
                    and provided for in the Share Option Plans. If, under the rules of the Share
                    Options Plans, the share options held by a Participant unconditionally lapsed
                    upon his death without any provision for restoration such as that set out in
                    Rule 7.3, and if the Companies, purely out of goodwill or compassion to the
                    family of a deceased Participant, then allowed his estate to retain <em>some</em> share options, that could perhaps make a
                    difference. In this case, however, the possibility of the Estate retaining the
                    Share Options upon the death of the Taxpayer had always been part and parcel of
                    the latter’s terms of employment. This is a strong indicator that the
                    retention of the Share Options by the Estate constituted a benefit obtained by
                    reason of the Taxpayer’s employment, notwithstanding the element of
                    discretion present in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Mr Tan submitted that it made no
                    difference whether or not the retention of the Share Options by the Estate was
                    contemplated by the Taxpayer’s terms of employment, and relied in this
                    regard on the case of <em>Commissioner for Inland Revenue v Shell
                        Southern Africa Pension Fund</em> (1983) 46 SATC 1
                        (“<em>Shell Southern Africa</em>”). In
                        <em>Shell Southern Africa</em>, the rules of a pension
                    fund (“the Fund”) provided that, if a male pensioner died, his
                    widows or dependants would be entitled to a pension of an amount to be
                    determined according to the rules of the Fund. The rules further provided that
                    the committee responsible for administering the Fund had the discretion to
                    commute the whole or any part of a pension to a single lump sum. A dispute arose
                    between the Fund and the Commissioner for Inland Revenue over the effect of
                    para 3 (as it stood at the material time) of the Second Schedule to the
                    Income Tax Act (Act 58 of 1962) (South Africa) (“the South African
                    Act”), which read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Any lump sum benefit which becomes recoverable <em>in
                            consequence of or following upon</em> the death of a member of a
                        pension fund, provident fund or retirement annuity fund shall be deemed to
                        be a lump sum benefit which accrued to such member immediately prior to his
                        death … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Paragraph 3 of the Second Schedule to the
                    South African Act was significant because s 1(<em>e</em>) of that Act defined the “gross income” of a
                    taxpayer as including:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… any amount determined in accordance with the provisions of the
                        Second Schedule in respect of lump sum benefits received by or accrued to
                        such person from any fund …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The issue in <em>Shell Southern Africa</em> was
                    whether a lump sum paid out to a deceased male pensioner’s widows or
                    dependants by the Fund pursuant to the exercise of the committee’s
                    discretion constituted a lump sum benefit within the meaning of para 3 of
                    the Second Schedule to the South African Act. The Supreme Court of South Africa
                    answered this question in the negative. It held (at 9) that the exercise of
                    discretion by the Fund’s committee constituted an intervening event that
                    broke the chain of causation between a male pensioner’s death and the
                    recoverability of the lump sum benefit by that pensioner’s widows or
                    dependants. Thus, the payment of a lump sum by the Fund to the widows or
                    dependants of a deceased male pensioner would not be “in consequence of
                    or following upon” (<em>per</em> para 3 of the
                    Second Schedule to the South African Act) the death of the pensioner
                    concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Mr Tan submitted that the facts of the
                    present case were even stronger than those in <em>Shell Southern
                        Africa</em>. While the widows and dependants in <em>Shell Southern Africa</em> already had a right to payment from the
                    Fund, the Estate in the present case had no right to retain the Share Options if
                    the Committees did not exercise their discretion in its favour. Therefore,
                    Mr Tan contended, the fact that the retention of the Share Options was
                    originally contemplated in the Share Option Plans was immaterial because the
                    exercise of discretion by the Committees was an intervening factor that broke
                    the link between the Taxpayer’s employment and the Estate’s
                    retention of the Share Options.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I am unable to agree with this submission.
                    With respect, counsel seems to have missed the point that the decision in
                        <em>Shell Southern Africa</em> did not concern the
                    question of whether a lump sum payment made pursuant to the rules of the Fund
                    was employment income. Instead, the issue there was whether such a payment fell
                    within a specific statutory provision (<em>ie</em>,
                    para 3 of the Second Schedule to the South African Act) and, in particular,
                    whether such a payment was in consequence of or following upon the death of the
                    male pensioner concerned. The judgment of the court (at 8) made it very clear
                    that this was essentially a question of causation. The inquiry was thus a linear
                    one, namely: did the death of the male pensioner concerned cause the ultimate
                    result, <em>ie</em>, the payment of a lump sum to his
                    widows or dependants? The court, having answered this question in the negative,
                    naturally had to rule that such a lump sum payment did not come within
                    para 3 of the Second Schedule to the South African Act. The fact that a
                    deceased male pensioner’s widows or dependants had a prior right to
                    payment from the Fund in the form of annuities was irrelevant because it was the
                    exercise of the committee’s discretion that converted this right into a
                    lump sum payment – that was the crux of the dispute before the court in
                        <em>Shell Southern Africa</em>, and it was determinant
                    of the eventual outcome in that case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In contrast, and unlike the circumstances in
                        <em>Shell Southern Africa</em>, the court, in
                    determining whether a gain or benefit arises from employment, has to consider
                    all the relevant factors in a holistic manner. In my judgment, the three factors
                    enumerated above (at <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>–<a href="#p1_45">[45]</a>), taken together, show quite clearly that the
                    Share Options were allowed to be retained by the Estate by reason of the
                    Taxpayer’s employment with the Companies. These factors far outweigh the
                    following factors which tend to support the opposite conclusion (<em>viz</em>, that the retention of the Share Options by the
                    Estate did not constitute a benefit obtained by reason of the Taxpayer’s
                    employment), namely: (a) the retention of the Share Options was a one-off
                    benefit to the Estate; (b) the benefit was granted to the Estate after the
                    Taxpayer’s employment had ceased; and (c) the conferment of the
                    benefit was discretionary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Mr Tan next relied on the case of
                        <em>Wilcock</em> and submitted that the facts in the
                    present case were indistinguishable from those in <em>Wilcock</em>. In <em>Wilcock</em>, the taxpayer
                    was granted share options in his employer’s parent company which he could
                    originally have exercised at a future point in time. However, the employer
                    ceased to be a subsidiary of the parent company and the share options lapsed.
                    The parent company, in order to maintain its reputation for fair dealing,
                    decided to make an <em>ex gratia</em> payment of
                    £10,000 to the taxpayer. This payment was held not to be
                taxable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In my view, the facts in <em>Wilcock</em> are hardly the same as those in the present case and are
                    distinguishable as follows. In <em>Wilcock</em>, the
                    taxpayer was compensated for the loss of a right to exercise share options at a
                    future point in time, and the payment was made entirely <em>ex
                        gratia</em>. It did not arise from the terms of the share option
                    scheme in question, unlike the present case, where the rules of the Share Option
                    Plans expressly provide that, upon the death of a Participant, the Committees
                    can allow the estate of the deceased Participant to retain the share options. In
                    the present case, the share options retained by the Estate were precisely the
                    Share Options as defined at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above. The
                    Estate did not receive any compensatory payment; instead, it was allowed to
                    retain the Share Options. Since s 10(6) of the Act and the former
                    s 10(5) deem gains derived from share options which are granted to a
                    taxpayer by reason of his office or employment to be “gains or profits
                    from … employment” within the meaning of s 10(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Act, all that the respondent needs to show is
                    that the Share Options were obtained by the Estate by reason of the
                    Taxpayer’s employment. As far as this point is concerned, it is abundantly
                    clear (see <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>–<a href="#p1_45">[45]</a> above) that the Estate was allowed to retain
                    the Share Options because of the Taxpayer’s employment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Lastly, Mr Tan relied on three cases
                    which were cited before the Board in the proceedings below, namely, <em>Income Tax Case No 1386</em> (1984) 46 SATC 116,
                        <em>Secretary for Inland Revenue v Watermeyer</em>
                    (1965) 4 SA 431 and <em>Turner (Surveyor of Taxes) v
                        Cuxon</em> (1889) 22 QBD 150. Mr Tan’s main
                    contention was that the payments in these three cases were held not to be
                    taxable in circumstances which, he submitted, were indistinguishable from those
                    in the present case. I have read these cases and the only common factor in them,
                    as well as in the present case, is the fact that the payment in question was
                    discretionary. Beyond that, I do not propose to examine each case in detail. I
                    have already indicated earlier (at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>
                    above) that the voluntary nature of a payment does not conclusively show that
                    the payment arose outside an employment relationship. I respectfully agree with
                    the Board’s conclusion that each case has to be looked at on its own
                    facts. I am accordingly of the view that the retention of the Share Options by
                    the Estate was a benefit arising from the Taxpayer’s employment, despite
                    the exercise of discretion by the Committees.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The second issue: Whether s 10(6) of the Act and the former
                s 10(5) apply to share options retained by a deceased taxpayer’s
                estate</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     I now turn to the second issue to be decided
                    in this appeal, <em>viz</em>, whether s 10(6) of the
                    Act and the former s 10(5) apply to share options retained by a deceased
                    taxpayer’s estate. This issue essentially turns on a construction of these
                    two provisions. In this regard, I note that s 9A(1) of the Interpretation
                    Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) requires the court, in construing a statute,
                    to adopt an interpretation that would promote the legislative purpose or object
                    underlying the statute. This provision applies to all written law and
                    effectively displaces the common law principle that tax statutes should be
                    interpreted strictly in favour of the taxpayer. As the High Court put it in
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Low Kok Heng</em> [2007]
                    4 SLR(R) 183 at [41]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Section 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act requires the construction of
                        written law to promote the purpose or object underlying the statute. In
                        fact, it <em>mandates</em> that a construction
                        promoting legislative purpose be preferred over one that does not promote
                        such purpose or object: see Brady Coleman, “The Effect of
                        Section 9A of the Interpretation Act on Statutory Interpretation in
                        Singapore” [2000] Sing JLS 152 at 154. Accordingly, any common
                        law principle of interpretation, such as the plain meaning rule and the
                        strict construction rule, must yield to the purposive interpretation
                        approach stipulated by s 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act. <em>All</em> written law (penal or otherwise) must be
                        interpreted purposively. Other common law principles come into play
                            <em>only</em> when their application coincides with
                        the purpose underlying the written law in question, or alternatively, when
                        ambiguity in that written law persists even after an attempt at purposive
                        interpretation has been properly made. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, in interpreting s 10(6) of the Act and the former
                    s 10(5), the court must give paramount weight to the legislative intention
                    behind these two provisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The former s 10(5) was first introduced
                    into our legislation as s 10(5) of the Income Tax Act (Cap 141,
                    1970 Rev Ed) via s 3 of the Income Tax (Amendment) Act 1973
                    (Act 26 of 1973) (“the 1973 Amendment Act”). Mr Tan
                    referred me to the following extract from the second reading of the Income Tax
                    (Amendment) Bill 1973 (Bill 42 of 1973) –
                    <em>ie</em>, the Bill which was subsequently enacted as the
                    1973 Amendment Act – in <em>Singapore Parliamentary
                        Debates, Official Report</em> (26 July 1973) vol 32 at
                    cols 1244–1245 (Hon Sui Sen, Minister for Finance):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Stock Exchange[,] which witnessed a lot of speculative activity last
                        year, also saw the emergence of “share option schemes”. Such
                        share option schemes allow directors and employees to take an option to buy
                        shares in the company at often a nominal price. Clause 3 of the Income
                        Tax [(Amendment) Bill 1973 (Bill 42 of 1973)] will make it clear beyond
                        doubt that gains or profits from share option schemes are liable to income
                        tax.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Mr Tan drew my attention in particular to
                    the phrase “directors and employees” in the above quotation and
                    submitted that Parliament’s intention in enacting the former s 10(5)
                    was to tax gains derived from share options given to living directors and
                    employees only. I cannot agree with this submission. Reading the above extract
                    as a whole, it is clear that the phrase “directors and employees”
                    was merely being used in a descriptive sense to identify the usual beneficiaries
                    of a share option scheme. Nothing in the speech of the then Minister for Finance
                    suggests that Parliament intended to distinguish between a living employee and
                    the estate of a deceased employee, or to treat gains derived by the estate from
                    the deceased employee’s share options more favourably. On the contrary,
                    the last sentence of the above passage affirms my belief that Parliament simply
                    intended to tax all gains derived from share options obtained by reason of a
                    taxpayer’s employment. Indeed, it would make absolutely no sense if the
                    taxability of gains derived from such share options were to depend on whether or
                    not, at the time of the grant of the options, the employee was still
                    alive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The former s 10(5) was amended by the
                    Income Tax (Amendment) Act 2002 (Act 37 of 2002), and subsequently
                    re-numbered to become s 10(6) of the Act. The only difference between the
                    two provisions is that s 10(6) of the Act expressly deems gains derived
                    from share options to be chargeable to tax under s 10(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Act, whereas the former s 10(5) does not
                    expressly indicate a head of income under s 10(1). Like the former
                    s 10(5), s 10(6) of the Act does not draw a distinction between living
                    and deceased employees. Accordingly, I am of the view that both provisions apply
                    to gains derived from share options retained by the estate of a deceased
                    employee as long as the options are shown to have been obtained by reason of
                    that person’s employment, which the respondent has done in this
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Mr Tan also referred me to
                        ss 10(6)(<em>d</em>) and 10(6)(<em>e</em>) of the Act, which provide that any gains or profits derived
                    from share options obtained by reason of a taxpayer’s office or employment
                    shall be deemed to accrue at such time and to be of such amount as determined by
                    the following mechanisms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>d</em>)    … any gains
                            or profits derived by <em>him</em> [<em>ie</em>, the taxpayer] by any exercise of a right or
                            benefit to acquire shares in any company listed on the Singapore
                            Exchange shall be the last done price on the listing date of the shares
                            so acquired less the amount paid for the shares;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>e</em>)    “the last
                            done price on the listing date”, in relation to any shares
                            referred to in paragraph (<em>d</em>), means
                            the price of the shares in the open market at the last transaction on
                            the date on which the shares are first listed on the Singapore Exchange
                            after the acquisition of the shares by <em>him</em>
                            …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Sections 10(6)(<em>d</em>) and
                        10(6)(<em>e</em>) of the Act are substantially similar
                    to, respectively, sub-paras (<em>c</em>) and
                        (<em>d</em>) of the former s 10(5).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Mr Tan contended that the use of the word
                    “him” in ss 10(6)(<em>d</em>) and
                        10(6)(<em>e</em>) of the Act indicated that the whole
                    of s 10 was meant to apply to living employees who exercised their share
                    options in the open market. As such, s 10(6) of the Act and the former
                    s 10(5) would not be applicable to deceased employees as they would have
                    had no opportunity to exercise the share options which had been granted to them
                    while they were alive. For the reasons set out at <a href="#p1_55">[55]</a>–<a href="#p1_57">[57]</a> above, I
                    have no hesitation in rejecting this argument. Sections 10(6)(<em>d</em>) and 10(6)(<em>e</em>) of the Act
                    merely set out a mechanism for valuing gains derived from share options obtained
                    by reason of a taxpayer’s employment where the company in question is a
                    listed company. They do not change the overall purpose of s 10(6) of the
                    Act (and also the former s 10(5)), which is to deem such gains to be
                    taxable income regardless of whether the share options were given to an employee
                    before his death or whether they were restored to his estate pursuant to the
                    rules of the relevant share option scheme after his death. The personal
                    representatives of a deceased employee’s estate are just as capable of
                    exercising (or otherwise realising) the share options and obtaining gains in the
                    open market.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     For the foregoing reasons, I find that the
                    Share Options retained by the Estate constituted a benefit which arose by reason
                    of the Taxpayer’s employment with the Companies, and that s 10(6) of
                    the Act and the former s 10(5) apply to the gains derived by the Estate in
                    exercising those share options. Accordingly, I affirm the decision of the Board
                    and dismiss this appeal with costs and the usual consequential
                orders.</p>
