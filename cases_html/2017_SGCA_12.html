She was 40 years old at the time of the incident leading to her arrest. At the conclusion of the trial, the trial judge (“the Judge”) convicted her on a charge under s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”) for having imported crystalline substance weighing 2951.12g which was analysed and found to contain not less than 2309.45g of methamphetamine into Changi Airport Terminal 1, Singapore, on 3 September 2012 at about 10.10pm. The charge involved a capital offence. However, as the Judge found that the Appellant’s role in the transaction was limited to that of a courier within the meaning of s 33B of the MDA and since the Public Prosecutor had issued a certificate of substantive assistance under the same provision, the Judge exercised his discretion to sentence her to life imprisonment instead of the death penalty, with the sentence backdated to the date of her arrest on 3 September 2012. As the Appellant is a female, the mandatory minimum sentence of 15 strokes of the cane was not imposed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The central issue in this appeal is whether the Judge was correct in deciding that the Appellant failed to rebut the presumptions of possession and knowledge in ss 18(1) and (2) of the MDA. The issue of whether the Appellant had knowledge of the presence and the nature of the drugs arose because the methamphetamine was concealed in digital video disc (“DVD”) players, sandals and tin cans with food labels (see [3] below). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts and the investigations  </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The facts pertaining to the offence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Appellant is now 44 years old. She was born in Accra, Ghana. On 3 September 2012, at about 9pm, she arrived at Changi Airport Terminal 1. She had travelled from Kotoka International Airport in Accra and transited at Dubai before arriving here. At about 9.20pm, she was stopped by an officer from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”), Sergeant Muhammad Ridhuan bin Ariffin (“Sgt Ridhuan”), as part of a routine check. Sgt Ridhuan stated in his statement that this was because he found her behaviour suspicious as “she avoided eye contact and was looking down most of the time”.

Her belongings were screened through an X-ray machine and anomalies were detected in the images of some items in her haversack. The suspected items were individually screened using the X-ray machine. In the Appellant’s presence, CNB officers broke open the suspected items and found the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) two blocks of crystalline substance (marked as “A1A1”) were found in a “Heinz Beanz” tin can;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b)  two blocks of crystalline substance (marked as “A2A1”) were found in a “Sunripe Whole Sweetcorn” tin can;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) two packets of crystalline substance (marked as “A3”) were found inside a pair of ladies sandals bearing the brand “Shoes Story”;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) two packets of crystalline substance (marked as “A4”) were found inside another pair of ladies sandals also bearing the brand “Shoes Story”; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) five packets of crystalline substance (marked as “A5A1”, “A5B” and “A5C” respectively), which were separately wrapped in aluminium foil, were found in a silver-grey DVD player with the brand “Chusei”;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) a packet of crystalline substance (marked as “A6A”), which was wrapped in aluminium foil, was found inside a power adapter; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) five packets of crystalline substance (one marked as “A7A” and four others marked as “A7B”) were found in a black DVD player with the brand “Chusei”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">All the exhibits of crystalline substance were sent to the Health Sciences Authority subsequently for analysis and they were found to amount to a total of 2951.12g of crystalline substance which contained not less than 2309.45g of methamphetamine. We will refer to the various items containing crystalline substance listed above as “the Items”. After a contemporaneous statement was taken from the Appellant, a search of her body revealed cash in US$100 notes amounting to US$2,900 and a black Nokia mobile phone hidden at the Appellant’s hip area, between the Appellant’s tights and panties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 While the Appellant was being questioned by the CNB officers after the arrest, she received numerous calls from various Ghanaian phone numbers which were not answered. Early the next day (4 September 2012), just after 6.00am, the CNB officers asked the Appellant to return the call of the last caller. The conversation, partly in English and partly in the Twi language, that the Appellant had with the male caller, whom she addressed as “Bra Kwaku” and whom she claimed was the person who gave her the Items, was recorded. The conversation was transcribed with the relevant portions in Twi language translated into English. The transcripts are marked as Exhibit “P59”.

</div> Not much can be gathered from the conversation apart from the fact that the male caller demanded to know why she had not answered his calls the night before and appeared concerned about whether something had happened. The Appellant lied to the male caller that she was in her hotel room and that she had not called him earlier because she was tired and had fallen asleep in the hotel room.

</div> She claimed that a man had given her the Items at the airport in Ghana and had offered to pay for her air ticket and accommodation in Singapore if she agreed to deliver the Items for him. She also gave information on an exchange between the man and herself while she was in transit in Dubai. She said that the man told her over the phone that the laptop and the shoes that she was carrying were also known as “shine shine” and when she enquired further, he said that he would explain to her when she reached Singapore. She also said that the man told her that the recipient of the Items would give her $5,000 and that he would subsequently advise her on how that was to be dealt with. She claimed that she had no knowledge of the contents in the Items and “was basically asked to deliver the items in return for the free tickets and accomodation” (error in spelling in the original).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The long statements </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 In the course of the next two weeks, six long statements were recorded from the Appellant. The Appellant provided some background information about herself in the first long statement recorded on 6 September 2012. She said that she lived in Accra with her four children, whom she adopted after her sister passed away. Her husband was working as a trailer driver in the USA and he would remit to her about US$150 to US$250 every three to four months. The Appellant said that she studied only up to Form 4 of Middle School, which is slightly higher than Primary Six under the Singapore system. The Appellant said that she worked as a trader in many types of clothing and accessories for a living. On average, she earned about 100 GHS (new Ghanaian currency) per month (or about one million Cedis). She also stated that she withdrew her savings, which amounted to 160 GHS, and passed them to her children before she left for Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The Appellant gave a detailed account of the events leading up to her arrest in the subsequent statements.

Notwithstanding this, he found her “reasonably articulate, confident and intelligent”. He found that the “changes, inconsistencies and illogicality in her evidence” could not be attributed to bad memory or other more innocent reasons such as her lack of education but were due to a “reluctance to tell the truth and a propensity to change her narration of the facts and retract troublesome admissions”.

Section 18 provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Presumption of possession and knowledge of controlled drugs</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">18.</span>—(1) Any person who is proved to have had in his possession or custody or under his control —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)    anything containing a controlled drug;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)    the keys of anything containing a controlled drug;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)    the keys of any place or premises or any part thereof in which a controlled drug is found; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)    a document of title relating to a controlled drug or any other document intended for the delivery of a controlled drug,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that drug in his possession.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)    Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)    The presumptions provided for in this section shall not be rebutted by proof that the accused never had physical possession of the controlled drug.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4)    Where one of 2 or more persons with the knowledge and consent of the rest has any controlled drug in his possession, it shall be deemed to be in the possession of each and all of them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">These two presumptions were introduced to overcome the practical difficulty faced by the Prosecution of proving possession and knowledge on the part of the accused (<span class="font-italic">Tan Kiam Peng v Public Prosecutor</span> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Kiam Peng</span>”) at [55]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Section 18(1) lists certain circumstances under which a person is presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession. For the purposes of s 18(1), what we are concerned with is whether the thing in issue exists and whether the accused in fact has possession, control or custody of the thing in issue. The thing in issue is the container, the key or the document of title. In this sense, this provision deals with secondary possession of the drug in that the accused possesses, controls or has custody of something which has the drug or which relates to the title in, or delivery of, the drug. As is evident in s 18(3), the accused does not need to be in physical possession of the drug, <span class="font-italic">ie </span>primary possession. At this stage, we are also not concerned with the qualities of the drug. In this regard, we respectfully disagree with the observations of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Mohsen bin Na’im </span>[2016] SGHC 150 at [115(a)(i)] in so far as the court suggested that knowledge that the item was a controlled drug is necessary to satisfy the requirement of possession. Once the prosecution proves that the thing in issue exists and that the accused has possession, control or custody of the thing in issue, the effect of s 18(1) is to raise a presumption of fact, which is that the accused, by virtue of his possession, control or custody of the thing in issue, is presumed to possess the drugs which are contained in or are related to the thing in issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 To rebut the presumption in s 18(1), the accused has to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not have the drug in his possession. In this context, the most obvious way in which the presumption can be rebutted is by establishing that the accused did not know that the thing in issue contained that which is shown to be the drug in question. Thus, for instance, the presumption could be rebutted successfully if the accused is able to persuade the court that the drug was slipped into his bag or was placed in his vehicle or his house without his knowledge. The inquiry under s 18(1) does not extend to the accused’s knowledge of the <span class="font-italic">nature </span>of the drug. That is dealt with under the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2) where a person who is proved or presumed to be in possession of a controlled drug is presumed to have known “the nature of that drug”. As clarified by this court in <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam v Public Prosecutor</span> [2011] 4 SLR 1156 (“<span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span>”) at [23]–[24], the nature of the drug refers to the specific controlled drug found in his possession (for instance, methamphetamine or diamorphine). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Where the presumption in s 18(1) of the MDA is invoked by the Prosecution and is then rebutted successfully by the accused, the Prosecution would have failed to prove that the accused was in possession of the drug. There would be no need to consider the next issue of whether the accused had knowledge of the nature of the drug. However, if an accused is either (a) proved to have had the controlled drug in his possession; or (b) presumed under s 18(1) of the MDA to have had the controlled drug in his possession and the contrary is not proved, the presumption under s 18(2) that he has knowledge of the nature of the drug would be invoked. This follows because an accused person, who, it has been established, was in possession of the controlled drug should be taken to know the nature of that drug unless he can demonstrate otherwise. To rebut the presumption in s 18(2), the accused must prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not have knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug (in effect, that he did not have the <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>of the offence). In <span class="font-italic">Dinesh Pillai a/l K Raja Retnam v Public Prosecutor</span> [2012] 2 SLR 903 (“<span class="font-italic">Dinesh Pillai</span>”), this court observed (at [18]) that the accused can do so by showing that “he did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have known the nature of the controlled drug”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Contrary to the concerns in some quarters that <span class="font-italic">Dinesh Pillai</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>has modified the test of<span class="font-italic"> </span>knowledge in s 18(2) such that mere negligence or constructive knowledge on the part of the accused suffices to convict him, we do not think that the above-mentioned pronouncement in that case purported to do anything of that sort. This has already been made clear in the recent decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Masoud Rahimi bin Mehrzad v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</span> [2016] SGCA 69. The court assesses the accused’s evidence as to his subjective knowledge by comparing it with what an ordinary, reasonable person would have known or done if placed in the same situation that the accused was in. If such an ordinary, reasonable person would surely have known or taken steps to establish the nature of the drug in question, the accused would have to adduce evidence to persuade the court that nevertheless he, for reasons special to himself or to his situation,<span class="font-italic"> </span>did not have such knowledge or did not take such steps. It would then be for the court to assess the credibility of the accused’s account on a balance of probabilities. The onus on the accused has not changed after <span class="font-italic">Dinesh Pillai</span>.<span class="font-italic"> </span>His duty is still the same. To rebut the presumption in s 18(2), he must lead evidence to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not have knowledge of the nature of the drug.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 When the presumptions in ss 18(1) and (2) of the MDA apply, the accused stands before the court presumed to have been in possession of the drug and to have known the nature of the drug that he was carrying and, in the present case, importing. If the accused elects to remain silent and does not make his defence, he can be convicted on the relevant charge on the basis of the presumptions that operate against him. If he elects to make his defence but calls no evidence or inadequate evidence to rebut the presumptions, he can similarly be convicted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In a case where the accused is seeking to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA, as a matter of common sense and practical application, he should be able to say what he thought or believed he was carrying, particularly when the goods have to be carried across international borders as they could be prohibited goods or goods which are subject to tax. It would not suffice for the accused to claim simply that he did not know what he was carrying save that he did not know or think it was drugs. If such a simplistic claim could rebut the presumption in s 18(2), the presumption would be all bark and no bite. Similarly, he would not be able to rebut the presumption as to knowledge by merely claiming that he did not know the proper name of the drug that he was asked to carry. The law also does not require him to know the scientific or the chemical name of the drug or the effects that the drug could bring about. The presumption under s 18(2) operates to vest the accused with knowledge of the nature of the drug which he is in possession of and to rebut this, he must give an account of what he thought it was.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Where the accused has stated what he thought he was carrying (“the purported item”), the court will assess the veracity of his assertion against the objective facts and examine his actions relating to the purported item. This assessment will naturally be a highly fact-specific inquiry. For example, the court will generally consider the nature, the value and the quantity of the purported item and any reward for transporting such an item. If it is an ordinary item that is easily available in the country of receipt, the court would want to know why it was necessary for him to transport it from another country. If it is a perishable or fragile item, the court would consider whether steps were taken to preserve it or to prevent damage to it. If it is a precious item, the court would consider whether steps were taken to keep it safe from loss through theft or otherwise. If it is a dangerous item, the court would consider how the item was packed and handled. Ultimately, what the court is concerned with is the credibility and veracity of the accused’s account (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether his assertion that he did not know the nature of the drugs is true). This depends not only on the credibility of the accused<span class="font-italic"> </span>as a witness but also on how believable his account relating to the purported item is. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Of course, apart from availing itself of the presumptions, the Prosecution may also prove that the accused had actual possession and actual knowledge of the drugs. In such a case, the presumptions are still operable even though they need not be invoked (<span class="font-italic">Tan Kiam Peng</span> at [54]). It is also clear from previous cases that a finding of wilful blindness is simply the inference of actual knowledge that is drawn because it is the only rational and therefore irresistible inference on the facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 With these legal principles in mind, we turn to the facts of the present case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Appellant was in possession of the methamphetamine  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The Judge accepted the Prosecution’s submission that the Appellant had admitted in her fifth long statement recorded on 14 September 2012 that she knew that the Items <span class="font-italic">contained </span>“shine shine” and had identified the methamphetamine as “shine shine” when she was shown the photographs. On appeal, the Appellant argues, as she did before the Judge, that this was not the meaning of the relevant portion of her statement because she was merely telling the interpreter that she recognised the methamphetamine as “shine shine” as she recognised it as the thing that was taken out of the Items after her arrest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Having examined the relevant portion of the statement (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, paragraphs 67 to 69), we accept the Appellant’s submission and respectfully disagree with the Judge’s finding on this issue. The meaning of this part of the statement becomes clearer when the relevant portion is set out in full (as opposed to the truncated version provided by the Prosecution which is set out at [21] above):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">67 I recognize the laptop marked ‘A5’ in Photo 12 and 13.

I believe the shiny item shown in photo 16 is the “shine shine” that Kwaku was talking about. I recognize the laptop shown in Photo 17. I believe the shiny item in the laptop shown in the photo is “shine shine”. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">68 I recognize the items marked ‘A5B’ and ‘A5C’ in Photo 18 as the “shine shine” that was taken out of the laptop. I recognize the item marked ‘A6’ in Photo 19 and Photo 20. <span class="font-italic">I first saw it during the photo taking after my arrest. </span>I know it was taken out from one of the items in my haversack.

It is the laptop taken out of my haversack after the X-ray scanning. I recognize the item marked ‘A7A’ in Photo 24. It is the “shine shine” and <span class="font-italic">I first saw it when it was taken out of the laptop during the photo taking after my arrest</span>. I recognize the photo marked ‘A7’ in Photo 25 as the same laptop taken out of my haversack after the X-ray scanning. The shiny items shown in Photo 26 are the “shine shine” taken out of the laptop. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">We do not think that the relevant portion of the statement can be construed as an admission on the Appellant’s part that she knew all along that the Items contained “shine shine” and that “shine shine” was methamphetamine. A more natural reading of the paragraphs suggests that all she was saying was that she recognised the methamphetamine as the thing that was retrieved from the Items and which was shown to her <span class="font-italic">after </span>her arrest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 We are thus unable to agree with the Judge that actual possession was proved. The next question is whether the presumption of possession in s 18(1) of the MDA was rebutted. The Judge observed at [25] of his grounds of decision that in any event, even if he was wrong to have found actual possession, this presumption would apply. In this regard, the Appellant asserted that she did not know there was anything hidden in the Items at all and she thought that “shine shine” referred to the laptop (that is, the DVD player).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Looking at the evidence and the circumstances of this case, we are of the view that the presumption in s 18(1) was not rebutted. The Appellant’s evidence that she was an unsuspecting victim who was used by Kwaku as an unwitting drug courier was not believable. By her own account, she did not know Mama and Kwaku so well that she could repose so much trust in them, particularly Kwaku. Mama was merely someone she had met in the bus terminal or the market and yet she was willing to accept the offer to sponsor her on a trip to Singapore for her to purchase items to sell for her own profit in Ghana. Her own narration of the events showed that she was generally willing to fly all the way to Singapore at last-minute notice and was willing to stay a whole month in Niger pending their instructions. She was at Kwaku’s beck and call. It was also not believable that Kwaku would have been so generous as to sponsor not only the flights but also the accommodation of her earlier two trips to Singapore just to “help her”. It was equally unbelievable that she would have thought that Kwaku was willing to sponsor her third trip to Singapore just to bring an assortment of random objects (the two DVD players and two pairs of ladies sandals, even if we exclude the two tin cans) so that the recipient of the Items could use them as samples to purchase the same goods for him. This is especially so given that she was to receive US$5,000 from the recipient of the Items. In these circumstances, we find it incredible that the Appellant was in fact unaware that the items she was carrying contained something for which she could be accountable. If at all there could be any room to doubt this, this was wholly displaced by the phone call the Appellant received from Kwaku when she was in transit in Dubai in the course of which she was told (i) that the items contained something he referred to as “shine shine”; and (ii) that the person collecting the items would pay her US$5,000. During that conversation, Kwaku refused to tell her what “shine shine” was or what the money was for. In our judgment, by this stage, at the very latest, it was not possible for the Appellant to say she had no knowledge that what turned out to be the controlled drugs in question were in her possession. Even after factoring in the Appellant’s background and low educational level when assessing the veracity of her account, we do not think it is believable or sufficient to rebut the presumption in s 18(1) of the MDA. The presumption under s 18(1) was therefore not rebutted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The Prosecution submitted before the Judge that this amount of US$5,000 was likely to have been the Appellant’s profit. We do not think that this was established on the evidence. This does not, however, affect our decision that the Appellant has failed to rebut the presumption under s 18(1). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 We do not see any basis to disturb the Judge’s finding that the Appellant was not a credible witness. It is difficult for us (as it was also for the Judge) to believe that she did not know that the drugs were hidden in the Items. There were the various inconsistencies in the Appellant’s evidence (see for example, the inconsistencies set out at [17] above). For instance, she gave at least three different accounts of how the Items came to be in her haversack. These were, namely, that (a) Kwaku had shown her the Items and physically handed them to her; (b) Kwaku had “blindsided” her by packing the Items into the haversack without allowing her to see what he was doing; and (c) Kwaku had shown her the Items but did not allow her to hold them. The Appellant was also inconsistent in her account on where the tin cans were from. She first told Sgt Ridhuan that Kwaku gave them to her in Ghana but later changed her account by stating that they were purchased in Singapore.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Like the Judge, we are not persuaded by the Appellant’s explanation that these inconsistent accounts were due to inaccurate translation by the interpreter, not least because the Appellant did not even put forward such a case at trial to challenge the interpreter when he was on the stand. Instead, we agree with the Judge that the inconsistencies and her prevarication revealed a propensity to prevaricate and to retract admissions once she realised they were against her case.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 For the above reasons, we are satisfied that the Appellant failed to rebut the presumption in s 18(1) and that the Prosecution has established that she was in possession of the methamphetamine.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Appellant knew the nature of the drugs </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 As we pointed out during the appeal hearing and as rightly conceded by counsel for the Appellant, the Appellant’s alternative case that she did not know the nature of the drugs would necessarily be weakened once we disbelieved the Appellant’s primary case that she did not know the methamphetamine was present in the Items. The presumption in s 18(2) of the MDA applied and it was not rebutted. To put it bluntly, the Appellant’s case in essence was that she did not know what “shine shine” was. This is wholly insufficient to displace the presumption for the reasons set out at [39]-[40] above. If the Appellant is to be believed, she should have approached the customs officers at the airport and told them she had just learnt that Kwaku had put something called “shine shine” in her luggage and asked that this be checked. She did no such thing. Therefore, for the reasons set out above, we agree with the Judge’s conclusion that the Appellant was guilty as charged. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 We are of the view that the Appellant was correctly convicted and that there is no merit in her appeal against conviction. There is likewise no merit in her appeal against the sentence of life imprisonment, which is the statutory minimum sentence upon her conviction if the death penalty is not imposed. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Sundaresh Menon      Andrew Phang Boon Leong       Tay Yong Kwang <br/>Chief Justice      Judge of Appeal          Judge of Appeal </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ram Goswami and Cheng Kim Kuan (Ram Goswami)                               for the appellant; </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Anandan Bala and Kenny Yang (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"> </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
