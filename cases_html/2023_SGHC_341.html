</div> The reason stated was their failure to tender an Agreed Operating Protocol pursuant to MUIS’ earlier direction on 12 June 2019.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 In HC/OS 1168/2021 (“OS 1168”), the Applicant applied for leave to commence judicial review proceedings against MUIS in respect of the Removal Decision and Costs Decision (collectively, “the MUIS Decisions”). He argued that MUIS ought to have decided on the complaint or invited the Applicant to show cause, rather than to circumvent the need to do so by asking parties for an Agreed Operating Protocol; such a request was irrational in the light of the relationship between the trustees. At the hearing for leave on 20 March 2023, the OETs were on a watching brief but had not similarly applied for leave because they were willing to abide by the MUIS Decisions in the event that leave was not granted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 A point argued at the leave hearing, because the OETs were not party to the leave application, was whether, without the OETs being joined, orders specific to the Applicant could be granted to him. Citing various precedents, the Applicant’s argument was that the MUIS Decisions were severable in respect of the individual trustees. In these grounds of decision, the term “severability” is used in the same meaning employed by the Applicant, to refer to a decision being applicable to an individual trustee in contrast to the four trustees as a whole. The Applicant’s argument was that the MUIS Decisions could be quashed in a manner specific to him; in the event that they could not, the proceedings would then be dismissed. The issue as to whether the MUIS Decisions are severable is a proper one for the substantive stage of these proceedings. Regarding the leave threshold of reasonable suspicion, I agreed the threshold was met. An extension of time and leave was granted for judicial review of the Costs Decision because that decision was related to the dispute, for which the Removal Decision marked the end of a process of negotiation between MUIS and the four trustees in the context of their ongoing litigation. The Removal Decision would be before the court in any event and the Costs Decision was an integral aspect of that Decision.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The Applicant accordingly filed HC/SUM 1155/2023 (“SUM 1155”) on 20 April 2023 for the following: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A quashing order against MUIS’ decision to remove the Applicant as a trustee of the VCT. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) A quashing order against MUIS’ decision not to allow the Applicant to claim legal or other costs incurred in the dispute resolution proceedings before MUIS from the assets of the VCT.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) A declaration that the Applicant’s legal costs and disbursements on an indemnity basis in respect of the dispute resolution proceedings be reimbursed from the VCT.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">He did not serve any papers on the OETs despite their request that he do so.

In insisting that adverse impact was necessary, the Applicant rested on <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> in the Malaysian High Court case of <span class="font-italic">Ottavio Quattrocchi v Menteri Dala</span><span class="font-italic">m Megeri, Malaysia &amp; Ors</span> [2001] 6 MLJ 561 (“<span class="font-italic">Ottavio</span>”). There, while referring to a Hong Kong case, <span class="font-italic">Tomlin v Preliminary Investigation Committee of the Dental Council of Hong Kong</span> [1995] 1 HKC 533, Abdul Azziz J stated at [15]: “In other words, the defeat of the investigation committee in the judicial review would have had adverse consequences on the dentist”; and again at [16], “the adverse consequences on him of the successful outcome of the judicial review made him a person directly affected by the application for judicial review”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Nevertheless, it is clear from <span class="font-italic">Ottavio</span> that Azziz J regarded “adverse consequences” simply <span class="font-italic">as an example</span> of being “directly affected”. While on the facts in <span class="font-italic">Ottavio</span>, the dentist would experience adverse consequences and Azziz J therefore held that he was directly affected, it does not follow that “adverse consequences” and being “directly affected” become, in this analysis, the same concept. Indeed, a reading of <span class="font-italic">Ottavio</span> makes clear that Azziz J referred to and applied <span class="font-italic">Regina v Rent Officer Service and another, ex </span><span class="font-italic">parte Muldoon </span>[1996] 1 WLR 1103 (“<span class="font-italic">Muldoon</span>”), a case authority cited by the OETs and MUIS, where the phrase “directly affected” was explained. There, at 1105, Lord Keith elaborated, in interpreting the meaning of “directly affected” under O 53 r 5(3) of the English Rules of the Supreme Court 1965 (which is <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia</span> with O 53 r 2(3) of the ROC), “[t]hat a person is directly affected by something connotes that he is affected without the intervention of any intermediate agency”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The Applicant’s alternate argument was that an intermediate agency did not refer to a person or entity, but any other means through which the OETs may be impacted. In this vein, the Removal Decision was an intermediate agency.

</div> This argument is not supported by <span class="font-italic">Muldoon</span> and is but a variation of the argument that the OETs would suffer no adverse consequences if the Applicant is successful in obtaining a quashing order specific only to himself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Both of these arguments are not consistent with the Singapore Court of Appeal decision in<span class="font-italic"> Golden Hill Capital Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and others v Yihua Lifestyle Technology Co, Ltd and another</span> [2021] 2 SLR 1113 (“<span class="font-italic">Golden Hill</span>”),<span class="font-italic"> </span>where <span class="font-italic">Muldoon</span> was referred to with approval and explained, albeit in the context of O 57 r 3(6) regarding service of a notice of appeal to parties “directly affected” by the appeal. The Court of Appeal stated at [46] that “the word ‘affected’ entails some kind of impact on the <span class="font-italic">status and legal rights</span> of the party in question” [emphasis in original]. The Applicant relied on <span class="font-italic">Golden Hill</span> but did not explain how it was, in his view, “clear” that the search for adverse consequences replaced the test for “directly affected”.

</div> Order 53 r 4 of the ROC reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Right to be heard in opposition (O. 53, r. 4)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4.

He relied on the Malaysian Federal Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Majlis Agama Islam Selangor v Bong Boon Chuen &amp; </span><span class="font-italic">Ors</span> [2009] 6 MLJ 307 (“<span class="font-italic">Bong Boon Chuen</span><span class="font-italic"> (FC)</span>”) and a line of Malaysian authorities following <span class="font-italic">Bong Boon Chuen</span><span class="font-italic"> (FC)</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In <span class="font-italic">Bong Boon Chuen</span><span class="font-italic"> (FC)</span>, dissatisfied property owners applied for leave to commence judicial review proceedings against the local authority’s decision to allocate land (which was near the owners’ residential units) for the purpose of setting up a Muslim burial ground. The Islamic authority of Selangor, Majlis Agama Islam Selangor (“MAIS”), applied for leave to be joined as a party to the proceedings pursuant to O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Malaysian Rules of the High Court 1980 (“RHC”), which is <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia</span> with O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC. At first instance, MAIS’ joinder application was dismissed as it was found that MAIS did not satisfy the requirements of O 15 r 6(2), though the court agreed that O 15 r 6(2) of the RHC applied to judicial review proceedings. A majority of the Malaysian Court of Appeal upheld the decision refusing MAIS leave to be joined as a party. However, it also held that O 15 r 6(2) of the RHC was not applicable to judicial review proceedings (<span class="font-italic">Majlis Agama Islam Selangor v Bong Boon Chuen &amp; </span><span class="font-italic">Ors</span> [2008] 6 MLJ 488 (“<span class="font-italic">Bong Boon Chuen (CA)</span>”) at [7]). The court reasoned that in view of the existence of a specific provision, namely O 53 r 8(1) of the RHC (<span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia</span> with O 53 r 4 of the ROC), which catered to parties wanting to be heard on matters in issue in judicial review proceedings, there was “no necessity for MAIS to be made a party in order to be heard and support the impugned decision of [the local authority]”: <span class="font-italic">Bong Boon Chuen (CA</span><span class="font-italic">) </span>at [8]. Interestingly, while the Malaysian Court of Appeal recognised that MAIS sought to join <span class="font-italic">in support of</span> the decision of the local authority, it still decided that the Malaysian equivalent to our O 53 r 4, which pertained to being heard in <span class="font-italic">opposition</span>, was applicable. On further appeal to the Federal Court, the court endorsed the majority’s view that since a specific rule (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, O 53 r 8(1)) had been put in place for judicial review proceedings, the more general basis for intervention under O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the RHC could not be invoked: <span class="font-italic">Bong Boon Chuen (</span><span class="font-italic">FC) </span>at [17].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In interpreting O 53 r 4, I start with its plain words. The rule provides that a person who has not been served any papers may still be heard at the judicial review proceedings if he wishes to oppose the proceedings. It facilitates the hearing of a person who has not been served with papers, its only condition being that the person is a proper person to be heard. This rule comes after and is additional to r 2, which I have considered above, which provides for any party directly affected to be served. Rule 4 does <span class="font-italic">not</span> deal with these parties. It does <span class="font-italic">not</span> provide for the situation where a party, duly served with papers, wishes to proceed thereafter to oppose the application. The <span class="font-italic">assumption</span> reflected in the order and flow of O 53 r 2 and O 53 r 4 is that such a party <span class="font-italic">would</span> be heard. Thus, r 4 is on its face not an exhaustive avenue of opposing the judicial review. At the 16 October 2023 hearing, the Applicant modified his position to say that r 4 was “but one example” that showed that the Court should confine itself to O 53.

</div>
</div> There is no indication within O 53, however, to show that other Rules of Court do not apply to O 53.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 My interpretation of O 53 r 4 is consistent with the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Manjit Singh s/o Kirpal Singh and another v Attorney-General</span> [2013] 2 SLR 1108 (“<span class="font-italic">Manjit Singh</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Manjit Singh</span>, the applicants, who were advocates and solicitors, sought leave, pursuant to O 53 r 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) to commence judicial proceedings to quash the Chief Justice’s refusal to revoke his appointment of a Disciplinary Tribunal to hear and investigate a complaint against them. The non-party, the Law Society of Singapore, requested to hold a watching brief. The applicants objected to this by drawing the court’s attention to O 53 r 4 of the ROC. The applicants argued that, since r 4 conferred a right to be heard to a proper person who wished to oppose an application under O 53 r 2(1), but there was no equivalent rule giving a non-party a right to be heard on an application under O 53 r 1, the court had no discretion to permit the Law Society to attend the hearing. Vinodh Coomaraswamy JC (as he then was) rejected this argument. <span class="font-italic">Inter alia</span>, Coomaraswamy JC observed at [16] that “the purpose of O 53 r 4 is to <span class="font-italic">give</span> a right to a non-party on an application under O 53 r 2 rather than to <span class="font-italic">take away a right</span> from a non-party on other applications.” [emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In other words, O 53 r 4 allows a person who has not been served papers a right to be heard in opposition if he is a proper party to be heard. It does <span class="font-italic">not</span> take away rights from parties who have been served papers, and it does <span class="font-italic">not</span> abrogate the court’s powers under O 15 r 6. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 It is in this context that I return to the Malaysian cases relied upon by the Applicant. <span class="font-italic">Bong Boon Chuen (FC)</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>and the other cases that applied <span class="font-italic">Bong Boon Chuen (FC)</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>are, in my view, of little assistance. The Singapore and Malaysian provisions are entirely different. The Malaysian O 53 refers expressly to other provisions within the Rules, incorporating them. This is consistent with its introduction in Rule 1(1), stating that “[t]his Order shall govern all applications seeking the relief specified in paragraph 1 of the Schedule to the Courts of Judicature Act 1964…”. The body of the Order also expressly incorporates other specific Orders. This was explained at [22] by the Malaysian High Court in <span class="font-italic">Malayan</span><span class="font-italic"> Association of Private Colleges and Universities &amp; Ors v Registrar General of Private Education Institutions &amp; Ors</span> [2017] 8 MLJ 813<span class="font-italic">, </span>when referring to <span class="font-italic">Bong Boon Chuen (FC) </span>and the “well-entrenched principle that O 53 of the ROC had laid down a specific framework for purposes of all judicial review applications” (at [19]) as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… For instance, O 53 r 6 specifically refers to O 24 for discovery and inspection of documents, O 26 for interrogatories, O 38 for cross-examination of the deponent of any affidavit, O 53 r 7 allows for amendment to the statement or further affidavit to be used and O 53 r 8 allows any desirable party to file application to intervene in the judicial review proceedings. These provisions were specifically provided within the framework of O 53 despite similar provision having been provided elsewhere in the ROC. In the case of O 14A, the same was not incorporated in O53 and/or reference is made either in O 53 or O 14A for the applicability of O 14A procedure. Therefore, it is clear that the intention of Rules Committee is not to allow any other applications apart from those specifically provided in O 53, to be used.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Order 53 of the Singapore ROC is structured differently. Crucially, unlike the Malaysian equivalent, O 53 of the Singapore ROC does not specifically refer to other parts of the ROC, such as those relating to interrogatories and the cross-examination of the deponent of any affidavit. The Malaysian cases are therefore distinguishable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The Applicant further argued that O 15 r 6 of the ROC could not be used to bypass the requirement for leave under O 53 r 1(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>).

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 There, the applicant had been arrested and charged for using criminal force on a police officer. His case was that he had initially pleaded guilty because the Prosecution had allegedly promised during oral discussions that it would not seek a custodial sentence. He alleged that the Prosecution then changed its position, amended the charge and informed him that it would be seeking a custodial sentence. The applicant said in the circumstances, he would not plead guilty. He then made an application to the District Judge to enforce the alleged oral promise given by the Prosecution. When this was dismissed, he filed a criminal motion to the High Court seeking a declaration that the oral promise be enforced. The High Court dismissed the application. It found that the substance of the application was to stop the Prosecution from proceeding with its intended prosecution of the applicant for his offence of using criminal force. In the court’s view, this was effectively an attempt to secure public law remedies which were rightfully pursued under O 53 of the ROC. To allow the applicant to proceed by way of criminal motion would effectively allow him to bypass the need to secure leave to commence actions for judicial review (<span class="font-italic">Amarjeet Singh</span> at [41]–[43]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 <span class="font-italic">Amarjeet Singh</span> holds that a criminal motion to the High Court ought not to be used to circumvent what ought to be the proper public law remedy, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, judicial review,<span class="font-italic"> </span>which carries a leave requirement. It does <span class="font-italic">not</span> stand for the wider proposition that the court is not entitled to join a non-party to a judicial review proceeding where leave has already been granted to another party. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The factual scenario at hand was crucial in this analysis. The OETs were not, prior to leave being given for these judicial review proceedings, opposed to the original MUIS order being effected. <span class="font-italic">Their interests were only engaged upon the judicial review being filed</span>. There was <span class="font-italic">no</span> intention to bypass the leave requirement. Rather, <span class="font-italic">leave having been given</span> to the Applicant for a review the legality of the MUIS Decisions, their interests were then engaged as they were parties to the very same decisions. In the event that they had applied for leave, the same reasons for which the Applicant was granted leave would apply to them, and thereafter, it would have been efficient for the court to consolidate the two proceedings. Counsel for the Applicant conceded as much at the hearing, arguing that in those circumstances OS 1168 should proceed first because the Applicant had filed his application first. I rejected his assertion that his matter should be heard first. The related matters should be heard together. <span class="font-italic">Joinder in this situation was the more efficacious manner of </span><span class="font-italic">managing proceedings</span>. The court’s underlying discretion (see [38], below) in O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) to disallow joinder even where the specific statutory criterion was satisfied is an adequate safeguard against the potential misuse of O 15 r 6 by non-parties to bypass the leave requirement in O 53. The purpose of O 15 r 6 is “… to ensure that the right parties are before the court so as to minimise the delay, inconvenience and expense of multiple actions”: <span class="font-italic">Tan Yow Kon v Tan Swat Ping and others</span> [2006] 3 SLR(R) 881 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Yow Kon</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [36]. Accordingly, “[t]he court is vested with a wide discretion in order to secure these objectives”: <span class="font-italic">Tan Yow Kon</span> at [37]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In the premises, I held that O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC is applicable for a party seeking to be joined in a judicial review proceeding.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the OETs met the requirements of O 15 r 6(2)(b)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The principles pertaining to a joinder under O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC were not disputed. Joinder of a party is allowed when the party seeking to join meets either one of the two criteria outlined in O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). To assess the applicability of either criterion, a two-stage examination is conducted. The initial stage determines if the specific criterion is met, and this stage is entirely non-discretionary. If so, the court proceeds to the next stage, where it evaluates whether to exercise its discretionary power to permit the joinder of the applicant: <span class="font-italic">Lim Oon </span><span class="font-italic">Kuin and others v Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP and another appeal</span> [2022] 2 SLR 280 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Oon </span><span class="font-italic">Kuin</span>”) at [25] and <span class="font-italic">ARW v Comptroller of Income Tax and another and another appeal</span> [2019] 1 SLR 499 (“<span class="font-italic">ARW</span>”) at [40].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 When evaluating the “necessity” limb in O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) of the ROC, the main question is whether the action, as originally framed, can be “effectually and completely determined” without adding the party in question (<span class="font-italic">ARW</span> at [41]). It is insufficient if, for example, a plaintiff merely desires to include a third party for the purpose of presenting a connected claim against it. If this criterion is met, the court then weighs “all the factors which are relevant to the balance of justice in a particular case” in exercising its discretionary power (<span class="font-italic">ARW</span> at [41]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 When invoking the “just and convenient” limb in O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii), the court must first ensure that there is a question or issue concerning the party seeking to be joined that is relevant to an existing question or issue between the existing parties. Subsequently, in the exercise of its discretionary power, the court determines whether joinder for the purpose of deciding that question or issue would be just and convenient: <span class="font-italic">Ernest Ferdinand Perez De La Sala v </span><span class="font-italic">Compañia De Navegación Palomar, SA and others and other appeals</span> (“<span class="font-italic">De La Sala</span>”) [2018] 1 SLR 894 at [204]; <span class="font-italic">Lim Oon </span><span class="font-italic">Kuin </span>at [27].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The OETs submitted that they should be joined as both the “necessity” and “just and convenient” limbs in O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC were satisfied. The “necessity” limb was satisfied as it was necessary to include the OETs in these proceedings to provide the court with the benefit of having all parties before it rather than just the Applicant. Given that the current proceedings involved the Applicant only, even though it was a challenge against MUIS’ Removal Decision, the Applicant’s judicial review proceedings could not be “effectually and completely determined” without the joinder of the OETs. Like the Applicant, the OETs were also removed by the same Removal Decision.

</div> The “just and convenient” limb was also satisfied as it was evident that the OETs were sufficiently connected to the judicial review proceedings. The Applicant’s removal as a trustee stemmed from the complaint lodged by the OETs against him. When reviewing the decision resulting in the Applicant’s removal, the inclusion of the OETs would be essential since they were the initial complainants. Thus, it was just and convenient for the OETs to be before the court as parties interested in the outcome of the proceedings.

</div> Moreover, it was not unnecessary for the OETs to be present before the court in these proceedings as the OETs had “consistently taken the position at [pre-trial conferences] that they [did] not need to be heard”. The OETs’ main point was that MUIS’ Removal Decision was a single decision that applied to all the ex-trustees. However, as MUIS had also taken the same position, and would likely make this point during the judicial review proceedings (in resisting the Applicant’s application), the OETs’ presence before the court was unnecessary.

In that case, members of the Lim family (the “Lims”) applied to join themselves to two injunction applications taken out by Hin Leong Trading (“HLT”) and Ocean Tankers Pte Ltd (“OTPL”), respectively, against Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP (“R&amp;T”), to restrain R&amp;T from advising/acting as solicitors for HLT/OTPL and its judicial managers. According to the Lims, R&amp;T had advised and acted for the Lims and their companies, including OTPL and HLT, since the 1990s, during which R&amp;T was provided confidential information about the parties. The information was potentially relevant to the interim judicial managers and judicial managers of OTPL and HLT in any investigations they might undertake into the Lim Family’s management of OTPL and HLT. Hence, the injunctions were necessary to protect confidential information disclosed to R&amp;T. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The Court of Appeal found at [28] that it was not “necessary” to join the Lims to the applications as the Lims did not assert an interest on behalf of the HTL and OTPL that was necessary to the determination of the injunction applications, nor was their presence necessary to the issue of whether the companies were entitled to the reliefs sought. Rather, their interest, as asserted, was in preserving the confidence of information belonging to themselves and their other companies. Accordingly, they did not meet the requirements of the first limb of O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Despite having found that the “necessity” limb was not made out, the Court of Appeal went on to hold (at [29]) that it was just and convenient to add the Lims under O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(ii) of the ROC. This was because the Lims’ claims substantially arose from the same facts, being disclosure of information to R&amp;T by the Lims and the companies, which the Lims claimed would not have taken place had they known R&amp;T could subsequently act for the JMs of the companies in a manner adverse to their interests. As such, the questions of confidential information raised by the Lims were linked to the injunctive relief sought by the companies. The causes of action were linked by the same set of facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Coming to the facts of this case, I first address the “necessity” limb. The Applicant argued that the OETs were not necessary parties to his judicial review proceedings, because he sought only to quash the MUIS Decisions as they related to himself, and not the OETs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In the present case, the OETs’ case stood on their argument that the Removal Decision was not severable as it equally applied to all the trustees.

</div> This was an issue that MUIS raised at the leave stage and formed an issue to be adjudicated at the substantive stage of these proceedings. A possible conclusion from the substantive stage would be that the MUIS Decisions may be <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> and not severable. In this particular factual scenario, the issue could not be “effectually and completely determined” (see <span class="font-italic">De La Sala</span> at [203]) without the OETs’ participation.

Arising from the low threshold for leave, it was not yet clear whether the OETs were necessary to the resolution of the case.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 It is in this context that I turn to the “just and convenient” limb. This was satisfied because the OETs shared a substantial connection with the judicial review proceedings. Their removal was based on their repeated failure to agree on an Agreed Operating Protocol in the management of the VCT with the Applicant. In like vein to <span class="font-italic">Lim Oon </span><span class="font-italic">Kuin</span>, the various reliefs prayed for are linked by the same set of facts. The OETs and the Applicant were equally bound by the Removal and Costs Decisions. If, as argued by the OETs and as highlighted at [48] above, if the MUIS Decisions are not severable, it could become necessary for the OETs to be joined. And even if the subsequent decision on judicial review is that the MUIS Decisions are severable in respect of individual trustees, the OETs could then decide to initiate separate judicial review proceedings against MUIS concerning the same Removal Decision. The purpose of O 15 r 6 is to “minimise the delay, inconvenience and expense of multiple actions”: <span class="font-italic">Tan Yow Kon </span>at [36]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I therefore decided that it was just and convenient to join the OETs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Capacity in which the OETs were to be joined</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 At the hearing on 16 October 2023, the OETs sought to be joined as respondents to the proceedings, for the following reasons.

In both of these aspects, they stood with MUIS. First, regarding the resolution of the dispute before MUIS, they were willing to abide by the MUIS Decisions, and they were equally willing to accept MUIS’s offer to reconsider the MUIS Decisions. Second, they were of the view that the MUIS Decisions were not severable. In my judgment, therefore, they were to be joined as respondents. The manner in which they would make clear the relief they sought was an ancillary issue, which I address below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Directions for further conduct of case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The OETs initially proposed that they be allowed to file a counterclaim or third-party notice seeking a quashing order following their joinder as respondents under O 15 r 6(2) of the ROC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The Applicant contended that a counterclaim or third-party procedure is not allowed in a judicial review proceeding.

</div> In response, three days before the 16 October 2023 hearing, the OETs clarified that the OETs did not “intend to seek a quashing order against MUIS’s decision”. Instead, they sought to seek “relief against [the Applicant] and MUIS in the form of a declaration that MUIS’s Removal Decision was a single inseverable decision”. The basis of this relief was O 15 r 16 of the ROC.

</div> This approach was also rejected by MUIS. At the hearing, counsel for MUIS, citing <span class="font-italic">Vellama</span><span class="font-italic"> d/o Marie Muthu v Attorney-General</span> [2013] 4 SLR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Vellama</span>”), was of the view that allowing the declaration to be sought in addition to the quashing orders sought by the Applicant would still circumvent the leave requirement of O 53. MUIS proposed that the OETs be granted leave, as respondents, to give evidence and make submissions on the severability of the Removal Decision as well as the Costs Decision, including but not limited to contesting the Applicant’s position that the quashing of the Removal Decision and Costs Decision could and should only be limited to him to the exclusion of the OETs.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The OETs and MUIS had differing views on <span class="font-italic">Vellama</span>. I did not consider it necessary to deal with these arguments. It is settled law that a declaration is a discretionary remedy and must be justified by the circumstances of the case. Relief in the form of a declaration of right would generally be superfluous for a plaintiff who has a subsisting cause of action: <span class="font-italic">Karaha Bodas Co LLC v </span><span class="font-italic">Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd and another appeal </span>[2006] 1 SLR(R) 112 at [13] and [14]. Examining the facts of the present case, a declaration was not sufficient or adequate relief for the OETs. The OETs and MUIS agreed that what the OETs require is, in the event that the MUIS Decisions are quashed, for those orders to apply to them. In effect, in the event that the MUIS Decisions are found to be <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span>, the OETs require that the quashing order apply to all four trustees. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 O 32 of the ROC was sufficiently wide to allow the OETs to file a summons for the relief they sought. Rule 1 reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Mode of making application (O. 32, r. 1)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">1. </span>Except as provided by Order 25, Rule 7, every application in Chambers must be made by summons in Form 60.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">There was nothing in the Rules disallowing a summons through which the OETs could make clear the relief they seek. Such a summons would be useful for the proper conduct of these proceedings. The affidavit to be filed in support would thus be aligned. O 15 r 6(2) is expressed broadly and empowers the court to add a person as a party, subject to the satisfaction of requirements specified in O 15 r 6(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(i) or (ii), “on such terms as it thinks just”. MUIS and the OETs had no objections to this approach. I therefore so ordered.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I therefore joined the OETs as respondents and directed that they should file a summons supported by an affidavit within four weeks to make clear their position that in the event the MUIS Decisions were quashed, such a quashing order is not severable and must extend to them. The Applicant and MUIS were given liberty to file affidavits in reply, if any were needed, within two weeks thereafter.
