They were both charged with murder committed in furtherance of a common intention, and were thus liable to be punished under s 302(2) read with s 34 of the Penal Code.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 MAG and TAI, together with two other friends, Hairee Anak Landak (“HAL”) and Donny Anak Meluda (“DAM”) (collectively, “the Gang”), had set out from a friend’s house on the night of 29 May 2010 with a preconceived plan to commit robbery. One of them was armed with a deadly weapon, a <span class="font-italic">parang</span>. Over the course of that night and the wee hours of the following day, the Gang attacked the deceased and inflicted the injuries which eventually led to his death. It transpired that the deceased was not the only person whom the Gang attacked that night. Prior to attacking the deceased, the Gang had set upon three other victims in order to rob them. Fortunately, none of those other victims succumbed to their injuries. For the attacks on those three victims, MAG and TAI each faced three charges (one in relation to each victim) of robbery while one or more of the Gang was armed with a deadly weapon which came to be used to cause hurt to the three victims, an offence punishable under s 394 read with s 397 of the Penal Code. Those charges were stood down at the trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The High Court judge (“the Judge”) convicted both MAG and TAI of their respective murder charges (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Micheal Anak Garing and another</span> [2014] SGHC 13 (“the Judgment on Conviction”)). Given the amendments made to the Penal Code by the Penal Code (Amendment) Act 2012 (Act 32 of 2012), which came into effect on 1 January 2013, the Judge had the discretion to impose either the death penalty or life imprisonment with caning. The Judge sentenced MAG to suffer the death penalty, and sentenced TAI to life imprisonment with 24 strokes of the cane (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Micheal Anak Garing and another </span>[2015] SGHC 107 (“the Judgment on Sentence”)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Criminal Appeal No 9 of 2015 (“CCA 9”) is MAG’s appeal against his conviction on the murder charge and the death penalty imposed on him. MAG contends that his conviction should be overturned; alternatively, if the conviction were ordered to stand, the matter should be remitted to the Judge to reconsider the sentence meted out as the Judge erred in principle in sentencing him to suffer the death penalty. Criminal Appeal No 11 of 2015 (“CCA 11”) is the Prosecution’s appeal against the Judge’s decision to sentence TAI to life imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane. The Prosecution contends that the death penalty should similarly have been imposed on TAI. For completeness, we should mention that TAI initially filed Criminal Appeal No 24 of 2015 (“CCA 24”) against his conviction on the murder charge and his sentence, but subsequently withdrew this appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Before we outline the background facts, we shall first deal with a preliminary issue that was brought up at the hearing of these appeals. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Preliminary issue: Relevance of the evidence relating to the first three attacks</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The preliminary issue concerns the relevance and, in turn, the admissibility of the evidence relating to the first three attacks perpetrated by the Gang. Counsel for MAG, Mr Ramesh Tiwary (“Mr Tiwary”), submits that this evidence should not be admitted because it is prejudicial to both MAG and TAI.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 At the trial, a similar objection was raised before the Judge. The Judge ruled that the evidence concerning the three earlier attacks was admissible because those attacks formed part of the “crucial narrative” leading up to the commission of the offence in respect of which MAG and TAI were being tried. The Judge further opined that while each of those three attacks could be seen as an isolated incident, together, they formed “an integral act pursuant to a common intention to assault and rob”. The prejudicial effect of the evidence thus did not outweigh its probative value (at [2] of the Judgment on Conviction). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 In our view, the Judge was plainly correct in admitting the aforesaid evidence. It cannot be denied that this evidence was prejudicial to both MAG and TAI in that it disclosed the commission of offences which were violent in nature. However, in determining the admissibility of evidence, the purpose for which the evidence is sought to be admitted is vital (see <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Meng Jee v Public Prosecutor</span> [1996] 2 SLR(R) 178 at [37]; <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Purushothaman a/l Subramaniam</span> [2014] SGHC 215 at [60]). If the Prosecution seeks to admit evidence for the purpose of showing an accused person’s violent tendencies, such evidence would be unduly prejudicial and therefore inadmissible (see <span class="font-italic">Makin v Attorney General of New South Wales</span> [1894] AC 57). However, as can be seen from [7] above, this was not the basis on which the Judge admitted the evidence relating to the three earlier attacks. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Section 6 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) provides that facts which are not in issue but which are nevertheless “so connected with a fact in issue as to form part of the same transaction” are relevant. A good illustration of this rule can be found in the case of <span class="font-italic">O’Leary v King</span> (1946) 73 CLR 566. In that case, the High Court of Australia ruled on the admissibility of evidence of assaults committed by the appellant on different persons prior to his killing of one Ballard, for which the appellant was charged with murder. Latham CJ, Rich, Dixon and Williams JJ (Starke and McTiernan JJ dissenting) held that the evidence relating to the prior assaults was admissible at the appellant’s trial for murder as it disclosed a connected series of events which should be considered as one transaction. Dixon J explained his decision as follows (at 577):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In my opinion the evidence objected to was admissible, because, from the time on Saturday 6th July when the [appellant] and the party with him came under the influence of drink right up to the conclusion of the scene in the early hours of the following Sunday morning in the presence of the deceased’s body lying in front of the huts, a connected series of events occurred which should be considered as one transaction. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Without evidence of what, during that time, was done by those men who took any significant part in the matter and especially evidence of the behaviour of the [appellant], the transaction of which the alleged murder formed an integral part could not be truly understood and, isolated from it, could only be presented as an unreal and not very intelligible event. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 In our view, the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">O’Leary v King</span> applies to the present case with equal force. It would be artificial to reject evidence of what the Gang did during the period between leaving their friend’s house on the night of 29 May 2010 and attacking the deceased. If this evidence were rejected, the court would have only a truncated version of the material events which might not shed true light on the attack carried out on the deceased, especially because all four attacks occurred within a short span of time. The evidence concerning the three earlier attacks is thus admissible as those attacks formed part of the same venture which the Gang agreed to undertake that night.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 That evidence is also relevant as regards the state of mind of MAG and TAI. Section 14 of the Evidence Act provides that facts showing “the existence of any state of mind”, including intention and knowledge, are relevant when the existence of such state of mind is in issue. Explanation 1 to s 14 makes it clear that the facts in question have to show that a state of mind exists “not generally but in reference to the particular matter in question”. In the present case, both MAG and TAI were charged with committing murder in furtherance of a common intention. The attacks on the three victims that preceded the attack on the deceased are therefore highly material to the question of their state of mind <span class="font-italic">at the time of the </span><span class="font-italic">attack on the deceased</span>. Moreover, as we shall elaborate, MAG’s and TAI’s knowledge of how each of them was likely to act in relation to the attack on the deceased has a material bearing on the question of sentence. In view of this, the evidence concerning those three attacks is relevant as evidence showing MAG’s and TAI’s state of mind <span class="font-italic">at the time of the attack on the deceased</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 For the above reasons, we agree with the Judge that the aforesaid evidence is admissible. With this preliminary issue disposed of, we turn to outline the material facts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The material facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 MAG and TAI, who are now aged 28 and 38 respectively, are Malaysians from Sarawak. As earlier mentioned, HAL and DAM were the other members of the Gang. HAL, who was the Prosecution’s key witness in the court below, has already been convicted and sentenced for his role in the attacks. On 18 January 2013, he pleaded guilty to three charges of armed robbery with hurt, and was sentenced to 33 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane. DAM, on the other hand, has only recently been arrested and charged for his role in the attacks.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The attacks</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Sometime on 29 May 2010, the Gang were drinking at the house of a friend named Shaman in Geylang Lor 12.

TAI managed to grab hold of the deceased at around the spot where his body was eventually found.

The Judge held that the discrepancies in what MAG said TAI did with the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> and where TAI took it from him were not helpful to his defence. In this regard, the Judge noted that both HAL’s and TAI’s evidence consistently pointed towards MAG as the one who had used the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> on the deceased. In the Judge’s view, the attack on the deceased and the earlier attacks on the other three victims “took place as if the [G]ang were on a safari, hunting down one prey at a time, using the same method to trap and harm their victims” (at [8] of the Judgment on Conviction). In these circumstance, the Judge opined, it did not matter who had used the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> on the deceased. He was, however, satisfied based on the evidence that it was MAG who had struck the deceased with the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> (at [8] of the Judgment on Conviction). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 With regard to TAI, the Judge reasoned that TAI could not have been oblivious to the fact that MAG had slashed the earlier three victims before the fatal attack on the deceased. Therefore, TAI could not say that he had not intended to join in the attack on the deceased with the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> and had only agreed or intended to rob. The Judge was thus satisfied that the Prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt its case that TAI acted in furtherance of a common intention with MAG not only to rob, but also to cause injuries to the deceased with the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> (at [9] of the Judgment on Conviction).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In respect of sentence, the Judge sentenced MAG to suffer death because he was satisfied that it was MAG who had used the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> to inflict the fatal injuries on the deceased. The Judge did not, however, agree with the Prosecution’s submission that the death penalty should likewise be imposed on TAI. He exercised his discretion to sentence TAI to life imprisonment with 24 strokes of the cane. The Judge held that TAI’s culpability differed sufficiently from MAG’s because TAI had not used the <span class="font-italic">parang</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>to inflict the fatal injuries on the deceased.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The arguments on appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">MAG’s appeal in CCA 9</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In CCA 9, Mr Tiwary submits that the Judge erred in finding that the Prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt the charge against MAG. Mr Tiwary argues that HAL’s testimony, which formed the plank of the Prosecution’s entire case against MAG at the trial, was “riddled” with so many inconsistencies that it was unsafe to rely on that evidence alone to prove the Prosecution’s case that MAG used the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> to inflict the fatal injuries on the deceased. Mr Tiwary contends that because of the unreliability of HAL’s evidence, MAG’s defence raises a reasonable doubt as to whether he did in fact use the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> to inflict the injuries on the deceased. Mr Tiwary further submits that MAG cannot be held criminally liable for the injuries inflicted by TAI after MAG left the open field (see MAG’s version of the events at [28]–[30] above), and therefore, MAG’s conviction on the murder charge should be set aside.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 With regard to sentence, Mr Tiwary argues that even if MAG’s conviction for murder is ordered to stand, the matter should be remitted to the Judge for him to reconsider the sentence. Mr Tiwary submits that the Judge erred in principle in sentencing MAG to death because in doing so, he took into account the evidence concerning the earlier attacks on the other three victims. The Judge, Mr Tiwary argues, should have disregarded that evidence because the charges relating to those three attacks were stood down at the trial and MAG was to be sentenced only for the attack on the deceased. As the Judge erroneously took into account that evidence, the sentence of death imposed on MAG should be quashed and the matter remitted to the Judge for him to reconsider the sentence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Prosecution’s appeal in CCA 11</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In CCA 11, the Prosecution submits that the Judge erred in sentencing TAI to life imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane instead of imposing the death penalty. The Prosecution says that the present case is unique for its extreme violence. In the Prosecution’s view, the Judge erred in drawing a distinction between MAG’s culpability and TAI’s culpability for sentencing purposes on the sole basis that TAI had not wielded the <span class="font-italic">parang</span>. The fact that TAI was convicted of committing murder in furtherance of a common intention made it immaterial that he had not wielded the murder weapon because criminal liability was attributed on the basis of his common intention.

HAL admitted on the witness stand that his account to the police was wrong even though his memory at the time he gave his 2 June 2010 statement would have been fresher than when he was giving evidence in court.

However, we do not think these discrepancies necessarily show that HAL’s testimony in relation to <span class="font-italic">who </span>used the<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">parang</span> to inflict the fatal injuries on the deceased was unreliable. The crucial factual issue that concerned the Judge and that likewise concerns this court on appeal is <span class="font-italic">who</span> used the<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">parang</span> to inflict the fatal blows. HAL was consistent in all his accounts, whether in court, in his statements to the police or even in the Statement of Facts – he consistently pointed to MAG as the only person who wielded the <span class="font-italic">parang</span>. At no point did HAL say, as MAG would have us believe (see [29] above), that TAI took or snatched the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> from MAG. In our view, the discrepancies raised by Mr Tiwary fail to cast any reasonable doubt on this critical aspect of HAL’s evidence. At best, the discrepancies cast doubt on the penumbra and not the core of HAL’s evidence, which is that MAG alone wielded the <span class="font-italic">parang</span>. Moreover, as the Judge observed, HAL’s evidence on this issue was consistent with TAI’s evidence (see the Judgment on Conviction at [7]). There was no reason or obvious motive for HAL to lend support to TAI at the trial given that by then, HAL had already been fully dealt with for his role in the attacks. It is also vital, in considering the discrepancies in HAL’s evidence highlighted by Mr Tiwary, to bear in mind that HAL was recalling events which occurred in a fast and furious manner. For these reasons, we find that the discrepancies raised by Mr Tiwary do not meet the threshold for appellate intervention in relation to findings of fact made by a trial judge (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Muhammad </span><span class="font-italic">Farid bin Mohd Yusop</span> [2015] 3 SLR 16 at [54]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Indeed, we are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that MAG was the one who inflicted all the fatal injuries on the deceased with the <span class="font-italic">parang</span>. MAG accepts that he wielded the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> for the first three attacks and for part of the attack on the deceased. The critical part of his defence is that sometime during the attack on the deceased, TAI snatched the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> from him. MAG, however, provided inconsistent accounts as to where and when the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> was taken from him, and whether he saw TAI use the <span class="font-italic">parang</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>on the deceased. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In a contemporaneous statement which MAG provided, he said that the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> was taken from him<span class="font-italic"> during </span>the attack on the deceased, and after the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> was taken from him, he proceeded to check the deceased’s waist pouch. In court, however, he claimed that TAI snatched the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> from him near the electrical box <span class="font-italic">after</span> he left the open field and checked the deceased’s waist pouch. Further, in his 4 June 2010 statement to the police, MAG said that TAI snatched the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> from him and shouted “<span class="font-italic">serigala</span>” (the Malay word for “wolf”) “<span class="font-italic">while running to toward</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]<span class="font-italic"> the man and kicking him</span>” [emphasis added].

</div>
</div> MAG’s explanation in court as to what he meant in his earlier statements – namely, that he had <span class="font-italic">merely assumed</span> TAI was going to hit the deceased with the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> after TAI snatched it away from him because TAI shouted “<span class="font-italic">serigala</span>” while running towards the deceased – went against what was stated in those statements. In our judgment, these are material discrepancies (unlike the discrepancies raised by Mr Tiwary in relation to HAL’s evidence) which severely undermine MAG’s defence. Whether or not MAG saw TAI using the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> on the deceased in what (if TAI had indeed attacked the deceased as MAG alleged) would have been a brutal attack, given the injuries found on the deceased, was not something one could easily mix up. Further, the allegation that the <span class="font-italic">parang</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>changed hands during the attack on the deceased is central to MAG’s defence, but MAG could not provide a consistent account of the location where the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> was allegedly taken from him. This again undermines his claim that TAI snatched the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> from him during the attack.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Considering all the circumstances, we are satisfied that the Prosecution did prove beyond reasonable doubt that it was MAG who used the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> to inflict the fatal blows on the deceased. As MAG’s appeal against conviction rests solely on the ground that he did not strike the deceased with the <span class="font-italic">parang</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and cause the fatal injuries, our finding above is sufficient to dispose of his appeal against conviction. We thus dismiss this aspect of his appeal in CCA 9.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Given that MAG was convicted of murder under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Penal Code, he was liable to be sentenced under s 302(2), as opposed to s 302(1), of the Penal Code. The principles in relation to the imposition of the discretionary death penalty under s 302(2) were thoroughly considered by this court in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Kho Jabing</span> [2015] 2 SLR 112 (“<span class="font-italic">Kho</span><span class="font-italic"> Jabing (Re-sentencing)</span>”). In that case, we unanimously held that the test for determining whether to impose the death penalty in this context is whether the actions of the offender would outrage the feelings of the community (at [44]). We further elaborated that the death penalty would be appropriate in cases where the offender had acted in a way which exhibited viciousness or a blatant disregard for human life (at [45]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In <span class="font-italic">Kho</span><span class="font-italic"> Jabing (Re-sentencing)</span>, the majority relied on three critical factors in deciding to impose the death penalty on the offender (see <span class="font-italic">Kho</span><span class="font-italic"> Jabing v Public Prosecutor</span> [2016] 3 SLR 135 (“<span class="font-italic">Kho</span><span class="font-italic"> Jabing (Criminal Motion)</span>”) at [100]), namely:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the offender first struck the victim on the head from behind without warning, causing the latter to fall to the ground (see <span class="font-italic">Kho</span><span class="font-italic"> Jabing (Re-sentencing)</span> at [71(a)]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the offender inflicted at least one more blow on the victim while the latter was lying defenceless on the ground (see <span class="font-italic">Kho</span><span class="font-italic"> Jabing (Re-sentencing)</span> at [71(b)]); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) even if the offender had inflicted only two blows on the victim, it would be fair to infer that those two blows must have been of such force that they caused extensive fractures to the victim’s skull and weakened it to the extent that the strike which the offender’s co-accused dealt to the victim with a belt buckle and/or the deceased’s fall to the ground could have caused further fracturing when, ordinarily, they would not have had such an effect (see <span class="font-italic">Kho</span><span class="font-italic"> Jabing (Re-sentencing)</span> at [67]–[68], [71(c)] and [78]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In our judgment, MAG did act in blatant disregard for human life in the attack on the deceased. In <span class="font-italic">Kho</span><span class="font-italic"> Jabing (Re-sentencing)</span>, the offender used a piece of wood to strike the victim’s head with great force. Here, MAG used a 58cm long <span class="font-italic">parang</span> to slash the deceased. He struck the deceased with it on the top of his head with such force that it caused a fracture to the skull, and he also slit the deceased’s throat. MAG’s assault on the deceased was a vicious, savage and sustained onslaught. He swung the blade violently at different areas of the deceased’s body and eventually cut the deceased’s throat. The sheer brutality exhibited by MAG warrants the imposition of the death penalty – it seems to us that MAG attacked the deceased in a totally savage and merciless manner as though he were attacking a hunted prey.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 We now deal briefly with Mr Tiwary’s submission that in sentencing MAG, the Judge erroneously took into account the evidence concerning the three earlier attacks on the other victims. While it may appear that the Judge took that evidence into account for sentencing purposes (see the Judgment on Sentence at [11]), we do not think he in fact did so. The Judge merely <span class="font-italic">opined</span>, in response to Mr Tiwary’s submission that the evidence relating to those attacks should be disregarded, that that evidence could not be ignored because it was “relevant to the [P]rosecution’s narrative”. In our view, the Judge did not actually take that evidence into account when he sentenced MAG. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In any event, even if the Judge did err in taking into account the evidence concerning the three earlier attacks, we are satisfied, for the reasons stated above, that considering only the manner in which MAG attacked the deceased, the imposition of the death penalty is amply warranted because of the sheer viciousness of the attack. Accordingly, we also dismiss that part of MAG’s appeal in CCA 9 relating to sentence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Prosecution’s appeal in CCA 11 </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 We turn now to the Prosecution’s appeal in CCA 11 against TAI’s sentence. The Prosecution submits that this is the first case in which the imposition of the discretionary death penalty falls to be considered in respect of a <span class="font-italic">secondary</span> offender, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, an offender who did not inflict the fatal blow on the victim. In our view, there is no reason why the principles laid down by this court in <span class="font-italic">Kho</span><span class="font-italic"> Jabing (Re-sentencing)</span> (see [47] above) should not equally apply to a secondary offender. In <span class="font-italic">Kho</span><span class="font-italic"> Jabing (Criminal Motion)</span>, we elaborated (at [89]) that the test of whether an offender’s actions “outrage the feelings of the community” is a “<span class="font-italic">reasoned normative standard</span> which future courts are to apply” [emphasis in original]. We further explained as follows (at [90]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">90 Determining whether an offender’s actions so “outrage the feelings of the community” and are “so grievous an affront to humanity and so abhorrent” that the death penalty is justified is an exercise in ethical judgment in which the sentencing court expresses the collective conscience of the community through the selection of a condign punishment. In performing this exercise, contrary to what [counsel] submitted, the remit of the sentencing court’s inquiry is <span class="font-italic">not</span> circumscribed. This court specifically stated in [<span class="font-italic">Kho</span><span class="font-italic"> Jabing (Re-sentencing)</span>] that the sentencing court was to look widely, and that “<span class="font-italic">all</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>the circumstances and factors of the case must be taken into consideration in meting out an appropriate sentence” … (at [37]), thus also ensuring that the inquiry would be an <span class="font-italic">objective</span> one. Furthermore, at [51(d)], this court expressly highlighted that “the motive and intention of the offender at the time he committed the offence” was an important sentencing factor which must form part of the sentencing matrix. In the circumstances, we see no warrantable basis for concluding that this court applied the wrong test in [<span class="font-italic">Kho</span><span class="font-italic"> Jabing (Re-sentencing)</span>]. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Bearing in mind these considerations, we deal first with the Prosecution’s submission that TAI and MAG bore equal culpability for the deceased’s death because they were convicted on the basis of their shared common intention to commit murder under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) read with s 34 of the Penal Code. In our view, s 34 equates the culpability of a principal offender with that of a secondary offender for the purposes of <span class="font-italic">determining </span><span class="font-italic">criminal liability</span>. Section 34, however, does not equate the principal offender’s and the secondary offender’s culpability for the purposes of <span class="font-italic">sentencing</span>, where principles of (<span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>) and the personal circumstances of each offender are to be taken into account. The cases which the Prosecution relies on to support its submission on this point – namely, the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Er</span><span class="font-italic"> Joo Nguang and another v Public Prosecutor</span> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 756 and our decision in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Leong Soon </span><span class="font-italic">Kheong</span> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 63 (“<span class="font-italic">Leong Soon </span><span class="font-italic">Kheong</span>”) – do not assist the Prosecution because they merely stand for the proposition that a principal offender and a secondary offender <span class="font-italic">may</span> be regarded as bearing the same culpability for sentencing purposes. Indeed, these two decisions stand for the proposition that all the circumstances of the case must be considered, and it does not necessarily follow that a secondary offender always bears a lower degree of culpability than a primary offender simply because the former did not participate in the physical attack on the victim. This point is exemplified by the following passage in <span class="font-italic">Leong Soon </span><span class="font-italic">Kheong</span> (at [36]–[37]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">36 Contrary to the judge’s view, the law often does not benignly appraise the conduct of a “passive” participant in a group assault. In the context of determining participation under s 34 of the [Penal Code], this court in <span class="font-italic">Too Yin </span><span class="font-italic">Sheong v PP</span> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 994 declared (at [37]) that <span class="font-italic">it is clear that the potential utility of a person present as a guilty confederate at the scene of the crime cannot be underestimated</span>. Earlier in that decision, the court explained (at [27]) that the reason why all are deemed guilty in <span class="font-italic">typical</span> cases under s 34 of the [Penal Code] was that the presence of accomplices gives encouragement, support and protection to the person actually committing the act. Surely, it cannot be said that a gang leader who directs an attack from the sidelines ought to be viewed more benignly and favourably than his gang members who execute his directions. Those who are not involved in executing physical attacks <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">can</span> carry the <span class="font-italic">same</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>level of culpability as the attackers, if they participate in the common objectives of the group and/or encourage the attainment of the same. We must qualify this statement by emphasising that depending on the nature of the offence, the mere presence of a group member who is <span class="font-italic">not involved in the offending act itself</span> at the scene may not invariably be sufficient participation to affix culpability. This is especially true where no prior planning or discussion has taken place before individuals in a group act unilaterally without reference to the group’s objectives.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">37 With due respect, the judge was far too charitable in assessing the [accused’s] role. While it is true that the [accused] may not have landed any blows or directly injured the Deceased personally, he was, at the very least, every bit as culpable as his accomplices were. <span class="font-italic">A person, who by his presence and/or conduct authorises, instigates or supports an act of physical violence cannot avoid or limit his own personal responsibility by simply pointing to his lack of physical participation in the incident</span>. The use of inflammatory words in a volatile situation often aggravates violence. Such words can incite or embolden an angry group to commit inexplicable acts of brutality. <span class="font-italic">Words have the potential to generate even more harmful consequences than physical acts. The nub of the matter is that, in group offences such as this, the focus of the sentencing judge ought not to be on whether an offender has behaved actively or passively but on precisely what role he had in the incident</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In our judgment, in deciding for sentencing purposes whether a secondary offender acted in blatant disregard for human life, two particular factors are relevant: (a) the mental state of the offender at the time of the attack; and (b) his actual role or participation in the attack. It is the confluence of both factors, without one assuming a greater importance than the other, which ultimately determines whether the offender acted in blatant disregard for human life. We cannot but stress the importance of considering all the factual circumstances of each case. We should also clarify that the mere fact that an offender did not inflict the fatal blows does not necessarily mean that the death penalty would therefore be unwarranted. The Judge himself recognised this (see the Judgment on Sentence at [13]). With these considerations in mind, we turn to the facts pertinent to CCA 11, beginning with TAI’s mental state at the time of the attack on the deceased.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 TAI does not dispute that at the very minimum, he had the intention to inflict on the deceased injury of the type specified in s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Penal Code (“s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury”) as otherwise, criminal liability would not have attached to him in the first place (see <span class="font-italic">Daniel Vijay s/o </span><span class="font-italic">Katherasan and others v Public Prosecutor</span> [2010] 4 SLR 1119 at [167]; <span class="font-italic">Kho</span><span class="font-italic"> Jabing and another v Public Prosecutor</span> [2011] 3 SLR 634 at [32]–[33]). It follows that in every case where a secondary offender is held liable for murder committed in furtherance of a common intention under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) read with s 34, this mental element of intending to inflict s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury is necessarily present. A sentencing court must be cognisant of this and guard against placing too much emphasis on the secondary offender’s common intention because that common intention results in the imposition of criminal liability in the first place. In such cases, where the mental element on the part of the secondary offender is merely the common intention to inflict s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury <span class="font-italic">without more</span>, greater focus should be placed on the secondary offender’s actual role in the attack in determining the appropriate sentence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In our judgment, TAI’s mental state went beyond the minimum required for a conviction of murder committed in furtherance of a common intention under s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) read with s 34. Not only did TAI have the common intention to inflict s 300(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) injury on the deceased, he also knew that MAG would in all likelihood wield the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> indiscriminately when attacking the deceased. While there was no preconceived plan to kill the deceased by using the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> in a <span class="font-italic">savage and merciless</span> manner, TAI knew that MAG would in all likelihood do so as he had seen how MAG had used the <span class="font-italic">parang</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>indiscriminately on the earlier three victims. We do not accept that TAI did not know the extent of the injuries suffered by those victims, or that he did not know MAG would use the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> on the deceased. MAG had used the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> on all the earlier three victims despite TAI claiming that he told MAG not to, and there was nothing to suggest that MAG was going to behave differently in respect of the attack on the deceased.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Turning to TAI’s actual participation in that attack, it is not disputed that TAI acted according to the Gang’s plan and initiated the attack by knocking the deceased off his bicycle down the slope into the open field. The Prosecution’s case, based on HAL’s evidence, is that thereafter, TAI gave chase and held the deceased in an armlock while MAG inflicted the fatal injuries (see [25] above). TAI denies this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 On balance, we are not satisfied that TAI held on to the deceased for a significant period of time long enough for MAG to inflict the fatal injuries. There are several reasons why we have come to this conclusion. First, HAL’s evidence that TAI held on to the deceased for a significant period of time is not without difficulty since it has already been demonstrated that HAL had trouble recollecting the events which took place on the night of the four attacks. While we are satisfied that HAL’s evidence that MAG alone wielded the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> is reliable, the same cannot be said about his evidence on the <span class="font-italic">duration</span> for which TAI held on to the deceased while MAG struck the deceased with the <span class="font-italic">parang</span>. Second, we note that while there was street lighting on the footpath beside the open field where the attack took place, there were no lights in the open field (see [18] above), which was also where the fatal injuries were inflicted on the deceased. HAL’s vision would thus have been impaired by the lack of lighting. When this is considered together with the fact that the events during the attack on the deceased would have unfolded very rapidly, we are not satisfied that it is safe to rely on HAL’s testimony that TAI held the deceased for a sufficiently long period of time for MAG to inflict the fatal wounds. Third, we find persuasive the submission made by counsel for TAI, Mr Amarick Gill (“Mr Gill”), that it is unlikely that TAI could have held on to the deceased for a significant period of time while MAG wielded the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> indiscriminately without TAI himself suffering blows. It must be remembered that it was dark in the open field, and in all likelihood, TAI would not have held on to the deceased for the entire duration of the attack given the real possibility that he could himself have been struck by the <span class="font-italic">parang</span>. The Prosecution argues that it is reasonable to infer that TAI, in restraining the deceased, “positioned himself in such a way as to avoid the risk of injuries arising from MAG’s slashing”

</div> by pushing the deceased away from himself. We find this submission impermissibly speculative. There is no direct evidence that TAI in fact did so, and given that the burden of establishing this fact lies with the Prosecution, it would be improper to speculate and fill in gaps in the evidence. In the circumstances, we are not satisfied that TAI held on to the deceased for a significant period of time, allowing MAG to inflict the fatal injuries on the deceased. Given the risk to himself, it was just as likely that when MAG began to strike the deceased, TAI could have released his hold over the deceased.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 We should add that Mr Gill has highlighted the fact that neither the deceased’s blood nor his DNA was detected on the clothes which TAI wore during the attack. According to HAL’s evidence, which was the key basis of the Prosecution’s case at the trial, TAI grabbed hold of the deceased after MAG slashed his back and held the deceased in an armlock (see [25] above). If TAI had indeed done so, his clothes would have come into contact with the deceased’s blood. The absence of the deceased’s blood and/or DNA on TAI’s clothes would strongly suggest, according to Mr Gill, that TAI did not in fact hold on to the deceased as HAL claimed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 No expert evidence was adduced at the trial as to whether blood stains and DNA on clothes can be completely removed by washing. The Prosecution seemed to have acknowledged that it is not possible to completely remove DNA from clothes contaminated by blood.

</div> This appears to be reinforced by the fact that the clothes which TAI wore during the attack were shown to have Ang’s DNA even though there was evidence from the Prosecution that those clothes had been washed. This strongly suggests that washing clothes stained with DNA will not fully remove the DNA traces. On this basis, Mr Gill’s argument concerning the absence of the deceased’s blood and/or DNA on TAI’s clothes appears to have merit, indicating that it is highly unlikely that TAI held on to the deceased in the manner described by HAL. This in turn means that the fundamental plank on which the Prosecution rests its argument in CCA 11 that TAI should, like MAG, be sentenced to death is, in all likelihood, invalid. In any event, even if we take the view that it is not possible for us to make any firm conclusion on this matter given the available evidence and the <span class="font-italic">absence</span> of expert evidence on all the permutations of what most likely occurred during the attack on the deceased, the conclusion to be drawn would be neutral – neither detrimental nor favourable to TAI. The same can be said of the Prosecution’s reliance on the forensic evidence that the deceased’s DNA was found on TAI’s belt (see [23] above). This fact alone cannot tell us whether or not TAI did in fact hold on to the deceased for a sufficiently long period of time for MAG to inflict the fatal wounds on the deceased.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Considering both TAI’s mental state and his actual involvement in the attack on the deceased, we are not satisfied that he acted in blatant disregard for human life such that the ultimate sentence of death is warranted. There are a myriad of ways in which a guilty confederate may be involved in an offence of murder. On the facts of the present case, we accept that TAI initiated the attack on the deceased. We are, however, not satisfied that he held on to the deceased for a significant period of time long enough for MAG to inflict the fatal injuries on the deceased. We appreciate that TAI must have known that MAG would in all likelihood use the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> on the deceased in the same manner as he did in relation to the first three victims. Even so, we have doubts as to whether such knowledge on TAI’s part, coupled with his act of initiating the attack on the deceased, is, <span class="font-italic">without more</span>, sufficient to amount to a blatant disregard for human life. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Had there been a preconceived plan to inflict the heinous injuries which were sustained by the deceased (as opposed to knowledge that a savage and merciless attack on the deceased was likely), or a plan to kill the deceased in such a brutal manner, the imposition of the death penalty on TAI <span class="font-italic">may</span> well have been justified. Similarly, had there been more certainty on the evidence as to TAI’s actual participation in the attack (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, by holding on to the deceased so as to allow MAG to slash him or by egging MAG on (see <span class="font-italic">Leong Soon </span><span class="font-italic">Kheong</span> at [37])) apart from his initiation of the attack, the death penalty <span class="font-italic">may</span> also have been warranted. <span class="font-italic">We stress again that each case must turn on its</span><span class="font-italic"> own facts</span>. On the facts of this case, we do not see sufficient basis to disturb the Judge’s exercise of his discretion to sentence TAI to life imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane instead of imposing the ultimate sentence of death.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In conclusion, we dismiss MAG’s appeal in CCA 9 against conviction and sentence, and we also dismiss the Prosecution’s appeal in CCA 11 against TAI’s sentence. We express our appreciation to Mr Tiwary, Mr Gill and the Prosecution for their diligence in the carriage of this matter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 At the end of the day, the punishment must fit the crime. We are satisfied that the death penalty is warranted for MAG given his savage use of the <span class="font-italic">parang</span> on the deceased. The same, however, cannot be said of TAI’s involvement in the attack on the deceased. In the context of the test expounded in <span class="font-italic">Kho</span><span class="font-italic"> Jabing (Re-sentencing)</span>, we are not satisfied that TAI’s culpability is sufficient to warrant the imposition of the death penalty, although we should add that our decision in this regard rests on <span class="font-italic">a </span><span class="font-italic">very fine balance</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chao Hick Tin        Andrew Phang Boon Leong     Judith Prakash<br/>Judge of Appeal       Judge of Appeal       Judge of Appeal</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ramesh Tiwary (Ramesh Tiwary), Tng Soon Chye (Tng Soon Chye &amp; Co) and Keith Lim Wei Ming (Quahe Woo &amp; Palmer LLC) for the appellant in Criminal Appeal No 9 of 2015;<br/>Anandan Bala and Marcus Foo (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent in Criminal Appeal No 9 of 2015 and the appellant in Criminal Appeal No 11 of 2015;<br/>Gill Amarick Singh (Amarick Gill LLC), Loo Khee Sheng (K S Loo &amp; Co) and Justin Tan Jia Wei (Trident Law Corporation) for the respondent in Criminal Appeal No 11 of 2015.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
