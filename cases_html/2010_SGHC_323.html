        Lai Siu Chiu J :</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In this suit, Premiere Visione Resources Inc Pte
                    Ltd (“the plaintiff”) sued Lim Choo Sun (“the
                    defendant”) for breach of his fiduciary duties as a director and for
                    breach of his duties as an employee of the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff is a Singapore company that was
                    incorporated on or about 12 November 2003. Its principal activity is the
                    provision of consultancy and resource management services. In plain language,
                    what the plaintiff did was to recruit and deploy locals as trainees for the
                    hotel industry in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The defendant is a Singaporean who became a
                    director of the plaintiff from its inception and was also its employee (as the
                    director of operations Asia Pacific) and shareholder (holding 35% of the issued
                    shares). The defendant ceased to be a director of the plaintiff on or about
                    26 March 2008 and ceased to be its employee on or about 29 October
                    2007 when his services were terminated after he had been earlier suspended on or
                    about 12 September 2007. However, the defendant remains a shareholder of
                    the plaintiff to date. The defendant is known as and is referred to as Robin Lim
                    in the service industry and in all the correspondence that was produced in these
                    proceedings, while the plaintiff was referred to
                “PVR”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Besides the defendant, the plaintiff had/has two
                    other directors and shareholders <em>viz</em> Andrew Chai
                    Wei Kuo (“Andrew”) and Stelle Lim Soak Ngee
                    (“Stelle”) (PW8) who are husband and wife respectively. Andrew
                    holds 55% while Stelle holds 10% of the issued shares in the plaintiff. The
                    couple presently runs the plaintiff’s operations and were the
                    plaintiff’s witnesses at this trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The defendant had previously worked under Andrew
                    as an assistant sales manager when both were with the Singapore office of
                    Honeywell Inc, an American multinational corporation. When Andrew left Honeywell
                    Inc sometime in July 2002 to strike out on his own, the defendant decided to
                    follow Andrew as he regarded Andrew as his mentor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Prior to the incorporation of the plaintiff,
                    Andrew and Stelle had on or about 13 March 2002, incorporated another
                    company called Sass Atlantic Inc Pte Ltd, of which they were the only
                    shareholders. The company subsequently changed its name to Mil-Com Sass Atlantic
                    Pte Ltd in October 2002 and finally to Sass Atlantic Pte Ltd (“Sass
                    Atlantic”) in mid-2004. Sass Atlantic’s business was to recruit and
                    outsource manpower, both local and foreign, for the airline industry. Before
                    being employed by the plaintiff, the defendant was employed by Sass Atlantic (in
                    December 2002) as its business development manager.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Besides Sass Atlantic, Andrew had an interest in
                    a Singapore company called Mil-Com Aerospace Pte Ltd (“Mil-Com”)
                    whose managing-director was one Dr Diana Young (“Diana”).
                    Mil-Com was in the business of supplying foreigners (mainly Filipinos) such as
                    technicians and engineers to the airline industry. Andrew negotiated with Diana
                    in August 2002 and the two agreed to have a joint venture which resulted in Sass
                    Atlantic being renamed Mil-Com-Sass Atlantic Pte Ltd in or about October 2002.
                    According to the defendant, Andrew is also the sole proprietor of Sass Atlantic
                    Aviation Services and has two other businesses known as “The Mannequin
                    Collection” and “Platinum Models”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In October 2003, Diana offered to and did sell
                    her shares in Sass Atlantic to Andrew. Andrew said he used Sass Atlantic as the
                    vehicle to supply manpower such as cabin crew to airlines. In his affidavit of
                    evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) Andrew deposed that he decided that
                    Sass Atlantic would service airline clients while the plaintiff would focus on
                    servicing non-airline clients.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Andrew’s involvement in Sass Atlantic and
                    his deploying of the plaintiff’s staff and resources to work for the
                    latter was a source of unhappiness to the defendant who voiced his displeasure
                    to Andrew in 2005. Andrew’s reaction was to call for an extraordinary
                    general meeting (“the EGM”) on 27 November 2005 to remove the
                    defendant as a director of the plaintiff. According to the defendant, at the
                    EGM, Andrew produced a table he had prepared setting out his contributions to
                    the plaintiff including loss of income, royalties, brand equity and demanded
                    that the defendant pay him the difference less the cost of Sass Atlantic’s
                    use of the plaintiff’s resources. Faced with termination, the defendant in
                    his AEIC deposed that he was forced to agree to Andrew’s justification of
                    the use of the plaintiff’s resources for Sass Atlantic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     According to the defendant, from then on, it
                    was understood that Andrew and he could proceed as they wished. While Andrew was
                    free to develop his businesses, the defendant decided he would have to look
                    beyond the boundaries of the plaintiff as his position was precarious, since he
                    could be removed by Andrew at any time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     At about this time, the defendant became
                    acquainted with Lee Hor Loong (“Desmond”) (DW7). The defendant was
                    first introduced to Desmond in or about 2003 when the latter was working as the
                    human resources manager in Shangri-La Hotel Singapore, which was then a client
                    of the plaintiff. The defendant deposed that he shared his problems with Desmond
                    in response to which Desmond invited the defendant to be his partner. In 2004,
                    Desmond had left Shangri-La and had started his own business called Gates Human
                    Resources Pte Ltd (“Gates”) initially as a sole proprietorship
                    before converting it to a limited company on or about 17 March 2006. After
                    Gates’ incorporation, Desmond and the defendant became the directors as
                    well as (equal) shareholders of the company. Gates started off in the business
                    of providing executive search services to hotels in Singapore before moving into
                    recruitment of foreign trainees and foreign workers for hotels, by bringing in
                    Filipinos, Indonesians and South Koreans.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In his AEIC, Andrew deposed that over time
                    Sass Atlantic built up a good reputation for providing manpower to the airline
                    industry. Leveraging on its good reputation, he said Sass Atlantic secured
                    Shangri-La Hotel as its first corporate non-airline customer on or about
                    26 August 2003. Sass Atlantic placed 25 Singaporean trainees to work in the
                    front office and food and beverage departments of Shangri-La
                Hotel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Andrew deposed he would make the initial
                    approach to potential customers and after he had established and developed a
                    business relationship with their senior managers and/or directors and the
                    potential customer became a client, he would hand over the client to the
                    defendant who would thereafter liaise with the client and take care of the
                    operations and/or logistics aspects of the business. The defendant would carry
                    out the placement of the trainees with the client.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     After Andrew had bought over Diana’s
                    shares in Sass Atlantic, he decided to channel the Shangri-La contract and
                    future non-airline clients to a new entity which, ultimately, was the plaintiff.
                    The defendant requested for and was eventually given 35% equity in the
                    plaintiff, after Andrew had discussed his request with Stelle. Initially, Andrew
                    was not a director of the plaintiff (the founder directors were Stelle, the
                    defendant and one Toh Li Ping) as he did not want a conflict of interest
                    situation arising from the transfer of the Shangri-La contract to the plaintiff
                    from Sass Atlantic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Andrew claimed that at that point in time
                    (when he was negotiating with Diana to buy over her shares in Sass Atlantic) he
                    had held discussions with the defendant and Stelle on the potential conflict of
                    interest situation were he to become a director of the plaintiff while retaining
                    his then directorship in Mil-Com. Flowing from those discussions, Andrew claimed
                    that the defendant was made aware of the duties he owed the plaintiff as a
                    director and as an employee, when his employment was transferred from Sass
                    Atlantic to the plaintiff. Andrew became a director of the plaintiff on or about
                    31 May 2004 after he had bought out Diana’s shares in Sass Atlantic.
                    The plaintiff then moved out of the office of Mil-Com to new premises at Changi
                    Business Park (“the plaintiff’s premises”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     After Shangri-La Hotel, the plaintiff secured
                    the Grand Hyatt, the Ritz Carlton, the Intercontinental Hotel, the Conrad
                    Centennial and other hotels as its clients. Through the defendant, the plaintiff
                    placed local trainees for all these hotels.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Contrary to the contention of the defendant
                    and Desmond, Andrew asserted that it was always his intention that the
                    plaintiff’s recruitment of trainees for hotels would be expanded to
                    include foreign trainees. In his AEIC, Andrew referred to emails he had
                    exchanged in 2005 with parties in Vietnam, the Philippines, Thailand and
                    Myanmar. He deposed that he and the defendant had even visited Dubai in
                    September 2004 to meet representatives of the Shangri-La and Traders Hotel there
                    with a view to supplying the two hotels with trainees from Indonesia, the
                    People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and the Philippines.
                    However, no contracts for the plaintiff resulted from that trip or from his
                    other contacts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     It was Andrew’s case that after the
                    Dubai trip, he had requested the defendant to explore the possibility of
                    recruiting foreign trainees and workers from neighbouring Asean countries
                    because the then labour market in Singapore was very tight and the plaintiff was
                    having difficulties sourcing for Mandarin speaking staff for its Singapore
                    clientele. Andrew deposed that in October 2004, he requested the defendant to
                    study Singapore’s regulatory and legislative framework as well as the
                    requirements for obtaining a licence to import foreign trainees from PRC under
                    internship/training work permits. He then requested the defendant to obtain a
                    licence to operate an employment agency in his own name (“the EA
                    licence”), which would be linked to the plaintiff. The defendant did
                    apply for and obtained an EA licence in November 2004 as Andrew
                    requested.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     However, when Andrew requested the defendant
                    to explore the possibility of recruiting candidates from PRC as trainees, the
                    defendant misrepresented to Andrew that the holder of the EA licence, <em>viz</em> the defendant, had to obtain a certificate in
                    employment agency (“the CEA”) and the plaintiff had to have two
                    years’ experience (which it did not) in importing foreign workers/trainees
                    from countries other than PRC before it would be allowed to bring in trainees
                    from PRC to Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Andrew instructed the defendant to take the
                    examination for the CEA which the defendant obtained in or about 2005 (this date
                    is incorrect). Believing what the defendant told him, Andrew said he put in
                    abeyance temporarily the plans for the plaintiff to recruit PRC nationals until
                    after the plaintiff had obtained two years’ experience in recruiting
                    foreign workers. To that intent, Andrew and the defendant visited a training
                    institute in Singapore called CSM Academy International Pte Ltd
                    (“CSM”) that specialised in training students from the
                    Philippines, Indonesia, Myanmar, PRC and India for the hospitality industry.
                    Andrew deposed that he had also negotiated an agreement with Shandong Hansen
                    International Economic &amp; Trade Cooperation Co Ltd (“Shandong”)
                    to source for candidates from PRC. However, when he discussed with the
                    defendant, the latter cautioned Andrew that such foreign trainees should only be
                    placed with the plaintiff’s clients if there were no local trainees.
                    Andrew alleged he was persuaded to abandon the project. He further alleged that
                    the defendant failed to follow-up on Andrew’s contacts with E-Training
                    Conxepts (“Conxepts”), a hospitality training institute in
                    Singapore that recruited Filipinos as foreign trainees for the plaintiff or the
                    Haach group (“Haach”), spa operators who wanted Mandarin
                    proficient workers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     According to Andrew, another project where the
                    defendant disagreed with him was the recruitment and training of customer
                    service staff for the Changi International Airport Services
                    (“CIAS”) in October 2005. When he discussed the proposal with the
                    defendant, the latter felt that the rates offered by CIAS were too low and would
                    not be profitable for the plaintiff. Yet, when Andrew offered to take on the
                    project using Sass Atlantic, the defendant allegedly became upset and suggested
                    that Sass Atlantic and the plaintiff merge their operations so that there would
                    be no conflict of interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Andrew felt that the defendant’s
                    comments were uncalled for as, according to Andrew, the defendant had been aware
                    of and had approved the arrangement of the plaintiff working in tandem with Sass
                    Atlantic. Sass Atlantic had voluntarily paid about $11,523.34 to the
                    plaintiff’s staff, between March 2006 and July 2007 for work done for Sass
                    Atlantic. Andrew further claimed that Sass Atlantic paid the medical expenses of
                    three of the plaintiff’s staff, and also paid the defendant $154,771 for
                    the period July 2005 to July 2007 for his equity share, which equated to 39.68%
                    of the profits made by the plaintiff during that period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     On 27 November 2005, Andrew called for the EGM
                    alluded to earlier in <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above as he viewed
                    the defendant’s allegations regarding Sass Atlantic’s usage of the
                    plaintiff’s staff and resources to be untrue and/or unwarranted. At the
                    EGM, Andrew deposed that he told the defendant that the latter’s
                    obstructive conduct, demeanour and recalcitrance was making it difficult to
                    conduct and manage the plaintiff’s day to day business. He suggested that
                    the defendant’s directorship be terminated and that the defendant be an
                    employee only of the plaintiff. Andrew alleged that the defendant pleaded with
                    him not to terminate the defendant’s directorship and Andrew did not. At
                    the EGM however, it was decided (presumably by Andrew and Stelle) that the
                    business of supplying manpower for aviation accounts like CIAS and Singapore
                    Airport Terminal Services would be given to Sass Atlantic whilst airport retail
                    clients like Nuance Watson would be placed with the plaintiff. I note that the
                    minutes of the EGM were signed by Andrew and Stelle but not by the defendant who
                    testified that he did not see the minutes until this trial and that the first
                    item minuted was not even discussed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In February 2006, when the plaintiff had
                    gained two years’ experience in recruiting foreign workers, Andrew
                    requested the defendant to relook the requirements of recruiting PRC nationals.
                    After some time, the defendant reported to Andrew that in addition to two
                    years’ experience, the plaintiff was required to place a security deposit
                    of $200,000 with the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) in Singapore
                    before the plaintiff would be allowed to bring in recruits from PRC. Much later,
                    Andrew discovered that there was no such requirement by MOM. He alleged that the
                    defendant lied to him in order to prevent the plaintiff from importing recruits
                    from PRC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Andrew said he was aware that Desmond had set
                    up Gates after leaving Shangri-La Hotel. He described Desmond as the
                    defendant’s “very good friend”. Andrew asserted that Gates
                    was in the business of executive search and not manpower placement as far as he
                    and Stelle were aware. Andrew revealed that at the defendant’s suggestion,
                    he had even allowed Desmond to set up a temporary office without charge at the
                    plaintiff’s premises, when Desmond first set up Gates. Desmond moved out
                    of the plaintiff’s premises in September 2005. Andrew claimed that he was
                    unaware that the defendant was a 50% shareholder in Gates until much later as
                    the defendant did not disclose his interest to Andrew/the plaintiff at the
                    material time. Neither did the defendant disclose his 50% interest in Nanyang
                    Training &amp; Education Consultants Pte Ltd
                (“Nanyang”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Andrew deposed that in furtherance of the
                    plaintiff’s intention to recruit foreign workers for Singapore hotels, he
                    developed contacts in Thailand in April 2006 and in Zhuhai (in PRC) and Macau in
                    June 2006. Andrew deposed that he travelled regularly to both places for
                    placement business. Further, in November 2006, Andrew tasked the defendant and
                    three other staff members of the plaintiff to visit Kuala Lumpur to conduct a
                    recruitment exercise which yielded a few applicants. Andrew blamed the defendant
                    for misinforming him that the results of the recruitment exercise did not
                    justify the costs involved and that the profit margins were too thin, causing
                    Andrew not to pursue further recruitment of Malaysians thereafter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In February 2007, Andrew took some staff from
                    the plaintiff (which included the defendant) to Macau as part of an incentive
                    trip. During that trip, the defendant met Andrew’s contacts, in particular
                    the senior management of The Venetian Hotel &amp; Resort (“The
                    Venetian”) who included the senior vice-president of The Sands Hotel one
                    Steven Hicks (“Hicks”), and Scott Sullivan
                    (“Sullivan”), the general manager of The Venetian and of the Grand
                    Canal Shoppes (“the Shoppes”) which are located within the hotel
                    complex. The Venetian, The Sands and The Four Seasons hotels in Macau belong to
                    The Sands Group of hotels/casinos. Andrew and the defendant discussed the
                    possibility of supplying manpower from the Philippines to the 300 or so
                    retailers of the Shoppes. In the same trip Andrew and the defendant also met
                    Jeff Low Wee Fong (“Jeff”) (PW2) at Zhuhai where Jeff operated The
                    ACN Institute (“ACN”), which institute provided cabin crew
                    training to PRC nationals who sought employment in the airline
                industry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In February/March 2007, Jeff introduced Andrew
                    and the defendant to U Pui Io (“Melvin”) (DW2) who was/is the
                    general manager of Lei Yun Human Resources Co Ltd (“Lei Yun”), a
                    registered foreign labour recruitment agency in Macau. The plaintiff intended to
                    provide foreign labour to The Venetian/the Shoppes and the introduction to Jeff
                    and then Melvin was with a view to exploring how the three parties could work
                    together to recruit workers for The Venetian/the Shoppes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The defendantfollowed up the introduction to
                    the management of The Venetian by submitting the plaintiff’s proposal in
                    February 2007 to Hicks for the Shoppes. In or about April 2007, Sullivan agreed
                    to support the plaintiff’s proposal and provided the plaintiff with a list
                    of the Shoppes’ retailers. (Henceforth, the plaintiff’s project in
                    Macau will be referred to as “the Macau project”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Macau project was one of Andrew’s
                    main grievances against the defendant in this trial. In this regard, Jeff
                    testified against while Melvin testified for, the defendant. Consequently, the
                    evidence that was adduced in connection with the Macau project has to be
                    reviewed in some detail later in this judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In May 2007, Andrew, Melvin and the defendant
                    visited some Hongkong retailers as the majority of the Shoppes’ operators
                    were from Hongkong. Thereafter, the defendant worked with Melvin (and Desmond)
                    to bring in Filipinos as sales assistants for the Macau project. The defendant
                    continued to work on the Macau project until his services with the plaintiff
                    were terminated by Andrew on 28 September 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     It was Andrew’s case that through the
                    defendant, Gates had benefited from the Macau project at the expense of the
                    plaintiff. The Macau project formed part of the plaintiff’s claim against
                    the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     According to Andrew, the profit-sharing
                    arrangement for the Macau project was resolved in June 2007 after the defendant
                    initially made an oral demand of him for 50%, even though the defendant’s
                    shareholding in the plaintiff was only 35%. Andrew claimed that he
                    counter-proposed 40% profit for the defendant which was accepted. Andrew alleged
                    that at the defendant’s recommendation, he agreed to Gates being engaged
                    and paid a commission to place Filipinos for 154 positions in the Shoppes, not
                    knowing then of the defendant’s interest in Gates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Andrew opined that it was unnecessary for
                    either Desmond or Gates to be involved in the Macau project at all as the
                    defendant already had (but failed to disclose to Andrew) contacts with labour
                    agencies in the Philippines. Andrew surmised that the defendant recommended
                    Gates for the Macau project so that the defendant could skim off profits for
                    himself using the name of Gates, or by way of kickbacks from Gates, or via some
                    other means. He further accused the defendant of cutting Jeff out of the Macau
                    project, relying on his exchange with the defendant in July 2007 in this regard.
                    I note however that the email exchange (at exhibit AC-34 in Andrew’s AEIC)
                    did not support Andrew’s allegation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In May 2007, the defendant had proposed the
                    following profit-sharing arrangement for the Macau project by his email to
                    Andrew dated 28 May 2007:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Andrew asserted that his email reply to the
                    defendant dated 18 June 2007 contained the actual agreed division. His
                    breakdown stated:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Melvin however categorically denied he had
                    agreed to Andrew’s figures and contrary to Andrew’s assertion,
                    testified he had not received commission from all the retailers in the Macau
                    project, let alone substantial sums. Neither had he paid any part of the
                    commission he received to Gates or to the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I shall return to the Macau project later in
                    my review of the parties’ evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Andrew deposed that he had requested the
                    defendant to file a report of the latter’s Macau expenses and to provide
                    copies of the agreements signed between the plaintiff and various retailers, but
                    the defendant repeatedly ignored Andrew’s request. Sensing that something
                    was wrong, Andrew decided to gain access to the defendant’s emails which
                    he did on or about 6 September 2007. It was then that Andrew discovered
                    that the defendant was involved with both Gates and Nanyang and that the
                    defendant had been earning profits on the sly from various transactions, to the
                    plaintiff’s detriment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Andrew then discovered from two staff members
                    of the plaintiff that they had received telephone calls from various Singapore
                    hotels including the Grand Hyatt, The Intercontinental, The Sentosa Resort &amp;
                    Spa claiming the plaintiff had supplied foreign trainees to the hotels which was
                    not the case. Andrew then realised that the defendant had supplied the foreign
                    trainees through Gates, but using the plaintiff’s name.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Andrew issued a notice of suspension dated
                    12 September 2007 to the defendant and requested that the defendant hand
                    over his duties to assigned staff and return the plaintiff’s properties
                    including a laptop. On checking the defendant’s desk after suspending him,
                    Andrew found a list of Gates’ clients. The defendant failed to comply with
                    Andrew’s request so Andrew made a police report on the same day. The
                    defendant replied by email to Andrew on 14 September 2007 asking that a
                    directors’ meeting be convened to resolve the parties’ differences,
                    pointing that under the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (the
                    “Companies Act”), the suspension of his directorship was invalid
                    and the defendant was entitled to have access to the plaintiff’s office
                    and property. On the same day, Andrew informed the plaintiff’s clients
                    including Lei Yun by email of the defendant’s suspension and that Jeff had
                    taken over the defendant’s duties in the Macau project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     On 18 September 2007 the
                    plaintiff’s (former) solicitors sent a letter of demand to the defendant
                    alleging he had breached his fiduciary duties as a director of the plaintiff.
                    The letter required the defendant to provide the plaintiff within seven days
                    with a proposal of how the defendant intended to account to the plaintiff for
                    profits arising from the defendant’s alleged breach and further required
                    the defendant to furnish the plaintiff with a complete list of the
                    plaintiff’s customers which the defendant, Gates, and/or Nanyang (both
                    Gates and Nanyang were described in the letter as the plaintiff’s
                    “competitors”) had approached. By his solicitors’ letter
                    dated 19 September 2007, the defendant denied the plaintiff’s
                    allegations and countered that Andrew had made false and misleading defamatory
                    statements against the defendant for which the defendant made a “cease
                    and desist” demand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Andrew sent another letter dated
                    28 September 2007 on the plaintiff’s behalf to the defendant giving
                    the defendant three months’ notice of termination. Andrew wrote a third
                    time on 29 October 2007 on the plaintiff’s behalf to the defendant
                    terminating the defendant’s employment immediately on the basis that the
                    defendant had failed to report for work after 28 September 2007 and had
                    also failed to account for his whereabouts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Andrew alleged that after the
                    defendant’s dismissal, he uncovered more evidence of the defendant’s
                    misdeeds, in particular, how the defendant had used the plaintiff’s email
                    account to communicate with local hotels with which Gates had contracted to
                    place Indonesian trainees and Filipino “S” pass (semi-skilled)
                    holders. He accused the defendant of misrepresenting to the plaintiff’s
                    clientele that the foreign trainees supplied by Gates/Nanyang were ostensibly
                    supplied by the plaintiff, thereby misusing the plaintiff’s name and
                    goodwill. None of the revenue generated from such placement was received by the
                    plaintiff. Andrew further alleged that the defendant had copied the
                    plaintiff’s business model in setting up Gates and Nanyang.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     It was only on 26 March 2008 that the
                    plaintiff finally convened a directors’ meeting (“the
                    directors’ meeting”) as the defendant had requested. In his written
                    testimony, Andrew deposed that he confronted the defendant over the
                    defendant’s involvement with Gates. The defendant replied he was concerned
                    about his livelihood when Andrew attempted to remove him as a director at the
                    EGM. Andrew said that he reassured the defendant that his livelihood was not
                    threatened but that the then intended removal of the defendant from his
                    directorship was due to the defendant’s obstructive behaviour that was
                    hurting the plaintiff’s business. Andrew and Stelle demanded that the
                    defendant pay compensation (amounting to $348,326) to the plaintiff for the loss
                    caused by his channelling business to Gates and Nanyang and for the loss of
                    profits from the Macau project. Stelle followed up by her email to the defendant
                    on the same afternoon attaching the resolution passed earlier at the
                    directors’ meeting, requiring the defendant to give his counter-proposal
                    on the compensation figure by Friday 28 March 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The defendant rejected the demands of the
                    couple in his email reply to Stelle and Andrew on 27 March 2008, pointing
                    out he neither agreed to the resolution as minuted nor to his removal as a
                    director and maintaining that he had not breached his duties as a director.
                    Neither would he accede to the couple’s demands. There was further
                    exchange of correspondence between the parties’ solicitors in October 2008
                    where accusations of breach of director’s duties were traded against one
                    another by the defendant and Andrew. Eventually, the writ of summons herein was
                    issued and served on the defendant on the defendant’s birthday, <em>viz</em> 25 April 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In the (lengthy) statement of claim, the
                    plaintiff listed out the duties that the defendant owed to the company as
                    employee and as director (express or implied) and which he had allegedly
                    breached. It was alleged that by an oral agreement made in October 2003 between
                    the defendant and Andrew, the defendant was appointed a director, shareholder
                    and employee of the plaintiff on terms and conditions negotiated by the
                    parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The facts (including the Macau project)
                    pertaining to the defendant’s breaches were pleaded <em>in
                        extenso</em> by the plaintiff. The plaintiff prayed <em>inter alia</em> for a declaration that the defendant had breached his
                    duties to the plaintiff and an injunction to restrain him from carrying on
                    business under the name of Gates and Nanyang and claimed $176,080 and $129,540
                    for loss of profits the plaintiff had suffered. The plaintiff required the
                    defendant to account for further secret profits he had made in breach of his
                    duties and/or in breach of trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In his defence (Amendment No 2) and contrary
                    to the plaintiff’s pleaded case, the defendant denied that his duties as
                    the plaintiff’s director of operations (Asia Pacific) included an
                    obligation to expand the plaintiff’s business or seek new business
                    opportunities for the plaintiff. Neither was the defendant tasked to study
                    regulatory and/or legislative framework and requirements in Singapore for
                    obtaining a licence to import foreign manpower/trainees from PRC for
                    internship/training work permit in Singapore. The defendant averred he had no
                    knowledge of any alleged agreement between the plaintiff and Shandong (see
                    [20]). The defendant further denied he had reached an oral agreement with Andrew
                    in October 2003 as alleged or at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The defendant averred that the plaintiff was
                    not in the business of supplying foreign manpower to customers in Singapore and
                    did not have the means or the contacts to start this business. At all material
                    times, the plaintiff’s principal business was the recruitment of Singapore
                    citizens for its customers. At no time did the plaintiff decide to explore the
                    possibility of recruiting foreign manpower/trainees from neighbouring countries
                    in Asia to supply to its Singapore customers nor did the plaintiff explore the
                    possibility of partnering Singapore training institutions to place their
                    students as interns with various local hotels. Neither was the defendant tasked
                    to follow up potential business dealings with CSM or Haach as alleged by the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The defendant denied making any
                    representations to Andrew as alleged by the plaintiff in the statement of claim.
                    Although he admitted being a director and shareholder of Gates and Nanyang, the
                    defendant contended there was no obligation for him to inform the plaintiff of
                    his involvement in the two companies which he denied were in the same business
                    as the plaintiff. The defendant pointed out that unlike Gates, the plaintiff at
                    all times was in the business of recruiting local manpower/trainees and was not
                    in the business of supplying foreign manpower nor did it have the means or
                    contacts to do so. Further, the plaintiff did not have the necessary contacts to
                    recruit Filipino workers for the Macau project. The defendant accused Andrew of
                    being jealous of his doing his own business which was separate and distinct from
                    the plaintiff’s business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The defendant denied he had breached his
                    duties or trust as alleged by the plaintiff. Even if he had breached his duties
                    (which he denied), the defendant contended the plaintiff had not suffered any
                    loss arising therefrom. He put the plaintiff to strict proof that the customers
                    of Gates/Nanyang were under the impression that the foreign manpower supplied by
                    the two companies was ostensibly from the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     It serves no purpose to refer to the
                    plaintiff’s reply to the defence as it was essentially a repeat of the
                    plaintiff’s allegations in the statement of claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(i)   The plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Having dealt with the pleadings, I turn now to
                    the evidence that was adduced at trial. I should first state that the plaintiff
                    called no less than eight other witnesses for its case besides Andrew and Stelle
                    while the defendant had seven witnesses including Desmond. Andrew was the
                    plaintiff’s first and main witness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     As the main points of the plaintiff’s
                    version of events as given by Andrew in his AEIC have already been set out
                    earlier, I will turn my attention to the additional evidence that was adduced
                    from Andrew and the plaintiff’s other witnesses in the course of oral
                    examination and/or cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Throughout his testimony (written and oral),
                    Andrew repeatedly maintained that it was always his/the plaintiff’s
                    intention to move into the recruitment of foreign workers/trainees. He referred
                    to emails exchanged between the defendant and Shangri-La, Dubai, where the
                    plaintiff proposed recruiting for the latter Indonesian and mainland PRC
                    nationals. In cross-examination, Andrew admitted the Dubai venture never
                    materialised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Andrew also referred the court to a draft
                    Strategic Partnership Agreement that was intended to be signed between the
                    plaintiff and Shandong (see [20]) for the placement of trainees/workers from the
                    PRC in international hotels. The document however was not signed and the
                    partnership with Shandong also did not materialise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Andrew took pains to emphasise that the
                    defendant had no grounds to be unhappy with the operations of Sass Atlantic as
                    the defendant was aware and approved of the same, when Sass Atlantic went its
                    separate way from Mil-Com after he had bought over Diana’s shares in Sass
                    Atlantic. He further asserted that when he had a meeting (in the
                    defendant’s presence) with Diana and her legal counsel over the split of
                    Sass Atlantic from Mil-Com, Diana had reminded him of the breach of his duties
                    as a director had he not disclosed his interest in the plaintiff to her which he
                    did.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     As for the Macau project, Andrew referred to a
                    number of the service agreements (of one year’s duration) that had been
                    signed between the plaintiff and certain retailers (collectively “the
                    service agreements”) wherein the retailers agreed to allow the plaintiff
                    to recruit and place Macanese and foreign workers (from the PRC, the
                    Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam) as staff for the Shoppes. Payment
                    for such services would be collected by the plaintiff from the recruits, save
                    for the Macanese, for whose placement the plaintiff would charge the
                    Shoppes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Andrew referred the court to emails exchanged
                    between the defendant and a Philippines recruitment agency called Service Online
                    Corporation (“SOL”) (through whom Filipino workers were recruited
                    for the Shoppes) wherein the defendant requested information on the
                    recruits’ salaries to enable the defendant to deduct placement fees due to
                    the plaintiff. He asserted that the defendant must have received payment for the
                    work done. Andrew pointed to the fact that he was not copied on such emails and
                    he discovered their existence by retrieving them from the office server as he
                    was denied access to the defendant’s laptop, the password having been
                    changed by the defendant without his knowledge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Andrew revealed that it was illegal for
                    non-PRC companies to collect placement fees. As Macau was not considered part of
                    mainland PRC, Lei Yun could not collect placement fees from PRC recruits. He
                    denied the suggestion of counsel for the defendant that his fee sharing
                    arrangement was never agreed by the other parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Andrew disagreed with the defendant’s
                    claim that the latter was a silent partner in Gates before the defendant left
                    the plaintiff’s services. Andrew drew the court’s attention to
                    Gates’ contract with the Grand Hyatt dated 28 March 2006 which was
                    signed by the defendant as Gates’ director, rather than by Desmond. He
                    found it odd that a silent partner would sign the contract instead of the main
                    director. Further, a clause in the Grand Hyatt agreement provided that the hotel
                    would pay the plaintiff (not Gates) fees for the trainees placed by Gates.
                    Andrew wondered why there was such a provision if Gates and the plaintiff were
                    not related entities. The same provision appeared in Gates’ contract with
                    the Intercontinental Hotel dated 9 July 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In the list of Gates’ clients that he
                    found on the defendant’s desk after suspending the defendant, Andrew said
                    a number were the plaintiff’s customers including The Sentosa Resort &amp;
                    Spa, The Shangri-La Hotel and The Conrad Centennial. Andrew alleged that the
                    defendant used a sole proprietorship called Trendz Consultants to receive
                    commissions paid to the defendant. He accused the defendant of providing resumes
                    of Filipinos to the Meritus Mandarin in October 2006 without his knowledge. As
                    the defendant had already established contact with a Philippines recruitment
                    agency in 2006 while working for the plaintiff, Andrew could see no reason why
                    the defendant would need to introduce Desmond to the Macau project save to cover
                    up the defendant’s own Philippines contacts and to get Gates involved in
                    the Macau project in conflict of his duties to the plaintiff. Moreover, in his
                    email correspondence on behalf of Gates, the defendant used the
                    plaintiff’s email address.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     During cross-examination, Andrew revealed that
                    the tenant of the plaintiff’s premises was Sass Atlantic who was
                    reimbursed by the plaintiff two-thirds of the rental paid to the landlord.
                    Questioned why the plaintiff was required to pay for everything, Andrew
                    explained it was because Sass Atlantic had transferred to the plaintiff all
                    revenue it received other than the business of cabin crew training, but he
                    admitted there were no resolutions evidencing such transfer. However Andrew
                    denied that the defendant had raised with him as a grievance the costs of Sass
                    Atlantic being borne by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Although he complained that the defendant
                    failed to keep him apprised of developments by extending to him copies of emails
                    with third parties, it emerged in the course of his cross-examination that
                    Andrew was equally guilty of the same omission – he failed to keep the
                    defendant informed of his email correspondence (either using the email address
                    of the plaintiff or Sass Atlantic) with Malaysian and other parties (in Vietnam
                    and PRC) on recruitment possibilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Andrew acknowledged that the plaintiff’s
                    effort in recruiting foreign workers/trainees never came to fruition while the
                    defendant was in the plaintiff’s employment; he gave various
                    reasons/excuses for the failure (including lack of funds on the part of
                    Shangri-La Dubai, disagreement on pricing with ICH group of hotels in Bangkok
                    and lack of interest in training in English by Thai hotels). He put the blame on
                    the defendant for making him believe the plaintiff should not go into the
                    venture because the margins would be lower than the plaintiff’s existing
                    margins. Andrew’s other excuse was that the defendant held the CEA
                    licence. It was adduced from Andrew that the plaintiff’s first placement
                    of foreign trainees with Singapore hotels took place at end-2007 (with less than
                    resounding success) after the defendant had left the plaintiff’s
                    services.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     As for the Macau project, Andrew revealed he
                    had asked Melvin himself in September/October 2007 whether Lei Yun had received
                    payment of the placement fees and the answer was “no”. Andrew said
                    he found the answer hard to believe. When Andrew pressed Melvin on whether Lei
                    Yun would cooperate with the plaintiff in future after the defendant’s
                    dismissal, Melvin reportedly said that he would work with whoever had the
                    closest customer contact.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Andrew drew the court’s attention to a
                    letter on Lei Yun’s letterhead dated 20 August 2007 signed by Melvin
                    as Lei Yun’s general manager which contents <em>inter
                        alia</em> stated:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Lei Yun Human Resources Co Ltd</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Andrew suspected from the letter that the defendant was a director of
                    Lei Yun and if he was not, then the defendant was misrepresenting himself to the
                    Philippines or Macau governments and which could have resulted in legal
                    liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Jeff founded ACN in 2005. In his AEIC, Jeff
                    deposed that he became acquainted with Andrew in June 2006; in turn, Andrew
                    introduced him to the defendant. Jeff was subsequently introduced to Melvin in
                    late 2006 through another party. Melvin enlisted Jeff’s collaboration to
                    procure clients as Lei Yun had limited resources. Jeff’s introduction to
                    the Macau project came about when he invited James Wong, the mall manager of the
                    Shoppes, to visit ACN’s premises in Zhuhai in May 2007. James Wong was
                    impressed with the cabin crew trainees he saw at ACN and he wanted to recruit
                    the students to work at The Venetian and at the Shoppes. As a gesture of
                    goodwill, Jeff deposed that he supplied gratis 38 cabin crew trainees to work as
                    customer service agents at The Venetian and at the Shoppes in June-July 2007.
                    From time to time, the defendant would bring retailers to ACN to showcase what
                    the institute could offer. However, Jeff gradually lost contact with the
                    defendant who copied him in emails on those visits. When the visits ended, the
                    defendant ceased communicating with Jeff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Jeff supported Andrew’s contention that
                    an agreement was reached in June 2007 in relation to the profit-sharing
                    arrangement for the Macau project. He reasoned that as no one reverted to object
                    to Andrew’s email dated 18 June 2007, it must mean that
                    Andrew’s proposal was accepted by all parties concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Based on rumours he had heard and from third
                    party reports, Jeff believed that the defendant had placed Filipino workers for
                    the Macau project and he opined that it was highly likely that the defendant had
                    been paid processing/placement fees by such workers before they were brought to
                    Macau.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Jeff testified that the plaintiff and Venetian
                    Cotai Limited (on behalf of The Venetian) signed a non-disclosure agreement on
                    or about 13 April 2007 (“the NDA”) as required by Sullivan. The
                    NDA provided that the plaintiff should not make unauthorised disclosure of
                    confidential information that The Venetian furnished to the plaintiff. In
                    exchange for the executed NDA, The Venetian released to the plaintiff the list
                    of 300 retailers involved in the Macau project. Jeff testified that with the
                    signing of the NDA, the plaintiff was able to commence the recruitment of
                    foreign and Macanese workers for the Macau project. Andrew, the defendant and
                    other staff of the plaintiff flew out from Singapore to visit the retailers
                    listed in the Macau project. He revealed that Sullivan and other senior
                    management from the Shoppes visited ACN in April 2007 after the NDA was signed
                    while the defendant brought retailers (including Tiffany’s) who were
                    involved in the Macau project to ACN to view its training
                facilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Jeff testified that he and the plaintiff did a
                    recruitment campaign in Macau for Duty Free America (“DFA”)
                    another retailer in the Macau project. He was surprised to find about three
                    months later, Filipinos working in DFA, and surmised that the placements must
                    have been done by the defendant. Jeff also found Filipinos working in other
                    shops. Jeff then heard from his housing agent contact that the defendant and
                    Melvin had visited the housing agent to negotiate for accommodation for the
                    Filipinos workers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     When Jeff confronted Melvin and demanded his
                    share of the commission, Melvin claimed that his role was only to take care of
                    documentation and referred Jeff to the defendant for his commission. Jeff said
                    he went back to Andrew as he felt the defendant and Melvin were doing things
                    behind his back. He would wait for the outcome of this suit before deciding what
                    steps to take on his share of the commission for the Macau
                project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Jeff claimed that without his contacts, the
                    plaintiff would not have secured the Macau project. He contended that the
                    plaintiff was the only manpower agency who could import Filipino workers for the
                    Macau project. Jeff claimed he spoke to the Filipinos who had been placed in DFA
                    and ascertained that they had been brought to Macau by SOL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     During cross-examination, Jeff revealed that
                    ACN did not collect placement fees from airlines that employed his trainees.
                    Instead, the trainees had to pay ACN for the training he provided to them. He
                    explained that ACN was an established cabin crew training school not only in
                    Zhuhai but in the whole of PRC. He pointed out it was not he, but the plaintiff,
                    who benefited from being involved in the Macau project. At the time the
                    plaintiff was the only manpower company that provided Filipino workers in Macau.
                    Unlike Lei Yun, the plaintiff could provide a “one-stop” service
                    for the hiring of Filipinos and PRC workers from documentation to housing
                    requirements. Had things proceeded as planned, the plaintiff would have provided
                    3,000 workers (or 10 per outlet to the 300 Shoppes) in the first phase of the
                    Macau project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Jeff acknowledged that he was supposed to take
                    over the Macau project from the defendant after the latter’s services were
                    terminated, according to Andrew’s email notification to the management of
                    The Venetian dated 17 September 2007. However, there was nothing much he could
                    do. By then, the first phase of the Macau project was completed and workers for
                    the retailers had been procured by the defendant. When Jeff visited the
                    plaintiff’s clients with Andrew, they told him they did not need the
                    plaintiff’s services any more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Jeff testified he had neither heard of Gates
                    in his discussions with the defendant or Melvin, nor was he involved with the
                    NDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The plaintiff’s other witnesses included
                    Tan Hung Liang known as Eugene Tan (“Eugene”) (PW10) to the
                    defendant. I would describe Eugene as a reluctant witness as he clearly would
                    not have testified for the plaintiff had he not been subpoenaed and warned of
                    the consequences of non-compliance with a subpoena. However, I found him to be a
                    forthright and impartial witness when he took the stand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Eugene is the (regional) director of human
                    resources or personnel director at Shangri-La Hotel Singapore. He testified that
                    he first met the defendant and Andrew in or about 2003 when they came to see him
                    to offer Mil-Com’s services for recruitment of trainees in Singapore.
                    Because Shangri-La was desperate for local staff at that point of time, Eugene
                    testified that Shangri-La agreed to engage Mil-Com’s services to recruit
                    local trainees, as reflected in copies of contracts signed between Shangri-La
                    Hotel and Mil-Com dated 26 August 2003 and 9 February 2004. Eugene explained
                    that under both contracts (of two years’ duration), Mil-Com was to provide
                    “service ambassadors” for the food and beverage, front office,
                    guest services, guest relations, concierge and baggage services
                    departments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     For both contracts, Eugene said he dealt with
                    Andrew and the defendant. Subsequently, the duo informed Eugene that they were
                    no longer with Mil-Com but had started a new company <em>viz</em> the plaintiff. Shangri-La Hotel subsequently signed a
                    contract dated 15 August 2005 with the plaintiff in terms similar to the
                    previous contracts signed with Mil-Com. Eugene revealed that because Shangri-La
                    Hotel was caught in a bind between the plaintiff and Gates, his superiors had
                    instructed Eugene to deal less with, and to gradually stop using the services
                    of, the two companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     It was noteworthy that Eugene testified that
                    the plaintiff and Gates were only two of the companies that provided
                    workers/trainees to the Shangri-La Hotel. There were other agencies that
                    provided the same service. For the housekeeping department, another agency was
                    responsible for recruiting room attendants and chamber maids from the PRC.
                    Eugene added that over the years, the number of trainees provided by the
                    plaintiff dwindled because the plaintiff had difficulty getting locals
                    interested in the work-cum-study programme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Eugene’s attention was drawn to
                    Gates’ contract with Shangri-La Hotel dated 16 June 2006, signed by
                    the defendant as director of the former. It was for the provision of foreign
                    trainees on trainee work permits by Gates to the hotel for two years with effect
                    from 1 July 2006. He said Desmond, Shangri-La Hotel’s former human
                    resources manager, was instrumental in securing the contract for Gates. It was
                    Desmond who approached Eugene to give Gates an opportunity to provide foreign
                    trainees who could either be graduates or degree holders. Eugene testified that
                    Gates continued to supply foreign workers to Shangri-La Hotel and he was not
                    aware of any negative feedback regarding their workers. However, Eugene revealed
                    that in the last two years, he had received negative feedback on the quality of
                    the candidates provided by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Due to a quota imposed by MOM, Eugene
                    explained that Shangri-La Hotel was only allowed to employ one foreign trainee
                    for every five local trainees irrespective of its size and the number of its
                    employees. After the foreign trainees had completed their six months’
                    training, they had to return to their home countries as MOM would not allow them
                    to be retained as employees. Apart from employment pass holders, it was only
                    semi-skilled foreigners <em>viz</em> those holding special
                    passes (“S Passes”) or those holding work permits from traditional
                    source countries (like Malaysia), who could be employed in hotels. S Pass
                    holders needed to earn a minimum monthly salary of $1,800 before they could be
                    employed by Singapore hotels and they were subject to foreign workers’
                    levy. Even then, there was a quota imposed by MOM for such
                workers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     In March 2007, Eugene had recommended the
                    defendant to the human resources manager, Francis Law (“Francis”)
                    of Malaysia’s YTL Group, describing the defendant as
                    “reliable”. Francis enlisted the defendant’s help, having
                    faced difficulties in recruiting Malaysians for the group’s hotels in West
                    Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Counsel for the plaintiff repeatedly
                    questioned Eugene that if he had requested of the plaintiff instead of the
                    defendant and/or Gates, the plaintiff could similarly have supplied Shangri-La
                    with foreign workers. Eugene’s answer was “no”, citing the
                    following example. To drum up business for its food and beverage outlets during
                    the 2008 financial crisis, Eugene said Shangri-La Hotel ran a “Flash Your
                    Age” campaign where diners celebrating their birthdays at Shangri-La
                    Hotel were given a discount based on their ages. There was an overwhelming
                    response to the campaign. The hotel was swarmed with telephone calls. Eugene
                    requested of the plaintiff but it was unable to provide Mandarin-speaking
                    trainees for the hotel’s call centre. The hotel resorted to other agencies
                    to obtain the trainees and they were not necessarily from Gates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Apart from Eugene, the plaintiff called two
                    other hotel representatives to testify. They were Margariete Virginia Johnson
                    (“Margariete”) (PW5) who is currently the front office manager of
                    the Hilton Hotel but who was previously with the Grand Hyatt (2002-2009)
                    occupying the same post. Besides Margariete, the plaintiff also called the
                    former human resources manager of the Grand Hyatt, Hong Bee Chen
                    (“Hong” who is known as Vicki) (PW9) to testify. Hong was with the
                    Grand Hyatt from April 2006 to May 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Margariete recalled making a trip to Manila to
                    recruit staff. She met Desmond for the first time at the airport and he
                    accompanied her to Manila in place of the defendant who she was told, was in
                    Macau. Margariete testified that she was told by Desmond during the flight that
                    the Filipinos to be recruited (and subsequently Indonesians) were not supplied
                    by the plaintiff. The defendant did not tell her the plaintiff only supplied
                    local trainees. Margariete said she always thought she dealt with the plaintiff
                    on Grand Hyatt’s staffing requirements and she continued to-date to deal
                    with the plaintiff on the Hilton Hotel’s staff recruitment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Nothing turns on Hong’s testimony as
                    like Margariete, she said she dealt with the plaintiff and the defendant in
                    particular, on staffing recruitments for the Grand Hyatt. Unlike Margariete
                    however, Hong recalled having dealt with Desmond on foreign trainees. Hong also
                    recalled liaising with another agency to recruit staff from the PRC and
                    testified that the plaintiff only provided local trainees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Besides Margariete and Hong, the
                    plaintiff’s other witnesses included its former operations manager Amran
                    Bin Samsudin (“Samsudin”) (PW3), its current operations manager
                    Linda Teo (“Linda”) (PW7) as well as its assistant operations
                    manager Evelyn Lee (“Evelyn”) (PW6).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     At the material time, Samsudin handled the
                    accounts of the Grand Hyatt, The Intercontinental, The Ritz-Carlton Millenia,
                    The Conrad Centennial and Sentosa Resort &amp; Spa. He recalled receiving a
                    telephone call from Hong (this corresponds with <a href="#p1_89">[89]</a> above) of the Grand Hyatt in mid-2006 inquiring about
                    shortlisted Indonesian trainees. Samsudin was surprised as the plaintiff to his
                    knowledge did not supply Indonesian trainees to any of its clients. He
                    questioned the defendant and the latter confirmed that he was recruiting foreign
                    trainees for the plaintiff and that Andrew was aware of the fact. Samsudin
                    subsequently received similar inquiries from the Grand Hyatt, The
                    Intercontinental and Sentosa Resort &amp; Spa when the callers could not contact
                    the defendant, Andrew and another staff member called Lawrence
                Teo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Samsudin deposed that he participated in the
                    Malaysian recruitment exercise in Kuala Lumpur in October 2006. Like Andrew (see
                    [26]), Samsudin said he was keen to recruit Malaysians as trainees but was
                    discouraged by the defendant’s negative comments that Malaysian trainees
                    were not financially viable for the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Samsudin visited Jakarta in October 2007 on
                    the plaintiff’s behalf with a view to recruiting Indonesian trainees by
                    partnering with two Indonesian educational institutions that provided
                    hospitality services. As none of the Indonesian parties who told him of the
                    defendant’s placing of Indonesian trainees with Singapore hotels through
                    Gates testified, Samsudin’s written testimony has no probative value. As
                    an aside, I should point out that the Indonesian educational institutions that
                    the plaintiff contacted were Gates’ contacts. In the defendant’s
                    closing submissions (para 43), he accused Andrew/the plaintiff’s
                    staff of stealing and retrieving information from his desk on Gates’
                    contact with its Indonesian counterparts and using the same to place two batches
                    of foreign recruits in The Sentosa Resort &amp; Spa.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Samsudin deposed that the number of trainees
                    which the plaintiff placed with the Shangri-La Hotel decreased from 40 in 2004
                    to 18 in 2009. Further, he discovered from his visits that the plaintiff’s
                    trainees at The Intercontinental, The Shangri-La Hotel and the Grand Hyatt were
                    replaced by Filipinos and Indonesians provided by Gates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Linda testified that she handled the Pan
                    Pacific Hotel and Grand Hyatt Hotel accounts for the plaintiff. She corroborated
                    Samsudin’s testimony on Hong’s inquiry in [91] on Indonesian
                    trainees. In fact, Hong had complained to her about the Indonesian trainees
                    thinking the plaintiff had recruited them. Linda also complained of the
                    plaintiff’s loss of business from The Pan Pacific’s Atrium Lounge
                    where its local trainees were replaced by Filipinos. The Pan Pacific had in fact
                    suggested to her that the plaintiff should recruit foreign trainees but when she
                    raised the subject with the defendant, he opined that the profit margins were
                    not enough.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Nothing turns on the testimony of Evelyn who
                    essentially repeated what Samsudin and Linda deposed to in their AEICs. Like
                    Andrew, Samsudin and Linda, Evelyn blamed the defendant for
                    “stifling” (using her word) the plaintiff’s efforts to
                    recruit Malaysian and mainland Chinese as trainees and for the plaintiff’s
                    loss of business, this time at the Intercontinental Hotel, which was under her
                    charge. She sensed that the defendant’s involvement with the plaintiff
                    decreased over time and by end 2006, his involvement decreased to the extent
                    that he did not even check the number of trainees hired by the plaintiff’s
                    clients.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     I should point out that it was the
                    defendant’s case that Evelyn’s salary was paid by the plaintiff
                    although half the time she worked for Sass Atlantic whilst Linda’s salary
                    was paid by the plaintiff even though she worked for half a year at Sass
                    Atlantic. This was not denied by Andrew but justified by him in <a href="#p1_108">[108]</a> below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Stelle was the plaintiff’s final
                    witness. Her role in the plaintiff (after the defendant’s termination in
                    September 2007) was to manage the payroll and she also took over the
                    defendant’s duties as business development manager sometime in April 2009.
                    Stelle’s testimony echoed that of Andrew. As such, it serves no purpose to
                    repeat it here. Moreover, it was established under cross-examination that a
                    substantial part of Stelle’s written testimony was hearsay – it was
                    what was told to her (usually by Andrew) and not what she saw or heard herself.
                    Above all, Stelle did not visit Macau and had no personal knowledge of the Macau
                    project. Stelle produced calculations of the plaintiff’s gross profit
                    margins for the years 2004-2008. I did not find Stelle’s testimony helpful
                    at all for this reason and for other reasons set out later in my
                    findings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(ii)   The defendant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     The defendant (DW1) called Melvin and Desmond
                    as his witnesses, together with a former trainee of the plaintiff Boon Ching
                    Ching (“Daisy”) (DW6) as well as the three personnel/human
                    resources managers of Singapore hotels that were/are the plaintiff’s
                    and/or Gates’ clients.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    I turn first to the defendant’s
                    testimony. In his AEIC and in the witness box, the defendant refuted the
                    accusations levelled against him by Andrew and the plaintiff’s other
                    witnesses that he had channelled to Gates, contracts from Singapore hotels that
                    were meant for the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Contrary to Andrew’s claim, the
                    defendant pointed out that Andrew was always more focussed on establishing his
                    business in Sass Atlantic than developing the plaintiff’s business,
                    sometimes at the expense of the plaintiff, the reason being that Andrew and his
                    wife Stelle owned 100% of Sass Atlantic as against 65% of the plaintiff. When he
                    worked for Mil-Com, the defendant said the primary objective was to outsource
                    manpower for Singapore Airlines. Unfortunately, despite a presentation to the
                    senior management of Singapore Airlines, Mil-Com did not succeed in its
                    objective. Mil-Com’s subsequent efforts to initiate contacts/contracts
                    with Emirates, Air China and Japan Airlines were also
                unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The defendant explained that the
                    plaintiff’s trainee scheme for locals was a two year work-cum-study
                    programme whereby school-leavers from poor backgrounds with “N”
                    level or Institute of Education (“ITE”) certificates could study
                    and work at the same time to gain experience in the hospitality field. The
                    plaintiff’s first batch of about 20 trainees was recruited in 2003. Hotels
                    like The Shangri-La and The Grand Hyatt were receptive and were the first hotels
                    with which the plaintiff placed trainees who were mainly recruited from
                    ITE.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    While Andrew made light of his parting with
                    Diana, the defendant said there were disagreements between Andrew and Diana that
                    caused Andrew to leave Mil-Com. The defendant sensed it because Andrew
                    instructed him on one occasion to go to Shangri-La Hotel quickly and change the
                    contracting party from Mil-Com to the plaintiff, which the defendant did. The
                    defendant recalled receiving a telephone call from Diana (in March-April 2003)
                    where she apologised to him but informed him that he and the other staff of the
                    plaintiff could no longer go to Mil-Com’s office because she had changed
                    the locks. Diana added she was upset with Andrew and apparently broke down when
                    she met him with Andrew subsequently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    The defendant refuted Andrew’s
                    testimony that Diana had (out of the blue) reminded them at the meeting of
                    conflict of interests and their directors’ duties. What the defendant
                    recalled was that Diana wanted Andrew to be responsible for the full loss of
                    $300,000 incurred by Mil-Com which Andrew rejected arguing that that as a 20%
                    shareholder he should not bear the full loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    The defendanttestified that Andrew requested
                    that staff Andrew had hired for Sass Atlantic (Rachelle Ang and Evelyn) were to
                    be paid by the plaintiff because to Andrew, it made no difference whether they
                    were paid from the left pocket or the right pocket. However, it made a
                    difference to the defendant as he had no shares in Sass Atlantic whereas Andrew
                    and Stelle held 65% shares in the plaintiff and that meant he was paying 35% of
                    such staff’s salaries. However, when the defendant broached the subject to
                    Andrew, it drew an angry response from Andrew (even though the defendant
                    apologised). This can be seen from the following text message which the
                    defendant received from Andrew on 21 November 2005 at 11.45pm:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Agreed. But if you remind me again about resource sharing issues, I will
                        bill PVR for licensing of training, brand equity and increase rent, and as
                        majority shareholder I will terminate your directorship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Still not mollified by or satisfied with the
                    defendant’s apology, Andrew sent another message to the defendant at
                    1.31am on 22 November 2005 which read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As a friend no issue, but as an equity partner you need to know where you
                        stand. I am very uncomfortable about you talking about Sass using PVR
                        resources, as if PVR does not use Sass resources (Emirates database,
                        training heads filler) or brand equity, business references from beginning
                        and even up to now. If we don’t see eye to eye as business partners, I
                        am prepared to part but keep the friendship. Please respect me as the
                        majority shareholder, is all I ask. I hope I don’t have to remind you
                        about this again.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    There was also a conflict in the work done
                    by Sass Atlantic and the plaintiff. The defendant recounted that Andrew had met
                    the management of CIAS (see para [21]) to propose a work-cum-study
                    programme for its staff. The defendant was excluded from the meeting.
                    Subsequently, Andrew informed the defendant that CIAS wanted a charge rate of
                    $7.00 per hour for the programme. The defendant expressed his view that such a
                    low rate was not feasible pointing out that Shangri-La was then paying the
                    plaintiff an hourly rate of $8.00 for a similar programme. Less an allowance of
                    $4.50-$5.00 to be paid to the trainees, the plaintiff would be left with
                    $2.00-$2.50 to cover overheads and for profits. Andrew’s response was, if
                    the defendant did not want to do it for the plaintiff, why not let Sass Atlantic
                    take on the CIAS assignment? This was encapsulated in Andrew’s text
                    message to the defendant sent on 21 November 2005 at 9.36pm where he
                    said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Robin, if the CIAS deal is indeed around 7 dollars just as they claim and
                        you don’t want to do it…then I like to propose that Sass take
                        on the project, firstly it is in the aviation industry, 2nd Sass desperately
                        need to build its own growth and its own resources with sustainable business
                        model, which Sass doesn’t have now. I have help grown Shang, Hyatt,
                        Intercon, Regent, Conrad with sustainable growth model for PVR. These are
                        the ones I pitch and help close the deal. 4 of these clients are our largest
                        most stable clients. I need to do likewise for Sass so that it can stand on
                        its own feet with its own resources. It is frustrating sharing resources and
                        my experience in Honeywell tells me so, as you know. Please concur and not
                        keep even aviation projects away from Sass…</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The defendant testified he suspected Andrew may not have been truthful
                    with him and that CIAS may well have offered a rate higher than $7.00 per hour.
                    That was why the defendant was not invited by Andrew to attend the meeting with
                    CIAS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    The defendant disputed para 62 of
                    Andrew’s AEIC. Andrew had claimed therein that it was part of the
                    agreement between the plaintiff and Sass Atlantic that the former would meet the
                    office, manpower and other expenses of the latter when Sass Atlantic transferred
                    the Shangri-La contract to the plaintiff. Andrew further deposed that Sass
                    Atlantic voluntarily paid the defendant $11,525.34 for the period March 2006 to
                    July 2007 for work done by the plaintiff’s staff for Sass Atlantic. The
                    defendant was further paid $154,771 for the period July 2005 to July 2007 as
                    profits for his 35% equity share in the plaintiff. Further, Sass Atlantic paid
                    the medical expenses/bills of three staff (Evelyn, Samsudin and Roland) of the
                    plaintiff for the period September 2004 to September 2007. The defendant did not
                    dispute those payments but pointed out that the plaintiff reimbursed Sass
                    Atlantic two-thirds of the latter’s rent not to mention that its staff
                    like Linda worked almost full-time for Sass Atlantic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    The defendant drew the court’s
                    attention to Andrew’s affidavit where Andrew had worked out the costs
                    sharing between the plaintiff and Sass Atlantic. Andrew claimed there that the
                    plaintiff owed Sass Atlantic an estimated $112,000 for supporting the plaintiff
                    with Emirates’ “brand name” of which the defendant’s
                    35% share amounted to $39,200. Andrew added that Sass Atlantic
                    “gave” $45,000 to the plaintiff by the value of the Shangri-La
                    contract. Further, Andrew claimed he had to pay $43,000 to Mil-Com to
                    “redeem the bank account from Mil-Com”. This (according to Andrew)
                    meant that Sass Atlantic subsidised the defendant to the extent of $15,750 (35%
                    x $45,000). As the plaintiff subsequently repaid Andrew $38,000, that left a
                    balance outstanding of $5,000 on the payment made to Mil-Com of which the
                    defendant’s share was $1,750.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    The defendant testified that he could not
                    accept Andrew’s calculations as the computation was not based on correct
                    figures, one example being that Andrew’s monthly salary was $4,000 but he
                    had used $5,000 as the figure in his calculations. In the defendant’s
                    opinion, the proportion of costs charged to the plaintiff far exceeded the
                    actual costs incurred by Sass Atlantic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    It is noteworthy that one item included in
                    Andrew’s computation as chargeable to the plaintiff was the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Andrew Cost Per Month    </p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1"></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Opportunity cost per month (Honeywell salary as of 2002 Sep)
                            $14100    </p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Less cost supported by the plaintiff    5,273.33</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Net cost per month to support the plaintiff    8,826.67</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    I can say without more that the above item
                    is not only unjustified but absurd and was quite rightly rejected by the
                    defendant along with many other items of a personal nature incurred by Andrew
                    but charged to the plaintiff. I see no reason why the plaintiff was/is expected
                    to bear the cost of Andrew’s computer, his mobile telephone and his
                    parking charges if he spent most if not all of his time working at and for Sass
                    Atlantic as well as travelling for the latter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    The defendant testified that the text
                    messages from Andrew in [105] and [106] not only hurt and saddened him but
                    caused him to feel insecure; I am not surprised. Anyone reading Andrew’s
                    messages with its unpleasant and menacing tone, never mind a fellow (minority)
                    shareholder and director like the defendant, would be fearful. Andrew had not
                    minced his words. He did not want the defendant to forget that he (with his wife
                    Stelle) was the majority shareholder who controlled the plaintiff and he could
                    get rid of the defendant at any time. Indeed, Andrew followed through his
                    threats by calling an EGM to remove the defendant as a director later that month
                    (see [9]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Although he was not removed as a director on
                    27 November 2005, the defendant felt insecure – his position in the
                    plaintiff was precarious as Andrew could still remove him subsequently for any
                    or no reason. The defendant decided he would have to make alternative plans for
                    his future. After he became acquainted with Desmond, the defendant realised
                    there was one area where he could put his expertise and experience in recruiting
                    manpower to good use <em>viz</em> foreign recruitment. The
                    idea had been briefly discussed by the plaintiff previously but not pursued
                    because the plaintiff did not have the resources for the project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    To turn his idea into reality, the defendant
                    testified that he checked the website of MOM to ascertain the regulatory
                    requirements of foreign labour recruitment. He then signed up to do a course
                    leading to the award of a CEA at the Singapore Polytechnic and subsequently
                    passed the examination after completing the course. The defendant said he also
                    acquired knowledge of foreign manpower recruitment from Desmond as the latter
                    was an experienced recruitment manager. The defendant also had to update himself
                    periodically on MOM regulations which constantly changed due to market
                    conditions. These measures were done by the defendant in his own
                time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Contrary to Andrew’s complaint that he
                    did not pursue the possibility of recruiting PRC workers for the plaintiff and
                    that he had misled Andrew into thinking the import of Chinese workers was not
                    allowed, the defendant explained that MOM only changed the rules and allowed the
                    import of PRC workers from 1 June 2007, at 5% of an employer’s workforce
                    which percentage was subsequently increased to 10%.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    The defendant similarly rebutted
                    Andrew’s claim that the plaintiff intended to recruit foreign students
                    from CSM (see [20]) and place them as trainees in Singapore hotels. This would
                    not have been allowed under MOM’s regulations. As for Andrew’s
                    complaint that he discouraged the plaintiff from recruiting Malaysians, the
                    defendant explained that it was not viable because the hotels would have to pay
                    a foreign worker’s levy on Malaysians (and they would therefore cost more)
                    as against the plaintiff’s local trainees. In any case, the
                    plaintiff’s recruitment exercise in Kuala Lumpur for Malaysians was a
                    failure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    The defendant drew the court’s
                    attention to the audited accounts of the plaintiff for the years 2005 and 2006.
                    The plaintiff’s revenue for 2005 was $1,707,352 and it increased
                    substantially to $2,047,049 in 2006 mainly due to his efforts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    The defendanttestified he was reacquainted
                    with Desmond in 2005 after their last encounter at the Shangri-La in 2004 when
                    Desmond was still the hotel’s recruitment manager. After meeting Desmond a
                    few more times subsequent to the November EGM, the defendant and Desmond decided
                    to go into the recruitment of foreign trainees. The defendant first applied for
                    the CEA. Desmond then used his previous contacts from Shangri-La Hotel to
                    sources for trainees from two Indonesian colleges and one Filipino school.
                    Desmond also had contacts with Filipino recruitment agencies and subsequently
                    from South Korea.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    The defendantrevealed that when Desmond
                    moved into the plaintiff’s office temporarily for two to three months
                    after starting Gates, Andrew asked him to approach Desmond with a view to the
                    plaintiff going into the field of executive search; Andrew wanted a 20% stake in
                    Desmond’s business. Desmond declined and moved out of the
                    plaintiff’s premises to Peninsular Plaza shortly thereafter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    In cross-examination the defendant revealed
                    that it was in fact Andrew who encouraged him to register his sole
                    proprietorship Trendz Consultants to receive the defendant’s share of the
                    profits from the plaintiff. Andrew’s share of the profits was similarly
                    transferred to Andrew’s sole proprietorship Sass Atlantic
                Aviation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    As for Nanyang (see [25]), the defendant
                    explained that Desmond travelled to Indonesia very often in 2006 and worked with
                    Indonesian students from two to three schools to source for trainees but the
                    margins were very low. Nanyang was incorporated in October 2006 by him and
                    Desmond with a view to attracting Indonesian and later Filipino students to
                    attend private schools in Singapore. There was then a local private school for
                    foreign students called Nanyang Institute of Management Pte Ltd
                    (“NIM”) whose chief executives the defendant had met. He had hoped
                    to use Nanyang to bring in foreign students for NIM which taught a diploma
                    course in hospitality, and earn a commission on the school fees paid by the
                    students. Private schools in Singapore saw high growth in 2006 and it was a
                    lucrative business. Unfortunately, NIM did not have the requisite licence to
                    accept such students and Nanyang became a dormant company in 2007-2008 after
                    going into the business of leasing dormitories temporarily.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    The defendant testified he was told of his
                    suspension when he was met at the airport on 12 September 2007 by Roland of
                    the plaintiff’s staff and Daisy from Sass Atlantic. They told the
                    defendant that Andrew had instructed them to escort him to the plaintiff’s
                    office and that they needed to retrieve the plaintiff’s Dell computer that
                    the defendant was using. The defendant refused to go to the plaintiff’s
                    office and further refused to acknowledge Andrew’s letter of suspension.
                    The defendant informed Roland and Daisy that the Dell computer had crashed a
                    long time ago and had since been discarded; he was using his own
                laptop.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    The defendant referred to the meeting on
                    26 March 2008 at [45] where Andrew and Stelle demanded that he compensate
                    the plaintiff $348,326 for allegedly diverting business to Gates and Nanyang.
                    The defendant said the demand was unjustified as it was premised on Gates making
                    the amount of profits the couple had projected which Gates never achieved as
                    reflected in its 2007 audited accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    I turn next to Desmond’s evidence.
                    Desmond testified that he became acquainted with Andrew and the defendant when
                    he was the human resource manager at the Shangri-La Hotel. He dealt mainly with
                    the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    Although both were directors and
                    shareholders of Gates, Desmond asserted that before the defendant left the
                    plaintiff’s services, the defendant was only his silent partner and was
                    not involved in Gates’ operations. Further, before the defendant left the
                    plaintiff, the defendant did not draw either director’s fees or a salary
                    from Gates. Desmond testified he was solely responsible for and ran Gates in the
                    initial years, funding the company’s operations with his own money. The
                    defendant was active in Gates only after he left the plaintiff. Further, the
                    business of Gates in 2006-2007 was not profitable at all, its losses being
                    reflected in the audited accounts of the company for the two
                years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    After leaving the Shangri-La Hotel in 2004,
                    Desmond worked elsewhere before he set up Gates with his wife’s help,
                    first as a sole proprietorship doing executive search for hotel management
                    personnel before converting it to a limited company, doing both executive search
                    and foreign workers recruitment. He testified that he and the defendant operated
                    on mutual trust and on a gentleman’s agreement that Desmond would keep all
                    the fees earned from executive search and he would only share (equally) with the
                    defendant Gates’ income from manpower recruitment. Desmond stated
                    unequivocally that Gates never competed with the plaintiff because the former
                    only recruited foreign workers (but not Malaysians or mainland Chinese) for
                    hotels whereas the plaintiff only provided local trainees. That was why it was
                    not uncommon for some hotels (<em>inter alia</em> Grand
                    Hyatt, Shangri-La, Conrad Centennial, The Intercontinental, and Marina Mandarin)
                    to have contracts with the plaintiff and Gates concurrently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Desmond denied the plaintiff’s pleaded
                    allegation that Gates had taken over the plaintiff’s customers or
                    clientele. He was equally emphatic in his contention that the defendant had no
                    overseas contacts before joining Gates. Otherwise the defendant would not have
                    come to him for help.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    Desmond exhibited to his AEIC copies of,
                    memoranda of understanding that he had signed on behalf of Gates, one with an
                    Indonesian school, another with an Indonesian tourism institute and Gates’
                    accreditation with SOL in the Philippines.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    As for Nanyang, Desmond also corroborated
                    the defendant’s evidence on the rationale for its setting-up. He said he
                    tried to bring in Filipino and Indonesian students through Nanyang but
                    failed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    I should point out that Desmond passed the
                    requisite examination and holds a CEA licence for manpower recruitment in
                    Singapore. Andrew’s portrayal of the defendant as the person holding a CEA
                    licence on the plaintiff’s behalf and which the defendant subsequently
                    took with him to Gates was inaccurate. The CEA licence was personal to the
                    defendant. It had nothing to do with the plaintiff. If Andrew had taken the
                    trouble (like the defendant and Desmond) to attend the course run by the
                    Singapore Polytechnic, sat for and passed the requisite examination
                    subsequently, he too could have been obtained a CEA licence and ventured into
                    foreign labour recruitment for the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    Desmond revealed that he moved out of the
                    plaintiff’s premises because it did not seem to him a fair trade-off that
                    he should give 20% of his executive search revenue to the plaintiff without
                    consideration, in exchange for a free workstation. Desmond did his sums and
                    realised that it was commercially better for him to pay $1,000 per month for 420
                    sq ft of rented space at the Peninsular Plaza than to give $2,000 of his (then)
                    monthly revenue of $10,000 to the plaintiff and be tied to the plaintiff for
                    life.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    Desmond’s testimony on the Macau
                    project corroborated the defendant’s version particularly on his role in
                    bringing Filipino recruits to Macau through SOL. Desmond testified that the
                    defendant had approached him in June 2007 to introduce a Philippines recruitment
                    agency to Lei Yun as the latter had no contact for recruiting Filipinos. Desmond
                    said he made the introduction of SOL to Lei Yun in his personal capacity, not on
                    behalf of Gates. As such, any revenue that he obtained from the Macau project
                    would not be paid to or shared with Gates. After he had made the introduction,
                    Desmond said he had no dealings with Andrew.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    An important factor raised by Desmond and
                    which the plaintiff appeared to have overlooked was that Desmond came from the
                    hotel industry. As he pointedly informed the plaintiff’s counsel, he knew
                    many of the human resource/personnel managers of major hotels from his stint
                    with the Shangri-La Hotel. Consequently, he had good contacts in the industry
                    when he started Gates. He not the defendant, negotiated contracts on
                    Gates’ behalf with the people he already knew in the hotel industry. The
                    plaintiff could not challenge this aspect of his evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    I would add that cross-examination of
                    Desmond did not show up any inconsistencies in his testimony so as to cast doubt
                    on his credibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Macau project</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    As for the Macau project, the
                    defendant’s version of events was vastly different from that put forward
                    by Andrew and Jeff.According to the defendant, Andrew’s contact with Hicks
                    (see [27]) at the beginning of 2007 was very preliminary. The defendant said he
                    followed up by sending a proposal to Hicks on a work-cum-study scheme that the
                    plaintiff had tried out in Singapore. He received no response to his proposal.
                    When Hicks visited Singapore subsequently, the defendant raised the subject of
                    sourcing manpower for the Shoppes. Hicks asked that the plaintiff’s
                    representatives visit him in Macau with their proposal which the defendant and
                    Andrew did one or two weeks later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    Contrary to Jeff’s comment that Lei
                    Yun was a small-time company, the defendant pointed out that the Lei Yun group
                    was a prominent construction company in Macau. Due to the limited labour pool in
                    Macau because of its small population (half million), the defendant testified he
                    and Melvin brainstormed on the sort of workers that would be suitable for the
                    Shoppes bearing in mind government regulations. They concluded that Filipinos
                    would be ideal. Filipinos were willing to do shift duty unlike the Macanese.
                    Further, the Macanese government only allowed locals to be croupiers in the
                    casinos, thereby retaining the best jobs in the gambling industry for its own
                    citizens. As the plaintiff was new in Macau, the defendant explained he had to
                    rely on and learn from Melvin on what was required of foreign labour recruitment
                    under Macanese law, including the restrictions and quotas.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    The defendant and Melvin met Sullivan (see
                    [27]) who verified Lei Yun’s licences and visited ACN in Zhuhai. The
                    plaintiff sent out questionnaires to the retailers to ascertain the manpower
                    needs of the Shoppes. The plaintiff then signed the non-disclosure agreement in
                    [73] with Venetian Cotai Limited. The defendant, Andrew and Melvin visited Hong
                    Kong in May 2007 where they made their sales pitch to 20-30 retailers who would
                    have outlets in the Macau project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    The defendant testified that because the
                    plaintiff was not then (and even now) involved in recruiting labour either from
                    the PRC or from the Philippines, he had to rely on Melvin for the former while
                    for the latter, he recommended Desmond to Andrew. He explained that the
                    paperwork involved for both types of recruitment was laborious and extensive and
                    needed the requisite expertise. During that period, the defendant visited Macau
                    as often as two weeks in a month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    The defendant (like Melvin), disputed the
                    testimony of Andrew and Jeff that the profit-sharing arrangement proposed by
                    Andrew (see <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> above) had been agreed to
                    by all parties. The defendant said he had pointed out to Andrew that Jeff made
                    nominal contributions towards the recruitment exercise and yet Jeff was given a
                    share of the profits in addition to which Jeff charged students at ACN fees of
                    RMB28,800 each for four months’ training as cabin crew. Further, Jeff was
                    not a licensed employment agent and therefore could not charge placement fees.
                    The defendant testified that his comments on Jeff drew a strong reaction from
                    Andrew (see [34]) who rejected any attempt to exclude Jeff from the
                    profit-sharing arrangement. Although Jeff placed 38 of his students to work in
                    The Venetian, neither the plaintiff nor Lei Yun received any placement fees
                    therefrom. Further, (according to the defendant), Jeff wanted to charge RMB500
                    per hour to conduct training for some of the plaintiff’s clients. The rate
                    was too high and by the time Andrew informed the defendant that the rate was a
                    mistake and should be RMB500 per day, the plaintiff had lost the training
                    deal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    The defendantfurther refuted Andrew’s
                    claim that the Macau project was very lucrative but the plaintiff had not
                    received its share of the revenue collected by Lei Yun. He cited DFA as an
                    example. DFA had projected its two outlets would be very successful as which
                    result it recruited (through Desmond and SOL), many Filipinos. Unfortunately,
                    after its opening, DFA’s outlets did not get the patronage it projected
                    with the result that within two to three months, DFA had retrenched 16
                    Filipinos. Besides DFA, the defendant testified, newly-opened restaurants also
                    retrenched their foreign workers due to poor business. There were also instances
                    (like Buddha Bar) where the outlet did not even commence business due to
                    disagreement with The Venetian’s management or other issues,
                    notwithstanding that a letter of intent may have been signed with Lei Yun and
                    expenses may have been incurred by SOL in the Philippines. In the case of The
                    Four Seasons Hotel, the management of The Venetian told the plaintiff and/or Lei
                    Yun that the workers selected would not be employed as The Venetian was
                    conducting a retrenchment exercise of its existing employees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    I should add that when he testified, Desmond
                    confirmed that on the Macau project, he lost money on The Four Seasons Hotel,
                    the Buddha Bar and DFA. Desmond described his profit from the Macau project as
                    “pathetic”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    The defendant added that some of the
                    Filipinos placed with DFA did not pay the contractual placement fee to Lei Yun.
                    The Filipinos failed or refused to pay either because they were retrenched soon
                    after they arrived in Macau, or they claimed they had paid before they left the
                    Philippines or, they were not made to sign promissory notes by SOL before they
                    left Manila. DFA refused to help Lei Yun collect the placement fees by
                    deductions from the employees’ salaries for the reason there was no such
                    contractual term in the employees’ contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    Contrary to Andrew’s accusation that
                    he continued to work on the Macau project and against the plaintiff’s
                    interests after his dismissal, the defendant explained that The Venetian had its
                    opening on 28 August 2007 whilst many of the Shoppes in the Macau project
                    were scheduled to open between September and November 2007. He felt he needed to
                    return to Macau (which he did) to explain to Melvin what had happened and to
                    leave it to Melvin to decide who Lei Yun would work with in future. As Melvin
                    opined he was more comfortable working with him, the defendant continued to help
                    Melvin with the Macau project at his own expense (travel and accommodation).
                    Melvin further informed the defendant (which Melvin confirmed when he testified)
                    that Lei Yun would continue to bill clients for work done and retain the monies
                    until differences between the plaintiff, Andrew, the defendant and Jeff were
                    resolved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    At this juncture, I turn to look at the
                    evidence of Melvin (DW2). In his AEIC, Melvin deposed that the roles of the
                    partners in the Macau project were well defined. Lei Yun/the plaintiff were in
                    charge of sales and customers, Jeff would recruit and train PRC workers while
                    Lei Yun was to be the Macau human resource agent as Lei Yun had all the
                    requisite licences for the import of foreign workers. Melvin confirmed the
                    defendant’s testimony as set out in <a href="#p1_141">[141]</a> to <a href="#p1_145">[145]</a> above. As
                    alluded to earlier (at <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a>), Melvin
                    disputed Andrew’s claim that the fee-sharing proposal set out in
                    Andrew’s email dated 18 June 2007 had been agreed. He was adamant
                    that he never knew let alone agreed to Andrew’s proposal. In fact he
                    added, Jeff had also not agreed. In the light of Jeff’s testimony (at
                        <a href="#p1_71">[71]</a> above), either Jeff had done a
                        <em>volte face</em> since 18 June 2007 and had
                    decided to accept Andrew’s proposal, or Jeff was untruthful in his
                    testimony.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    It was noteworthy that during
                    cross-examination, Melvin said that Jeff and Andrew did not participate in the
                    Macau project. He added that it was the defendant who had the closest
                    relationship with the retailers and who understood the project. Hence, after the
                    defendant’s termination by the plaintiff, Melvin asked for the
                    defendant’s assistance to complete the project; Melvin was of the view
                    that only the defendant had the ability to carry on and complete the work,
                    particularly on the recruitment from the Philippines. Melvin had initially
                    requested the defendant for a contact in the Philippines and this resulted in
                    the introduction of SOL to Melvin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    Melvin testified that the defendant was
                    neither a shareholder nor a director of Lei Yun, producing a search conducted in
                    Macau’s register of companies on Lei Yun as confirmation. When shown Lei
                    Yun’s letter dated 20 August 2007 (at [69]), Melvin admitted he had
                    signed it as the general manager. He rationalised it as a requirement of the
                    Philippines authorities with whose procedures for export of labour he was
                    unfamiliar. He understood the purpose was convenience, in order to do business
                    and he did not think it amounted to misrepresentation. During cross-examination,
                    Melvin revealed that in introducing him to Hong Kong retailers for the Macau
                    project, Andrew had similarly passed him off as a director of the plaintiff (and
                    prepared a name card for him accordingly) when he was not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    Melvin testified that he was made aware of
                    the defendant’s termination from the plaintiff’s services by
                    Andrew’s email announcement. He felt embarrassed (and complained it
                    damaged his reputation as well) that Andrew circulated the announcement to
                    retailers in the Macau project some of whom asked him about it. After the
                    defendant’s termination, Andrew and Jeff had a meeting with Melvin where
                    they informed him that Jeff would take over the defendant’s
                    responsibilities. Andrew had also asked Melvin who he sided with. Although he
                    suggested that Andrew should to settle the dispute with the defendant, Melvin
                    said he did not want to interfere. Thereafter, Melvin neither heard from either
                    Andrew or Jeff (which the plaintiff’s counsel disputed) nor whether the
                    fee dispute had been resolved. Melvin continued working on the Macau project
                    with the defendant’s assistance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    Melvin made it clear that Lei Yun was the
                    only legal entity responsible for conducting recruitment for the Macau project
                    and that could collect payment for its services. He confirmed that the fees Lei
                    Yun collected for the Macau project had not been dispersed to anyone. He added
                    that nothing was legally owed to the plaintiff, Jeff or the defendant since no
                    formal agreement was entered into. Melvin went further in his AEIC to say that
                    the plaintiff’s claim against the defendant for any loss of profit and/or
                    business from the Macau project could not stand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    In the course of cross-examination, Melvin
                    revealed that fees were payable by the retailers in the Macau project based on
                    success rates and the number of people placed. Consequently, by his estimate,
                    only about 20 retailers owed placement fees to Lei Yun.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    Melvin said he first heard of Gates in 2008
                    when he came to Singapore to attend the defendant’s wedding. The defendant
                    then informed Melvin that he had joined Gates. Melvin was then introduced to
                    Desmond. He was not aware of Desmond’s involvement in the Macau
                    project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    Although Melvin was called as the
                    defendant’s witness, I have no doubt that his testimony was unbiased and
                    truthful.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s other witnesses </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    Besides Desmond and Melvin, the defendant
                    called three hotel personnel as his witnesses. They were Florence Yeo
                    (“Florence”) (DW5) who was formerly the assistant human resource
                    manager of The Sentosa Resort &amp; Spa (between 2006 to 2007), Ng Lip Gee
                    (“Miss Ng”) (DW 3) who was the personnel manager of the Grand
                    Hyatt Hotel (2005 to mid-2007) and Wah Yuh Fang (“Miss Wah”) (DW4)
                    who was the human resource manager for Conrad Centennial (2006 to November
                    2007). All three witnesses testified that they were aware that Gates and the
                    plaintiff were separate entities, with the former supplying foreign trainees for
                    six months while the latter provided local students as trainees for two
                    years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    It bears mentioning that the evidence of
                    Miss Ng who no longer works in the hotel industry, contradicted that of her
                    former colleague Margariete. Miss Ng testified that she was fully aware that
                    Gates and the plaintiff were separate legal entities and performed different
                    functions – the plaintiff supplied local manpower while Gates recruited
                    foreign manpower for the Grand Hyatt. She was introduced by the defendant to
                    Gates as a company that sourced for foreign manpower. Miss Ng added that at the
                    material time, the Grand Hyatt recruited foreign housekeeping staff from
                    Strategic Mindmapping Management concurrently with obtaining foreign and local
                    manpower from Gates and the plaintiff respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    Nothing turns on the testimony of Miss Wah
                    or Florence. Both in essence corroborated Miss Ng’s testimony and in turn
                    that of the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    Another witness was Daisy who was a trainee
                    in the plaintiff’s internship programme in 2003, attached to Shangri-La
                    Hotel. Daisy subsequently worked at Sass-Atlantic for about four months in 2007
                    as a business development manager, tasked with marketing properties in the Thai
                    islands of Phuket and Koh Samui. Daisy testified she also helped to train cabin
                    crew for Tiger Airways along with Linda (whose salary was paid by the
                    plaintiff). Daisy revealed that for her traineeship, the allowances were $4.00
                    per hour which worked out to $600-$800 per month, with no Central Provident Fund
                    contributions or medical or annual leave benefits like regular employees. Hence,
                    while the internship was well received in an economic downturn, it was less
                    attractive when there were more job opportunities in better economic times. In
                    her AEIC, Daisy deposed to standing in for a colleague at a recruitment drive of
                    the plaintiff held at the Suntec Convention Centre; she noticed there were less
                    than 20 walk-in applicants for the internship programme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    Daisy was the person from Sass Atlantic who
                    met the defendant at the airport (see [138]) to inform him of his suspension on
                    12 September 2007. She revealed that she felt uncomfortable treating the
                    defendant as a criminal. However, as an employee, she had no choice but to
                    follow Andrew’s instructions. She explained she left Sass Atlantic because
                    too many things were going on there that made her feel
                uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The issue </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    The only issue this court has to determine
                    is whether the defendant breached his fiduciary duties to the plaintiff in being
                    a director and shareholder of Gates and Nanyang, without declaring his interests
                    to his fellow directors Andrew and Stelle. If the defendant did breach his
                    duties, did his breach cause damage to the plaintiff? As the law on a
                    director’s fiduciary duties both at common law and under s 157 of the
                    Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) is so well known, it does not require
                    repeating in this judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    The picture painted of the defendant by
                    Andrew (and to a lesser extent by Stelle) in the witness box was that of a
                    dishonest and ungrateful colleague/co-director/shareholder, who had secretly
                    worked against the interests of the plaintiff while still in its employment. The
                    defendant that this court saw and heard in the witness box was far removed from
                    the negative image that had been (unfairly) portrayed of him. He came across as
                    honest and sincere. I did not doubt his credibility. What emerged from the
                    evidence was that he had been shabbily treated by the plaintiff and by Andrew in
                    particular.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    It is noteworthy that the defendant did not
                    deny that he had failed to disclose his interest in Gates or Nanyang. His
                    defence was that he had no obligation to disclose because the plaintiff and
                    Gates were not in the same business, more so Nanyang. Apart from the
                    non-disclosure, the defendant denied he had acted against the interests of the
                    plaintiff or benefited from his interest in Gates at the expense of the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    The evidence also showed that there were
                    instances (the Grand Hyatt being one example) where the name of the plaintiff
                    had been mistakenly inserted in the contract provisions as the receiving party
                    of placement fees invoiced by the plaintiff to the hotel. Counsel for the
                    plaintiff (and Andrew) made much of this mistake to accuse the defendant of
                    deliberately misleading the hotels into thinking the plaintiff and Gates were
                    one and the same company. The defendant on the other hand candidly admitted that
                    it had been a typographical error arising from his “cut and paste”
                    job. He used the same template for Gates’ contracts as that he had used
                    for the plaintiff’s contracts of which he was the author in any case
                    (based on Mil-Com’s service contract for the first Shangri-La
                    contract).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    Counsel for the plaintiff also made much of
                    the fact that the defendant had used the plaintiff’s email address in his
                    correspondence on behalf of Gates. I view thus fact as inconsequential since
                    Andrew himself also used the email of Sass Atlantic interchangeably with that of
                    the plaintiff’s for his own correspondence. It bears repeating that the
                    defendant had no shares in Sass Atlantic. Furthermore, for incoming email
                    messages, the defendant was not in a position to dictate to the sender that his
                    email address should be that of the plaintiff and not Gates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    Counsel for the plaintiff and Andrew made
                    much too of the fact that the defendant was designated a director of Lei Yun in
                    Lei Yun’s letter dated 20 August 2007 set out at <a href="#p1_68">[68]</a> above. The defendant explained that it was a
                    requirement by the Philippines authorities that the importing agent of
                    Philippines labour (for Macau) <em>viz</em> Lei Yun
                    provided an official letter for the interview of applicants in Cebu. Melvin was
                    then not available and as a matter of urgency, SOL requested the defendant to
                    sign the letter on Lei Yun’s behalf. Melvin himself had categorically
                    stated that the defendant was never a director of Lei Yun and that the defendant
                    had signed the letter for business convenience. The plaintiff was in no position
                    to challenge the testimony of Melvin in this regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    The last fact the plaintiff capitalised on
                    was that the defendant had signed contracts on behalf of Gates with local hotels
                    while he was still in the plaintiff’s employment. The defendant’s
                    explanation was that whoever was available would sign the contract for Gates.
                    The defendant pointed out that in its early days, Gates was literally a one-man
                    operation of Desmond. If Desmond was busy, the defendant would help out by
                    signing Gates’ contracts on Desmond’s behalf. His testimony was
                    corroborated by Desmond and I accepted it as sensible and logical.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    I note that for a starting salary from the
                    plaintiff of $3,200 that was eventually increased to $3,800, the defendant
                    effectively headed and ran the plaintiff’s operations bringing in revenues
                    for the plaintiff that were $1,707,352 in 2005 and which increased substantially
                    to $2,047,049 in 2006 (see [118]). Apart from meetings with potential clients
                    (many of which like the Dubai trip came to nought), Andrew played no active role
                    in the running of the plaintiff’s operations before the defendant left the
                    plaintiff. According to the defendant, Andrew was only concerned with when the
                    plaintiff would bill the customer and when the defendant/the staff would be
                    collecting the money, not with operations. As reflected in the fact that the
                    plaintiff only managed to place two batches of foreign (Indonesian) trainees
                    with The Sentosa Resort &amp; Spa after the defendant’s departure, Andrew
                    and Stelle were apparently not familiar with the business of manpower placement
                    despite Andrew’s pursuit of many contacts set out earlier in <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    Although he was cross-examined <em>in extenso</em> over 3½ days, the defendant’s
                    testimony, that Gates never provided local but only foreign trainees whereas the
                    plaintiff only provided local but not foreign workers to Singapore hotels was
                    unshaken and not rebutted by the plaintiff. The voluminous documents before the
                    court provided by the defendant as a result of the plaintiff’s numerous
                    and excessive discovery applications, substantiated the defendant’s
                    testimony which in turn was corroborated by Desmond and the defendant’s
                    witnesses from three hotels. On hindsight, this court and the courts below
                    should not have granted the plaintiff’s repeated applications for
                    discovery (purportedly on the basis that the defendant was wilfully withholding
                    relevant documents) as they were nothing more than fishing expeditions,
                    attempting to find evidence to support the plaintiff’s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    Indeed, the plaintiff did not and/or could
                    not produce one iota of evidence that supported Andrew’s bald and repeated
                    assertion (in para 42 of his AEIC and in court) that “as early as
                    September 2004, the plaintiff was already in the business of providing foreign
                    manpower to hotels which Robin was well aware of since he was participating
                    actively in the process”. During cross-examination Andrew prevaricated
                    when questioned on his para 43 but finally, after he was pressed for an
                    answer by the court, he admitted that he had no evidence to support his bold
                    (and I would add untrue) statement. He then disclosed that the first time the
                    plaintiff placed foreign trainees in local hotels (at The Sentosa Resort &amp;
                    Spa) was at end 2007 after the defendant’s departure from the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    Yet, in its closing submissions, the
                    plaintiff asserted (at para 47) in complete disregard of the evidence
                    presented that, “using his close personal relationship, the defendant
                    gradually and systematically funnelled business away from the plaintiff to
                    Gates” and proceeded to expand on the argument by referring to a chart
                    that its counsel had prepared. The submission was completely misconceived.
                    Despite the extensive (and sometimes oppressive) discovery that it obtained from
                    the defendant, the plaintiff did not produce a single service agreement signed
                    with any hotel in Singapore that showed <em>either</em>
                    that (i) Gates provided local trainees or staff <em>or</em>
                    (ii) that the plaintiff provided foreign trainees or staff, <em>before</em> the defendant’s suspension on 12 September
                    2007. Quite simply none existed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    It is also pertinent to note from the
                    defendant’s (unchallenged) evidence that before Gates ventured into the
                    field, foreign hospitality trainees had already been provided to hotels like
                    Shangri-La by other manpower agencies such as FSC and Recruit 2000. His
                    testimony was corroborated by none other than the plaintiff’s own witness
                    Eugene from Shangri-La Hotel (at [82]) whose testimony the plaintiff sought to
                    discredit in its closing submissions (see [181]). Further, according to the
                    defendant, effective from 1 June 2009, MOM no longer permitted Indonesians
                    and only Filipinos could be deployed in hotels as trainees, under a new scheme
                    called training employment pass. For MOM approval’s under this scheme,
                    students had to come from state universities. Gates’ Indonesian partners
                    could not but its Filipino partners could, satisfy the criterion. Andrew had no
                    contacts in the Philippines that would have enabled the plaintiff to recruit
                    Filipinos for the hotel industry. The change of schemes by MOM may explain why
                    the plaintiff only managed to place two batches of Indonesians at The Sentosa
                    Resort &amp; Spa and no more at the same or other hotels.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    As Desmond had testified, many local
                    recruitment companies did not carry out foreign recruitment because they did not
                    have the contact or network. This certainly applied to the plaintiff. SOL was
                    Gates/Desmond’s contact, not the plaintiff’s or the
                    defendant’s. Hence, to date, the plaintiff has not recruited Filipinos for
                    its clients.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    As for Andrew’s repeated assertion
                    that the plaintiff’s intention was always to go into foreign labour
                    recruitment but that the defendant discouraged him (which the defendant denied),
                    the defendant’s answer was that those intentions were momentary,
                    short-lived and never pursued, citing Shangri-La Dubai as an example. I saw no
                    evidence that contradicted the defendant’s stand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    At this juncture I need to digress. The
                    defendant had accused Andrew/the plaintiff (see [93]) of stealing and retrieving
                    information from the defendant’s desk on Gates’ contacts with its
                    Indonesian counterparts and using the same to place Indonesian trainees in The
                    Sentosa Resort &amp; Spa. In the plaintiff’s closing submissions (at
                    para 208) in answer to this accusation, it was contended that “the
                    contact was obtained while the defendant was on the plaintiff’s payroll
                    and hence was the plaintiff’s contact and further, was in the
                    plaintiff’s office”. That lame submission however went against the
                    weight of the evidence adduced from Andrew himself – that he found a list
                    of Gates’ clients on the defendant’s desk. Obviously, Andrew had no
                    scruples about using Gates’ contacts for the plaintiff’s business
                    while in the same breath complaining that the defendant made use of the
                    plaintiff’s clients for Gates’ business (which allegation on the
                    evidence was not substantiated).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    It would also be appropriate at this
                    juncture to comment on Andrew’s testimony. I concluded from the evidence
                    adduced in court that he was an unreliable witness who was quite prepared to and
                    did take liberties with the truth. He was not above practising double standards
                    either when it suited his purpose (see [65], [147], <a href="#p1_169">[169]</a> above and <a href="#p1_177">[177]</a>
                    below). Andrew used Stelle to hold his shares in the plaintiff before he broke
                    away from Mil-Com and he certainly did not declare his interest to
                Diana.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    I dismiss as highly improbable
                    Andrew’s claim that there was an oral agreement made in or about October
                    2003 between himself and the defendant on the terms and conditions of the
                    defendant’s employment. Andrew was not the sort of person to rely on oral
                    agreements. If indeed there had been such an agreement, it would have been
                    evidenced in writing. The alleged oral agreement was fabricated just as Andrew
                    concocted the evidence that Diana would suddenly raise the subject of
                    directors’ duties and conflict at a meeting, when that had no relevance to
                    her discussion with him on who would bear the loss of $300,000 incurred by
                    Mil-Com. Andrew was described (not without justification) as manipulative and
                    unreasonable in the defendant’s closing submissions. Without the alleged
                    oral agreement, there was no basis for Andrew’s allegation that the
                    defendant’s duty included developing new businesses for the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    Earlier (at [113]), I had commented on
                    Andrew’s reaction when the defendant made known his unhappiness over the
                    plaintiff’s having to bear costs which should rightfully be borne by Sass
                    Atlantic. It showed up Andrew’s character for what it was. Andrew would
                    not tolerate dissent from his fellow director which he felt was against his
                    interests. Ultimately, Andrew’s only interest in the plaintiff was purely
                    financial – how much he could get for his 65% investment in the company.
                    There was nothing altruistic about Andrew’s motives in commencing this
                    suit. He thought (wrongly) that the defendant had profited and substantially at
                    that, from the Macau project, and Andrew was bent on getting his 65%
                    share.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    In this regard, the defendant had pointed
                    out that after his removal as a director by Andrew and Stelle, the accounts of
                    the plaintiff showed that Sass Atlantic charged the plaintiff a royalty of
                    $90,113 in 2007 which was never paid by the plaintiff previously. He further
                    noted that staff costs increased tremendously from $128,520 in 2007 to $209,406
                    in 2008. He also noted that legal and professional fees were $117,099 in 2007.
                    He pointed out that the couple was using the plaintiff’s funds to sue him
                    and as a 35% shareholder, he was in fact partly funding this litigation against
                    himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    More pertinently, the defendant had pointed
                    to the inequities of the situation. Andrew sued him via the plaintiff for
                    allegedly taking business away from Gates purportedly in breach of his fiduciary
                    duties to the plaintiff. Yet, Andrew himself targeted the same pool of trainees
                    as the plaintiff for the business of training cabin crew by Sass Atlantic for
                    his clients Jetstar and Tiger Airways. The defendant questioned, why then was it
                    wrong for him to hold a directorship in Gates which business of placing foreign
                        <em>not</em> local trainees with hotels did not
                    conflict with the plaintiff’s business?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    The defendant’s criticism of Andrew
                    was not unfounded. Andrew repeatedly stressed to the defendant that Sass
                    Atlantic had a “brand name” for which he was entitled to charge
                    the plaintiff a premium. The question that arises is what was this “brand
                    name” that justified the plaintiff being saddled with a premium payment
                    let alone a “royalty” amounting to $90,113 in 2007 (see [174])
                    Apart from cabin crew trainees and the prospective employer of such trainees,
                    who would have heard of Sass Atlantic? I certainly did not before this trial.
                    Why would training cabin crew for Emirates Airlines (bearing in mind that it is
                    not/may not be, as well known as Singapore Airlines which is not a client of
                    Sass Atlantic) give Sass Atlantic a brand name? This self-styled branding was
                    nothing more than Andrew’s attempt to milk the plaintiff for more money
                    than his 65% investment warranted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    I do not see why the plaintiff would have to
                    be perpetually beholden to Sass Atlantic merely because Andrew passed the
                    Shangri-La contract onto the plaintiff at the time he parted ways with Mil-Com,
                    particularly when by his own estimate the value of the contract was $45,000,
                    hardly a large sum. I had earlier commented as absurd (at [112]) Andrew’s
                    computation of his cost chargeable to the plaintiff; I need say no more. Andrew
                    had deposed in his AEIC that he paid the defendant dividends in the past (see
                    [108]) based on the defendant’s 35% shareholding. This was not generosity
                    on the part of Andrew as he sought to suggest. It was the defendant’s
                    entitlement to be paid dividends based on the defendant’s shareholding if
                    Andrew declared dividends and paid himself dividends based on his own 65%
                    shareholding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    Before I leave the topic of the credibility
                    of witnesses, I should also make some observations on the testimony of the
                    plaintiff’s other two key witnesses Stelle and Jeff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    In his closing submissions (para 98),
                    the defendant described Stelle as a puppet of Andrew. The defendant contended
                    that throughout her evidence, Stelle had been coached and was under the strict
                    direction of Andrew. Even if she was not coached by Andrew, I had earlier
                    commented (at [98]) that Stelle’s testimony was not helpful as she lacked
                    personal knowledge of key events. When she was recalled (on 14 May 2010) to
                    testify on her calculations in exhibit P5, it was clear from Stelle’s
                    answers to questions posed by the court, that her figures (like Andrew’s
                    computations in exhibits P1 and P2) were based entirely on projections of what
                    she/Andrew <em>thought</em> the plaintiff/Lei Yun could
                    have earned from the retailers in the Macau project, disregarding the realities
                    of the situation that (according to Melvin) Lei Yun only claimed fees from 20 or
                    so retailers because Lei Yun operated on a success basis to earn its
                    fees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    As for Jeff, he appeared to be the only
                    person who had benefited from the Macau project without encountering any
                    problems. Unlike Lei Yun, Desmond and the plaintiff (who have yet to resolve
                    their differences on the fee-sharing arrangement), Jeff had already collected
                    his training fees upfront from the 38 cabin crew trainees that he placed in The
                    Venetian. His involvement in the Macau project was nominal if not non-existent
                    and he gave himself (and the plaintiff) too much credit in his contention (at
                    [75]) that without his contacts, the plaintiff would not have secured the Macau
                    project. It was Desmond who was instrumental in importing Filipinos into Macau
                    through SOL for Lei Yun. Neither Jeff nor the plaintiff held the necessary
                    licences in Macau that would enable them to carry out recruitment of foreign
                    workers and place them in the Shoppes. The defendant’s complaint that Jeff
                    did nothing to earn the commission that Andrew was willing to share with him was
                    not unjustified. I viewed Jeff’s testimony with considerable scepticism
                    because of his obvious closeness to Andrew. In any event a large portion of his
                    evidence offended the hearsay rule and should be/is disregarded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    In its closing submissions (at
                    para 221), the plaintiff criticised the evidence of its own witness Eugene
                    as naturally suspect and should be discounted because he was the
                    defendant’s close friend. I reject this submission. Eugene’s
                    testimony was balanced and did not lean in either party’s favour. Just
                    because he spoke the truth and it happened to be unfavourable to the plaintiff
                    (see <a href="#p1_83">[83]</a> above) testifying he had received
                    negative feedback on the quality of the plaintiff’s trainees in the last
                    two years, does not mean the court should reject Eugene’s testimony. It
                    bears mentioning that the plaintiff’s witness Hong, also corroborated the
                    testimony of defendant’s witnesses from the hotel industry.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    On the evidence, I find that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_184-p2_a"></a>(a)     there was no conflict of interest
                        and no breach of fiduciary duties on the part of the defendant in his having
                        shares and directorships in Gates and Nanyang at the time he was employed by
                        the plaintiff. Although he failed to disclose his interest in either company
                        to the plaintiff, that failure caused no loss to the plaintiff. The
                        defendant’s failure to disclose was due to his fear of losing his job
                        with the plaintiff a fear which was very real at the material time (see
                        [113]). In any case no loss to the plaintiff resulted from the
                        defendant’s non- disclosure as Gates suffered losses in its operations
                        for the years 2006-2007;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_184-p2_b"></a>(b)     the plaintiff and Gates were not in competition for the
                        same business as they carried out different recruitments for the hotels in
                        Singapore; there is no evidence that the defendant copied the
                        plaintiff’s business model for Gates or Nanyang;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_184-p2_c"></a>(c)     there was no agreement reached on
                        profit-sharing of the revenue from the Macau project as the testimony of
                        Melvin, the defendant and Desmond is to be preferred to that of Andrew and
                        Jeff in this regard;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_184-p2_d"></a>(d)     whatever revenue collected by Melvin from the Macau project has not
                        been distributed and none has been paid to the defendant;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_184-p2_e"></a>(e)     there was no
                        basis for the plaintiff’s computation of the profits the
                        defendant/Gates purportedly made from the Macau project as shown in exhibits
                        P1, P2 and P5. The calculations were based on assumptions which were
                        completely off the mark; the demands for compensation made by Andrew and
                        Stelle in [45] were completely unjustified.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    Accordingly, I dismiss the plaintiff’s
                    entire claim against the defendant with costs to be taxed on a standard basis
                    unless otherwise agreed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    I shall hear arguments on another day as to
                    whether the costs should be borne by the plaintiff or personally by Andrew.
                    There is considerable merit in the defendant’s argument that making an
                    order for costs against the plaintiff would be unfair to him as it would mean he
                    was effectively paying 35% of those costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    The issue of the defendant’s 35%
                    shareholdings in the plaintiff would also need to be resolved by another forum
                    in the future as the defendant cannot conceivably continue as a shareholder of
                    the plaintiff indefinitely in the light of the breakdown of his relationship
                    with Andrew which has been exacerbated by this suit.</p>
