</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000" face="Times New Roman"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF

DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1. The plaintiffs and the first defendant

were friends and shareholders in the second defendant ("Genisys") a company

incorporated to provide coordinated mechanical and electrical contracts for main

contractors of building contracts. The company became a success, and like many success

stories its rise also marked the falling out of its members. The plaintiffs commenced an

action against the first defendant who was the majority shareholder, in Originating

Summons No. 1902 of 1999, for relief against oppression of the minority shareholders. The

parties, however, reached a settlement after two days’ trial before Rajendran J, and

consent judgment was entered on 7 July 2000. By that judgement, the first defendant agreed

to purchase the plaintiffs’ shares in Genisys. The price was based on an agreed

formula, and fixed at 47% of the value of Genisys as at 11 August 1999. The value of the

company's shares had therefore to be ascertained. The formula and way in which the shares

were to be valued were also agreed under the terms of the consent judgment. By a further

order of court dated 24 May 2001, Don Ho Mun Tuke was appointed as the valuer. The

resulting conclusion of the valuer was that the first defendant was to pay the plaintiffs

the sum of $1,694,199.60 being 47% of the value ($3,604,883.00) of Genisys as at 11 August

1999. The plaintiffs believed that the valuation was not properly carried out because the

first defendant had deliberately withheld material information from the valuer and misled

him with inaccurate ones.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2. Consequently, the plaintiffs commenced

a fresh claim by way of a writ action against the same defendants. This time, the action

was based on fraud in that they allege, broadly speaking, that the first defendant who

controlled Genisys caused fraudulent information to be created and given to the valuer, or

otherwise withheld material information from him, with the purpose and intention of

misleading him and thereby caused him to undervalue the assets of Genisys. The plaintiffs

made various interlocutory applications for discovery but were thwarted by the first

defendants refusal to cooperate or obey the discovery orders in letter and spirit. At the

end of their tether, the plaintiffs applied to the assistant registrar to strike out the

defence on the ground that they had contumaciously and continuously failed to comply with

the discovery orders of the assistant registrar made on 9 July 2001, which also aggregated

previous discovery orders. The assistant registrar declined to strike out the defence and

the plaintiffs appealed before me against that refusal.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3. At the heart of the dispute over

discovery are documents described as Balance Budget Summaries ("BBS"). These are

hard copies of documents containing budget summaries in respect of any given project of

Genisys. Each BBS is a mine of information about the nature, costs, and profitability of

the company in respect of the project stated in the summary. The BBS, however, are not a

stack of documents kept in the cabinets or drawers of the company. The information that

each BBS carries is stored in the database of the company’s computers. They are fed

in, stored, edited, and retrieved as the case may be at any moment by means of a

sophisticated programme known as "IMIX", the acronym for <i>Integrated

Management Information System</i>. It is therefore vital to any party who wishes to

ascertain the true worth of the company that the IMIX disgorges all the information from

the data pool into the printed BBS. By the same token, it is naturally important to anyone

who wishes to prevent that kind of information from surfacing, to manipulate IMIX so that

it regurgitates only choice bits for print.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4. It will first be helpful to consider

what the orders of 9 July 2001 were. For convenience I shall set out the material terms

here:</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5. It can be inferred from the tone and

form (from the repeated use of the word "comprehensive" in the same phrase in

order 1) as well as the specificity of the rest of the above orders that the assistant

registrar must have agreed with plaintiffs' vehement complaint that a previous order for

discovery made on 9 April 2001 was not fully complied with. The first order of 9 April

required that –</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"the first defendant provides the <i>complete</i>

  Balance Budget Summaries for all the three PWD projects under items B and C of paragraph

  27 of the first plaintiff's 15<sup>th</sup> affidavit filed on 2 November 2000 in OS 1902

  of 1999 showing the total alleged loss of S$5.7 million, <i>as well as the latest

  available updated complete BBS as at 13 February 2001</i>" (my emphasis).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">It is also noted that the discovery orders

made by the assistant registrar were in addition to orders made by Rajendran J on 13

February 2001 which were not complied with. Mr. Chong submitted on behalf of the

defendants that the closest BBS to that on 13 February 2001 was 5 January 2001 for the

simple reason that the data in the data pool changes all the time. The previous data

merges with the new each time it is edited. Hence, if no one printed a hard copy on 13

February, as was the case alleged by the defendants, they had no hard copy of that date.

In the event, the nearest hard copy was the one printed on 5 January 2001. The BBS is thus

aptly described as a 'snapshot' of the current status of the project's budget at the time

it was generated.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6. The first defendant asserts in his

affidavits that he had provided all the documents that were required of him. In this

regard, I shall be brief because I do not for the moment think it necessary to set out the

numerous disputes as to what exactly it was that the first defendant actually affirmed and

what he did not. The arguments concerning that aspect have been noted but should not

detain us here. The plaintiffs’ complaint in the appeal before me is that the first

defendant had either deliberately masked, or edited out, or simply refused to produce the

full and true information in the data pool from which the BBS’s were produced.

Secondly, they allege that it was obvious from the BBS themselves that the defendants must

be or have been in possession of supporting or source documents from which the information

fed into the data pool must originally have been set out. These documents (which may be

referred to as either supporting or source documents) were not produced.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7. Mr. Randolf Khoo, counsel for the

plaintiffs, meticulously and very patiently took me through a labyrinthine trail of

documents to establish why he says that the first defendant had not complied with the

orders for discovery. The first and basic point counsel made was that it is inconceivable,

taking into account the type and size of the company that Genisys is, and the nature of

its work and projects that no record is kept of the supporting or source documents. I

agree with this submission entirely, and in my view, there is more than a reasonable

suspicion that such documents must have existed and continue to exist. In this regard, Mr.

Khoo emphasized that the defendants have not deposed anywhere in their affidavits that the

documents no longer exist because they have either been shredded or otherwise disposed. I

am also inclined to infer on a balance of probabilities that such documents cannot be

destroyed without making it impossible for the company's auditors to conduct their audit.

Furthermore, it will be seen that the three major projects, which included that with the

Traffic Police Department are major and complex projects that involved many different

contractors and sub-contractors that it is indeed remarkable that not a single source

document was produced.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8. Next, Mr. Khoo went beyond pure theory

to the specifics of non-disclosure based on what is apparent from the face of the BBS that

had been produced. First, he pointed out that in the BBS of 3 August 2000 at page 386 of

the first plaintiff's seventh affidavit the sub-headings of variation works are captured

and printed but on the 5 January 2001 copy (ordered to be produced) the variation works

had obviously been edited out; but only from the heading for it did not escape the

scrutiny of the plaintiffs and their counsel that a sum of $710,131 appeared in the

details. Counsel also referred to the first defendant's disclosure, in purported

compliance, by setting out 12 "Provisional Budgets" said to be the latest

budgets; but Mr. Khoo quickly pointed out that the documents available and disclosed

showed that there were at least 156 variations that were not evident from the latest

budgets. I am inclined to agree that with such massive and major changes that it is

impossible to have no record of the source or supporting documents. I will not retrace the

steps Mr. Khoo took me through in demonstrating that such changes must and do eventually

show in the BBS unless they are edited out - save to mention briefly, that one of the many

examples counsel had in hand was an item entitled E4001 involving $40,072 at page 282 of

the BBS exhibited in the first plaintiff's seventh affidavit. This item appears to have

been overlooked by the defendants. It is a budget revision request corresponding to the

item in the BBS at page 382 of the same affidavit. Its existence calls in question all

other such documents which were noticeably missing. Next, Mr. Khoo drew my attention to

the non-disclosure concerning the contracts of the second defendant's subsidiary in

Malaysia ("UEG"). Again, Mr. Khoo laboriously demonstrated that there were

material non-disclosure of source documents by the defendants in respect of the UEG

records.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9. With the facts overwhelmingly against

him, Mr. Chong did what a good counsel would have done in the circumstances - he mounted a

formidable argument on the law. His basic position, relying on the Supreme Court Practice

(1999 White Book  24/7/2 at page 471), is that at the interlocutory stage the court

ought to accept a party's affidavit as final and conclusive; and if the deponent says that

whatever he did not produce he did not, or no longer have, his word must not be

contravened - at least until trial. One major plank of Mr. Chong's argument was that if an

"unless order" for disclosure based on reasonable suspicion is made, the

fundamental principle of the burden of proof based on a balance of probabilities will be

plainly ignored. Counsel argued that if a defence is struck out because the defendant did

not comply with the "unless order" then it would have been struck out based on

just a reasonable suspicion. The reference to "reasonable suspicion" is an

allusion to Cotton LJ's opinion in <i>Lyell v Kennedy</i> [1884] 27 Ch d 1, 20, that a

court may order further discovery if it had a reasonable suspicion that there are further

documents to be discovered. This lighter test is clearly intended for a different purpose,

that is to allow further discovery. Different considerations apply when a court is minded

to make an "unless order". It must be assumed that the court is fully aware that

a claim or defence may be struck out if the order is not carried out - hence the title

"unless order". It has nothing to do with the burden of proof in respect of the

merits of the case. It is the compelling force behind a coercive order. Why and when such

orders are necessary depend on the individual situation. I now revert to the issue that

Mr. Chong's argument addresses, that is, whether the deponent's affidavit verifying his

list of documents shall be regarded as conclusive. I must agree with counsel that

generally, such affidavits cannot be contravened by other contentious affidavits and shall

not be subject to cross-examination. The reasons for this, as Stuart-Smith LJ pointed out

in <i>Fayed &amp; Ors v Lonrho Plc</i> (The Times 24 June 1993), are plain. Affidavits

raised in such circumstances do not address the issues for trial and whether the deponent

is truthful or not in respect of the discovery of documents he might still persuade the

trial judge of the merits of his case through other evidence. Stuart-Smith LJ put his view

thus:</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"If I am wrong in holding that the

  statement in an affidavit of documents is conclusive, so that the court has no power to

  order cross-examination, the exercise of that power should in my judgment be reserved for

  those cases where the existence or non-existence of the document raises a discreet issue

  which does not impinge to any serious extent on the issues in the action."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">It should be noted Mr. Khoo had accepted

from the outset that he was not seeking a cross-examination of the first defendant.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10. Mr. Khoo relied on two authorities for

the proposition that the court may strike out a defence if it is satisfied that the

defendant had failed to comply with a discovery order. The first was <i>British

Association Of Glass Manufacturers Ltd v Nettlefold</i> [1912] 1 K B 369, 377. In that

case, Farwell LJ answered the pertinent question as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Is there any grounds from the

  contents of that document, which has thus become part of the affidavit of documents, for

  saying that something further is obviously omitted? In my opinion there clearly is; it was

  decided by this court in <i>Kent Coal Concessions Ltd v Duguid</i> [1910] 1 K B 904, which

  was affirmed in the House Of Lords, that it is allowable for the Court to draw inferences

  and say, as in that case, 'Here is a balance-sheet; a balance-sheet necessarily implies

  the existence of books of account from which that balance sheet was made up; those books

  so far as they were used to make up the balance-sheet, are relevant because the

  balance-sheet is admitted to be relevant, and therefore they must be produced'".</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Counsel quickly pointed out that this is

exactly the situation we have here. He submitted that the BBS were clearly regarded as

relevant. I am in full agreement. The BBS are detailed summaries of the financial position

of the company and summaries cannot exist without source documents. To bolster his

argument, Mr. Khoo referred to <i>Manilal &amp; Sons Pte Ltd v Bhupendra KJ Shan</i>

[1989] SLR 1182. Before proceeding further, it should be noted that that case is unusual

in that the parties there agreed to a cross-examination of the deponent, and it was the

oral evidence of the deponent that exposed his concealment of relevant documents.

Notwithstanding that, the principle emanating from that case is that where the court is

satisfied from the documents produced that other documents must exist, the party concerned

must either produce them or explain on oath what has become of them so that the contest at

trial will be open and fair.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11. The two lines of cases relied upon by

Mr. Khoo and Mr. Chong respectively are not difficult to reconcile.<i> Fayed v Lonrho </i>represent

the general principle whereas <i>Nettlefold </i>represent the exception. It is the

application to facts of individual cases, however, that tend to give rise to difficulties.

For example, in the <i>Fayed</i> case the documents sought were also source documents, and

in some ways similar to the applications in the present appeal. The actual issue in <i>Fayed</i>

however, concerned the decision of the judge to grant an order for cross-examination of

the deponents in respect their affidavits. Nonetheless, Stuart-Smith LJ further held that

a claim or defence ought not to be struck out under O 24 r 16 "except on clear and

uncontested evidence, either as a result of an admitted breach, or because the breach can

be ascertained from the party's own documents, affidavits or pleadings". On this

score, I am satisfied that the plaintiffs have amply demonstrated, through their counsel,

the numerous obvious omissions of documents that must surely exist, or to be more precise,

have existed. If they are no longer in the defendants' possession a reasonable explanation

ought to have been given but no explanation was given by them. In my view, therefore, the

plaintiffs have made out a sufficient case to strike out the defence.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12. In the circumstances, I will allow the

appeal. The question is, ought I to strike out the defence? Reiterating what I had just

stated above, having regard to the long record of non-compliance, the plaintiffs, are in

my opinion, are entitled to strike out the defence by reason of this last round of

non-compliance. The record shows that the defendants only produced a flourish of inchoate

and incomplete documents each time a court order is made against them. The record also

shows that the orders were made after spirited and long arguments that seem to indicate

the tenacity of the defendants in preventing relevant documents from being disclosed.

However, since a striking out, particularly of a defence, is a draconian measure, I shall

grant the defendants a final act of kindness. I therefore hereby make an unless order in

terms of prayer 2 of the plaintiffs' appeal in RA 37 of 2002 with a variation only in

terms of the time for performance from seven days to 14 days. The costs here and below are

to be taxed if not agreed, and paid by the defendants to the plaintiffs.</font></p>
