<p xmlns="">Facts</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The plaintiff ("Sinojaya") claimed the price of five

  machines sold and delivered to the defendant ("MCE"). MCE alleged that it was

  the agent for an undisclosed principal when it agreed to buy the machines from Sinojaya.

  Subsequently, MCE disclosed to Sinojaya that it was purchasing the machines as agent for

  the third party ("Hoyo"). MCE also alleged that Sinojaya then dealt directly

  with Hoyo, delivered the machines to Hoyo and issued quotations and invoices to Hoyo for

  two of the five machines. Hoyo also arranged to pay Sinojaya for the remaining machines by

  instalments. One instalment was paid but not others.</p>
<p align="justify">On 31 January 2002, Sinojaya commenced this action naming MCE as the

  only defendant. On 22 February 2002, representatives of Sinojaya, MCE and Hoyo met to

  discuss Sinojaya's claim. After the meeting, MCE prepared and forwarded the minutes of the

  meeting to Sinojaya's representative as well as to Hoyo.</p>
<p align="justify">Sinojaya subsequently applied for summary judgment. Sinojaya sought to

  refer to what was said at the meeting and, in particular, the minutes of the meeting in

  its affidavits. MCE took the position that the meeting of 22 February 2002 was on a

  without prejudice basis. Accordingly, MCE applied to strike out certain paragraphs in

  certain affidavits which referred to the meeting and the exhibit of a copy of the minutes.</p>
<p align="justify">At first instance, MCE's application was dismissed on the ground that

  there was a concluded agreement. MCE appealed.</p>
</blockquote>
<b xmlns="">
<p>Held, allowing the appeal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"></p></blockquote></b>(1) The intention of the meeting of 22 February 2002 was genuinely

  to try and reach a settlement not only as between Sinojaya and MCE but involving Hoyo as

  well. MCE would not agree to pay Sinojaya without securing an agreement from Hoyo to pay

  MCE in turn. The absence of any reference to the phrase "without prejudice" was

  therefore not fatal to MCE's position (See [30] – [31]).

  <p align="justify" xmlns="">(2) The fact that some parts of the minutes used the word

  "agrees" was not conclusive on whether there was a concluded agreement. The

  minutes were not drafted by solicitors. The opening words of the minutes stated,

  "This is the discussion ..." and not "agreement". The substance of the

  minutes showed quite clearly that there were two outstanding issues which were vital.

  First, MCE's solicitors were to send a payment schedule by 25 February 2002, and it was

  open to Sinojaya to reject it if it was not to Sinojaya's liking. Second, Hoyo had to

  agree to the terms recorded in the minutes by signing and returning a fresh sales

  agreement between MCE and Hoyo for three of the machines. If, as it turned out, Hoyo did

  not signify its agreement, the whole deal was off. In the circumstances, there was no

  concluded agreement on 22 February 2002 between Sinojaya and MCE (See [32] – [35],

  [37] – [38]).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(3) Sinojaya had not acted on the alleged agreement when their

  solicitors sent a fax dated 25 February 2002 to MCE's solicitors. This fax was to follow

  up on what had been discussed and had sought MCE's payment schedule for Sinojaya to

  consider. The fax also gave MCE the alternative of filing its Defence. MCE responded by

  filing the Defence. As the fax did not assert a concluded agreement, there was nothing for

  MCE to dispute at that time. Thus, although MCE's solicitors first alleged that the

  meeting was on a without prejudice basis only more than a month later by a fax dated 27

  March 2002, there was no waiver by MCE of the without prejudice privilege (See [28], [43]

  – [44]).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(4) The circulation of the minutes to Hoyo did not put the minutes in

  the public domain just because Hoyo was not a party to the proceedings at that time. The

  absence of any specific restriction on the circulation of the minutes did not make it

  inequitable for MCE to argue that the minutes were inadmissible as evidence. Even

  documents which are admittedly subject to the without prejudice qualification may be

  circulated. The prohibition is not against circulation but against admission in a court,

  or tribunal, of law as evidence (See [45]).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(5) It was inequitable for Sinojaya to now try to rely on the minutes

  of the 22 February 2002 meeting to bolster its summary judgment application against MCE

  (See [47]).</p>

<p xmlns=""><font size="3">5.        After the meeting, CKC, the

managing director of MCE, prepared and forwarded the minutes of the meeting to Charles

Wong of Sino International, as well as to Hoyo.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">6.        Sinojaya subsequently

applied for summary judgment. In various affidavits filed on its behalf, it sought to

refer to what was said at the meeting and, in particular, the minutes of the meeting.

Sinojaya asserted that the meeting resulted in a concluded agreement which MCE breached.

The reference to the minutes was not to establish a fresh cause of action based on the

alleged concluded agreement but to use them to assist Sinojaya to obtain summary judgment

under the original cause of action i.e the sale of the machines.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">7.        MCE took the position that

the meeting of 22 February 2002 was on a without prejudice basis and that there was no

concluded agreement. Hence no reference should be made to it or the minutes thereof which

were inadmissible as evidence. Accordingly, it applied to strike out certain paragraphs of

certain deponents’ affidavits which referred to the meeting and the exhibit of a copy

of the minutes.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">8.        MCE’s application was

heard by the Deputy Registrar Mr Foo Chee Hock on 14 May 2002. He decided that there was a

concluded agreement and so it was unnecessary to decide whether the meeting was held on a

without prejudice basis in the first place. Accordingly, Mr Foo dismissed MCE’s

application.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">9.        MCE then appealed to the

judge-in-chambers. The application for summary judgment was adjourned pending the outcome

of the appeal. The appeal was heard by me on 13 June 2002. After hearing arguments, I

concluded that the meeting was on a without prejudice basis and that there was no

concluded agreement. Accordingly, I allowed the appeal. Sinojaya has appealed to the Court

of Appeal.</font></p>

<p xmlns=""><font size="3">10.        The first affidavit of Mr

Wong Ping Leung, also known as Charles Wong, in support of Sinojaya’s contentions,

states inter alia:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">‘6.    This is especially so after

  the Defendants have actually admitted to the liability as recorded in the minutes prepared

  by their own managing director, Mr Chua Kheng Choon ("CKC") in relation to the

  settlement meeting held at Hilton Hotel on 22.02.02 (refer to paragraph 11 of LSM’s

  affidavit).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">7.    I was present at this meeting with

  a colleague, Mr Lim Kwee Beng. The meeting was called by CKC and we were to attend the

  meeting as the representatives of the Plaintiffs. I believe that none of the parties

  informed their lawyers about this meeting even though the Plaintiffs have commenced

  proceedings and the Defendants have entered appearance. CKC had reassured us that

  everyone’s concern is primarily to settle this matter and not to protract it any

  further. In fact CKC personally told me over the phone prior to the meeting that the

  Defendants would pay us our claim while they would look to Hoyo for payment.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">8.    At this meeting which lasted for

  about 2 hours, it was <i>definitely agreed</i> by parties that</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">a.     The Defendants would settle

    the Plaintiffs’ claim herein and in fact will be giving their proposal for full

    payment thereof by 25/2/02.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">b.     The Plaintiffs would not need

    to look to Hoyo Crosstec Sdn Bhd ("Hoyo") for payments and should in fact stop

    looking to them for settlement of this claim.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">c.     That Hoyo and the Defendants

    will deal directly between themselves on how they wish to settle the payment thereof.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">9.    At all times, there was no mention

  that this agreement was subject to any conditions. In fact, I had thought that this was

  not a separate agreement but merely stating the fact of the relationships of the 3

  parties; i.e. that the Defendants were liable to the Plaintiffs as contractual party and

  that the Defendants should be the one looking to Hoyo for their sub-sale of the machines

  to them.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">10.    I am also certain that at no times

  were there any mention that this meeting was to be made "Without Prejudice". No

  lawyers were involved in this meeting precisely because parties were keen and anxious to

  settle this matter once and for all. Neither I nor the Plaintiffs had informed Messr Ong

  Tay &amp; Partners, the solicitors for the Plaintiffs about this meeting until 25/02/02

  when we received the confirmed minutes from the Defendants. Messr Ong Tay &amp; Partners

  then wrote to the Defendants’ solicitors on the same day to record the settlement, a

  copy of this facsimile dated 25/02/02 is now exhibited as "CW-1".</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">11.    The Plaintiffs were therefore

  shocked and baffled when they were informed by their solicitors on 27/2/02 that the

  Defendants had in fact filed their Defence on the same day and were even seeking security

  for costs.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">12.    I then called CKM and asked why

  they had once again reneged on their agreement and was informed that it was because Hoyo

  had not fulfilled their part of the bargain vis a vis the Defendants.’</font></p>

<p xmlns=""><font size="3">16.        However, he submitted

that, ‘A meeting does not have to be expressed as to be on a "without

<p xmlns=""><font size="3">17.        Civil Procedure by Jeffrey

Pinsler, 1994, states at p. 588 to 589:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">‘3.    WITHOUT PREJUDICE

  COMMUNICATIONS</font></p>
<b><p align="justify"><font size="3">The rule, its rationale and scope</font></p>
</b><p align="justify"><font size="3">It is a well-established rule that statements made

  by opposing parties (or their solicitors) to each other, in the course of settlement

  negotiations on the express or implied understanding that they are not to be disclosed

  (that is, on ‘without prejudice’ terms), are privileged and may not be used at

  the trial unless both parties consent. The rationale of this principle is that such

  statements may be regarded as admissions by the party making them and used against him at

  the trial. The privilege, which is rooted in the public policy of keeping litigation to a

  minimum, protects the party against the disclosure of such statements, thereby encouraging

  him to settle the dispute without fear. In <i>Rush &amp; Tompkins Ltd v Greater London

  Council &amp; Anor</i>, Lord Griffiths, in the House of Lords, said:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">The ‘without prejudice’ rule is a rule

    governing the admissibility of evidence and is founded on the public policy of encouraging

    litigants to settle their differences rather than to litigate them to the finish….

    The rule applies to exclude all negotiations genuinely aimed at settlement whether

    oral or in writing from being given in evidence.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">In Singapore, the rule is given expression in the form

  of section 23 of the Evidence Act which provides:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">In civil cases no admission is relevant if it is made

    either upon an express condition that evidence of it is not to be given, or under

    circumstances from which the court can infer that the parties agreed together that

    evidence of it should not be given.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">18.        At p 590 to 591, the text

continues:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">‘The English courts have developed a variety of

  rules which make up the framework of this privilege at common law. For instance, it is

  clear that operation of the privilege is not dependent on the use of the words

  ‘without prejudice’ in correspondence between the parties. The House of Lords in

  <i>Rush &amp; Tompkins Ltd v Greater London Council &amp; Anor</i> disapproved of a

  linguistic approach. Lord Griffiths, who delivered the judgment, expressed the following

  view:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">… the application of the rule is not dependent upon

    the use of the phrase ‘without prejudice’ and if it is clear from the

    surrounding circumstances that the parties were seeking to compromise the action, evidence

    of the content of those negotiations will, as a general rule, not be admissible at the

    trial and cannot be used to establish an admission … I believe that the question has

    to be looked at more broadly and resolved by balancing two different public interests

    namely the public interest in promoting settlements and the public interest in full

    discovery between the parties to the litigation.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">The consequence of this approach is that although the

  terminology ‘without prejudice’ is generally regarded as indicative of the

  intention to settle (and is often used in practice), it is not an absolute

  criterion.’</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">19.        Mr Liow submitted that

para 6 of Wong Ping Leung’s first affidavit (cited above) demonstrated that the

meeting of 22 February 2002 was to settle matters.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">20.        Mr Liow then submitted

that there was no concluded agreement because the agreement was intended to be a

tripartite one. The minutes envisaged that Hoyo would sign a fresh sales agreement with

MCE for three machines failing which MCE would assume that Hoyo disagreed with the

agreement. Hoyo did not sign the fresh sales agreement.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">21.        Mr Liow further submitted

that there was no concluded agreement even as between Sinojaya and Hoyo for another

reason. Aside from the fact that Hoyo did not sign a fresh agreement with MCE, there was

as yet no agreement between Sinojaya and MCE on the payment schedule. Sinojaya was surely

not going to accept whatever MCE cared to propose as a payment schedule.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">Arguments for Sinojaya</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">22.        Mr Ong Ying Ping, Counsel

for Sinojaya, stressed that no one had specifically said that the meeting was on a without

prejudice basis and neither was this qualification stated in the minutes. However, he did

not dispute the legal principle that the privilege from disclosure could apply even if

such words were not used.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">23.        As regards the second main

question i.e whether there was a concluded agreement, he submitted that it did not matter

that Hoyo did not sign a fresh agreement with MCE as the suit was between Sinojaya and

MCE. Hoyo had not formally entered the fray yet.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">24.        He also submitted that the

minutes showed that an agreement had been reached. For example,</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(a)    Paragraph 1 of the minutes states

  that MCE ‘<u>agrees</u> to assume all outstanding payment liability with Sinojaya

  ….’ .</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">(b)    Paragraph 6 states, ‘Sino <u>agrees</u>

  to withdraw court order against MCE …’, meaning actually to withdraw the suit as

  there was no court order.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">        [Emphasis

  added.]</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">25.        There was no restriction

on the use of the minutes and its circulation.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">26.        Mr Ong also relied on the

case of <i>Tan Yeow Khoon v Tan Yeow Tat &amp; Anor (No. 1)</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=59034&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2000] 3 SLR 341</a> for the

proposition that there can be a concluded agreement if all the terms are clear, leaving

only the mechanics to be resolved. Also, the requirement of action by a third party would

not necessarily mean that there was no concluded agreement.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">27.        As regards the absence of

a payment schedule from MCE, Mr Ong suggested that this did not really matter so long as

full payment was received within the six months envisaged under paragraph 1 of the

minutes.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">28.        His third main point was

that Sinojaya had acted on this agreement because his firm had sent the fax dated 25

February 2002, to which no response was received from MCE’s solicitors until much

later. The only response was the fax dated 27 March 2002, more than one month later, which

alleged that the meeting was on a without prejudice basis. He submitted that by then it

was too late for MCE to raise the privilege as MCE had waived the privilege. Also it was

inequitable to allow MCE to raise the privilege after taking into account these factors as

well as the fact that there was no restriction on the use of the minutes and its

circulation. MCE could not pick and choose. By this, he meant that because MCE had allowed

the minutes to be circulated to Hoyo, and as Hoyo was not a party in the proceedings at

that time, the minutes had reached the public domain. MCE had acted thereon and could not

raise the privilege now.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">MCE’s counter-argument</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">29.        Mr Liow countered by

pointing out that although there was no reply fax to Ong Tay &amp; Partners’ fax

dated 25 February 2002, it was not true that there was no response. That fax had sought

MCE’s payment schedule the next day or MCE’s Defence to be filed within the

following 48 hours. MCE’s Defence was in fact filed, within the 48 hour deadline. It

must have been clear then to Sinojaya that the payment schedule was not forthcoming. Also,

MCE had assumed that the meeting was on a without prejudice basis until Sinojaya applied

for summary judgment and the supporting affidavits were filed. Thereafter MCE’s

solicitors wrote, on 27 March 2002, to object to any disclosure of without prejudice

communication.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font size="3">My Decision</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">30.        I was of the view that the

intention of the meeting of 22 February 2002 was genuinely to try and reach a settlement

not only as between Sinojaya and MCE only but involving Hoyo as well. That was why

Hoyo’s representatives also attended that meeting. Furthermore, in the circumstances,

MCE would not agree to pay Sinojaya without knowing what its position vis--vis Hoyo was

and securing an agreement from Hoyo to pay it (MCE) in turn.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">31.        The absence of any

reference to the phrase ‘without prejudice’ was therefore not fatal to

MCE’s position.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">32.        As regards the second

question i.e whether there was a concluded agreement, the fact that some parts of the

minutes use the word ‘agrees’ was not conclusive. The minutes were not drafted

by solicitors. Besides, the opening words of the minutes stated, ‘This is the

discussion …’ and not ‘agreement’.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">33.        More importantly, the

substance of the minutes showed quite clearly that there were two outstanding issues which

were vital.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">34.        First, MCE’s

solicitors were to send a payment schedule by 25 February 2002. I did not accept the

suggestion that this was an inconsequential term. If a payment schedule had been forwarded

and was not to Sinojaya’s liking, I had no doubt in my mind that Sinojaya would have

rejected it.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">35.        I was reinforced in this

view from the fax dated 25 February 2002 from Ong Tay &amp; Partners. Although it said

that the parties had agreed on various terms, this should not be considered in isolation.

What did the parties agree to? One of the terms was that a payment schedule was to be sent

by MCE’s solicitors. Indeed, the fax went on to refer to the payment schedule as

MCE’s ‘proposal’ thus indicating that it was open to Sinojaya to reject it

if it was not to Sinojaya’s liking. Unlike the minutes, the fax was drafted by

solicitors.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">36.        I was of the view that the

fax from Ong Tay &amp; Partners detracted from, rather than supported, the contention that

there was a concluded agreement.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">37.        Secondly, Hoyo had to

agree to the terms recorded in the minutes by signing and returning a fresh sales

agreement between MCE and Hoyo for three of the machines. As I have said, the purpose of

the meeting was to achieve a tripartite agreement and not an agreement between Sinojaya

and MCE only. This was reflected in the minutes. If, as turned out to be the case, Hoyo

did not signify its agreement, the whole deal was off.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">38.        In the circumstances, I

did not agree that there was a concluded agreement on 22 February 2002 between Sinojaya

and MCE.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">39.        The case of <i>Tan Yeow

Khoon</i> relied upon by Mr Ong was on different facts. There, the plaintiffs and

defendants were all siblings. They were shareholders of three family-owned companies. The

parties eventually met on two days to discuss their differences resulting in an agreement

encapsulated in a letter being sent by the first defendant’s solicitors. The letter

was cited, with emphasis added, by Justice M P H Rubin as follows:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">

</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font size="3">The letter was referred to as ‘the letter

agreement’.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">40.        Subsequently, there was a

meeting on 7 December 1995 to work out the mechanism mentioned. A company secretary

recorded the minutes of the meeting which minutes reflected the steps to be taken by

various parties.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">41.        In these circumstances,

Rubin J concluded that the letter agreement contained all the essential terms of a valid

and binding agreement. What remained was the mechanism as to who should be the expert

valuer to determine the adjustments to be made to the audited book value of the companies.

He considered this to be a subsidiary aspect and not a point vital to the agreement.

Apparently, the absence of an agreement on an instalment payment for the excess beyond $2m

was not raised as an argument against the existence of a concluded agreement.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">42.        In the case before me, the

payment schedule was, in my view, a vital part of the intended agreement. Secondly, it was

a vital part of the intended agreement that Hoyo agree to be bound by it and it did not

agree. Hoyo was not just a third party who would assist the parties to implement an

agreement. It was supposed to be a party to the very agreement in dispute.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">43.        As regards the third main

point raised by Mr Ong, I did not agree that Sinojaya had acted on the alleged agreement

when Ong Tay &amp; Partners sent their fax dated 25 February 2002 to Straits Law Practice

LLC. This fax was to follow up on what had been discussed and had sought MCE’s

payment schedule for Sinojaya to consider. Furthermore, the fax gave MCE an alternative in

its ultimatum: to forward the proposed payment schedule or file its Defence. As Mr Liow

had submitted, MCE did respond, although not in the way that Sinojaya would have wanted.

The Defence was filed. I did not see how Mr Wong Ping Leung could genuinely assert (in his

first affidavit) that Sinojaya was shocked and baffled when it was informed that the

Defence had been filed, given that this was an option given to MCE by Ong Tay &amp;

Partners.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">44.        I was also of the view

that the fax of Ong Tay &amp; Partners did not assert that there was a concluded agreement

and it gave the contrary impression. There was nothing for MCE to dispute at that time.

There was no waiver by MCE.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">45.        As for the circulation of

the minutes, they were sent to Sinojaya and to Hoyo. I did not agree that they were in the

public domain just because Hoyo was not a party to the proceedings at that time. In any

event, the absence of any specific restriction on the circulation of the minutes did not

make it inequitable for MCE to argue that the minutes were inadmissible as evidence. Even

documents which are admittedly subject to the without prejudice qualification may be

circulated. The prohibition is not against circulation but against admission in a court,

or tribunal, of law as evidence.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">46.        MCE was not picking and

choosing parts of the minutes it would use and parts which it would not.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font size="3">47.        In the circumstances, I

was of the view that the shoe was on the other foot. It was inequitable for Sinojaya to

now try and rely on the minutes of the 22 February 2002 meeting to bolster its summary

judgment application against MCE.</font></p>
