</div> The Prosecution offered several reasons for why this should be the case. First, the degree of exploitation in every relationship is different and should be measured holistically.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-6f3bab31-5377-4a4e-a8f9-17ccae978b54" data-toggle="modal" type="button">50</button></sup>

</div>
</div> Second, the extent of exploitation would reflect the “intrinsic seriousness of the offending act” which the different bands of the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework were intended to measure (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [39]).

</div>
</div> Third, the Prosecution noted that even where an aspect of offending formed an essential element of the offence, the intensity of that aspect could still be a factor taken into account in sentencing. The Prosecution relied on <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v BDB</span> [2018] 1 SLR 127 (“<span class="font-italic">BDB</span>”), where it was held that in the context of sentencing offences of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, the degree of hurt would be a primary indicator of the seriousness of the offence in determining the appropriate sentence (at [42] of <span class="font-italic">BDB</span>).

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The appropriate sentencing framework</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I first address the question of the appropriate sentencing framework to be applied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The Prosecution has argued that the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework should apply to offences under s 376A(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) punishable under s 376A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code. This framework was affirmed in <span class="font-italic">BPH v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2019] 2 SLR 764 (“<span class="font-italic">BPH</span>”) at [55] to cover all forms of sexual assault by penetration under s 376 of the Penal Code. The framework has two steps.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In the first step, the court should identify which band the offence in question falls under, having regard to offence-specific factors (factors which relate to the manner and mode by which the offence was committed as well as the harm caused to the victim). These offence-specific factors can be transposed from the framework in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>, and include the following (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [44]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) group rape;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) abuse of position and breach of trust;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) premeditation;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) violence;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) rape of a vulnerable victim;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) forcible rape of a victim below 14;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) hate crime;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) severe harm to the victim; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) deliberate infliction of special trauma.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The following sentencing bands should apply (<span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> at [159]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Band 1: seven to ten years’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Band 2: ten to 15 years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Band 3: 15 to 20 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Band 1 comprises cases at the lower end of the spectrum of seriousness, where there are no offence-specific factors or where the factors are only present to a very limited extent. Where only one aggravating factor is identified, the case in question will fall within the middle to the upper range of Band 1 (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [50]). Band 2 comprises cases involving a higher level of seriousness, which would usually feature two or more offence-specific aggravating factors. Offences at the middle and upper reaches of Band 2 are generally those marked by serious violence, those which take place over an extended period of time, and those which leave the victims with serious and long-lasting physical or psychological injuries (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [53]). Band 3 involves cases which are extremely serious by reason of the number and intensity of the aggravating factors, and often feature victims who are particularly vulnerable and/or serious levels of violence attended with perversities. At the apex of Band 3 lie cases which are among the most serious instances of the offence in question, and where the offender manifests “perverted or psychopathic tendencies or gross personality disorder, and where he is likely, if at large, to remain a danger to women for an indefinite time” (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [57], citing <span class="font-italic">Regina v Billam</span> [1986] 1 WLR 349 at [351E]). Further, where the offences disclose the use of actual or threatened violence, or where the offence is committed against a person under 14 years of age, either of these two aggravating factors would place the offence within Band 2 (or even Band 3 if there are additional aggravating factors) (<span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> at [160]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The sentencing band defines the range of sentences which may usually be imposed for a case with those offence-specific features. Once the sentencing band has been identified, the court should determine precisely where within the applicable range the offence at hand falls into, so as to derive an “indicative starting point” which reflects the intrinsic seriousness of the offending act. (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [39(a)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 At the second step, the court should have regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors which are personal to the offender, in order to calibrate the appropriate sentence for that offender. These “offender-specific” factors relate to the offender’s particular personal circumstances and, by definition, cannot be the factors which have already been taken into account in the categorisation of the offence. In exceptional circumstances, the court is entitled to move outside of the prescribed range for that band if, in its view, the case warrants such a departure (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [39(b)]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parties’ positions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The Prosecution cites two reasons why the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>sentencing framework should apply. First, the sentencing ranges for offences under s 376(3) and s 376A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code are identical, and the provisions target similar legal interests with many common considerations in sentencing.

Menon CJ observed the following (<span class="font-italic">ABC</span> at [47]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the sentencing ranges for both provisions were identical; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) there were common considerations to guide the sentencing judge; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) prior to the 2019 amendments and beyond, the consent of a minor under the age of 14 would be a neutral factor, although absence of consent would be an aggravating factor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Following from these observations, Menon CJ noted that it was clear that Parliament equated the position of an adult victim who did not consent with that of a minor under 14 who did consent. The <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span> framework, formulated in the context of a non-consenting adult victim, would thus be applicable to consenting minors under the age of 14, because Parliament equated both offences in terms of gravity and because they had an identical sentencing provision (<span class="font-italic">ABC</span> at [48]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In the present case, I find that similar considerations apply to offences under s 376A(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)–(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) p/u s 376A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code. The sentencing range under s 376A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is identical to that of s 376(3). The sentencing judge will also be guided by common considerations since the offences are similar in nature. This is supported by the legislative history of the provision. The Penal Code Review Committee (“PCRC”) recommended that enhanced punishment provisions for minors between 14 and 16 years of age, where the minors have been exploited by the offender, should be “pegged to those of non-consensual sexual activity with minors” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, offences under s 376(2) punishable under s 376(3) of the Penal Code) (Penal Code Review Committee, <span class="font-italic">Report</span> (August 2018) (“<span class="font-italic">PCRC Report</span>”) at p 114). This rationale was echoed by the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr K Shanmugam, during the Second Reading of the Criminal Law Reform Bill (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debat</span><span class="font-italic">es, Official Report</span> (6 May 2019, vol 94)):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">For sexual exploitation offences by persons in relationships of trust with minors who are below 16 years of age – we will enhance the existing penalties, and we will peg them to those for non-consensual sexual penetration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Given the similarities in the sentencing provisions, and the legislative intention that offences punishable under s 376A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) be sentenced in a similar manner to offences punishable under s 376(3), it will be appropriate to apply the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework to offences under s 376A(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)–(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) punishable under s 376A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I decline to opine on whether the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework should be extended to offences under s 376A(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) punishable under s 376A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, penile-vaginal penetration by an accused’s penis). This is because the <span class="font-italic">actus reus </span>of s 376A(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) does not have any equivalent provision under s 376 of the Penal Code, unlike the acts falling under subsections (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) to (<span class="font-italic">d</span>). To the extent that Parliament may be taken as equating the position of an adult victim who did not consent with that of a minor between 14 and 16 who provided factual consent within an exploitative relationship, there is no analogue offence under s 376 to which offences under s 376A(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) may be equated. It is thus not clear whether the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework, set out in the context of s 376, should apply. In this regard, the Court of Appeal noted in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>at [150]–[151] that (a) there was an intelligible difference between penile and digital penetration of the vagina because penile penetration carries the risk of unwanted pregnancy and of transmitting diseases, and is a more intimate act than digital penetration, and (b) rape has generally been regarded as the gravest of all the sexual offences. These views were re-affirmed in <span class="font-italic">BPH </span>at [62], even as the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework was extended to situations where an accused causes a male victim’s penis to penetrate a third and female person’s vagina (<span class="font-italic">BPH </span>at [57(e)]). The present version of s 376 of the Penal Code, under s 376(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), would also now encompass situations where a female accused causes a male victim’s penis to penetrate the accused’s vagina. It would seem that the psychological and physical consequences of penile-vaginal penetration outlined in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>above should apply equally to male victims who were non-consensually forced to penetrate a female accused person’s vagina, with the only distinguishing factor being the risk of pregnancy incurred by the victim. Indeed, in the context of other penetrative sexual acts, courts have been reluctant to draw bright lines of distinction between cases where the accused is the “giver” of penile penetration and cases where the accuse is the “receiver” (<span class="font-italic">AQW v Public Prosecutor </span>[2015] 4 SLR 150 (“<span class="font-italic">AQW</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [41]).

The criminalisation of such offences rests on the notion that minors below 16 are vulnerable to such a degree that they are taken to be incapable of consenting (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Ong Jack Hong</span> [2016] 5 SLR 166 at [8]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 A more extensive treatment on the harm underlying consensual sexual activity by minors is found in the case of <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v AOM </span>[2011] 2 SLR 1057 (“<span class="font-italic">AOM</span>”). <span class="font-italic">AOM </span>considered, among other issues, the question of whether consent could be regarded as a mitigating factor for statutory rape.

Indeed, as a matter of societal morality and legislative policy, girls below 16 years of age are, due to their inexperience and presumed lack of sexual and emotional maturity, considered to be vulnerable and susceptible to coercion and hence incapable of giving informed consent. This is epitomised by the fact that the offences of statutory rape and sexual penetration of a minor are <span class="font-italic">strict liability</span> offences as far as consent is concerned. This was also alluded to by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">PP v UI</span> ([15] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) where it was commented that (at [60]) the “law <span class="font-italic">imputes an </span><span class="font-italic">inability to consent</span> to the sexual acts committed against [the victim] as she is a minor”.

This would be consonant with the protection of young women under s 140(1)(i) of the Women’s Charter which was enacted on the basis that girls under the age of 16 are deemed to be incapable of giving valid consent to a sexual act. I was of the view that this principle should be extended to s 377 offences, such that in cases where the victim is under the age of 16 years, his or her consent is irrelevant for the purposes of sentencing. The underlying principle in this regard is that <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">young girls under the age of 16 may not have the experience or the maturity to make decisions in their own best interests about their own sexuality and that the law must step in to prevent their exposure to sexual activity regardless of their purported consent</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 <span class="font-italic">AOM</span> continues to be cited as the <span class="font-italic">locus classicus </span>which set out the normative basis for the offences of statutory rape and sexual penetration of a minor under 16. The PCRC Report, for example, quotes <span class="font-italic">AOM </span>as saying that for such offences, as a matter of social morality and legislative policy, girls below 16 years of age are, due to their inexperience and presumed lack of sexual and emotional maturity, considered to be vulnerable and susceptible to coercion and hence incapable of giving informed consent (<span class="font-italic">PCRC Report </span>at pp 97–98). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 To the explanation set out in <span class="font-italic">AOM</span>, it may be added that subsequent revisions to the Penal Code have increasingly recognised that boys and girls alike can be the subject of sexual offences. Vulnerability to sexual exploitation is not the exclusive province of young girls. The PCRC Report, for example, notes that recent legislative reforms to update sexual offences with gender neutral language are to ensure that legislation covers circumstances where offences are committed against males <span class="font-italic">and </span>females, to reflect changing societal norms and views on the roles of men and women (<span class="font-italic">PCRC Report </span>at p 328).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 It is also helpful to understand not just the underlying rationale behind s 376A, but also to articulate the wrongfulness of sexual offences against minors under s 376A. This helps guide our consideration of the sentencing process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 A review of the existing jurisprudence shows that there are four main interests of minors which s 376A of the Penal Code is intended to protect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 First, s 376A is meant to protect the bodily and sexual integrity of minors. Sexual offences, and penetrative sexual offences in particular, represent a grave intrusion into the sexual integrity of minors (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Tan Meng Soon Bernard</span> [2019] 3 SLR 1146 (“<span class="font-italic">Bernard Tan</span>”) at [30]; <span class="font-italic">Wong Tian Jun De Beers v Public Prosecutor</span> [2022] 4 SLR 805 at [39]; <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v ASR</span> [2019] 3 SLR 709 at [106]). The adoption of the language of sexual integrity should be welcomed as it enables a better articulation of the nature of rights and interests violated by sexual offences. Remarking on similar developments in the Canadian context, the Supreme Court of Canada in <span class="font-italic">R v Friesen</span> [2020] 1 SCR 424 (“<span class="font-italic">Friesen</span>”) at [55] noted:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">55 These developments are connected to a larger shift, as society has come to understand that the focus of the sexual offences scheme is not on sexual propriety but rather on wrongful interference with sexual integrity. As Professor Elaine Craig notes, "This shift from focusing on sexual propriety to sexual integrity enables greater emphasis on violations of trust, humiliation, objectification, exploitation, shame, and loss of self-esteem rather than simply, or only, on deprivations of honour, chastity, or bodily integrity (as was more the case when the law's concern had a greater focus on sexual propriety)" (<span class="font-italic">Troubling Sex: Towards a Legal Theory of Sexual Integrity</span> (2012), at p. 68).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Connected with the language of sexual integrity is the identification of sexual autonomy and its violation as a cornerstone of wrongdoing for sexual offences (<span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>at [150(b)]; <span class="font-italic">Bernard Tan </span>at [30]; <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [44(h)]). In my view, notwithstanding minors’ inability to legally consent, the language of autonomy remains relevant in articulating the nature of minors’ interests which need to be protected. However, in the context of minors, personal autonomy should be understood as referring to a minor’s right to grow to adulthood free from sexual interference and exploitation from adults (<span class="font-italic">Friesen</span> at [52]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The second main interest which s 376A of the Penal Code is meant to protect relates to the physical and psychological harm which could be caused to minors as a result of penetrative sexual activity. As our courts have reiterated time and again, the physical, emotional, and psychological scars inflicted on victims of serious sexual offences are irretrievable and severe (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v NF</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 849 (“<span class="font-italic">NF</span>”) at [47]<span class="font-italic">; Chia Kim Heng Frederick v PP</span> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 63 at [9]). Minors are particularly vulnerable to such harms. As noted by Michelle Oberman in “Regulating Consensual Sex with Minors: Defining a Role for Statutory Rape” (2000) 48 Buffalo Law Review 703 (“<span class="font-italic">Regulating Consensual Sex</span>”) at p 710:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As teenagers navigate the transition from childhood to adulthood, they learn by experimentation by mistake, and by observation. Because of their inexperience, they are necessarily prone to misjudgment. Nowhere is this tendency toward misjudgment more pernicious than in the area of sexuality, in which adolescents’ age-appropriate naivete renders them uniquely susceptible to coercion and abuse. The law of statutory rape reflects an attempt to protect teenagers from themselves, as well as from those who would prey upon their vulnerability.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The scars of exploitative sexual interference are even more painful when inflicted on minors, who must bear the burden of these traumatic experiences through crucial stages of identity formation and maturation into adulthood. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The third normative sentencing consideration underlying s 376A of the Penal Code is the recognition of the wrongfulness behind the sexual exploitation of minors, in the narrow sense of treating them as objects for sexual gratification. <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik</span> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 601 cites Kate Warner in “Sentencing in cases of marital rape: towards changing the male imagination” (2000) 20 Legal Studies 59, where she observed (at 601) as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It could be added that the wrong of rape lies in the fact that an act that is valued because it expresses connection and intimacy is abused to express power and domination, to objectify, humiliate and degrade. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In the context of sexual offending against minors, conduct that treats minors as sexual objects to be exploited for an accused’s personal gratification invites considerations of deterrence and retribution in sentencing (<span class="font-italic">AQW</span> at [15]). In <span class="font-italic">GCM v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</span> [2021] 4 SLR 1086, Aedit Abdullah J noted at [58] that seeking to exploit the known vulnerabilities of a young child was an especially reprehensible and calculated manner of behaviour which engaged considerations of deterrence. This consideration is why we speak of “predatory sex” when accused persons choose victims who are younger, less certain of themselves, and less likely to be sexually experienced (<span class="font-italic">Regulating Consensual Sex</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at p 721), because such intentional behaviour generally leads to a stronger inference that young persons are being used as objects to be exploited for the end of an accused’s own gratification.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Fourth, although not applicable <span class="font-italic">per se</span> to s 376A of the Penal Code, it is important to recognise that minors are autonomous and volitional human beings who retain the capacity to exercise their volition, even if they are not quite yet deemed capable of giving legal consent to sexual activity. Where sexual activity is forced on minors despite their lack of consent, this is an act of violence against their autonomous will that constitutes an additional wrong over and above the harm to their sexual integrity. This explains why even though minors cannot legally consent, the lack of factual consent of a minor would constitute an additional aggravating factor in sentencing. As noted by Andrew Ashworth in <span class="font-italic">Principles of Criminal Law</span> (Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed, 1999) at p 349, cited in <span class="font-italic">NF</span> at [46]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[S]exuality has a certain uniqueness which is absent from much property: sexuality is an intrinsic part of one’s personality, it is one mode of expressing that personality in relation to others, and it is therefore fundamental that one should be able to choose whether to express oneself in this way – and, if so, towards and with whom. The essence of such self-expression is that it should be voluntary, both in the giving and in the receiving.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The normative sentencing considerations for the enhanced sentencing range under s 376A(2)(</span>a<span class="font-italic">) of the Penal Code</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 On the face of the wording of s 376A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), it is clear that the enhanced sentencing range in the provision is predicated on the existence of an exploitative relationship.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 However, the plain wording of the terminology of “an exploitative relationship” does not in itself give much information as to why sexual acts with minors between 14 and 16 years old in an exploitative relationship should attract harsher sentences <span class="font-italic">on account of there being such a relationship</span>. The word “exploit” is defined in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (Oxford University Press, 6th Ed 2007) as <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, to “utilize for one’s own ends” or to “take advantage of”. On this expansive definition, one might say that people exploit each other all the time – friendships might be forged for ulterior motives, or workplace relationships taken advantage of for career advancement. To add that an exploitative relationship is one in which one party takes advantage of “some vulnerability of the other party” (John Lawrence Hill, “Exploitation”, (1993-1994) 79 Cornell L. Rev. 631 (“<span class="font-italic">Exploitation</span>”) at p 679) does not appear to bring about better clarity: the terminology remains amorphous. For the purposes of understanding s 376A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), a clearer definition of the term is necessary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In my view a consideration of the legislative intention behind the enhanced sentencing regime under s 376A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) lends some clarity to this issue. As noted by the PCRC, the exploitation of minors occurs even in the context of consensual sexual activity because the quality of the minor’s consent “may well have been compromised due to exploitation or manipulation by the offender” (<span class="font-italic">PCRC Report</span> at p 111). This reasoning was affirmed in Parliament during the Second Reading of the Criminal Law Reform Bill which introduced the provision. It is helpful to set out the relevant remarks here (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (6 May 2019, vol 94) (Mr K Shanmugam, Minister for Home Affairs)):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">So, the new offences, under the rubric of "exploitative sexual activity with minors" will deal with sexual predators who exploit young people.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The age of consent for sexual activity is 16 years old, but there are situations where slightly older minors, those between 16 and 18 years old, may be exploited for sexual gratification by persons who are in relationships of trust with the minor.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In such cases, the young person's consent, and we are talking about 16 to 18 years; that young person's consent, is, in my view, compromised.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">For sexual exploitation offences by persons in relationships of trust with minors who are below 16 years of age – we will enhance the existing penalties, and we will peg them to those for non-consensual sexual penetration.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">First, in considering whether the accused is in a relationship that is exploitative of the victim, the Court will be required to consider the age of the minor – the younger the person (the victim), the more susceptible to influence he or she will be.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Second, the difference in age between the accused and the minor.

If the accused initiates sexual communication or activity, it is likely that the intention of the accused, particularly if it is done very early in the relationship, was to make use of the power imbalance in the relationship to exploit the victim for his sexual gratification.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Fourth, the degree of control or influence exercised by the accused over the minor.

The central theme of these remarks would appear to <span class="font-italic">be </span><span class="font-italic">the effect that exploitation has on the quality of consent given by a minor</span>. The effect on the minor’s consent is the common explanatory denominator behind factors such as the minor’s susceptibility to influence (correlating with age), the degree of influence the accused exercises over a minor, and the presence of a power imbalance between the accused and minor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 That the compromising of the minor’s consent is the central wrong targeted by the enhanced sentence in s 376A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is reinforced by the sentencing range stated in the provision. As noted above at [63], the express reason for stipulating an imprisonment term of up to 20 years was to bring the sentence in s 376A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) in line with the sentence stipulated for non-consensual sexual activity with minors. As the PCRC observed in its Report, because a minor’s consent to sexual activity “may well have been compromised”, the sentence range for offences involving an exploitative relationship ought to be pegged to offences where no consent was in fact given by the minor (<span class="font-italic">PCRC Report</span> at pp 111 and 114).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 To this, I would add that based on the Parliamentary remarks reproduced above, the reason why a minor’s consent is compromised in an exploitative relationship is because there is a power imbalance inherent in such relationships which allows the accused to exert control or influence over the minor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 It is apposite at this juncture to clarify a point of terminology. In the paragraphs which follow, I refer to “exploitation” in the context of exploitative relationships as defined in s 377CA of the Penal Code. Exploitation in this sense relates to the manner in which a minor’s consent to sexual activity within a relationship is compromised, through the control or influence of the accused operating within an asymmetric power dynamic, such that an accused person can use the minor as a means to obtain sexual gratification. This is <span class="font-italic">different</span> from the sense in which the word “exploitation” is used in <span class="font-italic">AQW</span> at [13] and [19]–[21], where Menon CJ used the phrase to refer to the extent to which the accused interferes with and violates the minor’s rights. In the latter instance, the term is used in a more general sense encompassing <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>the degree of invasion of bodily integrity and privacy. In contrast, for the purposes of the present case, it is analytically neater to adopt a narrower view of the term. In the context of sentencing offences punishable under s 376A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), using the more general sense of the word may obfuscate the distinction between offence-specific factors stemming from the exploitative relationship, and other factors such as the harm to the victim’s bodily integrity or the use of violence or threats of violence (<span class="font-italic">contra AQW </span>at [21]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Prosecution’s approach</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 With the above in mind, I now explain why I choose not to adopt the Prosecution’s suggested implementation of the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework outlined at [45]–[48] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 First, in so far as the sentencing range in s 376A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) already treats the compromised consent of the minor as being akin to a situation where no factual consent was given, I am unconvinced of the merits of introducing an additional aggravating factor of the “degree of exploitation” which would introduce a sliding scale of the extent to which a minor’s consent is compromised.

Leaving aside these factors, it is unclear whether the <span class="font-italic">extent</span> of control <span class="font-italic">per </span><span class="font-italic">se</span> should be an independent aggravating factor. Consider the following two scenarios:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Void Deck I</span>: A is 40 years old and loiters around the void deck of A’s block looking for a teenager to befriend. A eventually forms a friendship with B, a 15 year old. A is an interesting and charismatic individual and a smooth talker. B is taken with A’s charisma, views A with a degree of “hero worship” and is flattered by his attention. A and B communicate frequently and enthusiastically over various messaging platforms. Over the next four months, A convinces B to enter a sexual relationship. B readily goes to A’s house every time A asks him to come over for sex.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Void Deck II</span>: A is 40 years old and loiters around the void deck of A’s block looking for a teenager to befriend. A eventually forms a friendship with B, a 15 year old. A is not a particularly interesting individual, and B is not particularly taken with A, but out of boredom and apathy, B responds to A’s text messages – albeit sporadically. Over the next four months, A convinces B to enter a sexual relationship. B agrees chiefly out of boredom and only responds to some of A’s invitations to come over to the latter’s house for sex.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 <span class="font-italic">Ceteris paribus</span>, (<span class="font-italic">i</span><span class="font-italic">.e.</span>, in both cases A sustains a relationship with B for the same length of time, takes identical steps to plan their meetings, does not engage in deception or coercion, initiates sexual activity with identical frequency, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>.), there does not appear to be any good reason why the <span class="font-italic">extent</span> of control exercised by the accused in <span class="font-weight-bold">Void Deck </span><span class="font-weight-bold">I </span>should form the basis for an additional aggravating factor compared to <span class="font-weight-bold">Void Deck </span><span class="font-weight-bold">II</span>. In both cases, there was apparent factual consent procured from the minor. Assuming that both scenarios disclose sufficient evidence of an exploitative relationship for the purposes of s 377CA, and the minor’s consent is deemed compromised, it is unclear why the extent of control exercised by the accused beyond this would <span class="font-italic">in itself</span> be of further relevance. Of course, if the charisma and smooth-talking charm of the accused in <span class="font-weight-bold">Void Deck </span><span class="font-weight-bold">I </span>allowed A to offend with greater frequency or to exploit multiple victims, these consequences might amount to a separate aggravating factor compared to <span class="font-weight-bold">Void Deck </span><span class="font-weight-bold">II</span>. If the accused’s text messages to the minor victim in <span class="font-weight-bold">Void Deck </span><span class="font-weight-bold">I </span>involved initiating conversations of a sexual nature or sending lewd photographs to the minor, such behaviour might also indicate premeditation and persistence and thereby give rise to separate aggravating factors (<span class="font-italic">Yap Lee Kok v Public Prosecutor </span>[2021] SGHC 78 (“<span class="font-italic">Yap Lee Kok</span>”) at [11]–[15]) compared to <span class="font-weight-bold">Void Deck </span><span class="font-weight-bold">II</span>. If A’s control over the minor in <span class="font-weight-bold">Void Deck </span><span class="font-weight-bold">I </span>enabled A to persuade the minor to refrain from reporting their sexual activity to the authorities, that would amount to a deliberate step to conceal offending which would in turn give rise to a separate aggravating factor (<span class="font-italic">Muhammad Alif bin Ab Rahim v Public Prosecutor </span>[2021] SGCA 106 (“<span class="font-italic">Muhammad </span><span class="font-italic">Alif</span>”) at [39]). If A was able to exercise more control over B because B placed trust in A by virtue of A’s office of employment or because A was in a position of responsibility over B, the breach of such trust or the abuse of such position would also constitute a distinct aggravating factor. If the nature of A’s relationship with B in <span class="font-weight-bold">Void Deck </span><span class="font-weight-bold">I </span>led to greater psychological trauma being suffered by B than in <span class="font-weight-bold">Void Deck II</span>, this would be taken into account in sentencing through the separate aggravating factor of serious harm caused to the victim. These situations aside, it is difficult to see how the <span class="font-italic">extent</span> of control exercised by the accused <span class="font-italic">per se </span>should be treated as an independent aggravating factor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Second, it seems anomalous to characterise the “degree of exploitation” as a <span class="font-italic">sui generis </span>aggravating factor which, despite being offence-specific, would <span class="font-italic">not</span> constitute an offence-specific factor for the purpose of determining which sentencing band to apply – while at the same time allowing it to affect where within the sentencing band the offence should fall. No legal precedent was offered for this suggested approach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Third, I was not convinced by the Prosecution’s attempt to equate their approach with the sentencing framework in <span class="font-italic">BDB</span> for offences of voluntarily causing grievous hurt.

</div> The rationale for the approach in <span class="font-italic">BDB </span>is that the extent of the hurt or injury caused is a “primary indicator of the seriousness of the offence [of causing grievous hurt] in determining the appropriate sentence” for such offences (<span class="font-italic">BDB</span> at [42]). Conversely, as the Court of Appeal pointed out in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>, the offence of rape can take place in a wide variety of different circumstances, and it is difficult to identify any set of “principal factual elements” which can affect the seriousness” for offences of rape (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [34]). The same is true for offences under s 376A of the Penal Code. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Fourth, I disagree with the Prosecution’s argument that “abuse of position and breach of trust” should be disregarded as an aggravating factor for offences under s 376A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code, because “<span class="font-italic">every</span> exploitative relationship would, <span class="font-italic">by its nature</span>, involve an abuse of position and breach of trust”.

</div>
</div> The definition of the aggravating factor of abuse of position and/or breach of trust was defined in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [44(b)] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-italic">Abuse of position and breach of trust</span>: This concerns cases where the offender is in a position of responsibility towards the victim (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, parents and their children, medical practitioners and patients, teachers and their pupils), or where the offender is a person in whom the victim has placed her trust by virtue of his office of employment (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, a policeman or social worker). When such an offender commits rape, there is a dual wrong: not only has he committed a serious crime, he has also violated the trust placed in him by society and by the victim.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[italics in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 This definition of abuse of trust was reiterated by the Court of Appeal in its recent decision in <span class="font-italic">Mustapah bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor</span> [2023] SGCA 30 (“<span class="font-italic">Mustapah</span>”). On the facts of <span class="font-italic">Mustapah</span>, the appellant and three victims (aged 16 to 17 years old) resided in the same neighbourhood. The victims were students enrolled in institutes of technical education. The three victims often met at a hut in their neighbourhood together with a fourth 15 year old victim. Around 2017, the fourth victim introduced the appellant to the other victims, and they began to meet the victims in the hut. At these meetings, the appellant would drink beer and smoke cigarettes. Whenever they met up, the appellant was friendly with the victims. He would often tell them about his past experiences and give them his views on various topics. The victims alleged that the appellant also revealed his past as an ex-convict and a gang member as well as his involvement in rioting with a large group of people. The victims viewed the appellant with respect and saw him as a close friend. They even thought of him as a “big brother”. Some of the victims were also members of a gang, and sometime prior to 17 October 2018 they asked the appellant for help when they wanted to leave the gang. The appellant testified that he had helped them leave the gang by negotiating with the headman of the gang. The appellant claimed trial to three charges of sexual assault by oral-penile penetration involving the first three victims under s 376(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code. He was convicted on these charges. On appeal, the appellant’s conviction was upheld. In relation to sentencing, the Court of Appeal held that there was no offence-specific aggravating factor of abuse of trust and authority present on the facts:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">122    Whilst the Victims thought of the appellant as a “big brother” and sought his assistance in order to leave their gang, that did not mean that the appellant was necessarily in a position of responsibility in relation to the Victims. It was clear that the Victims respected the appellant, seeing him as an experienced adult who could help them leave the gang. But the relationship between the appellant and the Victims was different from that found in the familial context where a clear hierarchy exists between family members. Nor can it be said that the appellant was standing in a quasi-parental position to the Victims (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">BPH v PP</span> at [67] at [92]). The Victims and the appellant shared a close friendship prior to the SAP offences but none of them had any responsibility towards the others. Hence, the offence-specific aggravating factor of abuse of trust and authority was not present in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Following from the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng, </span>and in <span class="font-italic">Mustapah</span>, it is clear that there can be a wide range of circumstances in which an exploitative relationship may not involve (a) the accused being in a position of responsibility towards the victim (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, parents and their children, medical practitioners and their patients, teachers and their pupils), or (b) the accused being a person in whom the victim has placed her trust by virtue of his office of employment (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, a policeman or social worker). For example, where a 55-year-old accused person befriends a minor online and engages in online conversation regularly, exchanges nude photographs with the minor, and eventually meets up with the minor to engage in sexual activity (as in <span class="font-italic">Yap Lee Kok</span>), this may possibly amount to an exploitative relationship between the accused and minor, but there would not be any abuse of trust and authority in the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> sense. Even though almost every exploitative relationship would involve the minor placing some degree of trust in the accused, to satisfy the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>definition of abuse of trust, this trust must have been placed <span class="font-italic">by virtue of the accused’s office of employment</span>. For this reason, I would consider the abuse of a position of trust (in the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>sense) to be a separate aggravating factor under the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework, for the purpose of applying the framework to offences under s 376A(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)–(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) punishable under s 376A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 I next outline my approach to the sentencing of offences under s 376A(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)–(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) punishable under s 376A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Adaptation of the Pram Nair framework</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 I am of the view that in applying the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework, two caveats apply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 First, contrary to the Prosecution’s proposed implementation, the degree of exploitation would not constitute an offence-specific aggravating factor for the purposes of sentencing. The same offence-specific aggravating factors recognised in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>, as well as those recognised in subsequent caselaw, would apply where relevant. These include:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Abuse of position and breach of trust (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [44(b)]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Premeditation (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [44(c)]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Violence, actual or threatened (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [44(d)]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Offences being committed against a vulnerable victim (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [44(e)]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Severe harm to the victim (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [44(h)]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Deliberate infliction of special trauma (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [44(i)]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Exhibition of significant opportunism (<span class="font-italic">Muhammad </span><span class="font-italic">Alif </span>at [39])</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) Taking deliberate steps to conceal offending (<span class="font-italic">Muhammad </span><span class="font-italic">Alif </span>at [39]); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Recording sexual acts on a mobile phone (<span class="font-italic">Isham bin Kayubi v Public Prosecutor</span> [2020] SGCA 42 at [21]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 As to the aggravating factor of abuse of position and breach of trust, this should only apply in situations where the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>definition of this aggravating factor (at [44(b)] of <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>) is satisfied (see the remarks at [97]–[98] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Second, I would add to the above list an additional offence-specific factor: the use of coercion or deception to (a) obtain physical access to the minor for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity, or (b) to procure factual consent from the minor to sexual activity. Earlier, at [90], I explained that “exploitation” for the purposes of the present case refers to “the manner in which a minor’s consent to sexual activity within a relationship is compromised, through the control or influence of the accused operating within an asymmetric power dynamic, such that an accused person can use the minor as a means to obtain sexual gratification”. I next explain why exploitation, so defined, is conceptually distinct from the use of coercion or deception, before going on to illustrate how application of this additional offence-specific aggravating factor would work.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 John Lawrence Hill in <span class="font-italic">Exploitation </span>at p 660 outlines the difference between exploitation on one hand, and coercion or duress on the other:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Exploitation is distinguished from coercion or duress in that coercion inevitably occurs in the context of a threat which serves to reduce the number of available options open to the actor. Exploitation, however, characteristically involves a situation in which the actor is presented with an <span class="font-italic">offer</span> that represents an additional alternative to the choices previously available. Exploitation, then, is distinct from the traditional notion of compulsion in two respects. First, the decision to pursue the proffered choice is precisely that - a <span class="font-italic">decision</span> made by the actor. Because it is a decision and not a compelled act, the choice springs from internal motives and is not imposed by forces outside the agent. Second, an offer that creates an additional alternative can never render an action less free or voluntary than the action which would otherwise have been performed. That is, providing an additional choice is <span class="font-italic">per se</span> liberating, not compelling.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[italics in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Joel Feinberg, in <span class="font-italic">Harmless Wrongdoing </span>at pp 177–178, similarly notes that the concepts of exploitation and coercion are “quite distinct in sense” even though they have a large overlap in application. He states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If we define exploitation in terms of A’s profit through his relations to B, then not all exploitation involves coercive mechanisms. In fact there are four possibilities:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1. A’s act can be exploitative and coercive, as when his proposal effectively forces B to act in a way that benefits A.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. A’s act can be exploitative and noncoercive, as when he takes advantage of B’s traits or circumstances to make a profit for himself either with B’s consent or without the mediation of B’s choice at all.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3. (More dubious) A’s act might be nonexploitative but coercive. Perhaps an example would be when A, a policeman, calls out to the murderer in hiding, B, to come out with his hands up or face lethal fire. This is a proper and justified use of coercion, but only minimally exploitative, that is a “taking advantage,” in this case, of B’s vulnerability. It shares in common with all exploitation a kind of opportunism, but it is not an exploitation of a person or in any way blameable.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4. A’s act can be both nonexploitative and noncoercive, as in an ordinary commercial exchange from which both vendor and purchase expect to gain (but not at one another’s expense).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 In the context of offences under s 376A of the Penal Code, even though coercion and deception affect the quality of the minor’s concept, they do so by operating in qualitatively distinct ways from exploitation. I first consider coercion. Where a minor’s decision is motivated by a threat from the accused to withhold something from the minor or to cause an undesirable outcome to the minor, the presence of that threat would constitute an independently objectionable means of vitiating the minor’s consent. Importantly, the wrongfulness of the threat, although functioning within an exploitative power dynamic, is not intrinsic to that dynamic. It involves an additional step by the accused to make a threat to do or omit to do something, in order to coerce the will of the minor. Consider the following situations:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Teacher I</span>: A is a 50 year old religious teacher of B, who is 15 years old. A gives religious guidance to B, who often seeks advice from A on sensitive situations. A asks B to engage in a sexual act together. B agrees.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Teacher II</span>: A is a 50 year old religious teacher of B, who is 15 years old. A gives religious guidance to B, who often seeks advice from A on sensitive situations. A asks B to engage in a sexual act together, saying that if B does not do this, A will not perform a religious ritual which will bring B spiritual blessings. A knows that B greatly desires spiritual blessings and will agree to A’s proposal because of B’s fear of losing these spiritual blessings. B agrees.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 In both <span class="font-weight-bold">Teacher I </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">Teacher II</span>, the consent of B may be compromised by virtue of the exploitative relationship between A and B. However, even though B’s consent may already be vitiated in either scenario, there is an added element of wrongdoing in <span class="font-weight-bold">Teacher II </span>because A engages in the <span class="font-italic">additional </span>act of intentionally threatening to omit to perform the religious ritual, intending to coerce B by this threat. This adds a further dimension through which A treats B as an object to be manipulated – through coercion – in order to achieve A’s ends. Thus understood, the use of coercion involves a separate act of wrongdoing not inherent in an exploitative relationship, and should rightly be considered an independent offence-specific aggravating factor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Coercion may also be engaged in by accused persons outside of positions of responsibility or positions where victims would repose trust in them by virtue of their office of employment. Consider the following scenario:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Void Deck III</span>: A is 40 years old and loiters around the void deck of A’s block looking for a teenager to befriend. A eventually forms a friendship with B, a 15 year old. A is an interesting and charismatic individual and a smooth talker. B is taken with A’s charisma, views A with a degree of “hero worship” and is flattered by A’s attention. A and B communicate frequently and enthusiastically over various messaging platforms. After four months, A invites B to come to A’s house for sex. B accepts the invitation and goes along to A’s house but gets cold feet about engaging in sexual activity. A, knowing B is scared of B’s strict parents, threatens to tell B’s parents that B went to A’s house after accepting an invitation to have sex at A’s house. Frightened, B agrees to have sex with A.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Importantly, the use of coercion by A in <span class="font-weight-bold">Void Deck </span><span class="font-weight-bold">III </span>would <span class="font-italic">not </span>be captured under the aggravating factor of abuse of position of trust in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>. A does not occupy a position of responsibility in relation to B, nor does B place trust in A by virtue of an office of employment. This is quite understandable since coercion, founded on abuse of a position of <span class="font-italic">power</span>, targets a different aspect of wrongdoing compared to abuse of a position of <span class="font-italic">trust</span>. There is thus a need for a separate aggravating factor to take in account situations where coercion is present.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The same analysis applies to deception, which involves the separate wrong of making dishonest representations to the minor. Not every exploitative relationship will necessarily involve deceptions, and so it cannot be said to be an essential element of the aggravated offence. Thus, where the accused lies to the minor in order to gain physical access for sexual activity, or where the accused lies in order to procure the minor’s consent to sexual activity, this should constitute an additional offence-specific aggravating factor. Take for example the following situations, in which <span class="font-weight-bold">Drink </span><span class="font-weight-bold">II </span>involves an additional wrongful element of deception compared to <span class="font-weight-bold">Drink </span><span class="font-weight-bold">I</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Drink I</span>: A is 45 years old and is the teacher of 15 year old B. A invites B to A’s house. A offers an alcoholic drink to B, knowing that B admires A and will accept the offer. B accepts the drink. A later engages in sexual activity with a tipsy B.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Drink II</span>: A is 45 years old and is the teacher of 15 year old B. A invites B to A’s house. A offers an alcoholic drink to B, knowing that B admires A and will accept the offer. To eliminate any reservations on that B’s part, A also lies to B by telling B that the drink does not contain any alcohol. B accepts the drink. A later engages in sexual activity with a tipsy B.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 The use of coercion or deception may also constitute an aggravating factor where it is perpetrated against third parties, if this was for the purpose of obtaining physical access to the minor or for the purpose of procuring the minor’s factual consent to sexual activity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 I add that the use of coercion or deception is conceptually distinct from, and is not intrinsic to, abuse of position and breach of trust in the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>sense. Not every accused in a position of responsibility or trust breaches that responsibility or trust through coercion or deception. In both <span class="font-weight-bold">Teacher I</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">Teacher II</span>, for example, the religious teacher might be said to abuse a position of responsibility over the minor – but <span class="font-weight-bold">Teacher II </span>may nevertheless be said to be a more serious case than <span class="font-weight-bold">Teacher I </span>by reason of the presence of coercion of the minor. That being said, in explaining the factors which determine the degree<span class="font-italic"> </span>of abuse of trust in a particular case, we may find that these overlap with the factor of coercion or deception: for example, the religious teacher in <span class="font-weight-bold">Teacher II </span>may be<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>said to have<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>committed a particularly egregious abuse of trust <span class="font-italic">because </span>of the coercive threat made in the capacity of a religious teacher.

</div>
</div> I disagree with this position. In my view, having regard to the harm suffered directly by the victim, the harm to the victim’s relationship with her family and community, and the harm suffered by the victim’s family, the level of harm does in fact rise to the level of severe harm. I elaborate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Foremost in the consideration of the harm suffered by the victim is her undisputed account of her experience, as set out in the Victim Impact Statement. It is worth reproducing this account in full:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">When the RC people came to my house to talk to me and asked me what [the accused] did to me, I told them the truth, but I was very scared, and I cried. I cried because I thought that my grandaunt will get angry with me. She scolded me for not telling her what [the accused] did to me. She said she was very disappointment with me, she said it was all her fault and she cried. I saw grandaunt cry and I also cry because I was very scared. I blamed myself for everything.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">After police talked to me about what [the accused] did to me, grandaunt told me that we will never ever go to the RC anymore. Grandaunt would ask me to stay at home with her and I could only go out with her. Every time I see the RC people at my neighbourhood, I just quickly hide and walk away. I just don’t feel like seeing the RC people. Grandaunt told me not to open the door for the RC people, we will never ever take anything from them or talk to them. Throughout Police investigations, I had to see a doctor at KK hospital, and I also see the doctor for the IQ test. When the doctor asked me about what [the accused] did to me, I felt very stress because I did not want to remember what happened and I got cry because it was very hard for me.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Many times, at night, I would be scared. I cannot sleep. I kept thinking of jumping down and I did not know why I want to kill myself. I cannot sleep, I cried softly on my bed until I fall asleep. I did not want grandaunt to know that I am not sleeping because I did not want her to ask me why I cannot sleep because I did not want her to worry. Since the police case, I would be afraid to share bad things with my Grandaunt. I did not want her to get worried and angry about me. I did not want to disappoint her again like how I disappointed her for not telling her what [the accused] did to me. I did not want to see her cry again because of me.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In school, I got punched the wall using my hands. I do not know why I punched the wall. The teacher asked me why I did that, I just cry, I did not know how to tell my teacher. I could only cry and cry. I never tell anyone about my feelings because I felt embarrassed to talk about it. I dared not tell them what [the accused] did to me. I only talk to girls in school, I dared not talk to the boys because I do not trust boys, I am scared of boys and I don’t know why. I can only make friends with girls and not boys. Few weeks ago, I really cannot take it. I cried in school and told my teacher that I want jump down and kill myself. I cannot take it because I suddenly think of what [the accused] did to me, I got very scared and stressed and I don’t know how. I don’t know how to stop all these things from coming to my head. The school counsellor sent me to KK hospital to the doctor. I told the doctor that I feel very scared and afraid. I told the doctor that I scratched my hands until it bled because I suddenly think of what [the accused] did to me. Then my head would suddenly very pain when I think of what [the accused] did to me. I also scared of going to grandaunt’s bedroom because I would think of how she was crying and scolding me when she found out what happened to me. She cried and cried and kept blaming herself and me about what happened. Sometimes, I don’t dare to go home because I scared of grandaunt, and I don’t know why. I would always cry and cry, I cannot feel ok anymore and I want to jump down. I hope I can become ok like last time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 In <span class="font-italic">CJH</span>, the Court of Appeal noted at [16] that severe harm for the purposes of the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>and <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>frameworks would not be limited to specific categories such as pregnancy or a specific psychiatric illness that is a consequence of the offence. While a court may not take into account facts that are part and parcel of the offence itself, there is no reason to exclude the type of harm and suffering that may be experienced by a victim just because many victims in a similar situation would also experience such harm. On the facts of <span class="font-italic">CJH</span>, the High Court had noted that the victim, who had not even started menstruating, would have experienced considerable pain and horror upon realising that the accused’s actions in sexually assaulting her had left her bleeding from the vagina. Her trauma and abject helplessness were such that over the course of the accused’s offending she had come to believe that it was “pointless” to resist the accused. This would have constituted severe harm to the victim. The Court of Appeal agreed with these observations and affirmed that it would be “difficult to suggest that there was no severe harm” to the victim (at [16]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The harm to the victim in the present case is considerable. Notwithstanding the lack of a diagnosed psychiatric illness, it is evident that the victim has experienced inability to sleep, continuous bouts of crying, and suicidal ideation; she has also engaged in self-harm and other forms of self-destructive behaviour. Beyond the psychological and physical toll on the victim, she continues to suffer from emotional dysregulation and an inability to “feel ok”. She blames herself for what has happened. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 I would also add that, although not perhaps rising to the level of an offence-specific factor (sufficient weight having been accorded through the presence of relevant TIC charges), the accused’s conduct in taking photographs of the victim’s naked body

</div> would have further exacerbated the level of degradation experienced by the victim as a result of the sexual assaults. The accused’s conduct of photographing the process of his sexual abuse – which included his arranging the victim in different poses and even manipulating her body (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>spreading her labial folds apart with his fingers) – speaks to a deliberate deconstruction of the victim’s dignity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 In accounting for the harm to the victim, it is also important to consider the harm which has been caused to the victim’s relationship with her family and community by the accused’s offending. As noted in <span class="font-italic">Friesen</span> at [60]–[61]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">60 Sexual violence causes additional harm to children by damaging their relationships with their families and caregivers. Because much sexual violence against children is committed by a family member, the violence is often accompanied by breach of a trust relationship (<span class="font-italic">R. v. D.R.W</span>., 2012 BCCA 454, 330 B.C.A.C. 18, at para. 41). If a parent or family member is the perpetrator of the sexual violence, the other parent or family members may cause further trauma by taking the side of the perpetrator and disbelieving the victim (see "<span class="font-italic">The 'Statutory Rape' Myth</span>", at p. 292). Children who are or have been in foster care may be particularly vulnerable since making an allegation can result in the end of a placement or a return to foster care (see <span class="font-italic">R. v. L.M</span>., 2019 ONCA 945, 59 C.R. (7th) 410). Even when a parent or caregiver is not the perpetrator, the sexual violence can still tear apart families or render them dysfunctional (<span class="font-italic">R. v. D.</span> (D.) (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 788 (C.A.), at para. 45). For instance, siblings and parents can reject victims of sexual violence because they blame them for their own victimization (see <span class="font-italic">Rafiq</span>, at para. 38). Victims may also lose trust in the ability of family members to protect them and may withdraw from their family as a result (<span class="font-italic">Rafiq</span>, at paras. 39-41). </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">61 The ripple effects can cause children to experience damage to their other social relationships. Children may lose trust in the communities and people they know. They may be reluctant to join new communities, meet new people, make friends in school, or participate in school activities (C.-A. Bauman, "<span class="font-italic">The Sentencing of Sexual Offences against Children</span>" (1998), 17 C.R. (5th) 352, at p. 355). This loss of trust is compounded when members of the community take the side of the offender or humiliate and ostracize the child (<span class="font-italic">R. v. Rayo</span>, 2018 QCCA 824, at para. 87 (CanLII); <span class="font-italic">R. v. T</span>. (K.), 2008 ONCA 91, 89 O.R. (3d) 99, at paras. 12 and 42). Technology and social media can also compound these problems by spreading images and details of the sexual violence throughout a community (see <span class="font-italic">R. v. N.G</span>., 2015 MBCA 81, 323 Man.R. (2d) 73).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The victim has lost an existing community – <span class="font-italic">i.e. </span>the people she used to spend time with at the RN. She does not dare to return to the RN for fear of reviving her trauma. She has found it difficult to make friends with boys. Worst of all, her relationship with her Grandaunt has deteriorated. The Grandaunt’s initial reaction in blaming the victim for her own victimisation (<span class="font-italic">Friesen </span>at [60]) cannot be undone. As a result, the victim cannot trust the only adult on whom she is dependent. She does not dare to go into the Grandaunt’s room. She can no longer share freely with the Grandaunt about her life. Sometimes, she is scared of her Grandaunt and scared of going home.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In this connection, I should clarify that no judgment or blame should be cast on the Grandaunt for how she may have reacted to the disclosure of the accused’s sexual offences. No-one can be expected to react perfectly to life’s most emotionally turbulent exigencies. Indeed, the Grandaunt herself has suffered harm as a result of the accused’s offences. The harm caused to her is relevant in assessing the harm caused as a result of the accused’s offending (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Lee Ah Choy</span> [2016] 4 SLR 1300 at [54]). The Grandaunt has suffered emotionally, not only on account for what has happened, but also because of how her relationship with the victim has been affected. Further, the Grandaunt’s involvement with the RN has had to cease on account of the trauma caused to the victim and the apparent distrust now felt by the Grandaunt towards the RN. The victim and the Grandaunt are now cut off from the very community that could have provided an important source of support. One can only hope that the estrangement and the isolation will not be permanent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Considering the harm suffered by the victim, the effect on her relationship with her family and community, and the harm caused to the victim’s family, I would view the harm caused by the accused as being severe harm sufficient to constitute an offence-specific aggravating factor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 For completeness, I would add that there is no abuse of position of trust on the facts of this case. The accused cannot be said to have been in a position of responsibility over the victim by virtue of his involvement in the RN, nor is there evidence that the victim placed trust in the accused <span class="font-italic">by virtue of his position </span>in the RN.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Having regard to the number of offence-specific aggravating factors, I find that this would bring the present case within the mid to high range of Band 2 of the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>sentencing framework, such that the indicative starting sentence should be 13 to 14 years’ imprisonment per charge.

If so, then an additional term of imprisonment in lieu of caning may be more readily seen as necessary or appropriate in order to compensate for the general deterrent effect lost because the offender knows he or she will be exempted from caning. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">67     In general, an offender who was exempted from caning due to gender or age is likely to have known from the outset that he or she would not be caned. Therefore, for this class of exempted offenders, an additional term of imprisonment will be more readily seen to be called for, in order to compensate for the lost deterrent effect of caning. Conversely, an offender who was exempted from caning on medical grounds is less likely to have known that he would not be caned. … Of course, these are mere guidelines, and each case must be decided on its own facts.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">68     Second, the court should consider whether an additional term of imprisonment would be <span class="font-italic">effective</span> in replacing the deterrent effect of caning. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Chua Hock Leong</span> [2018] SGCA 32 (“<span class="font-italic">Chua Hock Leong</span>”), the 63-year-old male accused was convicted on a charge under s 376(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) punishable under s 376(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Penal Code for performing fellatio on a young boy who was 12 years of age. The Court of Appeal reversed the trial judge’s decision not to impose additional imprisonment in lieu of the mandatory 12 strokes of the cane and imposed an additional imprisonment term of six months. It noted (at [12]), that considerations of general deterrence applied to adults over the age of 50 who might otherwise commit such sexual offences against minors. The court further stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14     In this case, the Respondent committed the offence when he was 61 years old – most offenders of a similar age would know that they cannot be caned on account of their age (see also <span class="font-italic">Amin</span> at [67]). Further, we are of the view that an additional imprisonment term is necessary here to underscore the principle of general deterrence. The Respondent, who was at least five times older than the Victim in age and whom the Victim had addressed as “Uncle”, was in a prime position to advise the Victim not to play truant from school. Instead of doing that, he had exploited the unsuspecting minor by befriending him in a public place and then forcing himself upon the Victim to satisfy his own depraved sexual desires. The offence committed by the Respondent offends “the sensibilities of the general public” and a “deterrent sentence is therefore necessary and appropriate to quell public disquiet and the unease engendered by such crimes” (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 814 at [25(c)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 I agree with the Prosecution that considerations of deterrence would be at the forefront of the sentencing calculus in this case. The accused very likely knew from the outset that he would not be caned by reason of his age. The nature of his offences is similar in character (and in fact even more invasive) than the offences in <span class="font-italic">Chua Hock Leon</span><span class="font-italic">g</span>: these are offences which would offend the sensibilities of the general public.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 On the second factor, retribution is likely to be the principal sentencing consideration where there is a specific victim, especially where violence has been visited upon that victim (<span class="font-italic">Amin </span>at [63], citing Kow Keng Siong, <span class="font-italic">Sentencing Principles in Singapore</span> (Academy Publishing, 2009) at paras 06.021 and 30.023). In the present case, where the accused specifically targeted and exploited a vulnerable victim, retribution would also form a dominant sentencing objective behind the imposition of caning. This therefore also points to the imposition of an additional term of imprisonment in lieu of caning.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Conversely, I do not find that the accused’s age militates against the imposition of an additional term of imprisonment. There are also no medical or compassionate grounds to this effect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 As to the duration of the additional imprisonment, Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">Amin </span>at [90] indicated that if more than 19 strokes of the cane were avoided, this would point to an additional imprisonment period of nine to 12 months. In this case, had the accused been eligible for caning, the starting point under Band 2 of the <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair </span>framework would have been eight strokes of the cane for each of the three proceeded charges under s 376A(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) punishable under s 376A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code – <span class="font-italic">i.e. </span>24 strokes in total.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Having regard to the above factors, I find it appropriate to impose the maximum term of 12 months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The global sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Having determined the appropriate sentence for each of the three charges, I next consider the global sentence which should be imposed in respect of all three charges. Two of the three sentences must be ordered to run consecutively by virtue of s 307(1) of the CPC. I agree with the Prosecution that the sentences for the First Charge and the Third Charge should run consecutively.

</div> This results in a global sentence of 24 years’ imprisonment, with an additional 12 months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 I next consider the application of the totality principle, as outlined in <span class="font-italic">Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor</span> [2014] 2 SLR 998 (“<span class="font-italic">Shouffee</span>”). The totality principle in <span class="font-italic">Shou</span><span class="font-italic">ffee</span> has two limbs. The first requires that the global sentence not be substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed. The second calls for consideration of whether the effect of the sentence on the accused is crushing and not in keeping with his past record and future prospects. While I do not think a global sentence of 25 years’ imprisonment would be “substantially” above the normal level of sentences meted out for such an offence under s 376A(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) p/u s 376A(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), I do find that such a global sentence would be crushing on the accused in this case. Accordingly, I further calibrate the individual sentences for each of the three charges downwards, from 12 years to eight years and six months per charge. The sentences in respect of the First Charge and the Third Charge will run consecutively, with the sentence in respect of the Second Charge being concurrent. This leads to a revised global sentence of 17 years’ imprisonment, with an additional 12 months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 In summary, the accused is sentenced to a total of 17 years’ imprisonment, with an additional 12 months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning. The imprisonment term is backdated to the accused’s date of arrest on 22 December 2021.
