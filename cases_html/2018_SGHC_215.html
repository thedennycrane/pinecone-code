Tolling is essentially the processing of raw materials for a fee. Thus under the Tolling Agreement, the Defendants continued to supply feedstock to JAC for processing into aromatics and petroleum products and would thereafter receive and sell the products. In exchange, JAC received a tolling fee. Funds were injected by the Senior Lenders.

Such clauses may entitle the Defendants (the debtors) to refuse to deal with the Senior Lenders (the assignees) and continue to make payment to JAC (the assignor), but they cannot affect the assignment or security arrangement between JAC and the Senior Lenders, in particular the proprietary effects of such assignment. The prohibition against assignment clauses also only apply to prohibit JAC from entering into assignments going forward, as from the dates of the Tolling Agreement and Transitional Agreement respectively. They have no effect on the tolling fee debt and final payment amount debt given that these receivables were subject to the security interest of the Senior Lenders by virtue of a floating charge which was entered into and which crystallised before the Tolling Agreement and Transitional Agreement were entered into. Moreover, on a proper interpretation of the prohibition against assignment clauses, the clauses cannot exclude the Senior Lenders’ beneficial interests.

In addition, the Assignment did not apply to the Set-Off Agreement debt as it was the Glencore–JAC Feedstock Supply Agreement and Glencore–JAC Product Offtake Agreement which were assigned to the Senior Lenders, rather than the Set-Off Agreement. In addition, any assignment of the Glencore–JAC Feedstock Supply Agreement and Glencore–JAC Product Offtake Agreement to the Senior Lenders under the Assignment was not complete since the security constituted by the Assignment had not become enforceable. Beneficial interest therefore had not passed. In addition, notices of reassignment had been sent by the Agent to Glencore which suggested that the Senior Lenders had reassigned their interests in the Glencore–JAC Feedstock Supply Agreement and Glencore–JAC Product Offtake Agreement back to JAC. While the Plaintiffs claim that the notices were sent in error, they have not discharged their burden of proof to show that there was no actual release of security by the Senior Lenders.

Therefore, any attempt to assign the benefits of the agreements in the face of such prohibition was rendered ineffective in the sense that it did not give the assignee (here, the Senior Lenders) any rights against the debtors (here, the Defendants). The fact that the Senior Lenders had a pre-existing security did not prevent the prohibition against assignment from being effective.

Whether a charge is fixed or floating does not depend on how it is termed in the agreement but on the actual nature of the security. The critical feature which distinguishes a floating charge from a fixed charge is the chargor’s ability, under a floating charge, to control and manage the charged assets freely and without the chargee’s consent. In this case, there was no fixed charge as JAC had an ability to freely control the charged assets. For the same reasons, even if the floating charge had crystallised at some point, it had subsequently decrystallised due to the ceding of control over the charged assets by the Senior Lenders.

As soon as they arose, the receivables were subject to the fixed charge or crystallised floating charge and hence to the equitable interest of the debenture holders. The requirement of mutuality for insolvency set-off to operate is thus not met. There has also been no ceding of control by the Senior Lenders releasing their security in the charges, nor any estoppel, waiver or decrystallisation. Further, the prohibition against assignment clauses in the relevant agreements cannot prevent the equitable interest in the receivables from being vested in the debenture holders.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The focus of the parties’ arguments centres around the effect of the clauses prohibiting assignment in the agreements. The clauses in question are cl 28.1 of the Tolling Agreement, cl 10 of the Transitional Agreement and cl 2(a) of the Set-Off Agreement. The immediate question is whether these clauses capture the charges operating in favour of the Senior Lenders. In other words, whether the clauses precluded the charging of the receivables in favour of the Senior Lenders pursuant to the fixed charge and floating charge (which has since crystallised) under the Debenture. Answering the question requires a consideration of the nature of a charge, and then an interpretation of the clauses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 If the charges are not captured by the clauses prohibiting assignment such that they are effective and in operation, the next question is whether notwithstanding the charges, there was any waiver by the Senior Lenders, decrystallisation of the charges, or other release, such that the receivables are free of the encumbrances in favour of the Senior Lenders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 If the receivables are encumbered by the charges in favour of the Senior Lenders, the effect of such an encumbrance on the possibility of set-off is to be considered. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39  The analysis thus proceeds in the following order:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the nature of a charge and the scope of the charges in question;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether the prohibition against assignment clauses prohibited charging of the receivables; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether there was any estoppel, waiver or decrystallisation which released the Senior Lenders’ interest in the receivables; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) whether there was any reassignment of the receivables by the Senior Lenders back to JAC in relation to the Set-Off Agreement debt; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) whether insolvency set-off or equitable set-off is applicable. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The charges</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The nature of a charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The parties seem to have accepted that a charge could be described as a species of assignment; in other words, a charge operates as an assignment of the property to which it relates. I do not think this is accurate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 A charge has been described as follows (see <span class="font-italic">Goode on Legal Problems of Credit and Security</span> (Professor Louise Gullifer gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5th Ed, 2013) (“<span class="font-italic">Goode on Legal Problems of Credit and Security</span>”) at para 1-55):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[A] charge … does not depend on either the delivery of possession or the transfer of ownership, but represents an agreement between creditor and debtor by which a particular asset or class of assets is appropriated to the satisfaction of a debt, so that the creditor is entitled to look to the asset and its proceeds to discharge the indebtedness, in priority to the claims of unsecured creditors and junior incumbrancers. The charge does not transfer ownership to the creditor; it is merely an incumbrance, a weight hanging on the asset which travels with it into the hands of third parties other than a bona fide purchaser of the legal title for value and without notice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 A charge is thus an equitable encumbrance upon a particular property. The basis for Professor Gullifer’s description of a charge is the judgment of Atkin LJ in <span class="font-italic">National </span><span class="font-italic">Provincial and Union Bank of England v Charnley </span>[1924] 1 KB 431 at 449:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is not necessary to give a formal definition of a charge, but I think there can be no doubt that where in a transaction for value both parties evince an intention that property, existing or future, shall be made available as security for the payment of a debt, and that the creditor shall have a present right to have it made available, there is a charge, even though the present legal right which is contemplated can only be enforced at some future date, and though the creditor gets no legal right of property, either absolute or special, or any legal right to possession, but only gets a right to have the security made available by an order of the Court. If those conditions exist I think there is a charge. If, on the other hand, the parties do not intend that there should be a present right to have the security made available, but only that there should be a right in the future by agreement, such as a licence, to seize the goods, there will be no charge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 What is clear is that a charge does not require the transfer of any ownership or possession – it is a creation of equity, appropriating the subject matter to an equitable interest that binds the world other than a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchaser of the legal title for value without notice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Commentaries cited by the Defendants are also to the same effect. Professor W J Gough states in W J Gough, <span class="font-italic">Company </span><span class="font-italic">Charges</span> (Butterworths, 2nd Ed, 1996) (“<span class="font-italic">Company Charges</span>”) at p 19:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The technical difference between a mortgage and a charge is that a mortgage involves a conveyance of property subject to a right of redemption, whereas a charge conveys nothing and merely gives the chargee certain rights over the property as security for a loan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I do note that Professor W J Gough goes on to say:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The creditor under a charge acquires as assignee a proprietary interest by assignment from the debtor as assignor, since there is vested in him under the charge a right of non-possessory control extending to the right of the debtor of free alienation of the property charged, which is enforceable immediately even in advance of default.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I am doubtful, with respect, that there is any assignment involved in the creation of a charge. This view has also been expressed by Professor Bridge in M G Bridge, <span class="font-italic">Personal</span><span class="font-italic"> Property Law</span> (Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed<span class="font-italic">, </span>2002) at p 181:

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">... a charge involves no conveyance or assignment of an interest in the property to the grantee. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 As a charge is an encumbrance on the full equitable ownership which exists to benefit the chargee, it differs from an assignment, as currently understood, which is a transfer of ownership of some portion of interest in the property. This is reflected in the definition of a charge as a non-possessory security whereby the charged property is appropriated to the discharge of an obligation without any transfer of ownership (see para 6.17 of <span class="font-italic">The Law of Security and Title-Based Financing</span> by Hugh Beale, Michael Bridge, Louise Gullifer &amp; Eva Lomnicka (Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2012)). The important aspect is the appropriation of the property for a specific purpose,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the discharge of a primary obligation, by way of the security interest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 While an appropriation of an asset through a charge may appear to be similar to a transfer, the significant difference is that under a charge, the whole asset remains with the chargor, subject to the chargee looking to it to satisfy what is owed to him. The chargee does not get an ownership right that allows for the disposal of the asset itself. What resides in the charge is only a limited right. In comparison, an assignment is a transfer of an interest or a part of it: it results in some part being taken away from the scope of ownership of the assignor and given to the assignee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 A charged interest can possibly be assigned by the chargee to another. But a charge in itself is not an assignment. Neither is an assignment necessary to create a charge. There is no transfer of ownership of an existing interest or part of an interest in the creation of a charge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The Plaintiffs have, like the Defendants, referred to an “assignment by way of a charge” in their arguments, but this does not affect the proper characterisation of a charge. While s 136(1) of the Law of Property Act 1925 (c 20) (UK) and s 4(8) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) suggest the possibility of an assignment of an interest by way of a charge, I do not consider that the use of the term “assignment” in the provisions compels the conclusion that a charge is a form of assignment. Its use in the two provisions does not mean that a charge is to be equated with an assignment for all purposes, in particular in terms of legal nature and effect. Certainly s 4(8) of the Civil Law Act would not be applicable here. The subsection reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Assignment of debts and choses in action effectual to pass right and remedy</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(8) Any absolute assignment by writing under the hand of the assignor, not purporting to be by way of charge only, of any debt or other legal chose in action of which express notice in writing has been given to the debtor, trustee or other person from whom the assignor would have been entitled to receive or claim such debt or chose in action, shall be and be deemed to have been effectual in law, subject to all equities which would have been entitled to priority over the right of the assignee under the law as it existed before 23rd July 1909, to pass and transfer the legal right to such debt or chose in action, from the date of such notice, and all legal and other remedies for the same, and the power to give a good discharge for the same, without the concurrence of the assignor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The subsection is only concerned with the effect at law of an assignment in writing (not purporting to be by way of charge only) of which express notice has been given to the debtor, which is that such an assignment takes effect without the agreement of the assignor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 On the nature of a charge, Glencore takes the position that a charge does not involve a transfer of any ownership interest (including beneficial ownership) from the chargor to the chargee. A charge creates a beneficial interest in, or an equitable assignment of, only the proceeds of the realisation of an asset. Glencore argues that the courts have on occasion failed to distinguish between the asset itself and the proceeds of the realisation of the asset.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I would agree with the first part of Glencore’s statement of what a charge is, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that there is an equitable interest created. However, I do not agree that a charge is an equitable <span class="font-italic">assignment</span>, in that there is a purported transfer of the proceeds of the realisation of an asset upon inception. What is created through a charge is an encumbrance or appropriation of an interest in the asset to the satisfaction of whatever obligation is owed by the chargor to the chargee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 BP argues that it is a principle of law that a charge operates as an equitable assignment, citing a number of cases. In <span class="font-italic">Duncan, Cameron Lindsay and another v Diablo Fortune </span><span class="font-italic">Inc and another matter</span> [2018] 4 SLR 240, the High Court stated at [35] that English authorities have held that a contractual lien gives rise to an equitable assignment by way of a charge, which is registrable under the UK Companies Act. I do not read this as laying down the position that a charge and an assignment are the same. The High Court agreed with the English authorities that a contractual lien over sub-freights should be construed as an equitable assignment (at [50]), without going into the issue of whether a charge is of the same nature and effect as an assignment, as this was not required in the circumstances of that case. I do not see anything in the Court of Appeal’s decision of the case (see <span class="font-italic">Diablo Fortune </span><span class="font-italic">Inc v Duncan, Cameron Lindsay and another</span> [2018] 2 SLR 129) that would lead to a different conclusion either. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">National Mutual Life Nominees Ltd and others v National Capital Development Commission and others </span>(1975)<span class="font-italic"> </span>6 ACTR 1, at 3, Blackburn J stated that a charge, once crystallised, operates as an equitable assignment of the property to which it relates. Similarly, in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">In</span> <span class="font-italic">r</span><span class="font-italic">e ELS LTD. </span>[1995] Ch 11, at 25,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Ferris J treated the crystallisation of the floating charge in question as completion of the assignment of goods effected by the floating charge contained in the debenture. In addition, Professor W J Gough, in <span class="font-italic">Company Charges</span> at p 100, states that there is a present but incomplete equitable assignment under a floating charge before crystallisation, referring to <span class="font-italic">Biggerstaff</span><span class="font-italic"> v Rowatt’s Wharf Ltd </span>[1896] 2 Ch 93 at 106. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52  With respect, I am doubtful that the characterisations in these cases and commentary fully describe the nature of a charge. As noted above, a charge is not a transfer of an interest in the way an assignment is. When an asset is charged, the beneficial ownership and legal ownership remain where they were before<span class="font-italic"> </span>the act of charging. The equitable interest represented by a charge is not the sort of interest that would normally be alienable or transferable from one person to another in the ordinary course of events. A charge is not a mortgage. The primary purpose of the charge is to give security, without any transfer of ownership rights; it does this by appropriating such value or beneficial interest of the asset in question to the satisfaction of the debt. In any event, it does not follow that each asset has to be separately assigned for it to fall under the charge – that is not how fixed or floating charges work. Once a charge is in effect, regardless of the precise mechanism, any asset that comes into the hands of the chargor is appropriated to the chargee without anything more. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I do not read any of the Singapore cases as prescribing the nature of a charge as an assignment rather than an encumbrance – the issue of whether a charge is an assignment did not arise in those cases. What was set out was, at most, a strand of common law jurisprudence that were considered in the determination of the legal issues that were at hand in those cases, which did not include the question of whether a charge is an assignment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The consequence of a charge being an encumbrance is that if notice is had of an existing charge, a person dealing with the chargor who attempts to protect assets such as receivables from coming under the charge cannot, to my mind, simply invoke a contractual clause to prohibit the existing charge from applying. Whatever may be the position between that person and the chargor, if the asset in question falls under the scope of the charge, it is encumbered by the charge on inception. Only if the chargee waives the rights under the charge can such an asset remain free. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In the present case, the receivables which arose out of the Tolling Agreement, Transitional Supplemental Agreement and Set-Off Agreement which were concluded subsequent to the Debenture, are caught by and subject to the fixed charge and the floating charge under the Debenture which were expressed to include future assets of JAC. By the time the prohibition against assignment clauses in the agreements came into being, the charges were already operational.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The floating charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 A floating charge does not fix on specific assets until crystallisation occurs. Before that point, the assets subject to a floating charge remain free to be dealt with and may be disposed of by the chargor, without more. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Under cl 4.1 of the Debenture, the Senior Lenders were given a first floating charge over JAC’s “undertaking and all its assets, both present and future”, including the assets that are already subject to the fixed charge under cl 3.1 of the Debenture.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The floating charge here was crystallised by the appointment of the receivers and managers: <span class="font-italic">Haw Par Brothers International Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">v Overseas Textiles Co Ltd</span> [1977-1978] SLR(R) 352 at [16].

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 BP on the other hand argues that the debts owed by BP to JAC are not subject to any fixed charge. Whether a charge is fixed or floating does not depend on how it is termed in the security instrument but on the actual nature of the security. In this case, the charge is not fixed because the requirement of exercise of control by the chargee (in this case, the Senior Lenders) for a fixed charge as established in <span class="font-italic">S</span><span class="font-italic">pectrum Plus</span> is not met. BP contends that the Plaintiffs have not shown that the chargor (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, JAC) had complied with the obligations and restrictions in the Debenture and a common terms agreement concluded between JAC and the Senior Lenders dated 13 April 2011 (“Common Terms Agreement”) such that the chargee (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Senior Lenders) exercised control. This is since, contrary to the requirements in the agreements, JAC failed to give the Agent various documents including a draft operating budget setting out the budgeted operating costs and other revenue and expenditure items. In addition, according to BP, there is a lack of control exercised by the Senior Lenders as JAC has been dealing and continues to deal with the sums due to it under the agreements as moneys that it beneficially owns, to cover its operational costs. Thus according to BP, the chargor here had the ability to freely and without the chargee’s consent, control and manage the charged assets, and hence the charge is not fixed.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [U]sually, unless there is clear evidence to the contrary, where the clause expressly extends to prohibiting ‘assignments’, ‘encumbrances’ or ‘any dealings’ it will, as a matter of construction, also capture a charge and a declaration of trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78  This position may be true of a clause that expressly refers to encumbrances or uses similar language. It may even extend to one that refers to dealings. But the clauses here, whether cl 28.1 of the Tolling Agreement, cl 10 of the Transitional Agreement or cl 2(a) of the Set-Off Agreement, do not refer to encumbrances and dealings. The prohibition under cl 28.1 covers only novations, assignments, licences, sub-licences and transfers. Clause 10 of the Transitional Agreement and cl 2(a) of the Set-Off Agreement refer to assignments only. None of the terms used in either cl 28.1, cl 10 or cl 2(a) would be sufficient to capture a charge. With respect, while an encumbrance or dealing may capture a charge or trust, I cannot see that the term ‘assignment’ is itself of such a wide effect, unless there is something in the context that requires such a conclusion to be reached. A charge does not involve either an assignment or a transfer at all (see above at [40]–[54]). I do note that the Plaintiffs themselves use language in their submissions which indicates that they view the charge as a form of assignment in equity. The Plaintiffs’ characterisation is however immaterial; they maintain that the prohibition against assignment clauses are not applicable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In any event, Professor Tolhurst is careful to indicate that the position at [77] above is only the usual position. He recognises the doctrinal distinction between a charge and an assignment and is of the view that whether a charge is included in a prohibition against assignment clause would depend on the construction of the relevant clause in question (see <span class="font-italic">The Assignment of Contractual Rights</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at p 291): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A charge is doctrinally distinct from an assignment and therefore arguably a simple prohibition on assignment should not prevent a party charging its interests under a contract. However, ‘assignment’ is a word of wide import and a judge may on the facts of a particular case either construe it to include a charge or construe it to be restricted to its technical meaning.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In a similar vein, Professor Roy Goode has opined that a mere prohibition against assignment would not extend to a charge. After explaining that whether or not a prohibition against assignment clause would extend to equitable charges would depend on the construction of the contract, he opines (see “Contractual Prohibitions Against Assignment” (2009) LMCLQ 300): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Prima facie a clause precluding assignment covers equitable as well as statutory assignments, and includes mortgages as well as sales and gifts, but does not extend to declarations of trust or equitable charges, neither of which constitute a transfer of rights … a “mere” charge (that is, a charge which does not incorporate an agreement for a mortgage) is simply an encumbrance, a <span class="font-italic">ius</span><span class="font-italic"> in re aliena</span>, and does not operate as a transfer of rights. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Therefore, applying the principles of contractual interpretation articulated in various cases, including <span class="font-italic">Y.E.S.

The text of the clauses would not on its own prevent the allocation or appropriation of the equitable interest in an asset to the satisfaction of a debt; that is, the plain meaning of the clauses does not preclude a charge. The conclusion considering the plain words used, which is the starting point in contractual interpretation, is that the clauses in question do not cover charges and thus do not prohibit the charging of the receivables pursuant to cl 3.1 (fixed charge) and cl 4.1 (crystallised floating charge) of the Debenture.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The context</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 There is also nothing in the context, as adduced, which discloses objective evidence showing that an intention existed between the parties for the words used in the prohibition against assignment clauses to prohibit charging of the assets under the agreements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The Defendants point to the fact that the Tolling Arrangement was put in place to increase the value of the Plant and allow the Plant to be sold.

Here, the very fact that the Tolling Agreement and Transitional Agreement were concluded after the fixed charge had been created and the floating charge had crystallised means that the parties were fully aware that the encumbrance or appropriation was already in operation. There is also nothing in the context surrounding the conclusion of the Set-Off Agreement between Glencore and JAC which shows that the parties had intended the prohibition against assignment clause in the Set-Off Agreement to preclude the operation of the pre-existing fixed charge over the Set-Off Agreement debt, or prevent the future crystallisation of the floating charge under the Debenture. Against that background and the underlying factual matrix, it cannot be said that the clauses cover charges.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In relation to the extrinsic evidence in the form of the parties’ prior negotiations of the contracts, the Defendants argue that the negotiating history shows that the parties’ intention or agreement was for the prohibition against assignment clauses to prevent the assets from being part of the security of the Senior Lenders. In particular, the Defendants highlight that in relation to the Tolling Agreement, a sub-clause, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, cl 28.2, was originally considered but subsequently rejected in the course of negotiations as it was not accepted by the Defendants. According to the Defendants, cl 28.2, if included, would have carved out an exception to the prohibition against assignment in cl 28.1 to allow assignments by way of security. The Defendants argue that this shows that the agreement of the parties was for cl 28.1 to prohibit charging of the debts owed by the Defendants to JAC.

The exclusion of this clause could on the one hand be an indication that JAC and its receivers accepted that there could not be any charging of the assets pursuant to cl 28.1; on the other hand, it could indicate that JAC and its receivers chose to rely on their position at general law and took the interpretation that cl 28.1 did not preclude the operation of the pre-existing charges, making a further cl 28.2 unnecessary and superfluous.

There is sufficient ambiguity in the circumstances surrounding the Acknowledgment that, even on a balance of probabilities standard, precludes such an inference from being made. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Effect of prohibition against assignment </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The Plaintiffs rely on <span class="font-italic">Foamcrete</span> for the position that the beneficial interest in the debts which the Senior Lenders acquired once the floating charge crystallised remains unaffected by prohibitions against assignment contained in agreements which post-date the floating charge.

It was not derived from any assignment in breach of the prohibition against assignment clauses, and therefore cannot be affected by these clauses.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The Defendants argue that the prohibition against assignment clauses prevented the crystallised floating charge and the fixed charge in the Debenture from operating over/affixing onto the receivables. As I have found in the previous section, the prohibition against assignment clauses in this case do not prohibit charging of the assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 But even assuming that the prohibition against assignment clauses can be read to cover charges or have expressly included charges, the authorities relied upon by the Defendants do not examine the issue in the specific context of a prior fixed charge or prior floating charge which crystallised before the contractual prohibition against assignment came into effect. The Defendants argue that <span class="font-italic">Foamcrete</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>can be distinguished, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, as the case was concerned with the effect of a prohibition against assignment clause subsequently entered into by the chargor without the knowledge or consent of the chargee.

</div>
</div> However, as I have found earlier, there is no evidence showing that an intention existed between the parties, or that there was consent from the Senior Lenders, for the prohibition against assignment clauses to preclude the operation of the pre-existing fixed charge and crystallised floating charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In addition, under the fixed charge and crystallised floating charge which cover future receivables, once the receivables arose, they were subject to the interest of the debenture holders. The receivables could not be an asset of JAC without ever being free from the interest of the debenture holders. That is the effect of the crystallisation of the floating charge and the operation of the fixed charge. If the equitable interest in the receivables arose in favour of the chargee as soon as the receivables were due to JAC, then there was never any point at which the prohibition against assignment clauses could operate: there was no scintilla of time for the receivables to operate free of the chargee’s interest and for any other interest short of that of a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> purchaser for value without notice to latch on in priority. Therefore, even if the clauses prohibited charges in addition to assignments, the clauses would at most prevent the creation of new encumbrances, and not affect the ones already operating against the assets. The Defendants did not show that the clauses operated to release the pre-existing charges. The plain words of the clauses do not support such construction. Indeed, very clear exclusionary words would be needed before a prohibition against assignment clause could operate to prevent a pre-existing crystallised floating charge or pre-existing fixed charge from affixing onto the receivables.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In summary, I find that based on a construction of the prohibition against assignment clauses, the clauses do not prohibit charging of the receivables that arise under the agreements. In addition, I also find that in any event, the receivables were charged from the moment they arose and that there was no opportunity for any contractual prohibition against charging, even if it existed in the agreements, to take effect.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Estoppel / waiver / decrystallisation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 For the reasons outlined at [91] above, a prohibition against assignment/charging contractual clause cannot apply to an asset that is already subject to a pre-existing crystallised floating charge/ fixed charge prior to the contractual clause coming into effect. In other words, such a contractual clause cannot in these circumstances unwind the charging of the asset. A charged asset will only escape the charge if for some reason the charge is to cease to operate, or to have its effect suspended, through some form of waiver, estoppel or decrystallisation. It is possible for a debenture holder to agree not to assert equitable interest in the charged assets or part thereof. The debenture holder can also release the charged assets, or decide not to have future assets subjected to the charge. In such circumstances, the doctrines of estoppel, waiver or decrystallisation may apply to prevent the operation of the charge. Based on the facts of this case, I do not find that there was an estoppel, waiver or decrystallisation applicable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The Defendants argue that the floating charge, even if crystallised at some point, has since decrystallised. Decrystallisation is a concept developed in <span class="font-italic">Goode on Legal Problems of Credit and Security</span> (see paras 4–62 to 4–64). It involves a charge ceasing to operate, either because of the restoration of the chargor’s management powers over the assets in question which reverts the charge to one that is floating, or the inaction of the debenture holder which allows the chargor to continue to deal with the charged assets in the ordinary course of business. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Though I accept that decrystallisation is possible in principle, there needs to be clear evidence before the court can conclude that there has been any decrystallisation. As decrystallisation is a form of release, it is possible for the chargee to agree to it. Indeed, as noted in <span class="font-italic">Goode on Legal Problems of Credit and Security</span> at para 4–62, decrystallisation is sometimes necessary to deal with unexpected situations such as unintended triggering of crystallisation. An express agreement between the parties on decrystallisation would put the possibility of decrystallisation beyond doubt, but a decrystallisation clause agreed to between the parties is likely to only cover situations of unintended crystallisation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Decrystallisation has been equated with the lack of control by the debenture holder over the charged assets. Loss of control by the debenture holder has been posited as a possible indication of decrystallisation. The court would not generally find such loss of control except where it is very clear. Furthermore, as argued by the Plaintiffs and which I have accepted (see above at [66]–[70]), the very appointment of receivers and managers is a clear indication that there has been no ceding of control. Therefore, on the facts, I find that there has been no decrystallisation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The Plaintiffs argue that uncertainty and grave repercussions would follow if the concept of decrystallisation were to be recognised.

</div> I do not think that that would be so, provided decrystallisation does not occur too readily. It is a useful concept which recognises the autonomy of the parties. There is also nothing against it as a matter of principle – what the parties have created, the parties can destroy, or at least, suspend.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Similarly, any estoppel or waiver is only to be found on the basis of a clear and unequivocal representation. The line between decrystallisation on the one hand and estoppel or waiver on the other may be very fine. In my view, it is not clear at this juncture whether any difference really exists between the concepts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 As earlier mentioned, the Defendants argue that the Senior Lenders, in agreeing to omit the originally contemplated cl 28.2 from the Tolling Agreement, had agreed to the exclusion of the tolling fee debt from their security package. According to the Defendants, the Senior Lenders had agreed to this as they were incentivised by the potential increase in value of the Plant arising from the tolling arrangements pending its sale. Hence, the Senior Lenders are estopped now from asserting any security over the tolling fee debt.

The omission is ambiguous since it could have been the result of a determination by JAC and its receivers that they did not need such a clause in the circumstances, and that they could rely on their position at general law (see above at [86]). There was no express statement showing that they agreed to exclude the tolling fee debt from the Senior Lenders’ security package by omitting cl 28.2. It is not necessary for the receivers and managers to testify to that effect – the onus lies on the Defendants to show that there was any such representation.

This is because the Set-Off Agreement debt stems from receivables under the Glencore–JAC Feedstock Supply Agreement and the Glencore–JAC Product Offtake Agreement, both of which were expressly assigned to the Senior Lenders under the Assignment.

In particular, Glencore contends that there was a reassignment to JAC and release of security arising from two notices of reassignment dated 28 August 2017 (the “Notices of Reassignment”). In the Notices of Reassignment, the Agent informed Glencore that the Glencore-–JAC Feedstock Supply Agreement and the Glencore–JAC Product Offtake Agreement had been “released and discharged from the security created or expressed to be created under the Assignment and [had] been reassigned to the Assignor [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, JAC] and the instructions and directions set out in the Notice of Assignment and Acknowledgement [were] hereby revoked with immediate effect”.

</div> There is nothing in law or in the circumstances that would prevent the Senior Lenders from reasserting their security, provided that the security itself remains valid. As I have found that the security was not released pursuant to the Deed of Reassignment, the Senior Lenders were not precluded from reasserting their security and retracting the Notices of Reassignment. Given that the Notices of Reassignment have been retracted, there has been no waiver of the Senior Lenders’ security interest in the Set-Off Agreement debt. In addition, waiver has not been proved because it was not shown that the party waiving its rights (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Senior Lenders) were necessarily aware of the facts that gave rise to the rights which were being foregone (see <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction Pte Ltd v Kian </span><span class="font-italic">Hiap Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2018] 1 SLR 317 at [54]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 I find that no estoppel arose either as there was no detrimental reliance by Glencore on the Notices of Reassignment between the date of issue on 28 August 2017 and date of retraction on 4 October 2017.

There was in any event no loss or other detriment suffered from the assertion of such a right.

This arises by way of s 88(1) of the Bankruptcy Act, read with s 327(2) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Companies Act”).

To satisfy mutuality, there must be identity between the holder of the beneficial interest in the claim and the person against whom the cross-claim is asserted (<span class="font-italic">N W Robbie</span> at 1339). In other words, the debts must be due between the same parties, in the same right (<span class="font-italic">Derham</span><span class="font-italic"> on the Law of Set-Off</span> at para 11.01). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 I am satisfied that here there is no mutuality.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 I do not accept BP’s arguments in this respect. In relation to the observations in <span class="font-italic">West Street Properties</span>, the view of Jeffery J appeared to be tentative and it would seem that the learned judge was cautious, presumably because of the possible impact the position may have on chargees’ equitable interests. While it may be that the debenture holder should be taken to be prepared to accept the normal incidents of trading as was said in <span class="font-italic">West Street Properties</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>on the other side of the coin, a trader who knows that a charge exists in relation to receivables must also be taken to have run the risk that no set-off will be applicable and guard himself accordingly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 As for the commentary in <span class="font-italic">Kerr &amp; Hunter</span>, I do not think it can be taken that far. The commentary was premised on at least an intimate connection between the contracts that gave rise to debts sought to be set-off; I do not think the intimate connection exists here. What would perhaps qualify as such a connection is where the two contracts are really part and parcel of the same transaction. That cannot be said for the charged debts here and the feedstock debt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 In the present case the charges were already in operation at the time the tolling fee debt, the final payment amount debt and the Set-Off Agreement debt arose, and there was no agreement that the charges would not operate in respect of the debts. Therefore, I believe that the court should be slow to allow set-off to arise in the manner contemplated in the <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> of <span class="font-italic">Rendell</span> and <span class="font-italic">Leichhardt</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>cited by BP, which suggest that an exception may apply and set-off may not necessarily be precluded where the company’s debt is incurred by or at the behest of a receiver carrying on the business of the company (see <span class="font-italic">Rendell</span> at 202 and <span class="font-italic">Leichhardt</span> at 707). I am of the view that the preferable position on this is that set out in <span class="font-italic">N W Robbie</span>. In any event, both <span class="font-italic">Rendell</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Leichhardt</span>, applying <span class="font-italic">N W Robbie</span>, held that there was no mutuality on the facts because the crystallisation of the floating charge upon the commencement of receivership resulted in the debts due to the company belonging in equity to the debenture holder.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 In <span class="font-italic">N</span><span class="font-italic"> W Robbie</span>, Sellers LJ, after expressing some sympathy for the position that where a receiver carries on the company’s business in the name of the company, those with whom he deals should not be lightly deprived of the rights of set-off, nevertheless stated at 1330–1331:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… I have been driven to the conclusion that so to do would not give full effect to the crystallisation of the floating charge … I think that it must be held that the debenture had the effect of making each debt as it arose after the appointment of a receiver a chose in action of the company subject to an equitable charge in favour of the bank as debenture-holders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Russell LJ had even less sympathy for that position. His Lordship, at 1338, rejected a quote from the 13th edition of <span class="font-italic">Kerr &amp; Hunter</span> to the effect that a charge would not attach to assets of the company acquired subsequent to the date of crystallisation. The authority cited in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Kerr &amp; Hunter </span>for that position was the case of <span class="font-italic">In</span><span class="font-italic"> re Yagerphone Ltd </span>[1935] Ch 392 (“<span class="font-italic">Yagerphone</span><span class="font-italic">”</span>).

Russell LJ then dealt with the argument that any charge that did arise on future assets was only a floating charge and found that such an approach did not give effect to crystallisation. That led Russell LJ to the conclusion, at 1338 and 1339, that, </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">by force of the debenture charge an equitable charge attached in favour of the denture-holders not only on the ... debt existing at the date of the appointment of the receiver and manager, but also upon the other debts … as they came into existence on delivery of goods to the defendants after such appointment. These choses in action belonging to the company became thus assigned in equity to the debenture-holders, at times when the defendants had no cross-claim of any kind against the company and consequently no right of set-off.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I conclude, therefore, that there is in this particular case no right of set-off because there is no “mutuality” in beneficial interest. The claimants are primarily the debenture-holders: the cross-claim is against the company alone, and is indeed one which in its origin could not be met and was not entitled to be met until the debenture-holders had been paid off in full. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">Russell LJ used the language of assignment, which is not an accurate description of a charge as I have noted above, but this does not affect the rest of the reasoning. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Donovan LJ, dissenting from the majority in <span class="font-italic">N W Robbie</span>, having interpreted the relevant provisions of the charge document in that case, came to the conclusion that no charge on the debts owing to the company arising after the appointment of the receiver was necessary, where the receiver was carrying on the business of the company (see <span class="font-italic">N W Robbie</span> at 1334–1335). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 The majority’s approach in <span class="font-italic">N W Robbie</span> does give full weight to the effect of a charge, and for that reason, should be preferred to the dissenting opinion of Donovan LJ.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 The Defendants have referred to a number of decisions which they say cast doubt on the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">N W</span> <span class="font-italic">Robbie.</span> The Defendants argue, citing various commentaries, that there is no transfer of beneficial ownership in a charge, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the chargor is not deprived of beneficial ownership in the charged asset.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 However, even though beneficial ownership may remain with the chargor, the fact that the property is appropriated to the charge means that the property must be available for the satisfaction of the chargee’s security; the only thing that can prevent such satisfaction is the disposal of the property to a purchaser for value without notice. If it were otherwise, the security interest would have no meaning. With that encumbrance or appropriation, mutuality is indeed destroyed. The following passage from <span class="font-italic">Derham</span><span class="font-italic"> on the Law of Set-Off </span>(at para 11.46) on the effect of a fixed equitable charge (which includes a crystallised floating charge) on mutuality is to my mind instructive: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[W]hile the charge also confers a form of proprietary interest in the debt the subject of the charge, in the sense that the chargor no longer has an unfettered title to deal with it, … it does not purport to transfer the beneficial ownership title in the debt to the chargee. Nevertheless, for the purpose of set-off a fixed equitable charge has the same effect upon mutuality as a mortgage. The important point is that the charge, while it does not involve a full transfer of the beneficial ownership, nevertheless confers an immediate proprietary interest in the debt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 Therefore, as the receivables, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the tolling fee debt, the final payment amount debt and the Set-Off Agreement debt are charged to the Senior Lenders, mutuality between each of these receivables and the feedstock debt is destroyed and insolvency set-off is inapplicable. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Equitable set-off </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 The Defendants also invoke equitable set-off, which applies where there is a close relationship or connection between the dealings and the transactions which give rise to the respective claims, such that it would offend one’s sense of fairness or justice to allow one claim to be enforced without regard to the other (<span class="font-italic">Abdul Salam </span><span class="font-italic">Asanaru Pillai (trading as South Kerala Cashew Exporters) v Nomanbhoy &amp; Sons Pte Ltd </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 856 (“<span class="font-italic">Abdul Salam</span>”) at [26]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 BP argues that equitable set-off is not displaced by insolvency set-off. Responding to the submissions of the Plaintiffs, BP argues that the Australian decision in <span class="font-italic">Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">v Forge Group Power Pty Ltd (in liquidation) (Receivers and Managers Appointed) </span>[2017] WASC 152, cited by the Plaintiffs, should not be followed as it concerned the position in a statute not binding in Singapore, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Australian Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 I accept that equitable set-off is not excluded by the statutory provisions on insolvency set-off. There is nothing in the Singapore statutes that expressly precludes the operation of equitable set-off, and I do not see anything in the actual operation of either form of set-off that would render one incompatible with the other as a matter of principle. The possible effect of equitable set-off on third parties, including other creditors of a bankrupt individual or insolvent company, may be a reason for the court not to effect equitable set-off. However, that is a matter of considering the specific circumstances which is the type of question that courts are constantly faced with in cases dealing with equitable remedies. I agree with the commentary in <span class="font-italic">Derham</span><span class="font-italic"> on the Law of Set-Off</span> at paras 6.25–6.32 that insolvency set-off should not bar equitable set-off as a matter of principle. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 That said, on the facts, equitable set-off is not established because the cross-claims (the feedstock debt on the one hand, and the tolling fee debt, the final payment amount debt and the Set-Off Agreement debt respectively on the other) do not bear a close connection. The respective debts arose out of separate arrangements and transactions which cannot be said to be so closely connected that it would be unjust not to allow the set-off. It is insufficient in this regard that the parties have dealt with each other along a single continuous business relationship, as submitted by Glencore.

</div> I did not consider that the factual disputes were so involved that a trial was to be preferred.
