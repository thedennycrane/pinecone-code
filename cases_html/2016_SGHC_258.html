One of those arguments, for example, is that Jaguar took steps to hinder its preparation for the arbitration by engaging in “guerrilla tactics”, and that the tribunal issued unfair procedural orders and interventions in the course of the arbitration, as a result of which it was unable to present its case. This, CMNC argues, constituted a breach of its right to be heard under s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA or Article 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Model Law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 In my recent decision in <span class="font-italic">Re Wordsworth</span><span class="font-italic">, Samuel Sherratt QC</span> [2016] 5 SLR 179 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Wordsworth</span>”), I admitted Mr Wordsworth QC to argue an application to set aside an investor-state arbitration award where the issues were observed (at [3]) to be “predominantly governed by principles of public international law”. I added at [22] that if the only issue in that application involved a “fairly straightforward” due process challenge, “Mr Wordsworth’s application would not pass muster”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The principal ground relied on by CMNC in OS 185 is that a breach of the rules of natural justice occurred. Would such a due process challenge “pass muster”? Inquiring whether the rules have been breached is necessarily a fact-sensitive exercise. The facts giving rise to such challenges may be fairly straightforward in some cases and more complex in others. But however complex the facts may be, the principles for setting aside an award for breach of natural justice are reasonably well-settled. Further, the inquiry will ultimately be based on the events as they have unfolded in the arbitration. That is largely, if not entirely, assisted by reviewing the record of the arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In addition to the due process challenge, CMNC has also raised what in its views are novel arguments, including the issue of whether there is a duty implied in the arbitration agreement to arbitrate in good faith. CMNC asserts that such a duty should be implied, a breach of which would justify setting aside the Award on the ground that the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 It is not uncommon to raise novel legal arguments in the course of court proceedings. But novelty <span class="font-italic">per se </span>should not be confused with complexity. Usually, there must be a factual substratum to support any argument, however novel or complex it may be. In view of the fact that this is an admission application and not the underlying application in OS 185, this judgment will examine the appropriate level of scrutiny that a court should undertake of the “novel” issues in deciding whether it is reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances, to admit an applicant under s 15 of the LPA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The underlying dispute concerned a Lump-Sum, Turnkey Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Contract (“EPC Contract”), dated 29 March 2008. Under the EPC Contract, CMNC was to construct a power generation plant in Guatemala for Jaguar for the approximate sum of US$450m. The sum was to be paid progressively to CMNC by way of milestone payments.

CMNC’s primary complaint is over the tribunal’s use of an Attorney’s Eyes Only (“AEO”) order, a procedural order for safeguarding confidential information.

</div> CMNC also alleges that the Award was contrary to public policy because of corruption. Jaguar originally had a claim for “post-termination public relations costs” amounting to US$2,526,071 but withdrew the claim after it emerged during the main evidential hearing that a representative of Jaguar, one Ernesto Cordova, had bribed high-ranking officials in Guatemala to obtain assistance in relation to Jaguar’s dispute with CMNC and the completion of the project.

</div> The allegations against Cordova affected Jaguar’s claims because it appeared that Jaguar had paid those bribes to Guatemalan officials through a woman called Karen Cancinos, who had allegedly a fictitious public relations consultancy contract with Jaguar, and whose fees were part of the “public relations costs” claim which Jaguar withdrew.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Law Society’s Submissions at para 42</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I am not persuaded by these submissions. The Law Society’s first argument seems to imply that local counsel would be no less well-placed to argue OS 185. That is a point which goes to the second and third Notification matters (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the necessity of foreign counsel and the availability of local counsel) which I will separately examine below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Its second argument is hardly an objection. It appears to be an implicit admission that the Applicant does have special expertise, since it shows that the Applicant has in practice confronted the issue of the duty of good faith before albeit in a different capacity and under a different arbitration regime. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Its third argument is not persuasive either. The concept of “public policy” under the IAA does not refer to the political stance that Singapore takes against corruption. As the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">PT </span><span class="font-italic">Asuransi Jasa Indonesia (Persero) v Dexia Bank SA </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 597 at [59], “public policy” for the purpose of setting aside an award refers to fundamental principles of law and justice. Corruption, bribery, or fraud would offend such fundamental principles, which would be common to most jurisdictions adopting the Model Law. Therefore, the court hearing OS 185 is not strictly concerned with local legislation “that has no analogue elsewhere” such that it would be ordinarily difficult to show that foreign counsel has special qualifications or experience for the purpose of the case (see <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Beloff </span>at [56]). It follows that the challenge to an arbitral award based on public policy is not, as the Law Society appears to suggest, a local-centric one. Granted, the concept of “public policy” under the IAA cannot be interpreted without reference to local jurisprudence on this point. But the Law Society’s submission that the Applicant “cannot reasonably be argued to possess the relevant qualifications and experience” simply because local jurisprudence is involved would imply that no foreign counsel could ever have such qualifications or experience so long as local jurisprudence is involved. That would be to take an unduly restrictive approach to the admissions regime. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Apart from that, there is consensus that the Applicant possesses wide-ranging experience in arbitration and certainly has the requisite expertise to address the four issues identified by Mr Tan. I have no doubt that, for the purpose of s 15(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), the Applicant does possess special qualifications and experience that will allow him “to expertly discharge [his] duties to the client and to the court ‘for the purpose’ of the case for which <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> admission is sought” (see <span class="font-italic">Re Andrews Geraldine Mary QC </span>[2013] 1 SLR 872 (“<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Andrews</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [39]). I turn to consider, with reference to the Notification matters, whether I should exercise my discretion to admit him to represent CMNC in OS 185. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Notification Matters</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Nature of factual and legal issues in this case </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The first Notification Matter is “directed at a qualitative evaluation of the character of the issues in the case”, which would call for an assessment of “whether the issues are complex or difficult, or novel, or of significant precedential value” (see <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Beloff</span> at [61]). Based on the previous cases on admission applications, it seems to me that there are a number of general principles which can guide this qualitative evaluation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 It is useful to ask how likely it is that the stated issues will actually arise for determination. Allegedly novel or complex points of law may not need to be dealt with if, for example, the other party does not intend to pursue them (see <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Caplan Jonathan Michael QC </span>[2013] 3 SLR 66 (“<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Caplan</span>”) at [63]–[64]), or if the court can say with the benefit of clear legal authority that they will not arise on the facts of the case (see <span class="font-italic">Re Rogers</span><span class="font-italic">, Heather QC</span> [2015] 4 SLR 1064 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Rogers</span>”) at [54]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Having identified the factual and legal issues that will arise, the court should give some thought as to how they are likely to be argued. It may also direct its mind towards the “procedural or evidential complexities which will or are likely to arise in the course of the underlying case” and which will influence the resolution of the issues (see <span class="font-italic">Re Andrews</span> at [47]). Such an inquiry will vary depending on the nature of the application for which admission is sought.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Where disputes of fact are concerned, it is important to look at the nature of the supporting evidence. If the evidence is documentary, one may ask whether it is “so convoluted or esoteric as to be beyond the comprehension of competent local counsel” (<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Caplan</span> at [61]). If the evidence is largely oral, the credibility of witnesses will be significant and the trial experience of foreign counsel may be more pertinent to the overall question of “need” (see <span class="font-italic">Re Andrews</span> at [73]). This would be relevant if the applicant is being sought to be admitted for the trial of the action or where cross-examination is ordered. This consideration does not arise here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 As regards questions of law, the court should sieve out those which are already well-settled (see <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Beloff </span>at [80]; <span class="font-italic">Re Rogers </span>at [53]). Such questions are unlikely to give rise to any unusual complexity or difficulty. On the other hand, legal propositions which have to be extracted from a long line of possibly conflicting authorities may justifiably be regarded as more complex (see <span class="font-italic">Re Fordham, Michael QC</span> [2015] 1 SLR 272 at [77]). In this regard, it may be relevant to consider the breadth and depth of research that will have to be undertaken to address any legal issue (see <span class="font-italic">Re Lord Goldsmith Peter Henry QC </span>[2013] 4 SLR 921 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Lord </span><span class="font-italic">Goldsmith</span>”) at [52]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Besides looking at how the arguments are likely to be presented, it is also relevant to consider how the court hearing the case is likely to resolve the factual and legal issues. To illustrate this point, in the context of applications to set aside an arbitral award, there is a difference between setting aside an award on jurisdiction, which involves a <span class="font-italic">de novo </span>standard of review and thus a greater possibility of factual and legal complexity (see <span class="font-italic">Re Wordsworth</span> at [44]), and an application to set aside for breach of natural justice, for example, for which the scope of curial intervention is far more limited (see [54] below). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 However, in considering how the issues are likely to play out, the court should be wary of delving too deeply into the merits of the case given that it is not hearing the underlying case for which admission is sought. Yet it cannot completely ignore either party’s prospects of success. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Beloff</span> described the tension in this way (at [79]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In forming an assessment of the complexity of the legal issues in a case the question arises as to the extent to which the court should consider the substantive merits of the case. Certainly not too much, for at the preliminary stage of applying to admit foreign senior counsel the parties’ arguments may not yet be fully formed; yet, not too little, for if the substantive merits are unarguably in one party’s favour then it cannot be said that the issues are complex.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I am mindful of these competing considerations because Jaguar alleged that two of CMNC’s arguments to set aside the Award – based on the implied duty of good faith and the tribunal’s alleged duty to investigate corruption – were neither novel nor complex but were simply without legal basis.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I think the focus of the inquiry should not be whether the issues raised in the substantive application are arguable. Even in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Beloff</span>, where the Court noted that the parties had put forward “fairly developed contentions” in support of their positions in the underlying case, the Court went no further than to note that on one of the issues, the arguments raised by the party resisting the admission of foreign counsel “seemed persuasive” though acknowledging that this might have stemmed from the absence of any riposte from the other side (at [79]). It would not be appropriate for the admission application to develop into a lengthy preliminary contest in advance of the actual case for which admission is sought. That said, the strength of the support for either party’s case, to the extent that it can be demonstrated, would be something to be borne in mind, not in deciding who has the better case, but as factors which may impact on the court’s assessment of the novelty or complexity of the issues. It would suffice to identify the legal issues, the “fairly developed contentions” which will be advanced at the substantive hearing and the authorities which will be relied upon in support of the contentions. If it is shown convincingly that some of the contentions are plainly unarguable or far-fetched, then, as noted in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Beloff</span>, it cannot be said that they will be complex. In such a case, it will hardly be appropriate or necessary to admit foreign counsel to argue those points. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In this case, although Jaguar did suggest that a number of CMNC’s arguments in OS 185 might be “devoid of any legal or precedential basis”

</div>, they have not quite explained why there is no legal basis beyond pointing to the lack of judicial authority. They did, however, put forward a number of local authorities showing that the arguments raised by CMNC may not be novel, or at least may be resolved by applying settled principles. I will consider them in due course. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The salient point in my view is this: the court should not analyse the legal issues in a vacuum. It is important to relate those issues to the facts and evidence which will be relied upon so as to appreciate the shape the legal arguments will eventually take in the substantive hearing.

</div> The conduct of the tribunal being challenged may not specifically have been the subject of any previous setting-aside application but the crucial inquiry remains the same, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether there was any causal connection between the tribunal’s alleged failure to respond to such obstructive conduct and the ability of CMNC to present its case. The court will necessarily examine the objections, if any, which were raised by CMNC in relation to such obstructive conduct during the arbitration and the consequential directions and orders, if any, made by the tribunal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53  It is increasingly the case that a variety of procedural decisions made by tribunals are challenged for being in breach of their duty to give each party a fair hearing. As I previously observed, this reflects parties’ attempts to expand the boundaries of natural justice as a ground for setting aside an award (see <span class="font-italic">Coal &amp; Oil Co LLC v GHCL Ltd</span> [2015] 3 SLR 154 at [3]). However, our courts have resolved such novel challenges by applying the settled legal principles on when an arbitral award should be set aside for breach of natural justice. There is no suggestion that the court hearing OS 185 cannot do likewise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The dispute will thus focus on whether the tribunal’s response, or lack thereof, to Jaguar’s misconduct warrants setting aside the Award. This can be determined by examining the procedural history of the arbitration which has been set out in affidavits filed by CMNC and Jaguar in OS 185. I do not think such a review would be particularly difficult, complex, or beyond the range of local counsel’s competence. The review is essentially objective in nature and one will have to bear in mind the limited scope for curial intervention where breaches of natural justice are alleged given the high threshold that must be crossed before a court will set aside an award. It is not a court’s task “to rake through the award and the record fastidiously with the view to finding fault with the arbitral process” (see <span class="font-italic">BLB and another v BLC and others</span> [2013] 4 SLR 1169 at [35]). Any alleged breaches of natural justice must be “demonstrably clear on the face of the record” (see <span class="font-italic">TMM</span> <span class="font-italic">Division </span><span class="font-italic">Maritima SA de CV v Pacific Richfield Marine Pte Ltd</span> [2013] 4 SLR 972 at [125]). This means that the factual substratum of such a challenge would be within a reasonably narrow compass. In this connection, it is material to note Mr Chia’s submission that CMNC did bring the guerrilla tactics to the attention of the tribunal for the purpose of seeking extensions of time. It is not disputed that the tribunal did grant the extensions (though some might have been shorter than what CMNC requested).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 It seems to me that the question of an implied duty to arbitrate in good faith only assumes relevance in OS 185 if: (a) such a duty is shown to exist; (b) Jaguar breached the duty; and (c) such a breach translates into a ground to set aside the Award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Whether the duty exists does not appear to me to be an entirely novel question. I was referred to an article showing that the duty has been recognised in awards and cases from around the world (see “Arbitrating in Good Faith and Protecting the Integrity of the Arbitral Process”, The Paris Journal of International Arbitration (2010), Vol 3, p 737). For example, one arbitral tribunal held that it was a breach of the duty of good faith to obtain evidence illegally (in that case, by wiretapping) and, in response, issued an order ordering the guilty party not to intercept communications. There are also a number of judicial decisions to the effect that a party who has not acted in good faith – <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, by being guilty of undue delay – will be estopped from challenging the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal. Such a duty can arguably be seen as inherent in an arbitration agreement, or implied by the governing law of the arbitration agreement or the law of the seat of the arbitration. Mr Tan has not explained why it would be necessary to admit the Applicant to make the case for recognising a duty on any of these grounds. In particular, so far as the duty is a contractual one, I agree with the Law Society that the concept of a contractual duty of good faith is not unfamiliar to our courts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Whether Jaguar breached the duty, if such a duty exists, is a factual inquiry. There is no reason why local counsel cannot undertake such a task. Any novelty at best lies in developing the link between one party’s<span class="font-italic"> </span>breach of its duty of good faith and the failure of the tribunal to conduct the arbitration in accordance with the agreement of the parties, which would be a ground to set aside the Award under Article 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iv) of the Model Law. According to Mr Tan, this point has yet to be decided by any court. If that is correct, then the Applicant or suitable local counsel would both be starting from the same base, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, arguing from first principles. I fail to see why local counsel would not be able to argue this issue competently. The argument seems to imply that arguing novel issues or ground breaking points of law is outside the competence of local counsel. However, as Jaguar rightly observed, a number of novel principles of law in setting-aside applications have been argued by local counsel.

If those underlying facts are found in OS 185 to constitute a breach of natural justice, then there is hardly any utility in deciding whether it would separately justify setting aside the Award under Article 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iv) of the Model Law. By the same token, if the facts do not amount to a breach of natural justice, then I have reservations about whether those same facts would justify setting aside the Award under Article 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iv) of the Model Law. The short point I wish to make here is simply this: ultimately, whether there is a duty to arbitrate in good faith may be a moot point on the facts of this case given the dual purpose of the guerrilla tactics allegation. However, I do not wish to pre-judge this issue. It is CMNC’s prerogative to argue this issue in OS 185.

The Court of Appeal noted at [72] that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… public policy is a question of law which an arbitrator must take cognisance of if he becomes aware of it in the course of hearing the evidence presented during arbitral proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Court endorsed the following passage from Gary B Born, <span class="font-italic">International Commercial Arbitration</span> (Kluwer Law International, 2009) at vol 1, p 835:  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where the parties’ contract raises issues of illegality, violations of public policy or mandatory law, or performance of administrative functions, then the tribunal’s mandate must necessarily include consideration of those issues insofar as they would affect its decision or the enforceability of its award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The question is whether the statement of principle above is broad enough to cover allegations of corruption. I do not think the argument that it does will be very difficult to make. I note that CMNC has filed an expert opinion in OS 185 from a leading arbitrator, Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, whose view is that the arbitrator’s duty to raise and inquire into issues of corruption is “well established among courts, tribunals and scholars”.

</div> Since CMNC’s own expert has acknowledged that the duty to investigate corruption is “well established”, CMNC’s local counsel should be able to develop the argument with reference to the relevant authorities identified by CMNC’s expert. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The more difficult question will be <span class="font-italic">how</span> a tribunal is expected to investigate allegations of corruption. That is what CMNC seems to imply the tribunal should have done. It is not clear how a tribunal would discharge such a role. Professor Kaufmann-Kohler suggests that in aid of their investigation, arbitrators may request additional evidence or explanations from parties, draw adverse inferences, or reverse the burden of proof if there is sufficient evidence supporting the corruption allegation.

</div> However, at no time after having brought the corruption allegations to the tribunal’s attention did CMNC ask the tribunal to recall any witness or seek any additional order from the tribunal in relation to the corruption allegations. There is no suggestion by CMNC that had the tribunal inquired further into these allegations, it would have uncovered evidence to show that the Award was indeed tainted by fraud and/or corruption. If so, I have difficulty with Mr Tan’s submission that the tribunal ought, on its own motion, to have investigated further. In a limited sense, I can agree that the argument is “novel” in that it has never been attempted before. But it does not follow that it is complex beyond the competence of local counsel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69  In the final analysis, I am not sure that the question of a tribunal’s investigative powers will occupy centre stage in OS 185. The dispositive issue is whether the Award should be set aside for being in conflict with Singapore’s public policy. That appears to turn on the factual question of whether Jaguar’s claims were indeed tainted by bribery or corruption. It is important to bear in mind that the tribunal did address its mind to this issue. It found that: (a) the allegations of corruption had not been established in any court; (b) no <span class="font-italic">evidence</span> was submitted to the tribunal that would enable it to make any judgment or conclusion that could have any bearing on the matters in issue; and (c) Jaguar had “quite properly” withdrawn a claim for the public relations costs which might have been affected by corruption.

</div> Accordingly, there is no question of the tribunal failing in its duty to <span class="font-italic">consider</span> the allegations of corruption. It is clear that if a tribunal finds <span class="font-italic">as a fact</span> that a contract is not illegal, a court cannot substitute its own factual findings in place of that (<span class="font-italic">AJU v AJT </span>[2011] 4 SLR 739 (“<span class="font-italic">AJU</span>”) at [65]); the court does not have the power to examine the facts of the case afresh (<span class="font-italic">AJU</span> at [71]). In that sense, as I said with the natural justice issue (at [54] above), the scope for curial intervention is limited, as is the extent of submissions that can be made. On the whole, I am not convinced that there is a need for foreign counsel to argue this issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 That leaves one further argument on the factual complexity of OS 185 to address. Mr Tan submitted that the 30,000 pages of affidavits that have been filed thus far in OS 185 is testament to the factual complexity of the case. The record of the arbitration itself runs to well over 250,000 pages.

</div>
</div> But it is not unusual, in modern litigation, for documentary evidence to run into tens of thousands of pages. That the evidence in OS 185 is voluminous is therefore not a factor in favour of admission. To hold otherwise might suggest that local counsel do not have the requisite competence to handle a document-intensive case. That would be quite unfair to the local Bar. Besides, the task of the parties and the court in reviewing the voluminous documentary evidence in the context of a setting aside application is quite different from the task of a trier of fact. It is even less demanding as compared to an appeal given the very limited grounds for curial intervention. Findings of facts have already been made by the tribunal. The court’s task is instead restricted to reviewing the documents insofar as they are relevant to the limited grounds for setting aside the Award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I have therefore come to the view, having regard primarily to the criteria of novelty and complexity, that none of the four legal issues raised by Mr Tan lean in favour of admitting the Applicant. That said, it is important to consider how the four Notification matters relate to or affect one another (<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Beloff </span>at [55]). Although the issues are not in my view unduly novel or complex, there may still be a need to admit the Applicant if it is shown that there are few local counsel able to handle these issues. I turn then to consider the second and third Notification matters. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Necessity of foreign counsel and availability of local counsel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 It has been repeatedly underscored that the current admissions regime is to be viewed through the prism of “need” (see <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Beloff</span> at [42], <span class="font-italic">Re Wordsworth</span> at [1]). However the question of “need” is necessarily relative: is there a need to admit the Applicant “because of a lack of available and appropriate local counsel” (see <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Beloff</span> at [44])? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 From the court’s perspective, there is no significant need for foreign counsel. It should be clear from the preceding paragraphs that there is ample local jurisprudence on applications to set aside arbitral awards. It can reasonably be assumed that the court would be <span class="font-italic">au fait </span>with this area of law. Although the court hearing OS 185 would certainly <span class="font-italic">benefit</span> from having the Applicant’s formidably wide-ranging experience, it does not follow that there is a “<span class="font-italic">need</span>” to admit him. Furthermore, setting-aside applications are brought before our courts fairly frequently and local counsel would have the benefit of familiarity with local case law and of having argued similar challenges in the context of the IAA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 As for the availability of local counsel, Mr Tan admitted that it would not be beyond the ability of competent local Senior Counsel to address the issues <span class="font-italic">in isolation</span>. However, because all these complex issues arose <span class="font-italic">together</span> in this case, that had the effect of compounding the complexity of the case and “substantially limiting the pool of local advocates, even in the upper echelons of the local Bar.”

</div> I cannot agree with this submission. As noted in <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Caplan </span>at [23], full details of efforts to ascertain the availability of local counsel should be set out. The reason for this requirement is clear. It is essential to establish a lack of available and appropriate local counsel to handle the case. I was prepared in <span class="font-italic">Re Wordsworth</span> to dispense with this requirement in <span class="font-italic">exceptional </span>cases (at [64]) and in that regard, I found that the issues in that case touched on public international law, which is not an area of law most local lawyers practise in. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The present case, however, is not such an exceptional one. Challenges to arbitral awards are brought before our courts fairly frequently. It is incumbent on Mr Tan to provide some detail at least of his efforts to ascertain the availability of local counsel. He did approach one Senior Counsel, Mr Lee Eng Beng SC. However, Mr Lee’s reply that the Applicant would be “more well-placed than local counsel”

</div> to argue the case is an implicit acknowledgment that the case is within the competence of local counsel, but that the Applicant is <span class="font-italic">better placed</span> to argue it. As aptly observed in <span class="font-italic">Re Lord Goldsmith</span> at [54], the fact that foreign counsel would do “an even better job” than local counsel “does not really address the question of necessity”. Furthermore, I do not think it is satisfactory for Mr Tan to approach just one senior counsel from his own firm and to rely on his response as representative of the views of the local Bar. As a result, I do not have the benefit of the record of efforts by CMNC to engage local counsel and I am not prepared to assume, as I did in <span class="font-italic">Re Wordsworth</span>, that the pool of local counsel who can act in OS 185 will inevitably be small (or non-existent) such that there would be limited utility in going through this exercise. Based on the number of such applications argued by local counsel, it appears to me that the contrary is true. I note in passing – and this was a point made by the Law Society as well – that CMNC has retained Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP, a leading local law firm with an established arbitration practice. It has five senior counsel within its ranks, each with an impressive track record in arbitration cases.
