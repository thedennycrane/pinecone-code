<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The appellant, Xing Rong Pte Ltd (“Xing
                    Rong”), appealed against the decision of the judge below (“the
                    Judge”), who had struck out its appeal against the decision of the
                    Assistant Registrar (“the AR”) in Summons No 5937 of 2009 where
                    the AR granted the discovery application that the respondent, Visionhealthone
                    Corporation Pte Ltd (“VHO”), had applied for against the Bank of
                    China Ltd (“BOC”), a non–party to the present proceedings
                    (“the Discovery Application”). We allowed the appeal against the
                    Judge’s decision on the striking out order but as we also found that the
                    AR was justified in granting the Discovery Application, we dismissed the appeal
                    against the AR’s decision. We now give the grounds for our
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Discovery Application was made in relation
                    to Suit No 678 of 2009 (“the Suit”). In the Suit, VHO claimed
                    S$2.125 million (“the Sum”) from Xing Rong on the basis of an
                    agreement dated 18 October 2003 (“the Agreement”) with Xing
                    Rong to establish a network of medical facilities in and outside China
                    (“the Joint Venture”). The funds for the Joint Venture were to be
                    provided solely by VHO.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       VHO claimed that, between December 2003 and
                    January 2004, it remitted the Sum to Xing Rong’s bank account with BOC
                    (“the Account”). It asserted that it was induced to remit the sum
                    to Xing Rong through the latter’s and/or the latter’s
                    representative’s fraudulent misrepresentations that the Sum was required
                    for the purposes of the Joint Venture</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Prior to March 2007, Xing Rong represented that,
                    in or around 2004, it had in turn remitted the Sum to a third-party Chinese
                    company, Fuzhou Huadi Hebang Construction Renovation Engineering Company Ltd
                    (“FHH”) for the purposes of the Joint Venture. However, the FHH
                    financial records obtained by VHO did not reflect the receipt of the sum by
                    FHH.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Xing Rong, while admitting that it had received
                    the Sum, alleged that the Sum was received pursuant to a currency exchange
                    transaction with VHO and not pursuant to any joint venture.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In the Suit, VHO sought, <em>inter alia</em>, to recover the Sum from Xing Rong, as well as the
                    production of all necessary accounts and enquiries relating to the movements of
                    the Sum. Thus, Xing Rong was asked to furnish the relevant bank statements that
                    evidenced the movements of the Sum. However, it claimed that the documents
                    sought by VHO were not in its possession.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In view of Xing Rong’s claim that it did
                    not have the bank statements in question, VHO sought the production of documents
                    from BOC relating to and/or evidencing the movements of the Sum, or any part
                    thereof, into and out of the Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       At the hearing of the Discovery Application
                    against BOC, BOC left it to the court to decide whether it should produce the
                    required documents. However, Xing Rong, which had been served with the papers
                    relating to the Discovery Application, opposed the said application. After
                    hearing the parties, the AR granted VHO’s application and ordered that it
                    be allowed to inspect and take copies of certain documents in BOC’s
                    possession (“the Discovery Order”). The discovery ordered related
                    to the following documents (“the Ordered Documents”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All bank statements, cheques, remittance slips, receipts, transfer
                        instructions and correspondence relating to and/or evidencing the movements
                        of the sum of S$2,125,000.00, which was deposited into account no.
                        012XXXXXXXX (the “<b>Account</b>”) of
                        Xing Rong Pte Ltd (formerly known as Huadi Projects Pte Ltd) with Bank of
                        China Limited by way of:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    OCBC cheque no. 749325 dated 23 December
                            2003 for the sum of S$400,000.00;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    UOB cheque no. 642852 dated 23 December
                            2003 for the sum of S$1,100,000.00; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    UOB cheque no. 642853 dated 10 January
                            2004 for the sum of S$625,000.00,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">into and out of the Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       BOC, which was the party subject to the
                    Discovery Order, did not appeal against the Discovery Order within the relevant
                    time frame (<em>ie</em>, by 14 December 2009).
                    However, Xing Rong, which was dissatisfied with the AR’s ruling, filed a
                    notice of appeal on 1 December 2009 against the Discovery Order by way of
                    Registrar’s Appeal No 449 of 2009 (“the Registrar’s
                    Appeal”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 4 December 2009, VHO applied, by way
                    of Summons No 6230 of 2009, to strike out the Registrar’s Appeal
                    (“the Striking Out Application”) on the ground that Xing Rong had
                    no <em>locus standi</em> to bring the Registrar’s
                    Appeal since there was no issue between VHO and Xing Rong with respect to the
                    discovery in question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 11 January 2010, the Judge, on hearing
                    the Striking Out Application, accepted VHO’s contention and struck out
                    Xing Rong’s appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 9 February 2010, Xing Rong filed an
                    appeal against the Judge’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Judge’s Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Judge allowed the Striking Out Application
                    on three grounds:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     Xing Rong lacked the <em>locus standi</em> to appeal against the Discovery Order
                        as its personal interests were neither affected nor aggrieved by it.
                        Moreover, it was neither a party to the Discovery Application nor the
                        subject of the Discovery Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     As BOC had not filed any appeal against the Discovery
                        Order within the prescribed time limit, the Discovery Order was perfected
                        between VHO and BOC. Thus, the doctrine of <em>res
                            judicata</em> precluded Xing Rong from filing an appeal against
                        the Discovery Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     In any event, Xing Rong’s appeal had no substantive merits as
                        the Ordered Documents were relevant and necessary to the fair disposal of
                        the Suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The issues in the appeal before this court
                    were:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Whether Xing Rong had <em>locus
                                standi</em> to appeal against the Discovery
                        Order;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Whether, given the fact that BOC did not file any
                            appeal against the Discovery Order, the Order had been perfected such
                            that Xing Rong was precluded, on the basis of the doctrine of <em>res judicata</em>, from filing any appeal against the
                            Order; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Whether the appeal against the AR’s
                            decision should, even if Xing Rong had <em>locus
                                standi</em> to file the appeal, have been struck out on the
                            basis that it lacked substantive merit.</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether Xing Rong had <em>locus standi</em> to
                appeal against the Discovery Order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The relevant part of O 24 r 6 of the
                    Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”)
                    concerning discovery of documents provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    An application for an order for the discovery of
                            documents before the commencement of proceedings shall be made by
                            originating summons and the person against whom the order is sought
                            shall be made defendant to the originating summons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    An application after the commencement of
                            proceedings for an order for the discovery of documents by a person who
                            is not a party to the proceedings shall be made by summons, which must
                            be served on that person personally and on every party to the
                            proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(8)    For the purpose of Rules 10 and 11, an application
                            for an order under this Rule shall be treated as a cause or matter
                            between the applicant and the person against whom the order is
                            sought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     After considering the relevant sections of
                    O 24 r 6 of the Rules, the Judge set out, at [19] of his Grounds of
                    Decision (“the GD”), the requirements that needed to be fulfilled
                    before a party could demonstrate that it had <em>locus
                        standi</em> to file an appeal against an order as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     One has to show that one is affected
                        or aggrieved by the court order and therefore has a personal interest in
                        seeking variation or release from the said order.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     Further and in addition to that, where
                        it is in the nature of an appeal, the Judge took the view that the appellant
                        must generally be a party to the application below that gave rise to the
                        orders that form the subject of his appeal before he has standing to appeal
                        against those orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In our view, insofar as proposition (a) is
                    concerned, Xing Rong had shown that it had a legitimate interest in the subject
                    matter of the Discovery Order as well as a corresponding right to ensure that
                    information relating to its bank account with BOC was not divulged without
                    proper cause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     As for the reasoning behind the Judge’s
                    proposition (b), he stated in the GD, at [17], that the wording of O 24
                    r 6 (1), (2), and (8) of the Rules indicates that an order for non-party
                    discovery is directed solely against the non-party from whom discovery is sought
                        (<em>ie</em>, it is clearly envisaged that an
                    application for non-party discovery is a matter exclusively between the
                    applicant and the non-party respondent). In addition, he stated, at [18] of the
                    GD, that the fact that Xing Rong was served with the application for non-party
                    discovery and that Xing Rong was heard by the AR did not <em>ipso
                        facto</em> confer it <em>locus standi</em> to
                    file an appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     With respect, we were unable to accept the
                    Judge’s reasoning. O 24 r 6(2) of the Rules provides that a
                    discovery application must be made by way of summons, which must be served on
                        <em>every party to the proceedings</em>. This must mean
                    that every party to the proceedings has <em>locus
                        standi</em> to make submissions where its interests in the main suit
                    may be affected by the court order on the discovery of documents. Insofar as
                    Xing Rong, a defendant in the main suit, was concerned, the discovery related to
                    its bank account with BOC and thus it had every right to oppose the Discovery
                    Application at the hearing before the AR.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     If Xing Rong was entitled to be heard at the
                    application before the AR to oppose it, it should also be entitled to appeal
                    against a decision that did not favour its arguments. It must be borne in mind
                    that in an application such as this, the bank against whom the discovery is
                    sought will invariably, as was the case here, take a neutral stand as it
                    normally will have no direct interest in the matter and will abide by whatever
                    order the court may deem fit to make. If it were the case that Xing Rong had no
                        <em>locus standi</em> to appeal against an adverse
                    order of the AR, then an anomaly would arise. While VHO could have three bites
                    of the cherry (as it could argue its case before the AR; appeal to the High
                    Court if it were unsuccessful; and appeal again to the Court of Appeal if it
                    were still unsuccessful), Xing Rong could only have one bite of the cherry
                    (namely to argue its case at the hearing before the AR). It is unimaginable that
                    the law should so discriminate between the parties. Moreover, on the
                    Judge’s holding, a question could be raised as to whether Xing Rong would
                    have the right to appear and oppose an appeal if it was VHO that was appealing
                    to the High Court. The answer must obviously be yes. And if Xing Rong could
                    oppose an appeal by VHO, why could it not then file an appeal against an
                    unfavourable AR order? If a party has the right to appear and oppose an
                    application, it should follow that he or she should also have the right of
                    pursuing the matter further on appeal in accordance with the general law. It
                    seemed to us that the Judge fell into error in thinking that just because the
                    Discovery Order was not directed against Xing Rong, it must therefore follow
                    that its interests were not affected by the order (see <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above). This is clearly a much too narrow, and indeed
                    unrealistic, view of the situation. We have not been able to find any reported
                    decision in any common law country which supported this narrow
                view.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Quite clearly a party to the main suit is
                    entitled to object to a discovery application sought by the other party against
                    it. By logical extension, the same rule must apply when the discovery order is
                    sought against someone who is not a party to the proceedings because that order
                    could likewise affect the interests of the party or parties to the main suit. It
                    seems to us that <em>locus standi</em> is not the correct
                    issue to raise when a party to the main action wishes to appeal a discovery
                    order made against a third party to the main action. The real matter to be
                    determined on such an appeal are the merits of the case (<em>ie</em>, whether the appellant has shown a real interest in the
                    documents sought and whether there are sufficient grounds to say that the
                    discovery order issued is wrong).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Discovery Order is <em>res
                    judicata</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The Judge noted, at [28] of the GD, that even
                    if Xing Rong had standing to appeal against the AR’s decision and
                    succeeded in its appeal, it would not be able to reap the fruits of the appeal
                    because the Discovery Order was <em>res judicata</em> as
                    between VHO and BOC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In ruling that the Discovery Order was
                        <em>res judicata</em>, the Judge had assumed that Xing
                    Rong had no <em>locus standi</em> to appeal against the
                    AR’s decision. Hence, he relied on <em>Nike International
                        Ltd and another v Campomar SL</em> [2005] 4 SLR(R) 76 at
                    [40] for the proposition that a decision which is not appealed against by a
                    party entitled to do so is <em>res judicata</em>. However,
                    this was not the case here as we found that Xing Rong was entitled to appeal
                    against the AR’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Judge also relied on <em>Teo Chee Yeow Aloysius and another v Tan Harry and another</em>
                    [2004] 3 SLR(R) 588. In that case, it was held that two
                    co-defendants who had both successfully appealed against an award of damages
                    assessed by an Assistant Registrar, but had appealed under different heads of
                    damages, were not entitled to the benefits of each other’s success
                        (<em>ie</em>, they could only benefit from the decision
                    with respect to the head of damages which formed the subject matter of their own
                    appeals). However, this reasoning was inapplicable to the present case, as Xing
                    Rong was not seeking to benefit from the successful appeal of another
                    party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In short, as the question of <em>res judicata</em> did not arise, Xing Rong was not precluded
                    from filing an appeal against the AR’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Judge was correct in striking out the Registrar’s
                Appeal based on a lack of substantive merit</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The principles concerning the striking out of
                    a notice of appeal were outlined by the Court of Appeal in <em>Riduan bin Yusof v Khng Thian Huat and another</em> [2005]
                    2 SLR(R) 188 (“<em>Riduan</em>”) as
                    follows at [17] and [21]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17    The principles
                            applicable to striking out notices of appeal are stated in <em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2003</em> (Sweet &amp;
                            Maxwell Asia, 2003) (“the White Book”) at
                            para 57/3/7:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The Court of Appeal has the inherent jurisdiction to strike out a
                            notice of appeal where an appeal is plainly not competent (see <em>Aviagents Ltd v. Balstravest Investments Ltd</em>
                            [1955] 1 W.L.R. 150; [1966] 1 All E.R. 450; or where the appeal is
                            frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of the process of the court (see
                                <em>Burgess v. Stafford Hotel Ltd</em> [1990] 1
                            W.L.R. 1215; [1990] 3 All E.R. 222). An appeal can be struck out in
                            the exercise of that jurisdiction, if there is no possibility that the
                            grounds of appeal are capable of argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21    A court will only exercise its power to strike out
                            notices of appeal in “clear and obvious
                            cases”…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The burden of showing that it is clear and
                    obvious that a notice to appeal should be struck off lies with the party seeking
                    to strike out the notice, which was VHO in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The Judge stated, at [47] of the GD, that he
                    struck out the appeal because apart from Xing Rong’s lack of <em>locus standi</em> to file the appeal, the said appeal
                    “lacked substantive merit” in any event. However, for an appeal to
                    be struck out, what is required is that there is “no possibility that the
                    grounds of appeal are capable of argument” or that the appeal is
                    “plainly not competent”, and not that the appeal lacks substantive
                    merit. Indeed, the Judge’s finding that the “appeal lacked
                    substantive merit” indicates that he had considered the merits of the
                    case before deciding to strike out the application. What is also noteworthy is
                    that the Judge did not make a finding that there was “no possibility that
                    the grounds of appeal (were) capable of argument” or that the appeal was
                    “plainly not competent”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In view of the circumstances, the Judge should
                    have dismissed the striking out application and proceeded to hear Xing
                    Rong’s appeal, in which case, he would have been entitled to dismiss the
                    appeal on the ground that it lacked substantive merit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the matter should be remitted to the Judge or any other judge
                for consideration of the merits of the appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     As the Judge should not have struck out Xing
                    Rong’s appeal against the AR’s decision, a question arose as to
                    whether the matter should be remitted to him or to any other judge to consider
                    the merits of the said appeal. In its notice of appeal, Xing Rong stated that it
                    was dissatisfied with the Judge’s decision in the striking out application
                    as well as the Registrar’s Appeal. In view of this, it seemed to us that
                    it would be expedient and much judicial time would be saved if the
                    Registrar’s Appeal was considered at this juncture so that the parties
                    could thereafter focus on the trial rather than be bogged down by further
                    interlocutory appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In fact, the Judge did consider the merits of
                    the case and the crux of the present case was whether the Ordered Documents were
                    relevant to the proceedings in the main action, and necessary for the fair
                    disposal of the case. There was no doubt that the Ordered Documents are very
                    relevant and necessary for the disposal of the main suit. As the Judge explained
                    in the GD at [44] and [45]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">44    ... The Ordered Documents <em>were
                                vital in establishing and resolving the disputed issues raised in
                                the main suit</em>. Apart from substantiating the claim that
                            there in fact was a receipt of such Sum (which was admitted by the
                                2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant), <em>the
                                Discovery Order also served a wider facilitative purpose in allowing
                                early disclosure of documents crucial to the main suit
                                itself</em>. For instance, if upon trial it was found that the
                            Plaintiff’s version of facts was in fact true and correct,
                                <em>ie</em>. that the Sum was paid under the
                            Cooperation Agreement, the Ordered Documents would provide useful
                            information pertaining to the onward application of the Sum by the
                                2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant by allowing the court to
                            trace its whereabouts since the transfer of the Sum into the
                                2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s account, including
                            whether or not the Sum was in fact subsequently paid over to FHH as
                            represented by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant in order to
                            establish a medical facilities network in and outside China pursuant to
                            the joint venture. This would assist the court in effectively
                            determining the liability of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                            Defendant under the Cooperation Agreement (if any).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">45    In the event that the Sum was found to have been
                            paid to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant pursuant to a
                            currency exchange transaction, there is no apparent prejudice in
                            disclosing the Ordered Documents in respect of the
                                2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s account. The
                            movement of the Sum that the Plaintiff was allowed to question and
                            scrutinise was limited only to those flowing from those cheques
                            delineated by the AR (see [11] above). The Discovery Order was not by
                            any means a blanket permission to intrude into the financial status and
                            activities of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant. The
                            Discovery Order allowed only disclosure of documents that were necessary
                            for the Plaintiff to establish its claim. It was never intended to
                            warrant a fishing expedition on the Plaintiff’s part. Hence,
                            details of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant’s use of
                            its other financial resources would not by way of the Discovery Order be
                            exposed. As such, the financial interests of the
                                2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant were sufficiently
                            safeguarded.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     We agreed with the Judge’s views on the
                    relevance and necessity of the Ordered Documents for the fair disposal of the
                    suit. It is pertinent to note that when requested by VHO to produce the Ordered
                    Documents, Xing Rong did not say that they were not relevant or necessary.
                    Instead, it merely stated that it did not have the Ordered
                Documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     As the Ordered Documents were relevant and
                    necessary for the disposal of the main action, the AR’s decision to allow
                    the Discovery Application was undoubtedly correct and should not be disturbed.
                    As such, we dismissed the Registrar’s Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     While Xing Rong succeeded in having the
                    striking out of its appeal set aside, the whole exercise had been futile as it
                    was very obvious that the Ordered Documents are relevant and necessary for the
                    disposal of the main action. As such, we ordered that each party should bear its
                    own costs with regard to both this appeal and the hearing before the High
                    Court.</p>
