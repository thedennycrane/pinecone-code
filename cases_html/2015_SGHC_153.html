        Choo Han Teck J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff is a company that provides
                    computerised services to its clients. One of these services is the management of
                    the payroll of its clients’ employees. Some of the plaintiff’s
                    clients are big corporations including banks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The first and second defendants were formerly
                    employed by the plaintiff. The first defendant resigned on 30 June 2011 and on
                    19 September 2012 she was appointed as a director of the third defendant. The
                    second defendant resigned on 2 June 2011 and on 19 September 2012 she was
                    appointed as a director of the third defendant. The third defendant is a company
                    engaged in similar services as the plaintiff, and in particular, in the
                    management of the payroll of corporations in Singapore and other parts of Asia.
                    The fourth defendant is also a director of the third defendant and holds 46%
                    shares in the latter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff claims that it holds the copyright
                    to several software systems including “ePayroll” and
                    “PayAdmin”. In this action, the plaintiff claims that the
                    defendants were in breach of its copyright in various software systems including
                    the two named. The plaintiff claims that the defendants had accessed data from
                    its software programmes, in that the first and second defendants breached the
                    confidentiality clause in their contracts with the plaintiff by taking the data
                    from the plaintiff’s system and downloading them into the third
                    defendant’s computer system.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff alleges that data taken by the
                    first and second defendants include sensitive and confidential information
                    belonging to the plaintiff’s clients including their names, residential
                    addresses, monthly income, bank details and passport numbers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Various interlocutory applications were made to
                    this court. They have been heard and orders have been made. The plaintiff had
                    obtained an Anton Piller order and seized computers belonging to the third
                    defendant. Forensic experts are studying the software and mechanism of those
                    computers. Non-disclosure agreements have been executed under the
                    confidentiality club, restricting the plaintiff’s disclosure of
                    information obtained during the discovery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The issues here before me arise from Summons No
                    728 of 2015 (“SUM 728/2015”) which is an application by the
                    plaintiff for leave to provide the police with a copy of the defendants’
                    disclosed materials.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Dr Stanley Lai, SC, assisted by Ms Clara Tung,
                    opposed the application. First they say that the original application was for
                    leave to extract information from the defendants’ computers for the
                    purpose of preparing an expert report. The defendants subsequently asked for
                    this court’s leave to use the information extracted for the purpose of
                    making a police report. Ms Tung argues that the application is not valid because
                    SUM 728/2015 has not been amended.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       There are two critical questions of fact to be
                    determined in this case. Firstly, does the confidential information in the
                    defendant’s computers belong to the plaintiff? Secondly, did the
                    defendants take them wrongfully from the plaintiff? These are issues for the
                    trial. What is relevant at the moment is that there is an injunction order
                    prohibiting the disclosure of the information being extracted from the
                    defendants’ computers. Some limited access is reasonable for the purposes
                    of the trial and therefore a confidentiality club was created by an order of
                    court. That is not challenged but the persons who are entitled to view the
                    confidential information are already named.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The plaintiff now submits that it be allowed to
                    show the extracted information to the police. It also submits that the extracted
                    information will show that a previous police report lodged by the defendants is
                    false. Everyone is entitled to lodge a complaint to the police if they think
                    that a criminal offence might have been committed. It is against the public
                    interest to prevent the making of such complaints. But criminal and civil
                    proceedings differ in many ways even if they arise from the same facts. The
                    parties control the conduct of the civil proceedings but the police decide what
                    actions are necessary if it is a criminal matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In the present case, the gravamen of the
                    plaintiff’s civil claim is that the defendant had wrongfully taken
                    confidential information from it by downloading the information from the
                    plaintiff’s computers and copying them onto the defendants’
                    computers. The information included the personal and private information of the
                    plaintiff’s clients. Some of these clients are banks and the information
                    taken wrongfully, as it is being alleged, includes information about the
                    banks’ customers and employees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The plaintiff is entitled to lodge a complaint
                    to the police. But it is not necessary to show the police the exact information
                    found in the defendants’ computers that is subject to a judicial
                    injunction. Giving the disclosed materials to the police for the purposes of
                    lodging a police report is clearly a purpose other than the pursuit of the
                    action in which discovery of the confidential information has been given. A
                    balance can be struck between producing a persuasive complaint to the police and
                    protecting the information in the defendants’ computers. All the plaintiff
                    has to do is to set out in its complaint the information that has been taken and
                    affirm that the exact information is now found in the defendants’
                    possession. It may also make its claims as to the perceived falsity of the
                    defendants’ previous police report dated 17 July 2014. The police can
                    invoke its own powers to seize the information. The police may then verify
                    whether the information is true and whether the matter can be referred to the
                    Public Prosecutor for criminal proceedings to commence. Thus, in spite of the
                    very able submissions of Ms Jocelyn Chan, counsel for the plaintiff, I find
                    that there are no exceptional circumstances justifying the release of such
                    information for the purposes of making a police report, and in fact, it would be
                    unduly prejudicial to the defendants if it were so allowed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     For the reasons above, SUM 728/2015 is
                    dismissed with costs reserved to the trial judge.</p>
