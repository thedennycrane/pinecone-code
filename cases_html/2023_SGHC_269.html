Yet, it was not a term of the alleged oral agreement (see [13] above) that the Biomax CLA would be subject to the approval of the preference shareholders of Biomax. It was highly implausible that ICG would have agreed to enter into the Biomax CLA without such a term.

Yet, the ICG Loan Agreement expressly stated that the repayment date for the loan was three months from the date of the agreement. The Liw Loan Agreement provided for repayment to be made six months from the date of the agreement. These repayment dates clearly contradicted the repayment terms under the CLAs.

There was no system and continuity to the Liw Loan Agreement.

Further, there was a lack of evidence to suggest that Liw was ready and willing to lend to all and sundry.
