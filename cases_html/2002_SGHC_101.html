<strong>Judgment</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="left" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><u><strong>GROUNDS OF DECISION</strong></u></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1. This is an application by the plaintiff under O 14 r 12 of the Rules

of Court for the construction of a term in a sale and purchase agreement between the

plaintiff and the first and second defendants. The plaintiff is a company carrying on the

business of selling furniture. The first and second defendants were the founders of the

plaintiff company in 1994. The third defendant is a company presently owned by the first

and second defendants and which the plaintiff alleges is now carrying on the business of

selling furniture. The plaintiff's claim in this action is based on a non-competition

clause in a service agreement (the "Service Agreement") signed by the first and

second defendants on 10 September 1999. That non-competition term is found in cl 4 of the

schedule reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"[The first and second defendants] will not within the South East

  Asia region and for the period of twelve (12) months after ceasing to be employed under

  [the Service Agreement] either alone or with (sic) or as manager, agent, consultant or

  employee of any person, firm or company, directly or indirectly carry on or be engaged in

  the business of (a) retailing home furnishing and lifestyle products and accessories and

  (b) engaging in any other retail business of a similar nature [as that of the

  plaintiff]."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The first and second defendants left the employment of the plaintiff on

19 July 2001. Thus the non-competition clause, if applicable, will be exhausted by

effluxion of time by 19 July 2002.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2. The plaintiff, however, alleges in this action that in breach of the

non-competition clause, the first and second defendants are carrying on the business of

furniture retailing through the third defendant. It is therefore seeking damages for

breach as well as an injunction to stop them from carrying on the third defendant's

business until 19 July 2002. Miss Baba, counsel for all three defendants opposed this

application on the basis that issue is not suitable for a determination under O 14 r 12.

She submitted that there is too much intertwining of facts with law that prevents a

straightforward disposition of the action.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3. Miss Baba's first objection is based on cll 11 and 12 of the Sale

and Purchase Agreement dated 24 July 2001. This agreement was signed by KLW Ltd as

purchaser and the first and second defendants as vendors of their shares in the plaintiff

company. Counsel submitted that cll 11 and 12 "constitute mutual release releases

granted by the plaintiff and the first and second defendants as against each other in

respect of the issues of shareholding, the first and second defendants' employment and

directorship in the plaintiff." The issue under this summons-in-chambers taken out by

the plaintiff calls for a determination as to whether cll 11 and 12 of the Sale and

Purchase Agreement supersedes the Service Agreement. Clauses 11 and 12 provide as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"11. KLW and [plaintiff] confirm that save for the obligations set

  out in this Agreement, neither of them has any claim against [the first and second

  defendants] arising out of or in connection with the shares held by [the first and second

  defendants], each of their directorships in and employment with [the plaintiff].</p>
<p align="justify">12. [The first and second defendants] confirm that save for the

  obligations set out in this Agreement, neither of them has any claim against KLW or [the

  plaintiff] arising out of or in connection with the shares held by [the first and second

  defendants], each of their directorships in and employment with [the plaintiff]."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4. Miss Baba submitted that on the true construction of the above

clauses the non-competition clause in the Service Agreement no longer operates. She

regards the words ‘<i>neither of them has any claim against [the first and second

defendants] … in connection with … their directorships in and employment with

[the plaintiff]</i>’<i> </i>to import the meaning and intention that all previous

obligations including those arising under the Service Agreement (executed before the Sale

and Purchase Agreement) are extinguished. Counsel further submitted that the

interpretation of these words cannot be made without oral evidence. The second objection

of Miss Baba is that the non-competition clause is a restraint of trade clause and by that

reason cannot be enforced. Miss Baba's third objection is that the determination of the

question as stated will not end the action because the defendants deny that they were in

breach of the non-competition clause and even if they had, counsel further submitted, the

defendants deny that the plaintiff had suffered any damage.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5. Mr. Say who appeared for the plaintiff began his submission by

citing a statement from a passage in the UK Supreme Court Practice to the effect that an

application under O 14 r 12 is appropriate if "a question of construction will

finally determine whether an important issue is suitable for determination under [O 14 r

12] and where it is an important feature of the case a court ought to proceed to determine

such issue". Counsel continues with the argument that the present issue concerns the

construction of the relevant terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement and the Service

Agreement and that a determination in the plaintiff's favour will "finally dispose of

the plaintiff's action". On the pleadings before me, this submission is not correct

and must therefore fail. I shall first refer to the opening point of counsel's submission.

The passage quoted by counsel and which I had set out above was taken from a brief account

of several general principles enunciated in an unreported case, namely <i>Korso Finance

Establishment Anstalt v John Wedge</i> (15 February 1994). The case itself was not

produced before me, but it is obvious that it was cited out of context and applied beyond

its force. The key does not lie on the words a "question of construction" but on

the later words "whether an important issue is suitable for determination under [O 14

r 12]". What is suitable is eminently and clearly set out in the rule itself. <i>The

construction of law or document must be such that it can be achieved without a full trial

and such a determination will fully determine the entire cause of the matter</i>. I have

placed emphasis on these words because they are the essence of O 14 r 12. They are clear

and simple words but it seems that counsel sometimes mistake the final determination of a

point of law or construction of document as the <i>only</i> requirement under this order.

This is apparent in this case by the reliance placed by counsel on the words of Roskill LJ

in <i>Verrall v Great Yarmouth Borough Council</i> [1981] 2 QB 202, 218: "Merely to

order a trial so that matters can be re-argued in open court is to encourage the law's

delays which in this court we are always trying to prevent". Order 14 r 12, however,

has a second component, namely, that the determination will finally dispose of the entire

cause of matter. This component underscores what is already stated in r 12(1)(a) - that

the question is only suitable for determination if a full trial of the action is not

required. So, if there are issues of fact or mixed fact and law that requires trial, an

application under O 14 r 12 would not be appropriate. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6. In this case, the plaintiff claims that the defendants are bound by

a non-competition clause which it appears to regard as of wide import whereas the

defendants argue that the clause is much narrower and, if applicable (which they say is

not) prevents them only from carrying on retail business. Whether the conduct and business

of the defendants was retail or otherwise is a disputed issue of fact that can only be

determined at trial. Thus, in this case, an annunciation of the effect of the law - that

is, whether the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement have superseded the Service

Agreement - will only sound the bugle signaling the battle to determine whether there is

in fact a breach. The construction of the terms is only <i>a</i> part and not <i>the </i>determinant

part of the case. The cases relied upon by counsel for the plaintiff are cases in which

the determination of the issue would have disposed of the entire action. In <i>Payna

Chettiar v Maimoon bte Ismail</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=11088&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1997] 3 SLR 387</a>, for instance, the only issue was

whether the plaintiff was wrong to have applied to set aside an earlier judgment against

it by the defendant without informing the court that the rights of <i>bona fide</i>

purchasers to the property in disputed are involved. Since the cause of action depended on

the previous judgment, if that stood, the plaintiff's action there must fail. In that

sense, therefore, if it was decided as a matter of law, that the judgment was wrongly set

aside by reason of the plaintiff's non-disclosure the entire action by the plaintiff

against the defendants cannot proceed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7. Furthermore, the defendants in this case before me are also

challenging the validity of the non-competition clause on the ground that it amounts to a

restraint of trade and is, therefore, void and unenforceable. Whether such a clause is

void on that ground may have to be determined as a mixed question of law and fact because

the issue of reasonableness, always a question of fact in such circumstances, calls to be

determined. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8. For the reasons above, prayer 1 of this application is dismissed.

The determination of the other prayers is therefore unnecessary. I shall hear the parties

on costs at a later date unless they are able to agree costs between themselves.</p>
