The two issues raised were first that the monies were not recoverable because the facility had been obtained by them by bribes, and secondly that the bank had breached its mandate by paying out US$750,000 on a particular cheque signed by the second defendant, apparently signed by him in blank and then, according to his counsel at the hearing before me, wrongly filled in as to payee by an employee of the borrower. The second defendant claimed that he had a standing instruction with the bank that the bank would call him first before honouring any draw down above US$5,000.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Affidavit of Gupta Vaibhav filed on 12 August 2021, at paras 37 to 39;  Affidavit of Gupta Vaibhav filed on 4 October 2021, at p 26.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The bank’s principal contention was that the evidence offered by the defendants was vague, belated and inconsistent, such that the court could safely conclude that the allegations of bribes and of a standing instruction to call the second defendant were not put forward in good faith.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 On 13 October 2021, the assistant registrar (“the AR”) held that the allegation of bribery disclosed a triable issue of illegality and granted unconditional leave to defend. However, he did strike out the borrower’s counterclaim, holding that it was unsustainable as there was no proper plea of how the bank might be bound by the alleged standing instruction. He granted leave to the defendants to amend their respective pleadings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The only part of these decisions appealed is the AR’s order granting unconditional leave to defend.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 As the borrower’s counterclaim has been struck out and no appeal filed against that decision, it is hard to see how the borrower can pursue before me the issue of the US$750,000. In any case, there was no evidence sufficient to raise a triable issue of any standing instruction as alleged. Generally, there is no room in a banking context for such collateral arrangements. A bank has to know on whose signature it is both entitled and obliged to act.  The cheque was signed by the second defendant who was the authorised signatory, and even if the employee had defrauded the borrower as suggested, this was a matter between the borrower and the employee. Thus, the question on appeal was whether the allegations of gifts and bribes gave rise to a triable issue of illegality. This question divides into whether these allegations are credible, and, whether, if they are true, they would found a defence of illegality. I will deal with the legal aspect first. I formulate the issues as follows:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Is a borrower who obtains a loan from a bank by bribing the bank’s officer entitled to resist recovery of the loan on the ground of illegality?</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Is a guarantor of such a loan entitled to resist enforcement on the ground of illegality?</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) If the answer to either of these questions is yes, is there credible evidence of the alleged bribes?</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: Is a borrower who obtains a loan from a bank by bribing the bank’s officer entitled to resist recovery of the loan on the ground of illegality?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The borrower accepted that the contract of loan was not unlawful. Rather, it contended that its bribing of the bank’s officer in the formation of the contract of loan tainted the contract with illegality. It recognised that it would benefit from having committed the offence if the loan was thereby rendered irrecoverable but contended that it was arguable that at trial the court might hold that refusing to enforce the contract of loan was a proportionate response, required by the wider public interest in discouraging bribery and corruption. The doctrine of illegality has been comprehensively elucidated and restated by the Court of Appeal in two decisions, namely <span class="font-italic">Ting Siew May v Boon Lay Choo and another</span> [2014] 3 SLR 609 and <span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading Ltd and another v Chua </span><span class="font-italic">Siok Lui (trading as VIE Import &amp; Export) and another</span> [2018] 1 SLR 363 (“<span class="font-italic">Ochroid</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 As stated in <span class="font-italic">Ochroid</span> at [64], the court will first ascertain whether the contract is prohibited either pursuant to a statute or an established head of common law public policy. The bank is licensed to lend money in Singapore. The purpose of the loan was wholly lawful and unobjectionable. The loan was made to finance the borrower in its ordinary business, including trading. There was no suggestion whatsoever that the contract was entered into with the object of committing any illegal act, or that the performance of the contract entailed any legal wrong or unlawful conduct. Consequently, the doctrine of illegality is not engaged, and the question of the proportionate response to such illegality is not raised.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 A contract to pay a bribe is unenforceable as it is a contract for the commission of a crime. A contract that has been procured by a bribe stands on a different footing. It is a situation dealt with under principles of equity and most often arises in the context of the law of agency. It is considered under the law of equity together with secret profits and commissions. The typical case in which a contract is procured by a bribe involves one party to the contract providing a gratification, whether or not financial, to an agent or employee of the other party with a view to influencing the other party’s decision to enter into the contract. That other party, perhaps a government or large corporation, typically knows nothing of the bribe, and has relied on its agent or employee to act in its best interests in connection with the entry into the contract. The payment of the bribe deprives that other party of the loyal service of its agent or employee. It is that other party which is the victim of the briber’s conduct. It has potential remedies against the bribe-taker within its ranks. It also, as the innocent party, has the option to avoid the contract procured by a bribe, either by rescission from inception of the contract, if counter-restitution is possible, or for the future: see <span class="font-italic">Panama</span><span class="font-italic"> and South Pacific Telegraph Co v India Rubber, Gutta Percha, and Telegraph Works Co</span> (1875) LR 10 Ch App 515. However, it also has the option to continue with the contract. Further, it may lose the right to avoid the contract through waiver or inaction after discovery of the bribe. If the contract is not avoided by the innocent party, then both parties are held to its terms. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In so far as the borrower suggests that the bank should be taken to have known of the bribes, there is no evidence sufficient to raise any triable issue that the bank knew of any allegations of bribery before these proceedings began, let alone at the time of entry into or renewal of the facilities. Moreover, I do not consider that the state of mind of a bribed employee can be attributed to his employer in the context of proceedings between the employer and the briber (or between the employer and the bribed employee). This is because the briber is necessarily an accomplice to the bribed employee’s breach of duty to his employer. The employer is the victim of both the briber and the bribed individual. The UK Supreme Court has recently held in <span class="font-italic">Aquila Advisory Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Faichney and others (Crown Prosecution Service intervening)</span> [2021] 1 WLR 5666 at [77]–[81] that where a company brought civil proceedings against its directors to recover the proceeds of crime which the directors had acquired in breach of their fiduciary duty, the unlawful acts and dishonest state of mind of those directors could not be attributed to the company, and accordingly the company could not be said to have acted illegally nor its claim barred by the defence of illegality.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 As I have noted, contracts procured by bribery are ordinarily addressed in the context of the law of agency. Nonetheless, in recent years, that a contract has been procured by bribery has sometimes been raised as a possible new category of contracts against public policy. The bank cited two English cases concerning enforcement of arbitration awards arising from contracts said to have been procured by bribery. In both cases, the court held that there was no English public policy requiring a court to refuse to enforce a contract procured by bribery: see <span class="font-italic">Honeywell</span><span class="font-italic"> International Middle East Ltd v Meydan Group LLC (formerly known as Meydan LLC)</span> [2014] EWHC 1344 (TCC) at [184]; <span class="font-italic">National Iranian Oil Company v Crescent Petroleum Company International Ltd and another</span> [2016] EWHC 510 (Comm) at [49(2)].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 I consider that there is similarly no Singaporean public policy requiring the court to refuse to enforce a contract procured by bribery. Rather, the innocent party has the option to avoid the contract upon discovery of the bribe.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In my view, it would be quite wrong to extend the categories of public policy to prevent the victim of a bribe enforcing the contract if it so chooses. This case is a good example of how wrong it would be to do so. If the payment of bribes to obtain a loan from a bank enabled the borrower to stop the bank from recovering monies disbursed, such a result would reward the wrongdoer and punish the victim. There are other examples. Take infrastructure projects. The <span class="font-italic">Public Sector Standard Conditions of Contract for Construction Works</span> (Building and Construction Authority, 8th Ed, July 2020) is a standard form adopted by the public sector for construction projects. It has been developed and refined over many years. It provides by clause 31.1(2)(b) that bribery by the contractor is a ground for termination of the contract by the government. This both adds a contractual right of termination to the common law right of rescission available where a bribe has been paid in connection with procurement and also applies that right of termination to a broader range of situations, including for example an offer of a bribe during the performance of the contract. That termination is an option and not mandatory reflects the reality that a government may still want the bribing contractor to complete performance of the contract. It may be more expensive or incur too much delay to change the contractor. Even if the contract were not terminated or avoided, there would remain other sanctions such as the criminal law.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Is a guarantor of such a loan entitled to resist enforcement on the ground of illegality?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22   The second defendant was, on his own account, the person giving bribes to the bank’s officers. Consequently, he is in no position to rely on this allegation as a reason to avoid liability under the guarantee. If he is being truthful in his accusations, he is at least the accomplice if not the instigator. The third defendant however claims that he knew nothing about the alleged gifts until the second defendant told him about them by WhatsApp on 21 April 2021.

</div> The third defendant did not suggest that he would not have signed the guarantee if he had known of the gifts, nor make any argument as to how knowing about them would have made a difference to his willingness to be guarantor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23  Where the guarantor knows nothing of the loan being procured by a bribe, then he is not an accomplice to the bribed employee’s breach of duty to the employer. Conceivably, such a guarantor may in an appropriate case be able to demonstrate both that he would not have agreed to have become a guarantor if he had known about the bribes and that he was misled not just by the borrower but also by the lender. However, no such defence has been pleaded or even raised in argument by the third defendant.

</div> When the allegations were finally made in the course of these proceedings, initially as gifts to unnamed individuals, there were inconsistencies, repeated revisions and a general lack of clear supporting evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In my assessment, the defendants’ allegations of bribery barely reach a threshold of minimal credibility. It is striking that they were not put forward before the proceedings began, although one possible explanation for this delay is that the second defendant was concerned that his doing so would incriminate himself. The pleadings have already been amended twice. This is a case where the old-fashioned parlance of a defence being shadowy is in fact accurate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 If I had decided that the defendants should have leave to defend instead of taking the view that I have done of the applicable law, I would have concluded that justice would be served by requiring the defendants to demonstrate their commitment to the defence of the action. I would have imposed as a condition that the defendants pay into court the amount outstanding as of 11 March 2021, namely US$546,920.78.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 It is no defence to a claim made to recover a loan for the borrower to allege that it had procured the loan by bribing employees of the lender. Accordingly, making such allegations does not raise a triable issue that would justify granting leave to defend. While a guarantor who does not know about the bribes could potentially raise the defence that he would not have given the guarantee if he had known of the bribes, in this case one of the guarantors was personally involved in making the bribes (if any were made) and the other neither pleaded nor argued that, had he known of the bribes allegedly made by the borrower, he would not have signed the guarantee. Accordingly, neither guarantor has raised any triable issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I allow the appeal and give judgment to the bank in the sum of US$546,920.78 against both the borrower and the guarantors.
