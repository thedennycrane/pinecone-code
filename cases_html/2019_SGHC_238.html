CMB had never explained what the gap in its knowledge was, such that the documents sought would fill and enable it to formulate a cause of action. Further, the Assistant Registrar had mistakenly thought that CMB had only two causes of action (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>fraudulent misrepresentation or conspiracy to injure) and had ignored the fact that CMB had an accrued cause of action as an assignee of receivables. The gravamen of CMB’s claim was that it had disbelieved Sinfeng, but mutual disbelief could not justify pre-action discovery because cases that come to court inevitably arise because of such disbelief. In any case, CMB had not explained why it was not convenient or just for the information sought to be obtained after proceedings were commenced.

The relevant provisions under the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) can be found in Order 24, and are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Discovery against other person </span>(O. 24, r. 6)</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">6<span class="font-weight-bold">.</span>—(1)  An application for an order for the discovery of documents before the commencement of proceedings shall be made by originating summons and the person against whom the order is sought shall be made defendant to the originating summons.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5)  An order for the discovery of documents before the commencement of proceedings or for the discovery of documents by a person who is not a party to the proceedings may be made by the Court for the purpose of or with a view to identifying possible parties to any proceedings in such circumstances where the Court thinks it just to make such an order, and on such terms as it thinks just.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Discovery to be ordered only if necessary </span>(O. 24, r. 7)</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">7.</span>  On the hearing of an application for an order under Rule 1, 5 or 6, the Court may, if satisfied that discovery is not necessary, or not necessary at that stage of the cause or matter, dismiss or, as the case may be, adjourn the application and shall in any case refuse to make such an order if and so far as it is of opinion that discovery is not necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 A plaintiff seeking pre-action discovery must show that the documents sought are relevant and necessary. Order 24 r 7 of the ROC clearly states that for such application to succeed it must also be necessary for a fair disposal of the matter or for saving costs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 If a potential plaintiff is in possession of sufficient facts to commence proceedings, pre-action discovery is unnecessary and accordingly would not be granted (<span class="font-italic">Ching</span><span class="font-italic"> Mun Fong v Standard Chartered Bank</span> [2012] 4 SLR 185 (“<span class="font-italic">Ching</span><span class="font-italic"> Mun Fong</span>”) at [23]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the scheme of pre-action discovery is to accommodate the situation where a potential plaintiff does not have sufficient facts to commence proceedings. This is consistent with its purpose being to allow a potential plaintiff to determine whether he has a “good cause of action”. It follows that pre-action discovery is unnecessary where an individual is in a position to commence proceedings. In this regard, we think the phrase in O 24 r 7, “discovery is not necessary, or not necessary at that stage of the cause or matter” lends weight to this approach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Further, as stated in <span class="font-italic">Dorsey James Michael v World Sport Group Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 2 SLR 208 at [49]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Pre-action disclosure, while not exceptional, is not usual. A court should not make an order if it has not been provided with sufficient information to adequately assess the necessity of disclosure. Reasons ought to be given why it is neither convenient nor just for that information to be sought after proceedings have been commenced against an already identifiable party. Ordinarily, the court is always placed in a better position in matters where proceedings have already commenced as it can then additionally examine the pleadings of all the parties to assess the merits of an application. This is why the granting of interrogatories after the commencement of proceedings is the norm. Further, where there are serious allegations of wrongdoing which will attract public interest considerations, a very careful assessment must be made about the appropriateness of this intrusive procedure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The potential plaintiff cannot use pre-action discovery simply to dispute the potential defendant’s version of the events. Nor is the purpose of pre-action discovery for the potential plaintiff to assess the strength of its claim. Nonetheless, courts have acknowledged that, sometimes, it is not easy to distinguish between seeking information to decide whether to commence an action and obtaining information to ensure that action has a reasonable prospect of success (<span class="font-italic">Ching</span><span class="font-italic"> Mun Fong</span> at [10] and [27]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… pre-action discovery would appear to apply only for the limited purpose of allowing a potential plaintiff to obtain the facts and materials needed to mount a claim. It would not be granted if the plaintiff already knows his cause(s) of action and is not otherwise constrained from commencing proceedings. Nor would an application be granted if its purpose is to enable a potential plaintiff to assess or augment the strength of his claim. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Admittedly, in certain circumstances the line between seeking materials in order to mount a claim and obtaining information to determine whether a claim if mounted could have a reasonable prospect of success can be difficult to draw. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 I was satisfied that discovery of the documents sought in OS 635/2019 should be granted in relation to Sinfeng as CMB required the information to frame an appropriate cause of action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The gap in CMB’s knowledge was whether the CIA contract was genuine. That was a critical gap to fill because, as CMB submitted, whether CMB had any basis to bring a claim in misrepresentation, fraud or conspiracy to injure would turn on the answer to that question. It was incorrect for Sinfeng to state that CMB had an assignment claim regardless of whether the CIA contract was genuine. In an assignment, the benefits of the contract are transferred to an assignee, with the assignor remaining bound to perform its obligations under the contract (which continues to subsist as between the contracting parties): <span class="font-italic">Fairview Developments </span><span class="font-italic">Pte Ltd v Ong &amp; Ong &amp; Ong Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2014] 2 SLR 318 at [46]. Thus, CMB’s claim as an assignee was inextricably dependent on the validity of the underlying contract, which in this case was the 90-day contract. But because the CIA contract and the 90-day contract bore the same reference number, the genuineness of both contracts was a serious issue that formed CMB’s pivotal consideration in deciding whether to proceed against Sinfeng. It would be unlikely for both versions of the contract to be genuine at the same time unless there was an honest careless mistake somewhere, which neither party contended was the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The documents sought (at [8]) were relevant because they went directly towards filling the gap in CMB’s knowledge. I did not accept Sinfeng’s oral submissions that pre-action discovery should be disallowed because the documents sought did not <span class="font-italic">conclusively</span> determine whether the CIA contract was genuine or a sham. That would be setting the bar too high. Nor did I accept Sinfeng’s argument that CMB was merely trying to assess the strength of its case and did not need the documents to test the viability of its cause of action. Sinfeng had pointed to correspondence where CMB stated that it was trying to “seek further <span class="font-italic">clarification</span> and <span class="font-italic">information</span> in respect of what [Sinfeng] explained in [its] Email” [emphasis added].

</div>
</div> However, notwithstanding some infelicitous wording, in substance and taken as a whole I read CMB’s emails as simply reaching out to Sinfeng for documents to check whether a claim against Sinfeng would lie in the first place. CMB was not trying to run ahead of itself to gauge the strength of its claim.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The documents sought were also necessary. Allegations of fraud cannot be made lightly in pleadings. Under O 18 r 12(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC, a plaintiff who pleads fraud must provide the particulars of the facts relied on:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Subject to paragraph (2), every pleading must contain the necessary particulars of any claim, defence or other matter pleaded including, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing words —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) where a party pleading alleges any condition of the mind of any person, whether any disorder or disability of mind or any malice, fraudulent intention or other condition of mind except knowledge, particulars of the facts on which the party relies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">For that reason, it was too glib for Sinfeng to claim that the matter boiled down to CMB seeking pre-action discovery simply because it did not believe Sinfeng. If CMB’s position was that it did not have sufficient information based on the documents at [7] and that it only had a reasonable basis of suspicion based on the Seaweb investigation reports, then in my view it would be fair that CMB be given the opportunity to obtain the requisite materials to ascertain if it could formulate its case. Doing so at the early stage of pre-action discovery would lead to time and costs savings if CMB were to conclude that its claim is not viable. Conversely, disallowing pre-action discovery might expose CMB to an application for further and better particulars and the risk of Sinfeng’s striking-out application should it press on with its fraudulent misrepresentation or conspiracy claims. The Seaweb investigation reports drew possible suspicions of fraud based on circumstantial and hearsay evidence. It would be unwise to rely solely on the Seaweb investigation reports to frame a cause of action without seeking pre-action discovery of documents that were readily available in Sinfeng’s possession.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Pre-action discovery would also enable CMB to decide whether to bring a fraud action against only Sinfeng or to join CO and its directors on grounds of conspiracy to defraud, as the bunkers contract (for which CMB was a beneficiary) was entered into between CO and Sinfeng. In my view, OS 635/2019 was necessary for CMB to frame proper causes of action against the appropriate defendants. Therefore, pre-action discovery was necessary for costs savings and also for fair disposal of the matter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Sinfeng in its submissions alleged that it had paid CMB US$12,486,600 for the bunkers deal and so CMB suffered no loss. In the course of the hearing, I sought clarification from Sinfeng’s counsel and it was disclosed that the payment of US$12,486,600 was paid to CO, which had an account with CMB. I informed Sinfeng’s counsel that payment to CMB and payment to CO’s bank account with CMB were completely different. She acknowledged the mistake. Therefore, it was incorrect and misleading for Sinfeng’s counsel to state categorically that Sinfeng had paid CMB US$12,486,600.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Lastly, the cases relied on by Sinfeng did not further its position. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Bayerische</span><span class="font-italic"> Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG v Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd </span>[2004] 4 SLR(R) 39, several banks sought discovery from APBS regarding APBS’s state of knowledge in relation to certain accounts and loans, which the banks claimed were unauthorised. The court stated that “a disbelief of APBS’s position itself cannot be a sufficient reason for seeking pre-action discovery” (at [26]). But it was crucial to understand <span class="font-italic">what </span><span class="font-italic">was being disbelieved and why</span>. The banks disbelieved APBS’s claims regarding APBS’s state of knowledge, because the banks had formed – <span class="font-italic">on the basis of their bank documents, which nobody alleged were fakes</span> – the belief that there was a banker-customer relationship (at [24]). The banks, therefore, had enough to plead their cause of action: the documents sought were, as CMB’s counsel put it, “good to have” but not necessary. This was unlike the present case where the very validity of the 90-day contract and documentation was disputed. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In <span class="font-italic">Ching</span><span class="font-italic"> Mun Fong</span>, a bank’s customer sought pre-action discovery of voice logs of communications regarding investments with the bank. This was disallowed because the customer was going beyond ascertaining the viability of her cause of action by trying to gauge her chances of success (at [40]). The applicant had clearly formulated causes of action in contract or tort and the voice logs were “record[s] of the verbal communications between the parties that <span class="font-italic">each must naturally have been equally privy to</span>”<span class="font-italic"> </span>[emphasis added] (at [42]). This was not the case here, as CMB was not privy to the CIA contract and had yet to formulate its cause of action. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 For the reasons stated above, I dismissed the appeal and fixed costs at $4,000 (all in) in favour of CMB. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tan Siong Thye<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ong Boon Hwee William, Lim Jun Rui, Ivan and Erik Widjaja (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the plaintiff in OS 635/2019 and the respondent in RA 240/2019;<br/>Tan Poh Ling Wendy and Carl Lim Kok Wee (Morgan Lewis Stamford LLC) for the defendant in OS 635/2019 and the appellant in RA 240/2019.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
