(In respect of the Third Defendants)</strong></font></p>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">1. The case against the first and second defendants have already been

dealt with in my grounds of decision dated 28 November 2000. The trial continued

thereafter against the third defendants a joinery and furniture making company. This is my

judgment in respect of the claims against the third defendants.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify">The Background</p>
<p align="justify">2. On 20 February 1999 a fire razed two shophouses known as 23 and 25

Senang Crescent ("No. 23" and "No. 25" respectively). The first

plaintiffs are the owners of No. 23 and the second plaintiff was the tenant of the second

storey of that shophouse. The first defendants are the owners of No. 25. The second

defendants were the tenants of the second storey of No. 25, and the third defendants were

the tenants of the first storey of No. 25. The plaintiffs sued all three defendants for

damage arising from the fire on the ground that the fire started at No. 25 and was the

result of the negligence of the defendants. They also sued alternatively under the rule in

<i>Rylands v Fletcher</i>, and recited <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> for good measure. No claim

was made in the tort of nuisance. The first and second defendants each filed a

counter-claim on the ground that the fire started at No. 23. However, in the midst of the

plaintiffs’ case at trial Mr. Cheong and Mr. Anparasan, counsel for the first and

second defendants respectively, were granted leave to discontinue the counterclaims. </p>
<p align="justify">3. The main issue of fact concerned the origin and cause of the fire.

Where the cause of action is founded on negligence, the origin of fire need not

necessarily be at the defendants’ premises. But, in this case the plaintiffs

specifically alleged that the point of origin and the negligent act (cause of the fire)

occurred at the premises occupied by the third defendants, namely the first storey of No.

25. The plaintiffs’ case was that the fire originated beneath a woodpile in the front

yard of No. 25. They alleged that the fire was caused by an electrical short circuit.

Their case was that the fuses in the premises had been tampered and up-rated.

Consequently, the fuses failed to break the current when the short circuit occurred. The

short circuit enabled sustained arcs (electrical sparks) to result and that ignited the

fire which subsequently spread to the plaintiffs’ premises next door.</p>
<p align="justify">4. At the close of the plaintiffs’ case counsel for the first and

second defendants submitted that there was no case for these defendants to meet. After

hearing submissions, I accepted the demurrer and dismissed the plaintiffs’ claim

against the first and second defendants and the trial continued against the third

defendants.</p>
<p align="justify">5. The plaintiffs’ claim against the third defendants was based on

negligence. Their case was that the fire started at the first storey of No. 25, which were

the premises occupied by the third defendants, and that the fire was caused by a sustained

electrical arc. Their case was that the third defendants were negligent in not maintaining

their electric cables in good condition, and more importantly, failing to maintain a

proper fuse box or circuit breaker. The plaintiffs called three experts. The first was Lt.

Rashid from the Singapore Civil Defence Force ("SCDF"). He was the head of a

team of three officers assigned to investigate this particular fire. The second was Dr

Jimmy Chen Wie Ying, an electrical engineer, and the third was Mr. Tan Jin Thong, a

retired Director of the Singapore Fire Services and Deputy Commissioner of the Singapore

Civil Defence Force. </p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify">Lt. Rashid’s Report</p>
<p align="justify">6. Lt. Rashid has about 17 years experience in the Fire Fighting

Service. He was the head of a team of three officers who investigated this fire. A written

report was subsequently made by the team and Lt. Rashid’s evidence in court relied

largely on that report. Recounting his investigation, Lt. Rashid said that when he arrived

at the scene of the fire, the firemen were attacking the fire at No. 25 because the fire

appeared most flagrant there and was spreading to No. 23 because of a north-westerly wind.

He was also told by the police officers at the scene that a passer-by on a motor-cycle saw

the flames and had gone into the premises of No. 25 where he reportedly told the police he

saw sparks coming from underneath some timber. </p>
<p align="justify">7. He examined the fire damage and noted that No. 25 was more

extensively damaged. It is not disputed that the whole of the first and second storey of

No. 25 were razed. No. 23, however, suffered extensive damage to its second storey, but

its first storey was almost unscathed in comparison. Little, if any, damage by fire was

suffered by either No. 21 or No. 27, the two shophouses which sandwich No. 23 and No. 25.</p>
<p align="justify">8. Lt. Rashid interviewed a Bangladeshi worker employed by the third

defendants. He was the only person in the third defendants’ premises at the time.

There was little dispute that the third defendants’ premises had been closed for the

Chinese New Year holidays from 12 February 1999 and was to re-open on 22 February 1999.

The Bangladeshi worker told Lt. Rashid that when he awoke in the middle of the night to go

to the toilet he did not notice anything unusual. He woke up a second time when he felt

very warm. He went to the front windows where he noticed a great deal of heat and smoke

coming from the front yard so he ran away from the rear of the premises. Although this

interview was recorded immediately after the fire, the witness’s name and particulars

were not recorded and he had since returned to Bangladesh. A woman who lived nearby was

also interviewed but her evidence was of not much assistance in determining the origin or

cause of the fire. The initial firefighters reported that they saw some electrical

sparkings at the front yard of No. 25. They noted that there was a breeze blowing in the

north-westerly direction, and the fire was spreading "laterally and towards the

rear", that is, the fire was spreading from No. 25 towards No. 23. The

plaintiffs’ two material witnesses were Mr. Udom Kasemkrai and his friend Mr. Soo

Chee Meng. Mr. Kasemkrai was a partner of the second plaintiffs. They carry on the

business of manufacturing mannequins. On 19 February 1999 Mr. Kasemkrai and Mr. Soo were

working till close to midnight rushing to complete a consignment of mannequins. Mr.

Kasemkrai testified that the lights in his room went out suddenly about 3.15 in the

morning of 20 February. He saw smoke coming from No. 25. When he realised that there was a

fire he called Mr. Soo and then ran out of the building. He testified that he did not see

any fire on the premises of No. 23 but there was fire in the front compound of No. 25. Mr.

Soo gave a very similar account except that he ran back once to No. 23 to search for his

passport. Mr. Kasemkrai, speaking through a Mandarin interpreter, was a difficult witness

in that he was rather hard of hearing and did not come across as someone with a clear and

organised mind, but I have no reason to think that he was being untruthful. Mr. Soo was

quite the opposite. I found him to be generally dependable, and of all the witnesses of

fact, he was the most reliable. I have little hesitation in accepting his account. On the

evidence as I had just described, I am of the view that the fire probably started in the

front yard of No. 25. I note the evidence of the experts Mr. Dillon and Dr. Mullen in

respect of the general theory that the fire seemed greater at No. 25 than at No. 23

because the fire burned through the front roofing of No. 23 and thus the fire was able to

escape upwards, thereby sparing the internal ground floor from extensive damage; whereas

the tougher roofing material on the front yard of No. 25 trapped the fire and heat forcing

the fire to spread inwards resulting in severe damage to the internal ground floor of No.

25. I also note their theory that the fire could have started from the front yard of No.

23 and the flames leapt over the central fence dividing the two premises, into No. 25 and

because of the heavy fireload, the flammable materials, and the architectural design, the

fire at No. 25 consequently became larger than that at No. 23. I will not dismiss these

theories as impossible, but on all accounts, I find that it was more probable that the

fire started at the front yard of No. 25.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify">The Opposing Theories - The Plaintiffs’ Case</p>
<p align="justify">9. That, however, was only half the story. The next crucial question

was, what caused the fire? Mr. Gn, counsel for the plaintiffs, advanced a theory of the

cause of the fire. It was based on the postulations of Dr. Chen. Counsel sought support in

the evidence of Mr. Tan and Lt. Rashid. Dr. Chen was appointed Professor of Electrical

Engineering in the University of Singapore in 1969. He has an impressive rsum which

includes membership in the Standing Committee of the Fire Safety Bureau. He was a

commissioner in the Commission of Inquiry into the Robinson’s fire in 1973, and

Chairman of the Fire Safety Appeals Advisory Board, among other appointments. Dr. Chen was

of the view that the fire started about 3 am or slightly later and was caused by a short

circuit at the supply wiring to the machines located in the front yard of No. 25. He said

that the ignition was caused by electrical arcing (sparks) in the course of the short

circuit. The problem was compounded because the fuses that were supposed to cut off any

over current did not work because the fuses were incorrect ones. He said that the fuses

consisted of 3 strands of copper wires instead of smaller more sensitive wires. The

incorrect fuses, according to Dr. Chen allowed the short circuit to persist. Dr. Chen

stated that a "short circuit occurred at these wirings because the wirings had not

been maintained; and most probably it had been over-loaded. Over time, the insulation on

the copper deteriorated then a short-circuit occurs". </p>
<p align="justify">10. The plaintiffs also called Mr. Tan, an impressively credentialled

retired Director of Fire Service and former Deputy Commissioner of the Singapore Civil

Defence Force. Unfortunately, Mr. Tan laboured under the disadvantage of being briefed

about a year after the fire and therefore had to work principally from documents,

photographs and instructions from the plaintiffs and their solicitors. He did, however,

visit the fire site to familiarize himself with the layout and design of the buildings,

which had been restored in the meantime. Mr. Tan’s contribution to the

plaintiffs’ cause was his agreement with Lt. Rashid that the point of origin of the

fire was a wood pile in the front yard of No. 25. Lt. Rashid had based his conclusion on

what he perceived as a "V" shaped burn pattern near the wood pile. He testified

that he saw this pattern when he inspected the site. Mr. Tan agreed with Lt. Rashid’s

conclusion by looking at the photographs. He was of the view that the wood pile had

sustained "severe deep charring and that the burning was from a very low level".

He also saw some burnt out electrical wirings below the stack of timber. He said that the

timber were stacked closed and would not burn easily "especially from the bottom of

the stack". He was of the view that burnt wiring recovered from under the wood pile

was probably the point of ignition. He said that the fire was probably smoldering and

burning for about 30 to 45 minutes before flaring. That also explained why a hole had been

burnt through the fence near that point.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify">The Third Defendants’ Case</p>
<p align="justify">11. The third defendants called Mr. Barry Dillon as their expert. Mr.

Dillon has an equally impressive rsum. He has a specialist expertise in metallurgy but

had also investigated well over 900 fires. He does not disagree with Dr. Chen’s views

that untrunked wiring may lead to a short-circuit, but he disagrees with the inference

that if the wires were trunked no short-circuit can take place. He also pointed out that

some of the wires found on the premises of No. 23 were also not trunked. Mr. Dillon was

highly critical of Mr. Tan and Lt. Rashid’s theory that the fire started at the wood

pile. He testified that he "could not understand how Lt. Rashid and [Mr.] Tan can say

that the fire came from underneath. The steel frame on which the wood was stacked, it had

distorted and toppled forward. No longer evidence of wood on the top two shelves. The wood

burn. Why not argue that the fire started from there? Mistake was assuming that the woods

were nicely stacked with pieces close together. If that was the case, it would be true

that the wood would burn more slowly. But that’s not the case from photos 10 and 11.

The timber had fallen. When it does, it is random and burns more quickly because of more

surface area."(sic).</p>
<p align="justify">12. The position taken by Mr. Dillon, and to a large extent by Dr. Eric

Mullen, (originally called as an expert witness by the first defendants) was that the fire

was far too extensive for any evidence as to its origin to be ascertained. Dr. Mullen took

the position slightly further and postulated that the fire could even have started in the

upper floor of No. 23 (the second plaintiffs’ premises), or on the ground floor of

No. 23 near the wall adjoining the front yards. Dr. Mullen is extremely well qualified

and, like Mr. Dillon, has extensive experience as a fire investigator. He too had

investigated over 900 fires with the firm of Dr. JH Burgoynes &amp; Partners. Dr. Mullen

is of the view that there is "virtually zero chance" of a short circuit causing

the fire in this case because a short circuit would have generated such a high current

that even the alleged incorrect fuses used here would have blown, thereby cutting off the

current flow. He also noted that no one witness, including Dr. Chen, had offered any

reason why a short circuit could have arisen. Dr. Mullen was of the opinion that the

plaintiffs’ theory that a short circuit occurred on a straight run cable is

impossible to sustain. The reason, he said, is that the wires do not touch, which is what

happens when a short circuit occurs. Furthermore, he explained that the arcing (electrical

currents) can occur when the melted insulation for the wires melt and become conductors of

current. However, such arcing occurs after a fire has broken out and not before. Thus, he

said, the cause of the fire here could not have been due to arcing. He testified that that

explains why the firemen saw sparks at the front yard of No. 25 when they were putting out

the fire. Dr. Mullen and Mr. Dillon were of the view that Lt. Rashid had placed too much

emphasis on arcing, reports of sparkings, and melted wires. Both these experts were of the

view that the sparkings were merely evidence of a serious fire attack and not the cause of

the fire. Mr. Dillon spent some time and effort explaining the greenish tone found on the

wires in the fuses. Dr. Chen had suggested that this colour was caused by the heat of the

current. In this regard Mr. Dillon’s explanation that the green tones were caused by

rain and water from the firefighters is probably more accurate. However, contrary to Mr.

Teo’s fervent belief, this point is not of great significance. Mr. Teo thought that

it was the centrepiece of Dr. Chen’s theory. It is not.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify">Findings</p>
<p align="justify">13. It is truly a difficult task to assess the opinions of witnesses

who are called precisely because the subject matter required specialist knowledge when the

judge himself stands alone least qualified. I had dealt with the simpler of the findings

that I needed to make, namely, where did the fire originate? I accept that in a massive

fire as that experienced by the two adjoining premises here, relevant evidence of the

cause may have been consumed and obliterated by the fire itself. The evidence here amply

suggests that the wires were so badly burned that it was impossible to trace the

connections or yield any useful information. However, sufficient clues remain. In this

regard, I accept the general theories of electrical conduct that Dr. Chen espoused. The

fire, in my view, did not destroy all the evidence. I accept Mr. Gn’s submission that

the electrical sparkings seen by the witnesses indicate that there was still electricity

flowing in the cables even when the fire was in full flame; otherwise no electrical sparks

could have been created. This was supported by the evidence that the switches at the

isolators were left in an "on" position when the shop closed for the holidays.

Dr. Mullen and Mr. Dillon had steadfastly maintained that in the circumstances of the

case, arcing from a short circuit could not have happened. Dr. Mullen stated that the

wires in question were "straight run" wires which could not have created an arc

or short circuit. Furthermore, even if a short circuit had occurred the fuses would have

tripped and the electricity supply cut off. This was so, he said, even accepting that the

fuses were not of the correct quality. In my view, that conclusion can only be maintained

on the premise that the wires were well maintained and not defective. If the insulation

covering the live and neutral wires were broken the probability of the exposed wires

making contact would be very high. The issue is whether there is sufficient evidence to

conclude or infer that there was probably some defective cables.</p>
<p align="justify">14. Dr. Chen was of the view that there was no evidence that there was

"an initiating fire to set the insulation smoking below the pile of wood". He

believed, therefore, that the cause was arcing in the wires. He disagreed with Dr.

Mullen’s theory of a "dead short circuit" which would send the current

beyond 200 amperes and blowing the fuses. In short, he drew the inference, from the

circumstances and the available clues, that the fire could only have been caused by an

electrical short circuit. In the absence of the probability of any other possible cause,

his inference, in my view, is reasonably probable.</p>
<p align="justify">15. There is no doubt that Dr. Mullen and Mr. Dillon were exacting a

high standard on themselves as experts in their field, but they were unable to accept Dr.

Chen’s opinion because they were searching for irrefutable hard evidence. The court,

however, is not required to seek such evidence in evaluating the balance of probabilities.

I am satisfied that Dr. Chen had been no less exacting on himself than Dr. Mullen or Mr.

Dillon but nonetheless, had established a reasonably probable theory, supported by

evidence, of how the fire occurred. After taking into accounts of Dr. Mullen and Mr.

Dillon, I am satisfied that on a balance of probabilities the fire occurred as a result of

an electrical short circuit in the premises of No. 25. The "up-rated" fuses were

not able to break the circuit and thereby electrical current continued to flow, resulting

in the ignition of the fire. Mr. Dillon agreed that the up-rated fuses permitted a greater

current flow than that prescribed but he disagreed that that resulted in the ignition of

the fire. Dr. Mullen suggested that there could have been some circuit breakers in the

premises but these, he said, could have been destroyed in the fire because modern circuit

breakers are made of less durable materials. I think that it is fair to say that this is

speculative contemplation because, apart from the absence of any trace of a circuit

breaker or any component part in the burned shophouse, there were no evidence from the

third defendants that they had any circuit breakers other than the three fuses in

question. The case against the third defendants was apparent to them from the start and

the presence of circuit breakers would feature as a key component of their defence; but no

evidence was adduced that there were any and I think that it is reasonable to conclude

that there were none in the old shophouse. I should add that Dr. Mullen did express the

view that he could not imagine that the shophouse was served by only three fuses, but that

seems to be the evidence. Furthermore, there was evidence of a circuit breaker in No. 23;

none in respect of No. 25. I do not think that it is right to assume that if there was a

circuit breaker in No. 23 it must follow that there was one in No. 25. That was not Mr.

Teo’s point in any event. The circuit breakers are modern devices and must be

installed specifically. There was no evidence of such installation in No. 25 a building of

at least 30 years in age.</p>
<p align="justify">16. I think that it is not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that

the third defendants were the ones who altered the fuses. The fuses were in premises they

occupy and use. The responsibility rests with them to ensure that the electrical wires are

well insulated and the proper fuses or circuit breakers were in place. It was not disputed

that the fuses were not in conformity with the recommended 30 amperes specification. In

the circumstances, the third defendants, in failing on these counts, were negligent and

the plaintiffs’ claim against them in negligence must succeed.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p align="justify">Res Ipsa Loquitur</p>
<p align="justify">17. I had dealt with the plaintiffs plea of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> in

my grounds of decision in respect of the case concerning the first and second defendants,

but it is necessary to repeat my views in this judgment as the plaintiffs had also raised

this plea against the third defendants. <i>Res ipsa loquitur </i>is only an evidentiary

doctrine and does not apply in this case because the plaintiffs had specifically sought to

show that the cause of the fire was an electrical ignition. That being the case, it will

not assist them to say that if they fail, the defendants must then explain how the fire

occurred. This is not how the doctrine was intended to be used. The burden of proof lies

with he who asserts. Where a plaintiff asserts negligence he must prove negligence. If he

is unable to assert any cause, then he may, if the circumstances permit, cry <i>res ipsa

loquitur</i> and shift the burden of proof to the defendant to establish how the facts

complained of occurred. The overall burden (the legal burden) of proving the

plaintiffs’ case remains with the plaintiff. Where, as in this case, the plaintiff

makes a specific allegation of negligence he cannot rely on the rule to establish a

preliminary case of negligence. He must proceed to prove forthwith that which he has

asserted to be the defendant’s negligence, which in this instance, the plaintiffs had

accomplished.</p>
