The Grease Trap comprised of two units of grease (and solids) interceptors, an ejector system (consisting of one ejector tank and two ejector pumps) and a sump pump system which consists of two sump pumps.

As its name implies, the function of the Grease Trap was to remove grease from the Building whose tenants’ main business was in food processing and storage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The maintenance of the Grease Trap was carried out by a contractor called JOL Environmental Pte Ltd (“JOL”) engaged by the plaintiff. However, JOL’s engagement was not based on a contract but was <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> as and when the defendant made a request. The <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> maintenance works for the Grease Trap consisted of manually removing the hardened grease through the ground level manhole. According to the plaintiff, because the Grease Trap was not maintained on a regular basis, there were frequent blockages that necessitated JOL’s services being called upon often on an urgent basis to clear the blockages.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 In the affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) of the plaintiff’s only witness Mr Ow Yong Chaan Loung (“Mr Ow Yong”), he set out a number of occasions when JOL were called to clear blockages (emergency and non-emergency) of the Grease Trap.

</div> During his cross-examination, Mr Ow Yong clarified that the blockages were not in the Grease Trap itself but in the pipes from individual units that led to the common pipe and then to the grease tank. The causes of blockage were rubbish, plastic bags, debris raffia, cigarette butts and even a door hinge on one occasion.

When the plaintiff’s council members inquired of the defendant’s building manager Mr Ahmad bin Mahamood (“Mr Ahmad”) they were told that the Grease Trap was choked and flooded. At their request, Mr Ahmad showed council members the Grease Trap. They saw that the entire Grease Trap pit was flooded to the floor level and it looked like a swimming pool.

</div>  According to Mr Ahmad, the grease in the Grease Trap had accumulated over time due to lack of maintenance.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The plaintiff alleged that as of 14 May 2014 when the plaintiff held a council meeting, the defendant had still not obtained any quotations for the repair of the Grease Trap. It was only when council members told him to do so (according to the plaintiff), that Mr Ahmad started looking for quotations to repair the Grease Trap. Mr Ahmad had told the council members he was using an in-house pump to suck out the water and it was only after the water level had gone down that a contractor could have access to the Grease Trap.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Eventually, on 27 May 2014, the defendant submitted two quotations to the plaintiff to repair the Grease Trap. On 24 June 2014, Mr Ahmad sent to council members of the Plaintiff a summary of quotations for the repair of the Grease Trap. The lowest quotation submitted was that from Red Power Engineering Pte Ltd (“Red Power”) in the sum of $4,601.00.

The Plaintiff’s then-chairman J Manickam (“Mr Manickam”) replied to say he had no objections. However, Red Power’s quotation was only to provide a temporary solution as its quoted services were to supply a temporary submersible sump pump to pump out excessive water in the ejector pit and provide labour to clean the tank. Red Power’s quotation did not include determining the cause of the Grease Trap’s malfunctioning or how to rectify the problem.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In July 2014, after it had taken over management of the Building from the defendant, Vinco engaged Goodwill Plumbing &amp; Sanitary Enterprise (“Goodwill”) to flush out the flooded Grease Trap. Goodwill discovered that the Grease Trap installation had been disconnected resulting in regular blockage and the entire system namely, the ejector pumps, the sump pumps and the grease tanks, were not in working condition. As an interim measure, Goodwill used two sump pumps to drain out the grease via the manhole on the ground level. Vinco reported Goodwill’s findings to the plaintiff at its council meeting on 7 August 2014. Goodwill’s findings were contained in its report dated 26 August 2014

In cross-examination, Mr Bala sought to disprove the plaintiff’s allegations of negligence against the defendant as seen in the following paragraphs.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Mr Bala referred to an email from Mr Ahmad to the MC members dated 4 February 2014 where Mr Ahmad reported that the grease tank and sump pump chokage problem in December 2013 had been rectified by his calling upon JOL who carried out desilting, flushing and washing out of the pit with a high pressure water jet. Mr Ahmad had also reported that he found one of the injector pumps out of order and some pipe breakages due to wear and tear. Mr Ahmad concluded his message by stating that to avoid a repeat of the chokage incident, the plaintiff must carry out monthly desilting of the grease tank, as required by the National Environment Agency (“NEA”).

There was no reason for them to check whether the grease tank was working or not. His position was that the pervasive foul smell had been ongoing since before December 2013 and whenever Mr Ahmad was queried on the same, he would brush off MC members with the remark “it’s from the grease tank issue”.

However, the ejector tank was filled to the brim by grease deposits which had hardened into a “caked” condition.

</div> He explained that the entire grease system had been submerged in water for a significant period of time. There was no telling what damage had been done to the electrical components in the grease system by water. Machinery for the system was obsolete and the plaintiff could not find a like-for-like replacement. Even if replacement parts could be found, they were not of the same quality. Moreover, if the repaired system failed (bearing in mind Goodwill gave no warranty after repair whilst Everrise’s warranty was only for six months), he and his fellow council members would find it hard to explain to the subsidiary proprietors of JFH the reason. The subsidiary proprietors expected the MC to run the estate in the best or optimum condition. There was no guarantee that repairs would resolve the problem of the malfunctioning of the grease tank. Mr Ow Yong added that as a reflection of the careful deliberations made by the MC in going through so many quotations and brainstorming sessions, the plaintiff took four years to decide on the replacement system of the grease trap system.

</div> that when the latter was called to clear chokage, JOL found that the cause was a door hinge stuck in a pipe’s elbow joint. As a result (presumably on the advice of the plaintiff’s consultants RL (see above at [19])), when the plaintiff installed a new grease trap system in May 2018, it decided to install strainers and grilles in each of the 138 units in JFH to minimise the risk of blockages. This evidence led Mr Bala to suggest to Mr Ow Yong that had strainers and grilles been installed from the outset of construction of JFH, it would have helped the situation.

He claimed he had obtained quotations for desilting. The court pointed out that desilting work was already being done by an existing contractor JOL, so why was there a need for quotations for desilting work? Mr Ahmad’s answer (which was both untrue and absurd) was that JOL desilted the grease but not the water. Questioned by the court whether there was a difference between desilting for grease and water, Mr Ahmad confirmed there was.

</div> –  he was an untruthful witness who lied repeatedly and when he was caught lying, he had no compunctions in lying even more, entangling himself in his web of untruths. The court places little weight on Mr Ahmad’s testimony as it was riddled with untruths and contradictions.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The court entertains little doubt that Mr Ahmad was an incompetent building manager and/or derelict in his duties. His inordinate delay in obtaining quotations for the MC to stop the flooding and carry out necessary repairs after 30 April 2014 is telling. He was also slow to report previous blockage incidents, such as the one on 24 December 2013. Ahmad paid lip service to his duties as the Defendant’s onsite representative. His claim that he made 6-weekly inspections of the Grease Trap installation as envisaged under item A(a) of the First Schedule to the Management Contract is not believable. It is telling that whenever the MC members inquired as to the foul smell, he brushed them off with his explanation that it was a grease tank issue. Unfortunately, the MC being none the wiser, seemed to have accepted his explanation until 30 April 2014. The court does not accept that the presence of any grease trap installation is synonymous with foul odours. Otherwise, every such system in Singapore would emit foul smells.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Unfortunately, the defendant did not have any other employee who had oversight of Mr Ahmad as the other onsite representative of the defendant was a technician who was his subordinate. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(a) Was there a duty on the part of the defendant to maintain the Grease Trap?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The defendant undoubtedly had a contractual duty under clause 7 of the Management Contract to maintain the Grease Trap installation. However, it would be unreasonable to expect the defendant to discharge this obligation <span class="font-italic">personally.</span> As Mr Koh testified (see above at [74]),  it was the responsibility of the defendant to engage competent specialist contractors to carry out maintenance of the fixtures at JFH, not that the defendant should do those works itself. It was not wrong of the defendant to engage the services of JOL in this regard. It bears noting that JOL was a contractor “inherited” from the Developer by the plaintiff. It was neither chosen by the plaintiff nor the defendant.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(b) Did the defendant owe any implied duties to the plaintiff over and above those spelt out in the Management Contract?  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The court does not think implied duties should apply in this case where there are express contractual provisions and there are no gaps or lacuna in the Management Contract to be filled in order to give the contract business efficacy (per Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">CAA Technologies Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Newcon Builders Pte Ltd</span> [2017] 2 SLR 940 at [66] and <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 4 SLR 193 at [101]). Hence the court answers this question in the negative.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(c) Did the defendant disconnect the Grease Trap as the plaintiff alleged?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The evidence suggests that the defendant could not have disconnected the Grease Trap installation. As the defendant’s closing submissions pointed out, there was no mention in any of JOL’s service reports in April 2014 that the System had been disconnected

Mr Ow Yong had agreed under cross-examination that Vinco could have disconnected the System, and so could Goodwill if it obtained access to the System using the key held by the managing agent.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The neatness of the disconnection (according to the reports of CCBS and Chong) strongly suggests that the disconnection was done deliberately by people who knew exactly what they were doing. By process of elimination, the disconnection could only have been done by a contractor who was familiar with the System with the knowledge and acquiescence of Vinco, who gave access to the room with the key that it held. Ulterior motives may have prompted such conduct. The contractor in question probably hoped to procure the contract to replace the existing system while Vinco may have been prompted by the same motive or even malice (as it fell out with the plaintiff). Unfortunately, the court’s conclusions are purely speculative as there is no evidence to support either surmise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Mr Chong’s report had concluded that disconnection took place between 6 August 2014 and January 2015 as connection works were not included in the quotations submitted by Everrise and Goodwill (see above at [85(e)]).

Based on the evidence adduced, the court does not disagree with Mr Chong’s conclusion.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 At this juncture, the court would make an observation. After Goodwill and/or Vinco discovered the disconnection of the grease trap installation in July 2014, the quotations received from contractors increased dramatically. Under the watch of Vinco’s successor Corporate Vision, quotations that the plaintiff received from various contractors between January and September 2015 to dismantle and replace the existing grease trap system with a new one ranged from $130,000 to $267,400. Eventually, the plaintiff incurred $241,796.00 for the replacement. Had <span class="font-italic">permanent </span>(as opposed to <span class="font-italic">temporary</span>) repairs been carried out to the existing system immediately or soon after 30 April 2014, the costs involved would have been considerably less. The court’s observation is based on comparing the prices of replacement of the entire System with repair quotations from Everrise ($34,500),

Causation must be proved as a matter of fact and in law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The court finds that it is more likely than not that the flooding incident could have resulted from a combination of unfortunate factors. First, as found by Mr Chong (see above at [86]),  the Grease Trap was undersized in capacity and could not cope with the volume of grease output from the 128 units in the Building. Second, the desilting maintenance was not done often enough but only when there was blockage/chokage–it was corrective and not preventive maintenance that was practised. Third, the defendant/Mr Ahmad failed to carry out any 6-weekly inspections of the installation to ensure that the System was working properly. The pervasive foul smell raised by the MC should have alerted Mr Ahmad that the System (which he failed to check) was not working efficiently. Consequently, it was a combination of factors that may have caused the flooding incident. The court cannot determine on the evidence whether one or two or all three factors caused the flooding incident. It must be borne in mind that the burden is on the plaintiff to prove its claim against the defendant. Notwithstanding the court’s finding that Mr Ahmad was derelict in his duties as the defendant’s on-site representative, it is not for the defendant to <span class="font-italic">disprove </span>that Mr Ahmad’s dereliction was the cause of the flooding incident on 30 April 2014. The plaintiff has to <span class="font-italic">prove </span>that his negligence was the <span class="font-italic">cause </span>of the flooding incident and the <span class="font-italic">resultant loss/damage</span> that it suffered.

Indeed, the court fully sympathises with the unenviable position the MC found itself in after 30 April 2014. There was a fear, not unfounded, by the MC that repair of a system that choked frequently and had been submerged in water may not be feasible or enable the system to continue operating permanently again. However, it also bears noting that Goal Link’s report (see above at [44])
