</div> The appellant’s primary defence was that the fire started on the respondent’s premises. And on that basis, the appellant brought a counterclaim against the respondent for the damages caused to its premises by the fire. The appellant’s defence and counterclaim were specifically rejected by the High Court judge (“the Judge”) in <span class="font-italic">Te</span><span class="font-italic"> Deum Engineering Pte Ltd v Grace Electrical Engineering Pte Ltd </span>[2016] SGHC 232 who found at [88]–[89] that the fire had instead started on the appellant’s premises and spread to the respondent’s premises. The Judge relied on the evidential rule of <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur</span> and found the appellant liable in negligence for causing the damage to the respondent’s premises. The appellant sought to deny the application of the rule <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the respondent’s claim on the basis that the appellant’s premises were not under its exclusive control. Although this was pleaded, it was not seriously pursued below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 For the appeal, the appellant instructed new counsel, Mr Tay Yong Seng, who adopts an entirely different approach to challenge the decision below. Significantly, Mr Tay quite sensibly accepts that the fire had indeed started on the appellant’s premises.

</div>
</div> (more than three years after the fire) to allege that the fire had instead started on the respondent’s premises. In abandoning its primary defence below, the appellant had essentially backtracked to its initial position with respect to the genesis of the fire. The appellant’s fresh challenge focuses on one principal submission – that the rule of <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur</span> was wrongly invoked by the Judge. Interestingly, the appellant had itself sought to rely on the rule against the respondent in support of its counterclaim below that the fire had started on the respondent’s premises. The appellant’s argument below that the rule does not apply <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the appellant because the premises were not under its exclusive control at the time of the fire has also since been abandoned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The appellant argues on appeal that the rule does not apply because the expert reports before the court identified possible causes of the fire and, given this evidence, it must follow that the cause of the fire was not unknown and/or did not preclude the possibility of a non-negligent cause. What is unique about this case is that in the court below, both parties in their respective reliance on <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur</span> accepted that the rule was applicable to the occurrence of the fire. The dispute was therefore only on the question of whether the rule should be invoked against the appellant <span class="font-italic">or</span> the respondent. On appeal, however, the appellant seeks to avoid the application of the rule altogether. Its position on appeal is not free from difficulty not least because in the court below, the appellant actually <span class="font-italic">denied</span> the very same possible causes which it now seeks to rely on in aid thereof.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 It is thus immediately apparent that the appellant’s case on appeal is not only entirely new but indeed a <span class="font-italic">volte</span><span class="font-italic">-face</span> from the defence which it ran below. What then is the impact of the appellant’s change of position for the purposes of the appeal? The appellant, having run its defence below on the basis that the fire started on the respondent’s premises, simply could not and in fact did not lead <span class="font-italic">any </span>evidence on how the fire started on its own premises and how, in respect of that cause, it had exercised the requisite care and control. In fact, the appellant specifically pleaded in the alternative that the cause of the fire was <span class="font-italic">unknown</span>, which is one of the essential requirements for the application of the rule. In response to these evidential shortcomings, the appellant’s case on appeal is that the court should nonetheless take cognisance of the possible causes identified in the expert reports which in themselves would render the maxim inapplicable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 <span class="font-italic">Res ipsa loquitur </span>has variously been described as a “rule of evidence”, “an evidential principle of common sense” and “an exotic although convenient phrase” to permit the court to infer negligence from the very nature of the accident or injury in the absence of direct evidence on its cause. These descriptive terms are entirely in sync with its translation into English from the original Latin that “the thing speaks for itself”. Despite the simplicity seemingly inherent in the maxim, not infrequently, the thing does not really speak for itself. This may explain why it has also been described as “the source of much misunderstanding and confusion in the tort of negligence” (see Francis Trindade and Tan Keng Feng, “<span class="font-italic">Res </span><span class="font-italic">Ipsa Loquitur</span>: Some Recent Cases in Singapore and its Future” [2000] SJLS 186 (“<span class="font-italic">Trindade</span><span class="font-italic"> and Tan</span>”) at p 188). Does it cease to speak for itself because there is a possibility of some hypothetical competing cause? Must that hypothetical cause be of a non-negligent nature in order to displace the inference of negligence? Who has the burden to prove or disprove the competing causes and on what standard? These are some of the core questions which will be examined in this judgment.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Material background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Te Deum Engineering Pte Ltd, which is the respondent on appeal and the plaintiff below, was at all material times the lessee and occupier of the unit at 143 Kallang Way (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the respondent’s premises).

</div> It is undeniable that the appellant had permitted its premises to be used as accommodation for workers in contravention of the FSA. These breaches were not irrelevant to the issue of the appellant’s negligence. After all, the appellant was charged under s 30(1) of the FSA for causing its existing fire safety measures to become inadequate. These fire safety measures, as defined under s 2 of the FSA, include measures for “preventing or limiting a fire”. The inadequacies of the appellant’s fire safety measures would therefore have contributed to the spread of the fire to the respondent’s premises.

In its Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 1), the appellant pleaded that “[n]one of the 3 investigations” that were conducted by the SCDF, Burgoyne, and Approved, “could identify the actual cause of the fire and all of them differed materially in their findings on the probable area of origin of fire and the probable cause of fire”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 There is, strictly speaking, no legal impediment for the appellant to raise these points on appeal even if it did not plead any of the competing causes of the fire. The mere fact that a party raises a new point that contradicts its pleaded case does not invariably lead to the denial of leave to raise the new point on appeal. In <span class="font-italic">Feoso</span>, leave was denied not merely because the new point raised contradicted its pleaded case but, more importantly, because further findings and evidence might well have been made, given, or raised had the arguments been raised below. In the result, the court was “deprived of any findings and reasoning of the [court below] on the [new] point”. The court relied on the observations of Lord Birkenhead LC in <span class="font-italic">North Staffordshire Railway Company v Edge </span>[1920] AC 254 at 263 to 264:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The efficiency and the authority of a Court of Appeal … are increased and strengthened by the opinions of learned judges who have considered these matters below. To acquiesce in such an attempt as the appellants have made in this case is in effect to undertake decisions which may be of the highest importance without having received any assistance at all from the judges in the Courts below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The present case is quite different. First, the new arguments do not require any amendments to the pleadings. Second, the appellant is relying on the expert reports already before the court to make good the new arguments. Hence, there is no question of adducing fresh evidence. Finally, it is notable that the Judge carefully considered the other possible causes of fire that were raised by the expert reports in relation to the application of <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur </span>(see the Judgment at [105]–[115]). In any case, it is the respondent and not the appellant who bears the burden of establishing the requirements of <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur </span>such that the appellant can <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>be found negligent. The respondent will only succeed in doing so if it is able, “[o]n the assumption that a submission of no case is then made”, show that on the evidence, in the ordinary course of things, the accident was “more likely than not” caused by the appellant’s negligence (see <span class="font-italic">Lloyde</span><span class="font-italic"> v West Midlands Gas Board </span>[1971] 1 WLR 749 (“<span class="font-italic">Lloyde</span>”) at 755–756). In this appeal, the appellant is relying on the same expert reports to rebut the inference of negligence. The fact that the appellant had renounced the expert reports in the court below does not alter whatever probative value these reports might otherwise have on the issue of the appellant’s alleged negligence. The appellant should be entitled to rely on all the evidence already before the court to seek to displace the application of the rule, if possible. It is then for the court to make findings on that evidence and determine the weight that should be assigned to it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 That having been said, the appellant has to contend with the fact <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">the</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> expert reports' conclusions on the </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">cause</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> of the fire </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">were not subject to cross-examination as its focus below was on challenging the conclusions in the reports that the fire started on the </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">appellant’s</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">(as opposed to the respondent’s) premises</span>.

</div> Both these observations obviously reflect the appellant’s own assessment of the weight that ought to be attributed to the expert reports. However, whether the appellant can ultimately rely on the expert reports to successfully rebut the presumption or to displace the application of <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur </span>is separate and distinct from the question whether it can raise the new arguments on appeal. In our view, the fact that the appellant had renounced the expert reports below does not disentitle it from raising the new arguments in reliance on the expert reports. We emphasise, however, that whether a party is granted leave under O 57 r 9A(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC to introduce on appeal new points not taken in the court below – in particular, points that represent a substantial departure from the position taken below by that party – will be the subject of careful consideration in each case, having due regard to factors including (a) the nature of the parties’ arguments below; (b) whether the court had considered and provided any findings and reasoning in relation to the new point; (c) whether further submissions, evidence, or findings would have been necessitated had the new points been raised below; and (d) any prejudice that might result to the counterparty in the appeal if leave were to be granted. On the facts of the present case, we are satisfied for the foregoing reasons that leave should be granted to the appellant to raise the new arguments before us.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Res ipsa loquitur</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 It is perhaps apposite to begin by examining the principles governing the application of <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur</span>. It is undisputed that at law, the legal burden is on the plaintiff to prove on the balance of probabilities that the defendant was negligent in order for the plaintiff to succeed in the action. <span class="font-italic">Res</span><span class="font-italic"> ipsa loquitur</span> is a rule of evidence that enables a plaintiff to establish a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of negligence in the event that there is insufficient direct evidence to establish the cause of the accident in a situation where the accident would not have occurred in the ordinary course of things had proper care been exercised, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, absent any negligence. The three requirements for the application of <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur</span> are identified in the seminal case of <span class="font-italic">Scott</span> (see also <span class="font-italic">Tesa</span><span class="font-italic"> Tape Asia Pacific Pte Ltd v Wing Seng Logistics Pte Ltd </span>[2006] 3 SLR(R) 116 (“<span class="font-italic">Tesa</span><span class="font-italic"> Tape</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [21]; <span class="font-italic">Teng</span><span class="font-italic"> Ah Kow</span> at [23]):<span class="font-italic"> </span> </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the defendant must have been in control of the situation or thing which resulted in the accident (“the first requirement”);</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the accident would not have happened, in the ordinary course of things, if proper care had been taken (“the second requirement”); and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) the cause of the accident must be unknown (“the third requirement”).</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Once the three requirements are satisfied, the evidential burden shifts to the defendant to rebut the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of negligence (see <span class="font-italic">Teng</span><span class="font-italic"> Ah Kow </span>at [22]). For this appeal, only the second and third requirements are in dispute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 <span class="font-italic">Res ipsa loquitur</span> has been applied in different settings. As the present case concerns losses arising from a fire, it is fitting to examine its application in the specific context of fire outbreaks where the <span class="font-italic">precise</span> cause of the fire is <span class="font-italic">unknown</span>. In this context, it must be borne in mind that the mere occurrence of a fire does not in itself give rise to the inference of negligence (see <span class="font-italic">Wayfoong</span><span class="font-italic"> Credit Limited and others v Tsui Siu Man t/a Wilson Plastics Manufactory </span>[1984] HKCA 205 (“<span class="font-italic">Wayfoong</span>”) at [59]; <span class="font-italic">Sochacki</span><span class="font-italic"> v Sas and another </span>[1947] 1 All ER 344 at 345, which is cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">aquette v Labelle</span> (1981) 33 O.R. (2d) 425 (“<span class="font-italic">Paquette</span>”)). This is not controversial because fires may occur without negligence on anybody’s part. This does not cease to be a fact merely because the particular premises and operations carried on therein are under the exclusive control of the defendant or a person for whom he is responsible (see <span class="font-italic">Flannigan v British Dyewood Company Limited</span> [1970] SLT 285 at 289). In every case, the court must necessarily examine the circumstances under which the fire started in order to determine whether the <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur</span> rule is applicable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Examining cases involving fire outbreaks</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 We believe it will be useful to analyse prior cases involving fire outbreaks so as to discern the reasons why, and the circumstances under which, the <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur</span> rule may or may not be found to be applicable. A consideration of the cases will assist us to identify a set of principles that can then be applied to the present case to determine if the rule is applicable on the facts of the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 We begin with the cases where the rule was found to be <span class="font-italic">in</span><span class="font-italic">applicable</span>. One of the key cases that the appellant relied upon was <span class="font-italic">Wayfoong</span>. In that case, the cause of a fire that broke out on the 8th floor of an industrial building was unknown. The Hong Kong Court of Appeal held that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur</span>. The court found that in all likelihood the 8th floor had been left untouched for some three hours before the fire. No heaters had been left on and there was nothing liable to spontaneous combustion in the premises. When the fire actually started, how it actually started, how long it smouldered before it really took hold, and how easily it might have been detected during that period, were all matters of pure speculation. There was no evidence as to who might have been in the premises, as to whether there was an electrical storm, electrical fault, or a defective switch, or as to whether there was a third party in the premises. The court also identified several ways by which an electrical fault could have occurred. In the light of all the circumstances, the court did not apply the rule as it found that the evidence could not be regarded as anything other than “equivocal” (<span class="font-italic">Wayfoong</span> at [16]). <span class="font-italic">Wayfoong</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>is an example of a case where there is an absence of evidence to indicate<span class="font-italic"> any</span> breach or negligence on the part of the defendant. In such a situation, <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur</span> does not apply at all. The evidential burden does not shift to the defendant to rebut the inference of negligence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In <span class="font-italic">Wayfoong</span>, the plaintiff pleaded that the defendant was negligent in that it kept stocks of plastic materials and dolls on its premises and did not employ a night watchman. This allegation was directed only at the <span class="font-italic">spread</span> of the fire. As such, there was no pleaded allegation against the plaintiff as regards the <span class="font-italic">cause </span>of the fire. The trial judge rejected the suggested breach of statutory duty in failing to employ a night watchman but found that the defendant was negligent in keeping four tons of plastic dolls in the premises because once ignited, “[the fire] was not easy to extinguish”. Hence, the finding of negligence by the trial judge was not in relation to the cause of the fire, only its spread. For completeness, we should add that this finding of negligence in connection with the spread of fire was, in any event, overturned by the Hong Kong Court of Appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Paquette</span>, a fire of unknown origin broke out in the defendant’s automobile body repair and painting shop and spread to the plaintiff’s premises. The Ontario Court of Appeal held that the rule did not apply because there was no evidence to show <span class="font-italic">any</span> negligence on the part of the defendant or his servants.

The respondent was an electrician who performed all the electrical work associated with the fish farm. The plaintiff’s expert identified 10 possible causes of the fire, including damage by rodents, ageing of insulation, and electrical failure due to a loose connection (a negligent cause). Although the expert ruled out some of the 10 possible causes of the fire, the court concluded that this was a case where it was “simply not possible to identify any one as being more likely than another” (see <span class="font-italic">Blue and White Barra</span> at [67]). The evidence “fell short of identifying a cause attributable to fault on the part of the [defendant] which was more likely than other possible causes, at least one of which would not have involved fault on his part” (see <span class="font-italic">Blue and White Barra</span> at [78]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 From the above cases, we observe that the courts have generally declined to apply <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur</span> in situations where there is simply <span class="font-italic">no</span> evidence of <span class="font-italic">any</span> act or omission (including any breach of statutory duty) by the defendant that <span class="font-italic">could</span> have caused the fire. In addressing the second requirement (see [39(b)] above), the court must necessarily examine whether there was <span class="font-italic">any</span> act or omission on the part of the defendant that could have caused the fire. Absent that, the rule simply does not apply. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 We now turn to examine the cases where the rule was applied. We begin with <span class="font-italic">Teng</span><span class="font-italic"> Ah Kow</span>. In that case, the plaintiffs were cooks employed by the defendants who owned the restaurant where the plaintiffs worked. The plaintiffs suffered burns when they turned on a gas powered stove to cook and an explosion and fire occurred. This court held that the circumstances were sufficient for <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur</span> to apply. It was admitted that the cap on one of the three gas cylinders was faulty. The court held that it was not for the plaintiffs to explain why the explosion and the fire occurred and to specifically identify which cylinder was turned on by one of the cooks; they were entitled to expect the defendant employers to provide them with safe equipment to do their work and/or a safe system of work. Two other possibilities were canvassed, including the tampering of the gas cylinder (which was suggested by the expert) and the intrusion by a third party into the premises. However, the court found that there was insufficient evidence to find that either of these possibilities was the cause of the fire. They were “no more than a possibility”.

This would cause his negligence (as a cause of the fire) to shift into the “realm of probabilities” (see <span class="font-italic">Sisters of Charity</span>; referred to above at [49]). In order to raise a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>inference of negligence, the plaintiff must “at the close of [its] case” and “[o]n the assumption that a submission of no case is then made”, show that on the evidence, in the ordinary course of things, the accident was “more likely than not” caused by the defendant’s negligence (see <span class="font-italic">Lloyde</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>referred to above at [37]).

The convictions present the clearest objective evidence that the appellant had, by its conduct, <span class="font-italic">increased the risk</span> of fire on its premises.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In that case, a fire broke out in the premises of the second defendant, who was a tenant in an industrial building owned by the first defendant. The fire spread to the premises of the first plaintiff, which was likewise a tenant within the same building. The first plaintiff commenced an action for damages for the losses it suffered. The defendants contended that the first plaintiff’s losses could not be recovered because the first plaintiff had used its premises in breach of the Factories Act (Cap 104, 1998 Rev Ed) (“Factories Act”). It was not disputed that the first plaintiff had indeed breached the Factories Act as it was operating a factory on the premises without a factory licence. However, the High Court held that nothing in that breach could give the first defendant a cause of action or a defence (see <span class="font-italic">Virco</span> at [20]). The appellant relies on this case to illustrate that its breaches of the FSA are analytically distinct from the question of whether it had breached its duty of care to the respondent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 We find that <span class="font-italic">Virco</span> does not remotely assist the appellant. In <span class="font-italic">Virco</span>, the High Court found that the first defendant could not rely on the first plaintiff’s breach of the Factories Act as a defence because the property loss suffered by the first plaintiff from the fire, had nothing to do with the object of the Factories Act, which was the protection of workmen (see <span class="font-italic">Virco</span> at [21]–[22]). Unlike the present case, there was no suggestion in <span class="font-italic">Virco</span> that the first plaintiff’s unlicensed use was in breach of the FSA (as opposed to the Factories Act) or had in any way compromised its safety standards. Furthermore, there was no link whatsoever between the breach of the Factories Act with the fire. There was also no suggestion that the breach had increased the risk of fire on the premises. Liability would only arise if it could be established that Parliament intended breach of the relevant statutory duty to be actionable by the individual harmed by that breach (see <span class="font-italic">Virco</span> at [20]). However, it was not Parliament’s intention to allow the first defendant to rely on a technical breach of the Factories Act to bar recovery of the losses suffered by the first plaintiff arising from a fire for which the first defendant was responsible. In the present case, quite unlike <span class="font-italic">Virco</span>, the appellant’s contraventions of the FSA <span class="font-italic">had</span><span class="font-italic"> in fact</span> <span class="font-italic">increased the risk of fire </span>occurring on its premises. The legislative object of the FSA is to “prescribe minimum fire safety standards”, to “ensure that these are implemented, complied with and effectively enforced” for the “protect[ion] [of] lives <span class="font-italic">and property</span>” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (10 November 1993) vol 61 at cols 940 to 941). The respondent’s premises would constitute “property” which the FSA was designed to protect. In <span class="font-italic">Virco</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [22], the High Court held that “[t]he loss which is the subject of the present action has nothing to do with the object of the Factories Act”. The present case calls for exactly the opposite conclusion. Loss such as that which resulted from the fire that occurred on the appellant’s premises on that fateful night in September 2012 was <span class="font-italic">precisely </span>that which was sought to be prevented by the FSA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In any case, <span class="font-italic">Virco</span> only goes so far as to establish that breach of a statutory duty does not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> give rise to a concomitant breach of a common law duty of care. This principle is well-settled (see <span class="font-italic">Animal Concerns </span>at [21]; <span class="font-italic">Jurong</span><span class="font-italic"> Primewide Pte Ltd v Moh Seng Cranes Pte Ltd and others</span> [2014] 2 SLR 360 (“<span class="font-italic">Jurong</span><span class="font-italic"> Primewide</span>”) at [37]). However, it is equally well-established that the existence and scope of a statutory duty may “form the backdrop to and inform the existence (or lack thereof) of a common law duty of care” (see <span class="font-italic">Animal Concerns </span>at [22]). Further, in <span class="font-italic">Jurong</span><span class="font-italic"> Primewide</span>, this court held at [36] and [43] that the prevailing regulatory framework in that case (<span class="font-italic">i</span><span class="font-italic">e</span>, the Workplace Health and Safety Act (Cap 354A, 2009 Rev Ed) (“Workplace Health and Safety Act”) and its relevant regulations) had “a significant bearing on [the court’s] analysis of the parties’ conduct, their legal responsibilities and the imputation of negligence” and that the “stipulations under the [Workplace Health and Safety Act] would … be relevant in pitching the standard of care”. Likewise, in the present case, the FSA would be relevant in informing the court of the standard of care expected of the appellant. Breaches of the FSA would then provide the backdrop for our assessment (see [51]–[53] above) as to whether the circumstances under which the fire occurred justified an inference of negligence on the appellant’s part. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The appellant asserts that none of the offences under the FSA that it had committed has any bearing on the question of whether <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur</span> should be applied, because its commission of those offences did not increase the risk of a fire outbreak on its premises.

</div>
</div> Implicit in the appellant’s submission is that if its conduct amounting to offences under the FSA <span class="font-italic">had</span><span class="font-italic"> indeed</span> increased the risk of fire, then its convictions for those offences would be relevant to the court’s decision on whether to draw an inference of negligence. The appellant argues that its breaches of s 30(1) of the FSA are irrelevant to the outbreak of the fire because even if it had complied with s 30(1) to request for the Commissioner’s approval to use the premises as a workers’ dormitory, “the only relevant change which the [a]ppellant would have had to make on [its premises] would be the installation of additional means of escape for the occupants”.

</div>
</div> In our view, such an argument is entirely speculative because s 30(3) of the FSA gives the Commissioner the discretion to “grant permission for the change of use, subject to such conditions as he may impose”. The court is simply not in a position to speak on the nature of the terms the Commissioner might or would have imposed on the appellant after reviewing the physical condition of the appellant’s premises if the appellant had applied for the requisite permission. This would amount to nothing more than speculation on the court’s part and we decline to do so. More crucially, the fact that the Commissioner’s approval was not sought also meant that there was no occasion for the Commissioner to even <span class="font-italic">consider</span> the conditions that he might have imposed. It follows that the Commissioner would have no reason to inspect the appellant’s premises to ensure that the fire safety measures were adequate for the use of its premises for resting and cooking. The possibility that the Commissioner might simply have rejected the appellant’s application for conversion of the premises for use as workers’ accommodation altogether cannot be ruled out either. This was in fact conceded by the appellant’s Project Director, Mr Teo Boon Len, under cross-examination when he testified that the Ministry of Manpower and the appellant’s landlord, Jurong Town Corporation, would not have approved the use of the premises for accommodation.

While it may be unclear whether the specific breaches of s 24(1) of the FSA were <span class="font-italic">directly</span> causative of the fire, it cannot be disputed that the breaches led to the appellant’s unauthorised use of its premises as an accommodation area where the electrical appliances were located and, for the reasons discussed above at [52]–[53], increased the risk of fire occurring on the premises. The appellant’s breaches of the FSA form the backdrop to our finding that it had more likely than not breached its duty of care to the respondent because the breaches undeniably <span class="font-italic">increased the risk</span> of fire occurring on the appellant’s premises. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">When would the possibility of other causes preclude or displace the application of the rule?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 At the close of the hearing of the appeal, we invited the parties to file further submissions to address the question as to whether, in order to exclude the application of <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur</span>, it is incumbent on the defendant to prove that it had not been negligent in respect of at least one reasonable explanation of the cause of the damage suffered by the plaintiff. This pertains to the extent of the appellant’s burden in adducing evidence as to the cause of the fire before it can successfully displace the application of the rule. Our direction arose from the appellant’s new argument that the expert reports had allegedly identified some possible non-negligent explanations for the fire, and on this basis that the second requirement was not satisfied. In such a situation, the appellant claims, the thing ceases to speak for itself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 From our review of cases such as <span class="font-italic">Teng</span><span class="font-italic"> Ah Kow </span>at [48] and <span class="font-italic">Sisters Charity </span>at [49], it is clear that the mere presence of some evidence indicating other <span class="font-italic">possible</span> causes of the fire has never been sufficient to preclude the application of <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur</span>. The rule was applied in those cases notwithstanding the evidence of other possible causes. This in turn begs the question as to the circumstances in which other possible causes of the fire would preclude or displace the application of the rule. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The appellant’s new argument also raises several sub-issues. Who bears the burden of proving the other possible competing causes of the fire? And what is the standard of proof required to discharge that burden? Before addressing these questions, it is important to understand what is meant by “other possible competing causes” in the context of <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur</span>. From the cases, we think such causes fall into two categories. The first concerns “non-negligent causes” while the second concerns “neutral causes”, in the sense that the cause is consistent with both negligence and non-negligence of the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The appellant reiterates in its further submissions that the burden of proving a claim in negligence rests on the respondent throughout the proceedings and that <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur</span> does not change the position. We agree with Ms Chin that this submission obfuscates the distinction between the legal burden (which is always on the respondent) and the evidential burden which is shifted to the appellant once the respondent establishes a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of negligence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In its further written submissions, the appellant also states that it does not bear any burden to prove that the fire was started by a non-negligent cause in order to exclude the application of <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur</span>.

</div> This is, strictly speaking, correct because the respondent (or a plaintiff seeking to rely on the rule) will only succeed in demonstrating that the rule applies if it can, “[o]n the assumption that a submission of no case is then made”, show that on the evidence, in the ordinary course of things, the accident was “more likely than not” caused by the defendant’s negligence (see <span class="font-italic">Lloyde</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at 755–756; see above at [37]). In other words, the plaintiff may fail to even raise a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>inference of negligence. Nonetheless, the appellant is <span class="font-italic">at liberty</span> to prove a non-negligent cause (though he is not obliged to do so) if the evidence is available. The appellant asserts that it can displace the inference of negligence by referring to the evidence before the court to show that there was “at least one other plausible explanation consistent with reasonable care or which does not connote negligence”.

</div> In making this submission, the appellant accepts that in order to displace the inference, the appellant bears the burden of establishing two matters: (a) the existence of a plausible competing cause; and (b) that plausible competing cause is either (i) consistent with the existence of reasonable care on the part of the appellant or (ii) does not connote negligence on the part of the appellant. The appellant, however, adds that this submission is tantamount to showing “that the accident is as consistent with no negligence as with negligence”.

</div> In support, it cites <span class="font-italic">Trindade</span><span class="font-italic"> and Tan</span> at 201. It would appear that the authors of the article treated these two propositions as synonymous. In our judgment, the appellant’s submission is erroneous for two related reasons. First, because <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur</span> is merely a rule of evidence which enables the court in certain circumstances to arrive at an inference of negligence, the question before the court at all times remains whether on a balance of probabilities, it is satisfied that there is negligence. What this means is that it is <span class="font-italic">never</span> a matter of raising possibilities in order to exclude the application of the rule. The court must be satisfied at the close of the plaintiff’s case that the explanation that rests on the negligence of the defendant is that which is <span class="font-italic">more probable than no</span>t; and if the court is satisfied of that, the defendant can only overcome it by adducing evidence to show that there are other causes that are <span class="font-italic">more probable</span>. And in relation to this evidential burden on the part of the defendant, the second point we wish to make is that in order to displace the inference, it will not suffice for the defendant to establish a <span class="font-italic">neutral</span> event. <span class="font-italic">Trindade</span><span class="font-italic"> and Tan</span> in fact goes on to explain the utility of the rule “in flushing out some evidence from the defendant which he would rather not bring forward” and in helping “a plaintiff to resist a submission of no case to answer”. The significance of this second point is explained below at [69]–[71] when we deal with the evidence which was led (or, more accurately, not led) by the appellant in relation to the alleged electrical faults. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The subtle but vital distinction between the burden of establishing a competing cause which does not connote negligence and that of a neutral cause is borne out by the authorities. In <span class="font-italic">Barkway</span><span class="font-italic"> v South Wales Transport Co </span>[1948] 2 All ER 460 (“<span class="font-italic">Barkway</span>”) at 471, the English Court of Appeal made the following observations, which we find instructive:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) If the defendants’ omnibus leaves the road and falls down an embankment, and this without more is proved, then <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur</span>, there<span class="font-italic"> </span>is a presumption that the event is caused by negligence on the part of the defendants, and the plaintiff succeeds unless the defendants can rebut this presumption. (ii) <span class="font-italic">It is no rebuttal for the defendants to show, again without more, that the immediate cause of the omnibus leaving the road is a tyre-burst, since a tyre-burst per se is </span><span class="font-italic">a </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">neutral event</span><span class="font-italic"> consistent, and equally consistent, with negligence or due diligence on the part of the defendants.</span> When a balance has been tilted one way, you cannot redress it by adding an equal weight to each scale. The depressed scale will remain down…<span class="font-italic">To displace the presumption, the defendants must go further and prove (or it must emerge from the evidence as a whole) either (a) that the burst itself was due to a specific cause which </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">does not connote negligence on their part </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">but points to its absence as more probable,</span><span class="font-italic"> or (b), if they can point to no such specific cause, that they used all reasonable care in and about the management of their tyres</span>… [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 What the passage above shows is that once a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> inference of negligence arises, it is insufficient for the defendant, in its attempt to rebut the inference, to merely show that the accident was due to a neutral event. The defendant must go on to show either that (a) this neutral event does not connote negligence on its part (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the event was a non-negligent cause of the accident); or (b) it had exercised all reasonable care in relation to that event. In seeking to show a cause which does not connote negligence, the appellant must positively point to “its absence as more probable”.

</div> where the House of Lords held that the defence must put forward a “plausible explanation” (citing Lord Simonds in <span class="font-italic">Woods v Duncan </span>[1946] AC 401 at 441) and must go further to show that this explanation is “consistent with no negligence on [the defendant’s] part” (at 477–478). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 To appreciate this important distinction, it is crucial to bear in mind that the respondent’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur</span> is premised on the cause of the fire being <span class="font-italic">unknown</span>. Therefore, it stands to reason that in order for the appellant to rebut the inference of negligence in respect of a fire which occurred from an unknown cause in its premises, in circumstances where the appellant’s conduct constituting breaches of the FSA had increased the risk of fire, it has to establish a cause which is <span class="font-italic">more probably </span>due to non-negligence. If that is achieved by the appellant, the inference of negligence would then be successfully displaced but not otherwise. In contrast, in a situation where the evidence is equally consistent with negligence as with no negligence (which is premised on evidence to establish the absence of negligence in relation to the other plausible cause), then the rule simply would not apply and the plaintiff would fail at the first hurdle as it would have failed to satisfy the court that, in the ordinary course of things, the accident was <span class="font-italic">more likely than not</span> to have been caused by the defendant’s negligence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The appellant cites the decision of the High Court of Australia in <span class="font-italic">Schellenberg</span><span class="font-italic"> v Tunnel Holdings Ptv Ltd</span> (2000) 170 ALR 594 (“<span class="font-italic">Schellenberg</span>”) in aid of its proposition (see above at [64]). That case involved an allegation of negligence made after the plaintiff was struck in the face by a hose carrying compressed air, which became loose while he was using it in the course of his employment with the defendant. In our judgment, <span class="font-italic">Schellenberg</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>does not assist the appellant. First, the court found at [27] that <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur</span> did not apply because the cause of the accident was <span class="font-italic">known</span>. Accordingly, there was no question of displacing the rule. Second, the court found at [140]–[141] and [146] that there was evidence that the air hose could have been separated from its coupling for reasons that did not suggest negligence on the part of the defendant, such as a defect of the air hose or a sudden surge in air pressure. For that reason, the court held at [146] that “[t]here was no basis for concluding that the reasons which did not suggest negligence were any more or less probable causes of what happened than other reasons which did suggest negligence by the respondent”. Based on the evidence before the court, the accident was as consistent with no negligence as with negligence. The evidence in <span class="font-italic">Schellenberg</span> did not connote negligence on the part of the defendant, quite unlike the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In the present case, the appellant has not been able to identify a cause of the fire which is “consistent with reasonable care <span class="font-italic">or</span> which does not connote negligence” on its part. This is the relevant inquiry which arises from the appellant’s own further submission. In our view, the appellant fails on both scores. The appellant relies on the expert reports to argue that the “other possible competing cause” of the fire is “electrical”.

</div> Given the appellant’s position below, whether the fire was due to an electrical fault became a non-issue. More importantly, because the appellant had expressly denied that this was the cause of the fire at the trial, it had effectively forfeited the opportunity to establish through cross-examination of the experts that the electrical cause was <span class="font-italic">more probably </span>a non-negligent cause. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 It is also material that the expert reports merely identified the possibility of other <span class="font-italic">physical </span>causes of the fire without expressing any view as to whether or not there was any <span class="font-italic">negligence</span> with regard to those causes. This means that the identified possible causes in the reports do not in themselves preclude the possibility of negligence on the part of the appellant. In other words, the expert reports are incapable of providing true assistance to the appellant in showing that the electrical faults were, more probably than not, non–negligent events.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Further, the appellant also did not adduce sufficient evidence to show that it had exercised all reasonable care in relation to its electrical appliances and wirings. The appellant relies on the License in its attempt to show that it had exercised reasonable care (see [19] above). The appellant argues that in order to obtain the Licence, the appellant is required to employ a licensed electrical worker to take charge of and maintain its electrical systems.

</div> In our view, the proper inquiry ought to go beyond establishing the mere existence of the License. First, no evidence was led at the trial as to what checks were carried out for the purposes of the License or how regularly this took place. Second, it is unclear precisely which electrical appliance or wirings caused the fire, and whether those appliances and/or wirings had been checked by the electrical worker.

</div> [emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In our view, the appellant has misstated the third requirement for the rule. With respect, the appellant has taken the phrase “there must be no evidence” out of its context. The authors of <span class="font-italic">Clerk &amp; </span><span class="font-italic">Lindsell</span> explain the third requirement of <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur</span> in the following manner (at para 8–175): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Cause of occurrence unknown to claimant</span>. Res ipsa loquitur has no application when the cause of the occurrence is known. This is because there is then no need to do more than to decide whether on these facts negligence on the part of the defendant has been proved or not. … <span class="font-italic">Where the defendant does give evidence relating to the possible cause of the damage and the level of precaution taken, the court may still conclude that the evidence provides an insufficient explanation to displace the inference of negligence. </span>... [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In stating that “there must be no evidence as to why or how the occurrence took place”, the authors of <span class="font-italic">Clerk &amp; </span><span class="font-italic">Lindsell </span>meant to draw a distinction between cases where the cause of the accident is unknown and cases where the cause is known (for example, where the cause has been proved or otherwise established either by admission or common ground between the parties) and therefore the rule cannot apply. This makes sense because when a cause of the accident has been established, it ceases to speak for itself and the onus is then on the plaintiff to prove that the defendant was negligent in relation to <span class="font-italic">that </span>cause. In other words, the claim would have to be proved in the usual manner without invoking the <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>inference of negligence through the application of <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur</span>. Thus, contrary to Mr Tay’s submission, the presence of other “possible” causes does not <span class="font-italic">per se</span> mean that the third requirement of <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur</span> is not satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 This position is amply supported by the authorities. As mentioned above at [48], this court held in <span class="font-italic">Teng</span><span class="font-italic"> Ah Kow</span> that <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur</span> applied even though there was evidence from an expert that the gas cylinders could have been tampered with. Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Shimizu </span>at [8], the Singapore High Court accepted that the conclusion reached by a field incident report, namely that the fire was caused by cooking or over-heating of food in the defendant’s building, was “a possible inference to be drawn”. The court nonetheless held that “<span class="font-italic">on the balance of probabilities</span> [it] [could not] properly draw this inference” [emphasis added]. The court applied <span class="font-italic">r</span><span class="font-italic">es ipsa loquitur </span>because “on the evidence before [it] the true cause of the fire ha[d] not been established”; it had “not been established to [the court’s] satisfaction that a kerosene stove had been brought to the defendants’ building and was used in cooking or heating food and that the fire was caused by over-heating of food left unattended on the kerosene stove in the defendants’ building”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The distinction (mentioned above at [76]) is also borne out in cases where the cause of the accident is known. In <span class="font-italic">BNJ</span>, the plaintiff fell on to the tracks of an MRT station operated by first defendant and owned by second defendant. She was struck by a train and severely injured. CCTV footage, eyewitness and expert evidence supported the finding that the plaintiff fell on to the tracks because she suffered a sudden and unpredictable loss of consciousness. The court held that <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur</span> did not assist the plaintiff’s case because the circumstances leading to her injuries were clear. There was no evidential gap to fill. Where there is no such evidential gap, the rule has no relevance, even if it can be shown that the defendant was in control of the thing which inflicted the damage (see <span class="font-italic">BNJ</span> at [139]–[140]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Likewise, in <span class="font-italic">Tesa</span><span class="font-italic"> Tape</span>, the plaintiff and the defendant occupied adjoining premises. The defendant stacked several rows of containers side-by-side, creating a large mono-block of containers, which was the standard practice. During a heavy thunderstorm, some containers fell onto the plaintiff’s land and damaged the plaintiff’s property. The court found at [21]–[22] that negligence was established but <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur </span>did not apply as there was ample evidence as to causation. The court found that “although strong gales were infrequent, they occurred often enough to be expected”. It held at [16] that “in the absence of any other reasonable evidence, … <span class="font-italic">on a balance of probabilities</span>, the collapse of the stacks of containers was substantially, if not solely, caused by a sudden gust of strong wind during the thunderstorm that occurred at the material time” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In the present case, the evidence available to the Judge below and on appeal shows that the <span class="font-italic">precise</span> cause of the fire had not been established <span class="font-italic">on the balance of probabilities</span>. This was in fact the appellant’s pleaded position. It would be useful at this juncture to examine the purpose and the context behind the production of each of the expert reports in order to determine the probative value of their conclusions on the possible causes of the fire and the Judge’s application of <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loquitur</span> notwithstanding the contents of the reports. It appears to us that the purpose and the focus of the SCDF report was to identify whether the fire was accidental as opposed to deliberate (and not to determine the <span class="font-italic">precise</span> cause of the fire). The first page of the SCDF report requires the investigating officer to select one of two possible options, namely “accidental” or “incendiary”.

</div> Owing to the appellant’s conduct of its case during the trial, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the position taken below by the appellant that the fire had started in the respondent’s premises, it renounced the SCDF and the Burgoyne reports. Therefore, the possible causes of the fire identified by these reports were not seriously tested through cross-examination. The conclusions the reports arrived at are, at their highest, <span class="font-italic">mere possibilities</span>. Hence, unlike in cases such as <span class="font-italic">BNJ </span>and <span class="font-italic">Tesa</span><span class="font-italic"> Tape</span>, we are not satisfied that any particular cause can be established <span class="font-italic">on the balance of probabilities</span>.
