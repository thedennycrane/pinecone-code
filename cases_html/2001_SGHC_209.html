<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1. This is an appeal by the defendant against the assistant registrar

Mr. Kwek Mean Luck’s refusal to stay proceedings on the ground of <i>forum non

conveniens</i>. The plaintiff commenced this action against the defendant for unpaid fees.

The plaintiff is presently an advocate and solicitor in Singapore. The defendant is the

eldest son of the Sultan of Johor. According to his counsel Mr. Raj Singam, the defendant

is a businessman and investor by occupation.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2. The plaintiff’s simple and straightforward claim is, however,

embellished in 230 paragraphs of a lengthy statement of claim 90 pages long. His claim is

that the defendant engaged him as a "legal and negotiating consultant" on the

basis of "S$1,600 a day or S$500 an hour (where only a few hours of work was

involved)". There is also a claim for US$60,000 being fees related to two specific

agreements alleged to be agreed at US$30,000 per agreement, as well as costs of

disbursements and incidentals.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3. It is not in dispute that the plaintiff was engaged by the defendant

to advise and assist him in the defendant’s involvement in a large oil and gas

concession project in Indonesia, referred to loosely by the parties as the "Petrogas

Project". From the submission of his counsel, it appears (the defence has not been

filed) that the defendant is resisting the claim on two principal grounds. First, that the

plaintiff is not entitled by the proper law of the contract - which the defendant says is

Malaysian law – to recover because the plaintiff was effectively working as an

advocate and solicitor in Malaysia without the requisite practising certificate. Secondly,

the defendant says that the terms of the contract were not "expressly discussed"

and neither the scope of work nor the rate of remuneration were agreed upon. The defendant

says that the plaintiff was not employed by him but by one of the Indonesian parties.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4. The plaintiff says that he was employed by the defendant from March

1995 to July 1996. He conceded that he had not taken out a practising certificate to

practise law in Singapore between the two dates. He also did not have a practising

certificate to practise law in Malaysia at all material times. The defendant considers

this to be a significant fact because it supports his defence that the claim was

unenforceable under Malaysian law. The plaintiff does not agree that it is relevant. The

fees claimed by the plaintiff are set out in various bills prepared by him and given to

the defendant.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5. The defendant applied to stay the action under s 9 of the Supreme

Court of Judicature Act, Ch 322, on the ground that there is a multiplicity of proceedings

in that the same matter is being tried here and in Malaysia where the defendant had

instituted an action to declare that the plaintiff’s claim is unenforceable at law;

and secondly, on the ground that Singapore is not the appropriate forum for the

proceedings to be tried. The burden of proof in an application of this nature is on the

defendant once it is shown - and in this case it is not disputed - that this court has the

jurisdiction to try the action which has been properly instituted and served on the

defendant.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6. I shall first consider the point concerning a multiplicity of

proceedings. The most obvious cases of this sort are those in which a plaintiff commences

two or more actions against the same defendant based on the same or similar causes of

action in different jurisdictions. In such cases, it is often not difficult to see where

the hardship may lay, especially if the competing jurisdictions are far apart. There are

some cases where the plaintiff in one jurisdiction is sued by the defendant in another

jurisdiction over the same facts but on a cross-claim. In such cases, it may not be easy

to determine where the more appropriate jurisdiction is, especially when the two claims

are genuine disputes and commenced in the respective jurisdictions in good faith. In the

present case before me, the defendant’s action in Malaysia is not a cross claim. It

is a claim for declaratory orders which, if the suit in Singapore had not been brought,

would have been considered to be a defensive action brought in anticipation of a suit.

Such actions are not always regarded as necessary without good reasons otherwise. Hence,

in the absence of other factors, in a competition of claims, I would consider the action

by the plaintiff in Singapore to be the more substantive one and, objectively, if one of

the two actions has to be stayed it would be more reasonable for the defendant to stay his

action in Malaysia. However, in view of the other ground (<i>forum non conveniens</i>)

raised by him, it is now necessary for me to consider whether the Malaysian court is the

more appropriate forum to try the action.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7. The principles governing the application of <i>forum non conveniens</i>

summarized by Lord Goff in <i>The Spiliada</i> [1987] 1 AC 460, 476 begins with the

general enquiry as to whether there is a more appropriate forum for the trial of the

action. It is a reiteration of the words of Lord Diplock in the previous case of <i>The

Abidin Daver</i> [1984] AC 398, 411 in which he said: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"the plea can never be sustained unless the court is satisfied

  that there is some tribunal, having competent jurisdiction, in which the case may be tried

  more suitably for the interests of all the parties and for the ends of justice."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Mr. Singam submitted that in applying the principles set out in the <i>Abidin

Daver </i>and the <i>Spiliada</i>, principles accepted and adopted in the Court of Appeal

in <i>Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Bhavani Stores Pte Ltd </i><nobr>[1998] 1 SLR 253</nobr>, it will be obvious that the sum of connecting

factors mount in favour of the defendant. In summary, the factors in which he relies on in

his submission consist of the fact that the defendant is a Malaysian and resident there;

most of the witnesses are there; the documents are there; the agreement was concluded

there; it was also in Malaysia that the contract was performed; the plaintiff’s

office was there; the defendant’s assets are there; the applicable law is Malaysian

law; and the defendant has commenced proceedings in respect of the same issues in

Malaysia. Against this, counsel submitted, the only connection with Singapore is the fact

that the plaintiff is resident here and that the defendant has a current account with a

bank here. For the sake of completeness, counsel conceded that there were factors

connecting the contract to Indonesia. First, the companies involved in the Petrogas

Project are there; secondly, the project itself was an Indonesian project; and thirdly,

three of the witnesses reside there.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8. In finding the appropriate forum it will be necessary to take stock

and evaluate the list of connecting factors advanced by both sides; but ever mindful of

the spirit which encapsulates the words of Lord Diplock in the <i>Abidin Daver</i>: that

the appropriate forum is the one "which the case may be tried more suitably for the

interests of all the parties and for the ends of justice." By its very nature thus,

the factors in each case must be evaluated according to the circumstances of the case. The

determination of the appropriate forum is not an exercise carried out merely by adding the

sum total of all the relevant connecting factors. The court has to apportion a value to

each factor and consider its place in the overall picture. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9. The present case is a claim for payment of invoices for consultancy

work. The issues appear to be, at best, first, a dispute as to whether an employment

contract was in fact created, and if so, under what terms. In this regard, from the

affidavits filed, it appears that the main witnesses to this are the plaintiff and the

defendant themselves, and the possibility that one Datuk Hamzah’s evidence may be of

some marginal relevance. Mr. Singam recited passages from<i> Lehman Brothers Special

Financing Inc. v Haradi Angkosuboroto</i> <nobr>[1999] 2 SLR 427</nobr> and the <i>Oriental Insurance</i> case to

fortify his argument for home ground advantage for the witnesses. All these witnesses are

important in so far as the project was concerned and are relevant, therefore, in the

second issue namely, whether the plaintiff’s invoices are justified by the work he

had done. The third issue that follows, concerns a question of law, namely whether the

plaintiff’s claim is unenforceable under Malaysian law. This issue becomes relevant

only after it is determined that Malaysian law applies or that the place of performance

was Malaysia. The issue as to what is the applicable proper law is an issue to be

determined by the forum. Therefore, in that sense, it is an issue caught in an circuitous

puzzle. A contract can be lawfully made under the proper choice of law and yet be

unenforceable at the place of performance. Here we have a situation where the plaintiff

argues that the applicable law governing the contract of employment is Singapore law and

the defendant saying that it is Malaysian law. I see no reason why the Singapore court

cannot determine this issue. Whether the contract is unenforceable in Malaysia is a

separate issue. But it is not a difficult one. I think that it is fair to say that the

courts on either side of the Causeway will not have much difficulty understanding or

appreciating the law governing contract and the practice of advocates and solicitors of

each other’s jurisdiction. Given the physical closeness of the two countries, and the

similarity in respect of the two relevant areas of law in this case, the arguments by Mr.

Singam concerning the inconvenience of witnesses are not sufficiently persuasive. Mr.

Singam pointed out that the foreign law issue will be determined as an issue of fact and

therefore, in that sense, affects the defendant’s right of appeal. If the matter is

tried in Malaysia, the issue may be argued up to the highest Court of Appeal there as a

matter of law, but here it is constrained by it being classified as an issue of fact. I do

not think that this argument ought to be given much weight. Whether the plaintiff’s

contract with the defendant is enforceable under Malaysian law is a matter of inference

from the facts. Such matters are certainly justiciable before the Court of Appeal.

Furthermore, the fact that foreign law is involved is not sufficient reason in itself to

warrant a stay of proceedings, as is the case in respect of each connecting factor in

itself. Mr. Singam also submitted that the documents and records are voluminous and

inconvenient to bring to the Singapore courts. I see little evidence that supports that

argument. The plaintiff has the burden of producing the documents necessary to justify his

claim. He has not said that he has any difficulty with that. The defendant, on the other

hand, has not shown what the voluminous documents are that the plaintiff does not have

which will be relevant to the issue of the contract.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10. So, what we have is a case of a resident plaintiff suing a

non-resident defendant over an employment contract the terms of which are in dispute. The

witnesses are essentially the parties themselves, save for experts on Malaysian law –

should it become necessary to call them. In my view, the case that Malaysia is more

appropriate forum has not been adequately made out. In these circumstances, the applicant

must fail. When a claim has been properly made the court must discharge its

responsibilities that come with the jurisdiction and not lightly surrender its

jurisdiction. For the above reasons, this appeal must fail, but I ought to deal with two

additional matters before I conclude because they were raised here and below.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11. First, Mr. Singam referred me to a similar application by the

defendant in another suit in which the plaintiff was the abovesaid Datuk Hamzah. Mr.

Singam pointed out that the defendant there succeeded in obtaining a stay of proceedings

on the ground of <i>forum non conveniens</i>. There is little known about that case before

me as the plaintiff there has appealed to the Court of Appeal and counsel informs me that

the grounds of decision have not been delivered. Both agree, however, that in that case,

the plaintiff and defendant are residents of Malaysia and the suit concerned the Petrogas

Project in Indonesia. That alone may be a sufficient ground for staying the proceedings in

Singapore, but as the matter is on appeal I do not think that we need to dwell on it. As I

have said, each case must be determined on its own facts.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12. Finally, the assistant registrar is of the view that even if the

case has been made out that Malaysia is the more appropriate forum he would nonetheless

refuse the application for stay on the ground that the plaintiff will suffer a personal

and juridical disadvantage. This is because there are restrictions under Malaysian law

against a non-resident who intends on suing a ruler. There is a reasonable possibility

that the defendant may ascend the Sultan’s throne in Johor and when that happens, the

plaintiff may not be able to pursue his civil claim against him. Mr. Singam submits that

there is no evidence that this will happen as a matter of course or before the

plaintiff’s case can be heard. The assistant registrar based his opinion on the case

of <i>Faridah Begum bte Abdullah v Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah Al Mustain Billah Ibni Almarhum

Sultan Abu Bakar Ri’Ayatuddin Al Mu’Adzaam Shah</i> <nobr>[1996] 1 MLJ 617</nobr>. It is true that issues in civil proceedings

are decided on a balance of probabilities, but the central question here is not the

probability of the defendant ascending the throne, but whether it is probable that if he

should ascend the throne would the plaintiff, on a balance of probabilities, suffer a

juridical disadvantage? What the plaintiff expresses here is a personal fear of that

disadvantage. The question therefore, is whether that fear was reasonably apprehended

– not whether it may probably come to pass. I am of the view that the assistant

registrar was right and I too, will not order a stay of the Singapore proceedings for that

reason as well.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13. For the reasons above, I dismiss the appeal. I will hear arguments

on costs at a later date if parties are unable to agree on that between themselves.</p>
