The other ancillary matters in these proceedings in respect of the custody and maintenance of the children have been stood down. They continue to be managed within the Multi-Disciplinary Team Pilot scheme recently set up by the Family Justice Courts (“FJC”). I had shared, extra-judicially, (see the Family Justice Courts Workplan Speech 2020 delivered on 21 May 2020 entitled “Today is A New Day”) that FJC intends </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… to implement a Multi-Disciplinary Team “Pilot” called “the MDT Pilot” project. This Pilot will explore how judges, mediators, counsellors, psychologists and psychiatrists can work together to resolve the family’s issues holistically through a coordinated multi-disciplinary team effort. The selected cases in this Pilot will be docketed to a team of hearing judges, judge-mediators, counsellors and case managers. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It is heartening that the present parties have agreed to place their case into this MDT Pilot scheme, which endeavours to use a coordinated multi-disciplinary approach to holistic problem solving.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The plaintiff (the “Husband”) and defendant (the “Wife”) were married on 15 September 2003. The interim judgment of divorce (the “IJ”) was granted on 26 July 2019 and the ancillary matters (the “AM”) relating to the division of matrimonial assets were heard over two mornings on 20 and 21 January 2021. The issues concerning the children (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, custody, care and control and maintenance) have been stood down in the meantime. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 This was a marriage that lasted nearly 16 years. The parties have two children, [B] and [C] (the “Children”), who will turn 16 and 14 years of age in 2021. The Wife is 53 years old and a compliance officer at a bank; her monthly income is stated to be about $25,238. The Husband is 53 years old and a personal investor who earns about $22,799 per month on average from his investments. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 I highlighted to both parties’ counsel that the joint summary of relevant information (the “Joint Summary”) that they had jointly submitted is a key document which I will use as a summary of their latest submissions on their respective positions. I made it clear that the positions stated therein would represent their <span class="font-italic">final </span>positions which will be relied on in coming to my decision. In view of some changes to the parties’ positions reflected in the respective written submissions dated 28 December 2020, the Joint Summary dated 14 December 2020 was updated at the AM hearing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 As a general position, all matrimonial assets and liabilities should be identified at the time of the IJ and valued at the time of the AM hearing. It was noted that the balances in bank and Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) accounts are to be taken at the time of the IJ, as the matrimonial assets are the moneys and not the bank and CPF accounts themselves. Thus, in general, available values as close to the AM hearing date as possible will be used. Nevertheless, where parties have specifically agreed to use a value for an asset or liability as at a different date, I will adopt that value instead for this decision. The parties agreed that, in general, the date for ascertaining the pool of assets is the IJ date and the date for valuing those assets is the date of the AM hearing (or closest to this date). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In this case, parties agreed on the values of all assets as listed in the Joint Summary save for [Property 1]. Parties agreed to the following exchange rates in valuing their assets: 1 RM = 0.33 SGD; 1 AUD = 0.94 SGD; 1 USD = 1.39 SGD. In this judgment, “$” refers to the Singapore dollar. I have used only whole dollar values in assigning values; the values in cents were dropped as they were <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span> in light of the large total value of the assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The main dispute in the present proceedings was over a group of assets, which the Husband claimed were pre-marriage assets and/or gifts and hence should be excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets. The Wife claimed that these assets should be included in the pool of matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Division of

text-justify">9 The Husband included the UOB Account No. ending 8619 in the Joint Summary as a matrimonial asset even though he had listed it as an excluded asset in his Affidavit of Assets and Means (“AOM”). In any case, the agreed value was relatively small at only $265, and I have included it in this table. I also noted that the Husband disputed that UOB Account No. ending 91, UOB Account No. ending 05, UOB Account No. ending 13, UOB Account No. ending 21, UOB Account No. ending 48 and UOB Account No. ending 56 were matrimonial assets. Nevertheless, as these assets had an agreed value of $0, their inclusion made no practical difference to the division of assets, and thus I have included them in the table above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 In respect of the assets held in the Husband’s sole name, the net value of the CIMB Fund (Contract No. ending 05) above is in the negative, after subtracting the $300,000 credit facility from the value of $293,580. The assets for [E] Inc and [F] Pte Ltd will be disregarded as neither party made any submissions in respect of either asset or estimated their respective values.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Assets disputed to be matrimonial assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The parties disputed that a number of the assets held in their respective names were matrimonial assets. I will address each of these issues below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Valuation of [Property 1]</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The only asset in which the <span class="font-italic">value </span><span class="font-italic">was disputed</span> was [Property 1]. Based on a valuation report from Knight Frank dated 16 January 2020, the Husband submitted that the value of [Property 1] is $4,500,000. The Wife contended that the more accurate value is $3,910,000, representing the average of two valuation reports from Jones Lang dated 24 July 2020 and SRX dated 5 July 2020. Although the Wife’s valuation at 24 July 2020 was the most recent and closest to the date of the AM hearings, the Husband submitted that such valuation should not necessarily be accepted given that the valuation prepared by Knight Frank “takes into account the actual physical condition of [Property 1]”. The Husband also highlighted that the Wife rejected the valuation report from Knight Frank in respect of [Property 1] without providing any further reasons for doing so, even though she agreed to adopt the valuation report from Knight Frank in respect of [Property 2]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 I considered the manner in which the valuation was conducted. I noted that the Jones Lang valuation report was expressly qualified as they had been “unable to verify nor validate” the information that was given to them electronically about the physical state of the property from the Wife as “it was not possible to conduct a physical inspection.” As such, the “condition is assessed based on information provided by the [Wife]”. In respect of the SRX report, I noted that the report was similarly expressly qualified insofar as the “information and indicative price provided [therein] is for <span class="font-italic">general reference only</span> and does <span class="font-italic">not</span> constitute a valuation by a licensed appraiser. The information and indicative value is [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] based on publicly available information, proprietary data of SRX and other third party sources believed but not guaranteed to be reliable” [emphasis added]. In particular, the SRX valuation report seemed to only consider past “comparable sale transactions” for [Property 1] in coming to the figure of $3,720,000. In contrast, the valuation report from Knight Frank was prepared after conducting “site inspection, title searches, … relevant inquiries and investigations”.

It is only under certain limited circumstances that gifts and inheritance lose their respective character as gifts and inheritance (as explained at [20]) such that it may be fair to include them in the pool of matrimonial assets (provided they also fall within the requirements in s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) or (<span class="font-italic">b</span>)). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 An asset acquired <span class="font-italic">before</span> marriage will only be transformed into a matrimonial asset in accordance with the transformation formula for Group A, stated above.

This is not to state that the concept of effort as such is irrelevant once one enters the realm of assets acquired by way of gift; far from it.

On the other hand … if the <span class="font-italic">donee</span> of the gift has, by his or her <span class="font-italic">efforts</span>, “<span class="font-italic">converted</span>” the gift into a different asset, then the new asset, if it has <span class="font-italic">ex hypothesi</span> lost its quality as a gift, can then be treated as part of the pool of matrimonial assets provided that it satisfies either para (<span class="font-italic">a</span>) or para (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of s 112(10).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Whether a gifted asset loses its character as a gift depends on whether there was a “<span class="font-italic">real and unambiguous intention</span>”<span class="font-italic"> </span>on the part of the donee of the asset that it was “to constitute part of the pool of matrimonial assets” (<span class="font-italic">Chen Siew Hwee</span> at [57]). The High Court further clarified (at [57]–[58]) that a gift does not cease to be a gift merely by “<span class="font-italic">literal </span>transformation”.

For example, in our recent decision in <span class="font-italic">TQU v TQT</span> [2020] SGCA 8, it was undisputed that a property at Pender Court was a gift from the husband’s father to the husband prior to the marriage (at [50]). The burden then fell on the wife to produce evidence that the property had been used as a matrimonial home and had therefore been transformed into a matrimonial asset, or that she had made substantial improvements to the property during the marriage (at [55]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In the present case, it was not disputed that the assets in question were pre-marital assets and/or gifts received by the Husband. Thus, the Wife bore the burden of proving that such assets had been transformed by the formulae in s 112(10) or lost their character as gifts and satisfied s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) or (<span class="font-italic">b</span>). Of note in the present case was the fact that there were existing assets which may not all be in their original form at the time they were first acquired. As a hypothetical example, suppose it is not disputed by the relevant parties that Asset X is a pre-marital asset or gift, but Asset X in its original form no longer exists at the time of the divorce. Suppose also, that one spouse then asserts that an existing asset, Asset Y, is a gift because either it is somehow <span class="font-italic">derived</span> from Asset X, or it is <span class="font-italic">in substance</span> Asset X existing in a different form as Asset Y at the time of the divorce. In such a scenario, it is for <span class="font-italic">the spouse making such assertion</span><span class="font-italic">s</span> to show satisfactorily that Asset Y is indeed a pre-marital asset or gift on the basis that, for example, there was a <span class="font-italic">literal</span> transformation in <span class="font-italic">only </span><span class="font-italic">the form of Asset X </span>that is not accompanied by any intention for it to be part of the pool of matrimonial assets. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Assets excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets: effect of Pre-Nuptial Agreement</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The parties in the present case had entered into the Pre-Nuptial Agreement five days before their marriage in September 2003. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 It is established law that pre-nuptial agreements “cannot be enforced in and of itself” and the court may have regard to such pre-nuptial agreements under s 112(2)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the Women’s Charter (<span class="font-italic">TQ v TR and another appeal </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 961 (“<span class="font-italic">TQ</span>”) at [80]).

Such developments include the fact that the Husband, shortly after parties were married, “left [Bank L]” and “floated between freelance work”, spending about 15 years during the marriage of 16 years “without a stable job and income from employment”. Under such circumstances, the Wife submitted that “parties never kept their finances separate” and parties “pooled their resources together in accordance with the concept of community of property” such that the Pre-Nuptial Agreement should be departed from. The Wife distinguished <span class="font-italic">TQ </span>as the prenuptial agreement in that case was “wholly foreign in nature”, signed by “foreigners” and “only dealt with the parties’ respective matrimonial assets only”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Clause 16 of the Pre-Nuptial Agreement provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Any property purchased after the marriage in which the evidence of title shows an unequal ownership of property will be divided in accordance with the percentage ownership reflected on the title.

On 18 April 2018, the Husband encouraged the Wife to reconsider whether “increasing net wealth” was “important” to her specifically by reassuring her that “we can spend $8k a month and still have approx [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] 75% or $11m remaining”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 As early as 12 February 2007, the Husband had expressed similar sentiments to the Wife by way of an email regarding “Our Net Wealth”:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">Balance Sheet</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">Assets:</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Property 1] Sing$1.5</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Property 2] Sing$1.2</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[The Australian Property] Sing$3</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Total: Sing$5.5million</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">Liability:</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">$800K loan (This loan amount obtained to cover renovations as well)</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">$230K renovations</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Total: Sing$1.1million</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">Net Worth:</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sing$4.4 million.

As I had mentioned earlier, a literal reading of the Pre-Nuptial Agreement, in particular clause 16, would lead to the result that the Wife would be entitled to these two properties entirely. The positions taken by the Husband were not consistent; if as the Husband claimed, the Pre-Nuptial Agreement ought to be given full weight, his position on these properties could not be upheld. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Considering all the relevant circumstances, I did not think it just and equitable to accord full weight to the Pre-Nuptial Agreement. This was not to say that I entirely disregarded it. I accepted that the parties, having signed a Pre-Nuptial Agreement, may to some extent be conscious of the broad arrangements contained in the agreement as they live out their married lives and this may be relevant when ascertaining a party’s intention in respect of how he or she treats certain assets. However, also relevant was the fact that this was a Pre-Nuptial Agreement made long ago before their 16-year marriage, before the parties had any children. I had observed in an academic article “Prenuptial Agreements: Affirming <span class="font-italic">TQ v TR</span> in Singapore” (2012) 24 SAcLJ 402 at [13]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In the marital context, the parties share an intimate relationship where parties may bargain with an attitude that is altruistic and generous, particularly where the relationship is subsisting lovingly. They bargain in a manner that is sensitive to the feelings of the other partner. The joint marital life of such parties is a journey where not every event can be foreseen, making it difficult for parties to make provisions where future circumstances are inevitably unpredictable. Children born to the parties complicate the matter as the state prioritises protecting vulnerable children. If marriage is seen as a journey where both parties adjust to each other, experience life together, and grow old together, then it seems unrealistic to make provisions for a future not yet learnt or experienced. Parties are pushed to “[e]nvisioning the end of a marriage not yet begun, prospective couples must divide property not yet acquired”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I observed that while the Husband relied on the Pre-Nuptial Agreement providing that pre-marriage assets and inheritance are his to retain, the Husband’s conduct during the marriage relied on these very assets to provide for the family, whether by using them to produce new income or as security that will provide for the family when needed. Such conduct<span class="font-italic"> had an effect on the Wife</span> in how she, in turn, conducted her life, such as in respect of her career choices, how she utilised her income or acquired assets. The contemporaneous communications on the various occasions above suggested that the Husband intended for some of his pre-marital assets to be used as matrimonial assets for the family. However, this did not necessarily mean that the Husband intended that <span class="font-italic">all </span>of his pre-marital assets listed in the First Schedule should constitute matrimonial assets. The Pre-Nuptial Agreement was accorded some weight as I bore in mind this context: whether the assets listed in the First Schedule were to be included in the pool of matrimonial assets would depend on the relevant facts surrounding each asset. The factors and circumstances I have just stated above would also be borne in mind. At the end of the day, the parties should move on after divorce with a just and equitable share of the net marital gains of their marriage partnership.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Assets excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets: Husband’s claims to exclude various assets</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) Pre-marital asset: the CPF moneys</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The Husband submitted that the following sums, representing the CPF moneys acquired before the marriage, should be excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets: $58,778 (Ordinary Account); $8,648 (Special Account); and $11,971 (Medisave Account), amounting to a total of $79,397. The Wife’s position, without more, was that the CPF moneys were “commingled with monies acquired during marriage”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I accepted the Husband’s submission that the CPF moneys acquired before the marriage fell outside the pool of matrimonial assets. This case did not involve the more common movements of CPF funds used to purchase property where there are difficulties in identifying pre-marriage funds from post-marriage funds.

The Wife’s position did not contradict this as she has stated it to be “a gift from [the Husband’s] father before our marriage”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 On the facts, I found that the Australian Property fell within Group B, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it was a <span class="font-italic">gift</span> acquired before marriage. Whether a gift is a matrimonial asset depends on whether it has been used as a matrimonial home, or has been substantially improved by the joint efforts of both parties or the other party, or has lost its character as a gift <span class="font-italic">and</span> satisfies the formula in s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) or (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Women’s Charter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The Wife’s position was that the Husband “had considered his Australian Property and any monies he had received by then as part of the family’s assets” on the basis of his communications to her. The parties operated on such a mutual understanding because the Husband had “no full-time work and only [received] sporadic income from his freelance work” and hence would “contribute towards the marriage through his inheritance monies.” As with her other arguments, the Wife’s basis for claiming that certain pre-marital assets as stipulated in the Pre-Nuptial Agreement, such as the Australian Property, were matrimonial assets was that these assets were intended by the Husband for the family’s use and hence transformed into matrimonial assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Intention alone does <span class="font-italic">not</span> transform an asset which is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> not a matrimonial asset into a matrimonial asset. Matrimonial assets are defined in s 112(10) of the Women’s Charter and an asset which has lost its character as a gift must fall within the definition in s 112(10) before it can be considered a matrimonial asset. Thus, <span class="font-italic">even if the Wife </span><span class="font-italic">was successful</span> in her arguments that the Australian Property had <span class="font-italic">lost its character as a gift</span>, the Wife must still prove that this pre-marital asset was transformed through s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) or (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Women’s Charter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Since neither party claimed that the Australian Property, a pre-marital asset, was substantially improved during the marriage, the Wife had to show that it was “ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties or one or more of their children” for shelter or for household purposes (s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the Women’s Charter) if she asserts it had been transformed into a matrimonial asset. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The Wife’s reliance on ordinary usage was brought up “[i]n addition” to the Husband’s consideration of the Australian Property as “one of our family’s assets”. The Husband also noted that the Wife’s position was that it had been transformed to a matrimonial asset “on the basis that it was enjoyed by the parties / family on 3 separate occasions”. According to the Wife, her first stay in 2005 was for a period of “about 1 month” and her “parents came along and stayed in the property with [them]”. Her second stay in 2007 was for a period of “2 months” during which she “maintained the house and looked after the 2 young children ([B] was 2 years old and [C] a newborn [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]) while helping to thoroughly clean out the property, packing and giving away the [Husband’s] father’s unwanted possessions which were stored away in the attic and garage”. The property was repaired and left in a state suitable for rental. The rental proceeds were then put into the Husband’s ANZ Account No. ending 55. Whenever the family visited Perth “which was an annual affair, all our family expenses in Perth were paid by the [Husband] from this same bank account”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 According to the Husband, “neither did the family live at the Australian Property at all in 2005, nor spend a period of 2 months at the said property in 2007”. The Husband relied on a copy of [B]’s passport showing that “the family lived at the Australian Property” on only two occasions: (i) for 6 weeks between 23 October 2007 to 4 December 2007; and (ii) for 9 days between 8 March 2008 to 16 March 2008. He submitted that the Australian Property “has not been transformed into a matrimonial asset” by virtue of ordinary usage. Adding both periods together, the family resided at the Australian Property for a total period of 52 days.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I found that the Australian Property was not “ordinarily used” by both parties or their Children and was a pre-marital asset that fell outside the pool of matrimonial assets. The requirement of ordinary use would not be satisfied if the parties’ use of the property was “occasional or casual” as the words “ordinarily used” required some form of substantiality (<span class="font-italic">BJS v BJT</span> [2013] 4 SLR 41 at [23]). For example, staying in a property for no more than 21 days out of 14 years of marriage is casual residence, not ordinary use of the property (<span class="font-italic">Ryan Neil John v Berger Rosaline</span> [2000] 3 SLR(R) 647 at [60]). Given the documentary evidence submitted, I accepted that it was more likely that the family had resided in the Australian Property for about 52 days out of the 16 years of marriage; this could not be said to amount to ordinary use of the Australian Property. Even if I were to accept the Wife’s assertion that the family had resided in the Australian Property for about one month in 2005, I did not think that a total of only about 3 occasions totalling no more than 3 months throughout the 16 years of marriage amounted to an ordinary use of the asset. As such, I excluded the Australian Property from the pool of matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) Pre-marital asset: Husband’s DBS Account No. ending 03</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The Husband submitted that his DBS Account No. ending 03 was “the bank account which the Husband uses as a conduit to draw financial resources from his assets and apply it towards the family’s expenditures. In other words, this DBS Account is a mere vessel or financial tool … and that the monies in the said account were ultimately derived from the Excluded Assets”. Furthermore, this account was “included in the Pre-Nuptial Agreement”. This was also the account into which the $450,000 from the sale of his 1/3 share in [Property 3] was credited on 1 December 2005.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The Wife’s position was that the moneys in the account were “commingled with monies acquired during the marriage, monies from the Singapore inheritance, the Wife’s monies and funds from this bank account were used for the family’s expenses”. According to the Wife, she had transferred a total of at least $28,000 from the years 2007 to 2015 to the account. The Wife was never repaid back for such sums nor did she “expect him to repay [her]”, since parties did not conceptualise the moneys as “<span class="font-italic">his</span>” and “<span class="font-italic">hers</span>” [emphasis in original]. It was unfortunate that the Husband “never once mentioned” the Wife’s “financial support for him to this same DBS bank account” in the Husband’s “four affidavits of combined length of 3,211 pages”. In respect of the $450,000, the moneys were “ploughed into the two Singapore properties held under the name of the Wife”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 On the Husband’s own evidence, he had “invested nearly $950,000” in the family in the period between 2004 to 9 February 2007. The sum of $950,000 which was spent on the family was “funded by $500K of [his] savings + $420 [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] from [his] father ([Property 3] sale)”. This was also supported by the Husband’s response to the second round of discovery and interrogatories in which the Husband admitted that as far as he could recall, “he had 2 main sources from which he drew funds [of $360,000 for [Property 2]] from at the material time: (1) DBS Account No. ending 03; and (2) [G] Inc., a BVI company of which he is the sole beneficial owner.” It was hence not disputed that the moneys from the sale of his 1/3 share in [Property 3] was converted to matrimonial assets shortly after the Husband received the $450,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 It was not disputed that the moneys in the account were used to fund the family’s expenses. The Husband did not dispute that the Wife had transferred an amount that was not insubstantial, of at least $28,000, into this account. He argued that this  “does not in any way dilute the argument that the source of the bulk of the funds in the account” was pre-marital and hence the moneys in the account should be excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets. However, he did not point to evidence to show the source of the “bulk of the funds”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I found that the Husband’s original pre-marriage moneys, if any, were co-mingled with other funds which were matrimonial assets and were “no longer separately identifiable” (<span class="font-italic">UYP v UYQ </span>[2020] 3 SLR 683 (“<span class="font-italic">UYP</span>”) at [14]). The Husband also had an intention to utilise the assets for and on behalf of the family. I observed that the balance in DBS Account No. ending 03 of $7,463 was a small sum in light of the total pool of assets. I included this sum of $7,463 into the pool of matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(D) Pre-marital gift: Husband’s 1/3 Share in [H] Sdn Bhd</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 According to the Husband, he was the beneficial owner of the shares in [H] Sdn Bhd “under a trust that was created in 1998”. The trust deed dated 8 December 1998 provided that 80,000 shares were to be held by the Husband’s sister on trust for the Husband and his two siblings. After the Husband’s father “passed away on 6 March 2008, [his] share of the proceeds from the sale of the shares under the Trust Deed were distributed in several tranches”. A total sum of $3,373,902 from February 2010 to mid-August 2014 was deposited immediately into UOB Account No. ending 1619, a joint account which is now closed. The last tranche received in mid-June 2015 for the sum of $23,738 was immediately deposited in UOB Account No. ending 8619, a joint account which is currently valued at $265, which was addressed at [9]. As such, the Husband received a total of $3,397,640 for his 1/3 share (this sum was later corrected by the Husband to $3,541,240 based on the prevailing foreign exchange rates at the material time). The Husband explained that the funds were initially put into joint accounts “simply to operate as a contingency plan” such that the Wife and Children “can access the funds for the support of the family after my demise.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The moneys were subsequently deposited into UOB Account No. ending 75 with a value of $521, UOB Kay Hian Securities (M) Sdn Bhd Trading Account with a value of $42,883 and UOB Kay Hian Securities (M) Sdn Bhd Trust Account No. ending 34 with a value of $377,978. The total value of these assets was $421,382. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The Husband submitted that part of the moneys was also used to acquire the Husband’s other assets such as the Orbit Securities (Tanzania) Account No. ending 18 with a value of $96,695, Orbit Trust Account with a value of $4,433, [J] Placement shares with a value of $47,000, DBS Account No. ending 42 with a value of $367,285 and DBS Portfolio No. ending 60 with a value of $398,230. The total value of the aforementioned assets was $913,643. In respect of those accounts, the Husband submitted that such accounts were also funded from the sale of [G] Inc (BVI) and the “sale proceeds from the Husband’s share of [Property 3]”. However, it was not disputed that the moneys from the sale of his 1/3 share in [Property 3] was already converted to matrimonial assets shortly after the Husband received the $450,000 (see [48] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 According to the Wife, the Husband intended to “share the monies with the [Wife] and the utilisation of the monies to provide for [the] family was unambiguous and undisputed.” For example, the Husband opened the joint bank account together with the Wife “immediately upon receiving all funds” and deposited the funds therein. Some of the funds were thereafter transferred to joint fixed deposit accounts together with the Wife. Additionally, moneys “from the said joint bank account were used towards the family’s holidays in Malaysia”. The moneys were kept in the joint accounts “until the marriage broke down in late 2018”, when the Husband transferred funds out of the joint accounts to “ringfence” the moneys. The Wife disagreed with the Husband’s position that in relation to these moneys, only “monies that were used from these accounts during the marriage may be matrimonial assets or converted into matrimonial assets”; her position was that such moneys “no longer exist”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 It was not disputed that the moneys were not co-mingled with any other moneys. It was also not disputed that the shares were pre-marital gifts to the Husband and hence fell within Group B. As such, the first issue to consider was whether such gift had lost its character as a gift; and secondly, if it had lost its character as a gift, whether such asset satisfied s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) or (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Women’s Charter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I did not think that the Husband’s act of depositing moneys into a joint account in itself was sufficient to evince the requisite “<span class="font-italic">real and unambiguous intention</span>” that the entire asset was to be part of the pool of matrimonial assets (<span class="font-italic">Chen Siew Hwee</span> at [57]). Even if I considered the contemporaneous communications from the Husband to the Wife as elaborated at [30]–[32], the Husband’s reference to “cash” was ambiguous and the Husband did not, at any material time, refer specifically to his inheritance moneys under the trust deed. Although the Husband used some part of his inheritance during the marriage for and on behalf of the family, the Husband could retain the rest of his inheritance if he did not intend for such inheritance to be part of the pool of matrimonial assets. In any case, neither of the tests under s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Women’s Charter were satisfied on the facts. As such, the UOB Account No. ending 75, UOB Kay Hian Securities (M) Sdn Bhd Trading Account, and UOB Kay Hian Securities (M) Sdn Bhd Trust Account No. ending 34 were excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Separately, whether the Husband’s other assets listed at [53] above were to be excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets would depend on whether the sale proceeds from the [G] Inc (BVI) were also non-matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(E) Pre-marital gift: Husband’s [G] Inc (BVI)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In respect of the Husband’s share in [G] Inc, the Husband stated that “[a]ll proceeds derived from its winding up in 2006 were transferred to a BNP Paribas Account No. [ending 48], which was subsequently distributed in accordance with the … Memorandum of Wishes”. The Husband’s 23.33% share amounted to USD 243,974 CHF 95,341, and GBP 16,851. The moneys were “transferred to and mixed with the existing funds in the same DBS bank account which is expressly excluded from the matrimonial pool” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, DBS Account No. ending 03, which was addressed at [50]). The moneys were also used to partially fund the balance costs of $360,000 for [Property 2] (see [48] above). As mentioned above at [53], the moneys were put into the Orbit Securities (Tanzania) Account No. ending 18 with a value of $96,695, Orbit Trust Account with a value of $4,433, [J] Placement shares with a value of $47,000, DBS Account No. ending 42 with a value of $367,285, and DBS Portfolio No. ending 60 with a value of $398,230.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The Wife did not address the moneys from [G] Inc (BVI) specifically but rather simply grouped such moneys together with the Husband’s inheritance under the Singapore Will amounting to $831,540 and the Husband’s 1/3 share in [Property 3] amounting to $450,000. The Wife submitted that the “repeated assurances to the [Wife] that [the Husband’s] inheritance belonged to both of them” was sufficient for the asset to lose its character as a gift such that it should be “added to the pool of matrimonial assets for division”. Further, the Wife submitted that “there [had] been substantial improvement during the marriage of the inheritance monies through the efforts of the [Wife] or the joint efforts of both parties” under s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Women’s Charter. The Wife submitted that it was her “good and steady income” that enabled her Husband to maintain “his wealth and the family would not have weathered [the Husband’s] unsuccessful job applications and business failures”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 It was not disputed that [G] Inc (BVI) was a pre-marital gift and the asset fell within Group B. I did not think that the Husband’s contemporaneous communications referencing “cash” on its own was sufficient to evince a real and unambiguous intention that the moneys from [G] Inc (BVI) were to constitute the pool of matrimonial assets. In particular, the Husband did not, at any material time, refer specifically to his pre-marital gift of [G] Inc (BVI). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 While I appreciated that the Wife’s resilience helped in providing for her family’s expenditure through her “good and steady income”, such contributions by the Wife did not amount to “substantial improvement” of the Husband’s pre-marital gift within the meaning of the Women’s Charter. It is clear that “substantial improvement” must involve some sort of “investment of some kind in the asset” (<span class="font-italic">USB </span>at [22]). On the facts, the Wife’s provision for her family was part and parcel of a marriage and quite separate from an investment <span class="font-italic">in the asset</span>. In that regard, it was not disputed that it was the Husband who used his experience as an investor to improve his pre-marital gifts. The Wife was not involved in investing the assets so as to substantially improve them. However, such efforts by the Wife were not irrelevant and could still be considered as part of her indirect contributions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 It was not disputed that all of the accounts above were acquired using the Husband’s pre-marital gifts. The assets hence retain their character as gifts. As such, the Orbit Securities (Tanzania) Account No. ending 18, Orbit Trust Account, [J] Placement Shares, DBS Account No. ending 42, and DBS Portfolio No. ending 60 were excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(F) Inheritance: Husband’s inheritance under the Australian Will</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I will not address the inheritance under the Malaysian Will executed on 22 September 2006, as “there was hardly any distribution made to [the Husband] or the children.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 One main difficulty in this case was that neither the Husband nor the Wife in their respective written submissions distinguished the different accounts based on the sources of moneys. The source of the moneys in the various accounts and how they related to each allegedly excluded asset were not clear. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 According to the Husband, he had inherited “12.5% of the residuary” of his late father’s estate under the Australian Will. The Husband received a total of $132,693 under the Australian Will on 2 October 2009 which comprised the “12.5% Children’s entitlement under [his] late father’s Australian Will” <span class="font-italic">and </span>the Husband’s entitlement under the Australian Will. The moneys which he inherited under the Australian Will were “mixed” with his “existing funds in an account that [he] maintain[ed] with ANZ Bank” which was used “when the family made trips to Australia”. As the Husband only had two accounts with ANZ bank, one of which he accepted to be a matrimonial asset, I concluded that this part of his affidavit related to the ANZ Account No. ending 55. The Husband did not go further to explain the source of his “existing funds” in this  account or other accounts which funds also “intermingled” with the $132,693. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 According to the Wife, the moneys in the Australian bank accounts and Australian investment accounts included “funds from the joint Malaysian bank accounts” between September 2018 and December 2018 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, after the breakdown of the marriage). This was based on the Husband’s finances as a whole across the Malaysian and Australian accounts. For example, the Wife submitted that the Husband could not have grown his inheritance of only $100,000 under the Australian Will by “more than 900%” within less than a decade. This appeared to be more relevant to the issue of drawing an adverse inference, which will be addressed below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The Wife also argued that “during the marriage, the [Husband] never ringfenced his Australian bank accounts and had used monies from the bank accounts for the benefit of the family”. For example, the rental proceeds from the Australian Property were credited into ANZ Account No. ending 55. Whenever the family visited Perth, “all [of the] family expenses in Perth were paid by the [Husband] from this same bank account”. In more recent years, the family trips took place during the following periods: 10 June 2016 to 21 June 2016; 2 September 2018 to 9 September 2018; and 4 June 2019 to 9 June 2019.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 It was not disputed that the moneys in the account were used to fund the family’s expenses. The Wife also accepted that the inheritance moneys had been placed in other accounts such as the Charles Schwab Account No. ending 12, Commonwealth Bank of Australia Account No. ending 29 and ANZ Account No. ending 55. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I found that the Husband had the intention to utilise the moneys in the ANZ Account No. ending 55 for the family. I accepted that, in respect of the ANZ Account No. ending 55, both parties had at all material times operated on the common understanding that the moneys therein were for the family’s use. The Husband had intended and considered moneys in that account to be part of the family’s assets and it was not necessary to trace the original source of the moneys, for the moneys from various sources had been co-mingled. I included the ANZ Account No. ending 55 in the pool of matrimonial assets at a value of $10,602.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 I now turn to consider whether the moneys in the other Australian accounts were also to be included in the pool of matrimonial assets. Specifically, according to the Husband, the inheritance moneys were also “intermingled with funds that [he had] in another account known as Commonwealth Bank Account No. [ending 29], as well as trading / investments accounts that [he] maintain[ed] with, [Charles Schwab] Account No. [ending 76], [Charles Schwab] Account No. [ending 12], Commonwealth Securities Account No. [ending 63], Shaw and Partners (Australia) Account [No. ending 15] and SAXO Capital Markets Account no: [ending 21].”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In respect of the Commonwealth Bank Account No. ending 29, Charles Schwab Account No. ending 12, Commonwealth Securities Account No. ending 63 and Shaw and Partners (Australia) Account No. ending 15, counsel for the Wife submitted that such accounts were opened during the marriage. This was because such accounts were <span class="font-italic">not </span>listed in the First Schedule of the Pre-Nuptial Agreement and hence, must have been opened by the Husband during the marriage. I also noted that the Charles Schwab Account No. ending 76 and SAXO Capital Markets Account No: ending 21 were similarly not listed in the Pre-Nuptial Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In the absence of evidence or submissions by the Husband to the contrary, I accepted that such accounts were opened during the marriage. However, the fact that such accounts were opened during the marriage did not necessarily mean that the moneys therein were matrimonial assets. If the Husband showed that all of the moneys in such accounts were inheritance moneys belonging solely to himself, such moneys would <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>fall outside the pool of matrimonial assets and it would be for the Wife to show they had been transformed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The Husband submitted that the moneys in these Australian accounts also came from his 1/3 share in [H] Sdn Bhd and [G] Inc (BVI). He argued that these funds had “not been mixed with any monies from the [Wife] during the entire marriage” but admitted that the accounts in which the moneys were credited were held in joint names (with the Wife). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The Husband’s inheritance under the Australian Will was obtained on 2 October 2009. He received his first tranche of his 1/3 share in [H] Sdn Bhd in February 2010 and further tranches until 2015. The proceeds of [H] Sdn Bhd’s shares were placed into UOB Account No. ending 1619, a joint account which is now closed (see [51] above). Likewise, the moneys from the winding up of [G] Inc (BVI) was received after 3 October 2008 and eventually “transferred to and mixed with the existing funds in the same DBS bank account which is expressly excluded from the matrimonial pool” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, DBS Account No. ending 03, which was addressed at [50]). I gathered that the Husband’s own evidence supported the Wife’s submission that the Australian accounts contained moneys from the joint Malaysian accounts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 I found that even if moneys from the Husband’s 1/3 share in [H] Sdn Bhd and [G] Inc (BVI) were eventually transferred into the Australian accounts, the moneys had been co-mingled and were “no longer separately identifiable” as the Husband’s inherited assets (see <span class="font-italic">UYP </span>at [14]). On the Husband’s own evidence, the inheritance moneys of $132,693 did not belong to him only. Part of that sum of $132,693 belonged to the Children as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 I included into the pool the Commonwealth Bank Account No. ending 29, Charles Schwab Account No. ending 76, Charles Schwab Account No. ending 12, Commonwealth Securities Account No. ending 63, Shaw and Partners (Australia) Account No. ending 15, and SAXO Capital Markets Account No. ending 21 at their respective agreed values.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(G) Inheritance: Husband’s inheritance under the Singapore Will</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 It was not disputed that the Husband was the sole beneficiary under his late father’s Singapore Will which was executed on 7 August 2007. Under the Singapore Will, the Husband inherited [Property 3] which was valued at $3,210,200 and DBS Account No. ending 67 with a value of $503,632. The Husband’s share of the Singapore Will, after distributing in accordance with his late father’s Memorandum of Wishes, amounted to $831,540, which was credited into his DBS Account No. ending 03 and thereafter put into various financial investments. However, there was no further explanation as to how much and which specific financial institutions the moneys were invested with.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Given the lack of evidence on what assets the inheritance was literally transformed into, I was unable to make a finding as to which of the Husband’s assets were acquired using the inheritance under the Singapore Will. Neither party pointed me to specific evidence as to where the inheritance moneys that were originally in the DBS Account No. ending 03 had been transferred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The Husband merely referred to his “share of [Property 3]” in support of his submission that the moneys in the Orbit Securities (Tanzania) Account No. ending 18, Orbit Trust Account, [J] Placement Shares, DBS Account No. ending 42, and DBS Portfolio No. ending 60 were to be excluded. Such “share of [Property 3]”, however, was not necessarily the same as his inheritance under the Singapore Will for a total sum of $831,540. The Wife, similarly, lumped the sum of $831,540 together with other moneys for a total sum of $1,800,952 as the “Singapore Monies”. She made no submissions on the sum of $831,540 which the Husband received under the Singapore Will.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 As such, the Husband’s inheritance under the Singapore Will neither helped nor supported his contention that the assets listed at [14] were to be excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets. In any case, I did not think that anything turned on a finding of fact as to whether the Husband’s inheritance moneys had indeed been used to fund the Orbit Securities (Tanzania) Account No. ending 18, Orbit Trust Account, [J] Placement Shares, DBS Account No. ending 42, and DBS Portfolio No. ending 60. Regardless of whether the moneys in these accounts were partly funded using the Husband’s inheritance moneys under the Singapore Will, the moneys therein were to be excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets. This was because the moneys in such accounts would be comprised of only non-matrimonial assets in any case (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, comprising either sale proceeds from the 1/3 share of [H] Sdn Bhd and proceeds from winding up [G] Inc (BVI) <span class="font-italic">only</span>; or include <span class="font-italic">also</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>the inheritance moneys received under the Singapore Will).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Adverse inference against the Husband</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The parties have a duty to fully and frankly disclose their assets in order that a fair assessment of the total pool of matrimonial assets can be determined. An adverse inference may be drawn for a failure to fully and frankly disclose one’s assets and means. This adverse inference may be drawn where the following criteria are satisfied (<span class="font-italic">UZN v UZM </span>[2021] 1 SLR 426 (“<span class="font-italic">UZN</span>”) at [18]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) there is a substratum of evidence that establishes a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case against the person against whom the inference is to be drawn; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) that person must have had some particular access to the information he is said to be hiding.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The court’s findings in respect of the value of undisclosed assets should thereafter be reflected in the manner in which the court gives effect to the adverse inference (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, uplift approach or quantification approach) (<span class="font-italic">UZN </span>at [36]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The Wife relied on the “extensive time required to trace the monies which could have been saved if the [Husband] provided the requisite information from the outset” as the basis for drawing an adverse inference. In particular, the Wife submitted that an adverse inference should be drawn over the Husband’s “withdrawal from parties’ joint bank accounts in Malaysia, and his lack of transparency on it” which led to a “tedious tracing exercise” which led to “a total number of 1,215 pages of bank statements and supporting documents provided … simply to thwart the tracing of the monies”. As such, the Wife submitted that “the percentage division in favour of the [Wife]” be adjusted upwards by 5%. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 At the AM hearing, counsel for the Wife highlighted the “mind map” of moneys moved between the Husband’s various accounts in Malaysia, Australia, and Singapore across different years. Based on the “mind map” submitted, it was not disputed that the Husband’s moneys were generally accounted for and traceable, notwithstanding the movements made between the different accounts. While I appreciated the effort which the counsel for the Wife put in to trace the moneys in contention, I accepted the Husband’s response that such “extensive time required to trace the monies which could have been saved” was not a basis for drawing an adverse inference under the law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Nevertheless, I recognised that the Wife’s underlying complaint was that the Husband “had withdrawn lump sums of monies from the joint bank accounts to accounts held in his sole names such as the amount of RM$300,000.00 on 30 August 2018, the amount of RM$52,587.64 on 3 September 2018 and the amounts of US$555,000.00, RM$139,000.00 and RM$674,641.29 in the span of eight (8) days”. Such withdrawals took place around the time the marriage broke down. In contrast, “such large sums from the years of 2010 to late 2018” were never withdrawn. The Wife submitted that the Husband’s “sole goal for the withdrawals was to dissipate the matrimonial assets by transferring them to his sole name accounts so that he could claim that they were inheritance”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Although those specific sums mentioned were accounted for within the “mind map”, I found that the increase in total value of the assets was not accounted for by the Husband. The top of the “mind map” showed the following starting balances in the various accounts and the bottom of the map reflected the most recent balance of the various accounts. The updated values were as such:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Account / Date</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Earlier Balance / $</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Balance at AM / $</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-left">Proceeds from winding up of [G] Inc (BVI) / 3 October 2008</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-right">519,411</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">NA, initially credited into a BNP Paribas account and then transferred into various accounts</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-left">Malaysia Accounts (Sale of shares in [H] Sdn Bhd) / 2010–2015</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-right">3,541,240</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">427,520</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-left">Australia Accounts (Inheritance under the Australia Will) / 2 October 2009</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-right">132,693</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">3,960,805</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-left">Singapore Accounts (Inheritance under the Singapore Will) / 4 February 2009</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-right">831,540</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">772,978</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-left">Total</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-right">5,024,884</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">5,161,303</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">While movements of moneys between accounts, without more, were insufficient to support a conclusion that the Husband was wrongfully dissipating the assets, I agreed that it was incumbent upon the Husband to account for the significant discrepancy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Even taking the Husband’s case at its highest (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, accepting the Husband’s position that the full initial sum of $5,024,884 belonged solely to him, giving the Husband the liberty to transfer his moneys between all of his accounts, and assuming that the Husband spent only $360,000 for the balance costs of [Property 2] and nothing more), the remaining value should be only $4,664,884 ($5,024,884 minus $360,000). The discrepancy amounting to $496,419, which represented a net value increase of 10.6%, was not accounted for by the Husband. In fact, it was the Husband’s case that the value of all of his assets increased by only $145,624 “from the inception of the marriage until the breakdown”. As such, I found that the Husband was unable to account for the additional $496,419. This was a large sum for which a fuller account or disclosure can be expected.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Since the moneys were in accounts held in his sole name, the Husband would have had access to all the information in respect of the movement of moneys, injection of funds, and gains made.

According to the Wife, the Husband had paid only $317,900 and she had paid the remaining $82,100 of the purchase price.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 To support his position, the Husband relied on two emails between the parties. In the email regarding “[Property 2]: Costs to Date (S$~848K)” dated 28 May 2006, the Wife noted that “<span class="font-weight-bold">Purchase Price = S$400,000</span> (Peter paid)” [emphasis in original]. In the email regarding “$950,000 spent on family over last 3 years” dated 9 February 2007, the Wife responded that she was “NOT quibbling on the fact that [the Husband] did contribute to part of [Property 2]” [emphasis in original] when the Husband wrote that he had contributed $554,565 to [Property 2]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The Husband also highlighted that the Wife “had shifted her position over the course of the proceedings” from her initial position of contributing 90% to the purchase price after the Husband located “2 additional cheques”. The first cheque dated 30 July 2004 issued by the Wife was for a sum of $91,578. The second cheque dated 30 July 2004 issued by the Husband was for a sum of $277,990. According to the Husband, he “had subsequently made reimbursements to the Wife” for the “legal fees of $7,000.00” and “the balance of the purchase price”. The Husband’s claims that he had reimbursed $7,000 <span class="font-italic">and </span>the balance of the purchase price were supported by a copy of the bank’s deposit slip dated 2 August 2004 to the Wife and the aforementioned email dated 28 May 2006 respectively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The Wife accepted that the Husband had reimbursed her $7,000 but averred that the Husband did not reimburse her the remaining amounts (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $2,568 for the remaining legal fees and stamp duties and $82,100 for the purchase price). With respect to the emails, the Wife submitted that the email dated 9 February 2007 suggested that she had made some direct contribution to [Property 2]. In particular, the words “contribute to <span class="font-italic">part of </span><span class="font-italic">[Property 2]</span>” suggested that the Husband did not pay for the entire cost of [Property 2].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 On the undisputed evidence of the emails and the cheques, the true dispute between the parties was in respect of the sum of $82,010. The email dated 28 May 2006 supported the Husband’s position that he had paid the full $400,000. While the email dated 28 May 2006 was closer in time to the date on which the property was purchased, I did not think that the email could be afforded conclusive weight. Given the contents of that email, I found that both parties operated on the mutual understanding that the Wife was checking in with the Husband as to her rough tally of the costs. This was evidenced by the numerous “??” scattered throughout the email, suggesting that the Wife was merely consolidating a rough tally of what parties had already paid, and the Husband’s subsequent clarification to <span class="font-italic">correct</span> the Wife’s rough tallies. Furthermore, the contents of that email in respect of the purchase price of $400,000 was not itself supported by further documents such as cheques or bank statements. In contrast, the email dated 9 February 2007 and cheques supported the Wife’s position that she had contributed at least $82,010. On the totality of the evidence, I found that it was more likely that the Wife contributed $82,010 to the purchase price of [Property 2].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 As such, the respective parties’ direct contributions were as follows:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">S/N</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Expense</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Husband / $</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Wife / $</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">1. </div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Purchase Price</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">317,990</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">82,010</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">2. </div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Legal Fees and Stamp Fees</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">7,000</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">2,568</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">3. </div></td><td><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">Construction Costs</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">125,195</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">194,656</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">4. </div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Architects’, Surveyors’, and Engineers’ Fees, Payment to Government Authorities; Fixtures and Furnishings</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">25,990</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">74,010</div></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><div class="Table-Text text-left">Total direct contribution in acquiring [Property 2] ($829,419)</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">476,175</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">353,244</div></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><div class="Table-Text text-left">Ratio</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">57.41%</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">42.59%</div></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><div class="Table-Text text-left">Direct contribution to [Property 2] valued at $2,100,000</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">1,205,610</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">894,390</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(D) Mazda Car</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Both parties agreed with the Husband’s values for the parties’ respective direct contributions as follows: $40,000 from the Husband, and $101,988 from the Wife (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, total of $141,988 at the time of purchase). I accepted that this would give a ratio of 28.17% for the Husband to 71.83% for the Wife. Based on the current value of $52,500, I therefore attributed $14,789 and $37,711 to the Husband and Wife’s direct contributions respectively. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Ratio (direct contributions)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 The parties’ direct contributions were as follows:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">S/N</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Asset </span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Husband / $</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Wife / $</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">1. </div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Sub-total of agreed direct contribution</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">4,232,974</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">1,850,969</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">2. </div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">[Property 1]</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">1,781,100</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">2,718,900</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">3. </div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">[Property 2]</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">1,205,610</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">894,390</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">4. </div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Mazda Car </div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">14,789</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">37,711</div></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><div class="Table-Text text-left">Total direct contribution</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">7,234,473</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">5,501,970</div></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><div class="Table-Text text-left">Ratio</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">56.80%</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-right">43.20%</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As such, the direct contribution ratio was 57:43 in favour of the Husband.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Indirect contribution ratio </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The Husband submitted that the ratio of indirect contributions should be 70:30 in his favour. The Wife submitted that the ratio should be 20:80 in her favour. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 In relation to indirect contributions, the court considers both indirect financial and non-financial contributions to reach one indirect contribution ratio. Since indirect contributions such as parenting and homemaking are “incapable of being reduced into monetary terms”, the values ascribed to such contributions are “necessarily a matter of impression and judgment of the court” (<span class="font-italic">ANJ </span>at [24]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The Husband submitted that he made indirect financial contributions by “letting the Wife use his half-share of the rental income from … [Property 2] towards the family’s expenses” and “making direct payments for certain expenses”. Excluding the costs of the domestic helper, the family’s expenses were generally “less or almost equal to the rental income” such that “effectively, the parties were equally bearing these expenses”. The Husband also made payments for: rental of [Property 4] during the period from November 2004 to May 2006 for a total of $48,114; purchase of Mitsubishi car for a sum of $74,178; property tax on [Property 2] during the period from February 2005 to June 2020 for a total of $40,595; maintenance works at the parties’ properties for a total of $52,123; domestic help  during the period from 2011 to 2014 and 2017 for a total of $32,890; holiday expenses; and other miscellaneous household expenses. The Husband therefore submitted that, for indirect financial contributions, a ratio of 60:40 in favour of the Husband was appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The Wife disagreed that the income earned from [Property 2], which was rented out since 2007, should be “construed as [the Husband’s] half share of the indirect contributions towards the family” because the Husband used part of the rental income for “his <span class="font-italic">personal</span> expenses” and not just the “household expenses” [emphasis in original]. According to the Wife, such personal expenses, which included his air tickets, overseas expenses, personal insurance, personal medical bills and personal investment subscriptions, charged to the Wife’s supplementary credit card were never reimbursed for by the Husband. The monthly bill for that supplementary credit card ranged from $442 to $5,700. The credit card expenses were paid for using the “rental income of [Property 2] that she received” and, when the bills exceeded the rental income, the Wife “solely covered it”. Such arrangement “continued until May 2017 when the marriage first broke down” and “the supplementary credit card [was] cancelled in 2019 after the marriage broke down for the second time”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The Wife also made payments for: household expenses (such as costs of domestic help, utility bills and food); annual family holidays prior to August 2017; generally maintained the family’s lifestyle and built the family’s “nest egg”; paid $100,000 for the Husband’s car; and purchased instruments to support the Children’s hobbies. Concerning the Husband’s indirect contributions from 2017, the Wife submitted that such contributions were “for an ulterior purpose” and hence should be “disregarded”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 With respect to the indirect financial contributions such as paying off the general household expenditure, it was not disputed that parties used the rental incomes from [Property 2]. The Wife also did not dispute the Husband’s indirect financial contributions in respect of [Property 4]’s rental, property tax and maintenance for the parties’ properties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 I did not accept the Wife’s submission that the Husband’s indirect contributions from 2017 onwards “should be disregarded” on the basis that the Husband “desperately wanted a reconciliation, and he did all he could to woo back the [Wife]”. The Husband’s efforts in reimbursing the Wife and taking the family on trips, even though such efforts were made after the parties faced a difficult time in their marital relationship, nevertheless contributed to the overall welfare of the family. The Husband should therefore be credited for his efforts during that period accordingly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 From the above, it was evident that parties’ indirect financial contributions varied through the years. On a whole, I accepted that both parties worked together to shoulder the family’s expenses which included medical bills, family holidays, the Children’s hobbies and maintaining their properties in approximately equal proportions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 In respect of indirect non-financial contributions, the Husband submitted that he assumed “most of the duties of a homemaker and the primary caregiver” to the Children. According to the Husband, his flexible work hours “allowed him to carry out various duties” such as regularly “ferrying the Children and the Wife”. The Husband also: helped with chores; bought groceries; ensured that there were meals at home for the Children; planned outings for the Children; signed off [C]’s report book; gave a presentation to [C]’s class; liaised with [B]’s teachers; brought [C] on a father-daughter trip in June 2019; and planned for [B] a father-son trip in September 2019 which was eventually cancelled.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 The Husband also submitted that the Wife’s indirect non-financial contribution be reduced “because of her conduct” in “overzealous physical disciplining of the Children that resulted in a [personal protection order] being granted in 2020”. In support of his claim, the Husband relied on <span class="font-italic">Chan Tin Sun v Fong Quay Sim </span>[2015] 2 SLR 195 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Tin Sun</span>”). While the Husband accepted that the Wife’s “misconduct [was] not as serious as that in the <span class="font-italic">Chan Tin Sun </span>case”, he was of the view that such conduct was sufficiently serious to warrant a reduction of her indirect non-financial contribution due to the personal protection order in favour of the Husband and the Children.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 The Wife submitted that the Husband spent “substantial amounts of time away from home”, even during key events such as the Wife’s final month of pregnancy in 2005 and shortly after the Wife had given birth to [B]. The Husband responded that he had “travelled for a total … of 409 days …, which is equivalent to 7% of the time”. According to the Wife, she: was the “[p]rimary caregiver of the Children and sole parenting for at least 6 months” after the birth of the Children and in 2010 when the Husband travelled to settle his late father’s estates; supported the Husband “throughout his myriad of unsuccessful business ventures”; supported the Husband “when his relationship with [B] broke down in 2017”; emotionally supported the Husband “as he struggled to find full-time employment”; and cared for the Children when the Husband “suffered a mental breakdown in mid-2017 and flew to Perth, Australia to seek treatment”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The parties agreed that the engagement of a domestic helper did not detract from each party’s contributions to managing the household as a whole (<span class="font-italic">Pang Rosaline v Chan Kong Chin </span>[2009] 4 SLR 935 at [20]). As such, each party was credited for their respective contributions in managing the household throughout the marriage regardless of whether the parties had employed domestic help. The parties also agreed that the Husband was abroad on multiple occasions throughout the marriage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 From the foregoing, it was evident that parties’ indirect contributions varied through the years. I accepted that the Wife had, on multiple occasions, acted as the sole caregiver to the Children when the Husband was abroad for weeks at a time. In addition, the Wife supported the Husband and the Children during the trying periods of the marriage such as when the Husband’s businesses did not come to fruition. In the Husband’s letter to the Wife dated 3 August 2017, the Wife had “[t]hrough it all, … stood by [him]” and is a “fabulous mother and wife” whose “great motherly love and sacrifice for [their] son to achieve greatly for his PSLE proves thus”. Still, the Husband could not be said to have been largely absent in the marriage and contributed little to the welfare of the family. On the facts, I found that the Husband did meaningfully utilise his free time to contribute to the welfare of the family by managing the Children’s schedules and ferrying them in between activities. Taking a broad brush approach, I found that the ratio of parties’ indirect contributions to the marriage was approximately 55:45 in favour of the Wife. The assignment of the ratio for indirect contributions is not a mathematical science. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">USB </span>has explained (at [43]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the broad-brush approach should be applied with particular vigour in assessing the parties’ <span class="font-italic">indirect </span>contributions. This would serve the purpose of discouraging needless acrimony during the ancillary proceedings. Practically, this means that, in ascertaining the ratio of indirect contributions, the court should not focus unduly on the minutiae of family life. Instead, the court should direct its attention to broad factual indicators when determining the ratio of parties’ indirect contributions. These would include factors such as the length of the marriage, the number of children, and which party was the children’s primary caregiver.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 I did not accept the Husband’s submission that the Wife’s indirect non-financial contribution should be reduced. I did not think that the legal principle established in <span class="font-italic">Chan Tin Sun </span>was applicable on the present facts. In that case, a negative value of 7% was ascribed to the wife’s indirect contributions due to her rather extreme misconduct in systematically poisoning the husband for at least one year. The threshold to be met is thus a high one and conduct must be both extreme and undisputed (<span class="font-italic">Chan Tin Sun </span>at [25]). Such high threshold was not satisfied on the facts of the present case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Average and final ratio </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Applying the <span class="font-italic">ANJ </span>approach, which is a broad brush approach, I found that the average ratio was approximately 50:50, worked out as follows:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Ratios</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Husband</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Wife</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Direct Contribution Ratio</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">57</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">43</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Indirect Contribution Ratio</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">≈ 45</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">≈ 55</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">Average Ratio</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">≈ 50</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center">≈ 50</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 I found that an equal division of assets was indeed just and equitable on the facts of this case. This was a marriage where parties recognised their independence and that assets external to the marriage such as pre-marriage gifts need not be divided on divorce, but during the marriage, they cooperated and built their family and wealth together using various resources and by various efforts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 The total pool of matrimonial assets valued at <span class="font-weight-bold">$13,233,139 </span>was to be divided equally between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 The parties should work out the consequential orders. If they are able to come to an agreement on them, they may send a draft to the court for approval, indicating their consent before extracting the order. The parties shall have the liberty to apply to court, should they be unable to come to an agreement on the consequential orders. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 I made it clear that these orders on the division of assets are final; thus for purposes of the filing of an appeal against these orders, the date of my judgment in respect of these orders is 23 March 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The matter of costs shall be agreed between the parties, and if not agreed, they are at liberty to write into the court for directions in respect of costs.
