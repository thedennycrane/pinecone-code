Upon his plea of guilt, the Respondent, a 27 year old male Singaporean, was convicted by the District Judge and sentenced to a term of two days’ imprisonment and a fine of $5,000.00 (with four weeks’ imprisonment in default of payment) (see the District Judge’s grounds of decision at <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Andrew Koh Weiwen</span> [2015] SGMC 33 (the “GD”)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Although this is a simple offence of voluntarily causing hurt, disputed facts relevant to sentence were inconclusively dealt with at the proceedings below. The admitted Statement of Facts (“SOF”) tendered by the Prosecution provided scant details of the events immediately preceding the physical attack, which allowed room for different versions of facts to emerge. Fortunately, the Prosecution and the Respondent managed to resolve their differences after a short adjournment was granted to them. After considering the submissions of the parties and the precedent cases, I am of the view that the sentence imposed by the District Judge is manifestly inadequate having regard to all the material facts and circumstances of the case. I allow the appeal, and order the Respondent’s sentence to be enhanced to four weeks’ imprisonment instead.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The victim, Mr Lai Yongwen (“Mr Lai”), was waiting for a taxi with two other friends in the early morning at or around 6 am on 6 July 2014 in front of St James Power Station, a nightlife venue along Sentosa Gateway. The Respondent was in the vicinity with a glass bottle of liquor (the “Martell bottle”) after drinking with his friends at a nightclub in the area. The Respondent approached Mr Lai and suddenly hit him on the head with the Martell bottle. The Respondent also elbowed Mr Lai on the nose in the subsequent fracas while Mr Lai was attempting to stop the Respondent from attacking him further. As a result, Mr Lai sought medical treatment at Singapore General Hospital. His medical report dated 30 July 2014 indicated that he had suffered two superficial lacerations: one over the scalp measuring 3 cm, and the other over his nose measuring 0.5 cm. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Respondent, a first-time offender, pleaded guilty to the offence at an early stage, and had offered compensation to Mr Lai.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The proceedings below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 After the Respondent was convicted, the Prosecution addressed the court on sentence and sought a custodial sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment. The Prosecution pointed out that the glass bottle used was a “dangerous weapon” and opined that it was “fortunate that the victim suffered only lacerations” (see [12] of the GD). In the written mitigation plea, it was brought up that counsel for the Respondent was instructed that the Respondent had witnessed a verbal fracas that morning and had seen his friend surrounded by a group of people, before he had joined in to “help his friend” who was being assaulted by the group. He then used the Martell bottle he had to hit Mr Lai. It was not anticipated that the Respondent would be involved in a fight but he “had used the bottle as he was fighting with the group of people”. As a result, the Respondent “suffered facial cuts and bruises to his face and body with blood streaming down from his face”. In response, the Prosecution stated that the scenario painted by the Respondent where he was there to help a friend being assaulted was not borne out by investigation as there was only a verbal fracas with no physical contact between the parties until the Respondent hit Mr Lai with the Martell bottle.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The District Judge sentenced the Respondent to a very brief term of imprisonment of only two days and a fine of $5,000.00 (with four weeks’ imprisonment in default of payment). He noted the fact-specificity of sentencing under s 323 of the Penal Code and emphasised the norm that where only minor injuries were caused, the offence was dealt with by the imposition of a fine. The District Judge then proceeded to compare Mr Lai’s injuries (of two superficial lacerations) to the victims’ injuries in five cases under s 323 where only fines were imposed, and concluded that Mr Lai’s injuries were much less serious than the victims’ in those five cases (see [33] of the GD).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The District Judge also noted that (a) Mr Lai was not a “vulnerable victim”; (b) the Respondent did not have a record of violence and was not in a position of authority; (c) the attack was not racially motivated; (d) the Respondent acted on impulse; and (e) there was no provocation (see [31] of the GD). The District Judge inferred genuine remorse on the part of the Respondent, based on his plea of guilt and his offer of compensation to Mr Lai (which was rejected as Mr Lai’s medical expenses were settled by his insurance).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Lastly, the District Judge was of the view that the “singular” aggravating factor in the case was the fact that the Respondent had used a weapon, the Martell bottle, to hit Mr Lai once on the head. The District Judge also apparently disregarded Mr Lai’s second laceration over his nose on the basis that it was not caused by the Martell bottle, but by the Respondent’s elbow (see [35] of the GD). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The crux of the Prosecution’s appeal lies in its case that the present matter involves an unprovoked and unrelenting attack that employed the use of a dangerous weapon on a particularly vulnerable part of the victim’s body. The attack was a continuing one, as evidenced from the fact that the victim had to stop the Respondent from further attacks. The Prosecution submits that the District Judge had wrongly emphasised the absence of certain aggravating factors, as opposed to focusing on the aggravating factors that were in fact present. Further, the Prosecution submits that the District Judge appeared to have aligned the sentencing in this case to other cases that had materially different factual matrices, and ignored other s 323 precedents where substantial imprisonment terms were imposed in cases where weapons had been used, however minor the extent of injuries caused to the victims. Based on the various sentencing precedents, the Prosecution submits that the sentence imposed on the Respondent should be enhanced to four weeks’ imprisonment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Disputed/unascertained facts relevant to sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Despite the SOF having been admitted without qualification by the Respondent before his conviction on his plea of guilt, there were several facts<span class="font-italic"> </span>(some disputed) <span class="font-italic">relevant to sentenc</span><span class="font-italic">e</span> that were not ascertained or resolved at the proceedings below as could be seen from a perusal of the GD and notes of evidence:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) What were the surrounding circumstances immediately prior to the Respondent suddenly approaching Mr Lai and hitting him on the head with the Martell bottle?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Were there other people involved? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Did the Martell bottle break upon impact?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Was the Respondent injured in the incident, and if so, how?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 From my examination of the proceedings below, I have two observations to make: (i) if the Prosecution objects to or disputes certain factual assertions made in the course of mitigation which have a material impact on sentence, the Defence <span class="font-italic">must</span> either withdraw those statements, provide proof or call evidence via a <span class="font-italic">Newton</span> hearing; and (ii) any aggravating facts that the Prosecution wishes to rely on in its submission on sentence should be included in the SOF to minimise any subsequent dispute and the need for a <span class="font-italic">Newton</span> hearing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In the mitigation plea at the hearing below, it was asserted by the Respondent that he had joined in to “help his friend” who was being assaulted by the group. However, the Prosecution had objected to this and categorically stated its position that this was not “borne out by investigation”. However, it seems that the Respondent is still taking the position during the appeal before me that he had helped his friend, and that there was a <span class="font-italic">physical</span> fracas <span class="font-italic">before</span> he used the Martell bottle to hit the victim. Chan Sek Keong CJ’s comments in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Aniza bte Essa </span>[2009] 3 SLR(R) 327 at [61] on the mitigation process in plead guilty proceedings are instructive here:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The existing practice of the Prosecution in tendering to the court an agreed statement of facts and of defence counsel in providing the Prosecution with a copy of the mitigation speech before the sentencing hearing has made the mitigation process simple. This practice minimises any dispute between the Prosecution and the Defence on what mitigation statements are to be admitted without proof. This practice has rendered a <span class="font-italic">Newton</span> hearing (see<span class="font-italic"> R v Robert John Newton</span> (1982) 4 Cr App R (S) 388) a rarity in our courts. <span class="font-italic">Where the Prosecution objects to any unsubstantiated assertions in the mitigation speech, the Defence will either have to withdraw the statements, provide proof acceptable to the Prosecution or call evidence</span>. This may be regarded as an analogous form of the <span class="font-italic">Newton</span> hearing, which is also rare in our sentencing practice. If the Prosecution does not object to the assertions made by the Defence, the court is entitled to accept them and give such weight to them as it thinks fit.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 As the Prosecution had clearly objected to the fact that the Respondent had to help his friend who was already involved in a physical fracas and the Defence had not responded appropriately at the hearing below to back up this assertion not found in the admitted SOF, I am not minded to allow the Respondent to continue asserting this disputed fact at this stage. All disputed facts relevant to sentence should have been resolved at the hearing below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Thus, the SOF tendered by the Prosecution and admitted by an accused person, along with the charge(s), are crucial in setting out the admitted facts for the court’s consideration during sentencing in plead guilty cases. Just as the Prosecution cannot introduce new aggravating facts <span class="font-italic">beyond</span> the admitted facts by the back door in its submissions on sentence whether at the hearing below or subsequently at the appeal, the Defence similarly cannot slip in new unsubstantiated mitigating facts by the back door through its submission on sentence at the appeal or by relying on disputed mitigating facts in its mitigation plea which remain unresolved at the hearing below. This point was emphasised by See Kee Oon JC in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Development 26 Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 1 SLR 309 (“<span class="font-italic">Development 26</span>”) at [16]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">When accused persons plead guilty, their plea marks their acceptance of the charges against them as well as what is set out in the statement of facts if one is prepared. The charges and the statement of facts constitute the <span class="font-italic">four corners of the case</span> against them. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In <span class="font-italic">Development 26</span>, no SOF was prepared during the proceedings below and the respondent there had pleaded guilty to facts “as per the charges”. On appeal, the Judicial Commissioner was of the view that the appeal should be confined to the facts that the accused person had admitted to, and that the Prosecution could not seek to alter the entire factual basis for the plea of guilt by adducing additional evidence on appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Reverting to the present case, I am of the view that the SOF tendered by the Prosecution and admitted to without qualification by the Respondent below is inadequate and bare. The SOF fails to flesh out adequately all the relevant facts of the case which are material to sentence. If it is part of the plea bargain that certain aggravating facts or disputed facts relevant to sentence are to be omitted, the Prosecution will omit them from the SOF and will not rely on them to address the court on sentence. The other side of the coin is that during mitigation, the Defence should not be addressing the court on the basis that those aggravating facts or disputed mitigating facts omitted from the SOF as part of the plea bargain are absent or present respectively as that would be misleading. I reproduce the short one-page SOF in full: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1. The accused is Andrew Koh Weiwen, a 26 year-old male Singaporean, bearing NRIC No. S8851611G.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. The victim is Lai Yongwen, a 25 year-old male Singaporean.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3. On 06 July 2014, the police received a call with the following message: <span class="font-italic">Required AB, Someone injured.</span> The incident location was given as Sentosa Gateway, in front of St James Power Station, Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4. Investigations revealed that on 06 July 2014, at or about 06.00am, at the incident location, the accused was walking with a bottle of liquor. At that point in time, the victim was also there waiting for a taxi with two of his friends.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5. Suddenly, the accused approached the victim and hit him on the head with the bottle that he was holding. The accused then elbowed the victim on the nose while the victim was trying to stop the accused from attacking him further.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">6. The victim was subsequently conveyed to Singapore General Hospital and sought medical treatment there. His medical report dated 30 July 2014 indicated that the victim suffered 2 superficial lacerations, one over the scalp measuring 3cm and another over the nose measuring 0.5cm, both as a result of the accused’s attack.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7. By virtue of the above, the accused has thereby committed an offence under s.323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">8. The accused is thus charged accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 It is a basic tenet that the Prosecution is duty-bound to assist the court to make a decision on sentence. As the Prosecution and the Defence may under certain circumstances compromise in terms of what material facts relevant to sentence are to be included or excluded in the SOF and the mitigation plea in the process of achieving a plea bargain, the court is necessarily limited in its consideration to only those material facts that have been presented in the SOF and mitigation plea. However on occasions, prosecutors may simply tender an SOF light in narrative detail to dispose of cases quickly for practical reasons. This case appears to be one such example. The SOF here is very brief. It does not paint a full picture of what had occurred. As a result, it allows room for parties to differ subsequently on what, if anything, had happened immediately preceding the physical attack. The SOF also gives the impression that any fracas that occurred was in fact only between the Respondent and the victim, Mr Lai, and that there were no other persons involved.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 As the parties initially continued to dispute the facts as to what had happened prior to the physical attack (which I reiterate ought to have been resolved at the hearing below but apparently were not), I instructed counsel for the Respondent to take instructions and then confer with the Prosecution to sort out all disputed facts relevant to sentence to see if they could come to an agreement on what had occurred on that morning of 6 July 2014. I also indicated that I was perplexed as to why the Respondent would suddenly approach the victim and hit the victim on the head with a bottle for no rhyme or reason as the bare SOF appears to suggest at [5]. Was it a sudden random attack in the early hours of the morning on an unsuspecting member of the public waiting for a taxi? Eventually, the parties agreed on the facts and explained to me that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) there was only a <span class="font-italic">v</span><span class="font-italic">erbal</span>—and not a physical—fracas, <span class="font-italic">before</span> the Respondent suddenly hit the victim on the head with the Martell bottle (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> the verbal fracas led to the sudden physical attack on the victim with the Martell bottle and it was not a random attack on a stranger waiting for a taxi, which would have been more aggravating);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the Martell bottle <span class="font-italic">broke</span> upon impact when the Respondent smashed the bottle on the victim’s head;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the Respondent was injured himself and bloodied due to the physical fracas that ensued; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) other people then joined in the physical fracas that followed (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> it was the Respondent’s sudden physical attack on the victim that ignited the subsequent physical fracas where several other persons joined in).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 For the record, had the parties not come to an agreement with respect to the material facts that they wish to rely on for the purpose of  sentence, I would have remitted the case back to the District Judge for a <span class="font-italic">Newton</span> hearing. Although <span class="font-italic">Newton </span>hearings are exceptional, the court should hear evidence if facts material to sentence are contested and make a finding to do justice and sentence the offender on the basis of accurate facts (see <span class="font-italic">Ng Chun </span><span class="font-italic">Hian v Public Prosecutor </span>[2014] 2 SLR 783 at [24]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Having now established the relevant facts material to sentence (above at [18]), I move on to consider the adequacy of the sentence imposed on the Respondent by the District Judge.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Fact-specificity in hurt offences</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The factual matrices in offences of hurt vary considerably. The appropriate sentence for each case must necessarily depend on its specific facts and circumstances. The sentencing judge has to consider all the relevant factors affecting sentence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The Prosecution interprets the District Judge’s emphasis that there were no aggravating factors such as premeditation, group action, a vulnerable victim, racial motivation, a record of violence, etc. (at [31] of the GD) to be a misconstrued placement of mitigating weight on an absence of aggravating factors (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v AOM</span> [2011] 2 SLR 1057 at [37]). However, from the overall reasoning in the GD, I find that the District Judge was not erroneously treating the absence of aggravating factors as mitigating. Instead, he had <span class="font-italic">started</span> from the principle that in hurt offences, where minor injury is caused the offence is usually dealt with by the imposition of a fine, unless certain aggravating factors are present to indicate a sufficient level of seriousness to breach the custody threshold. Hence, he was in fact treating the lack of those aggravating factors as <span class="font-italic">non-factors</span>. On the other hand, the Prosecution is taking the position that where a dangerous weapon is used, the appropriate <span class="font-italic">starting point</span> would be an imprisonment of a few weeks, even if the injuries suffered are not serious. Herein lies the diametrically different <span class="font-italic">starting point</span><span class="font-italic">s</span> between the sentencing analysis of the District Judge and what is being proposed by the Prosecution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In my view, <span class="font-italic">all</span> sentencing factors must be taken into consideration: be it the degree of deliberation, extent and duration of attack, nature of injury, the presence of provocation or the use of a weapon. By taking either the seriousness of the injury or the use of a dangerous weapon as determinative of the sentence would be over-emphasising one factor over others and may not result in individualised justice.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Protecting public transport users</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Although the District Judge had concluded that the victim was not a “vulnerable victim” (GD at [31]), the Prosecution is taking the position that the victim was in a “vulnerable position of waiting to use public transport”. In fairness to the District Judge, I should point out that this submission was not made to him below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Vulnerability ought to be analysed in relative terms, and our local case law has considered this factor in instances where victims are public transport workers (<span class="font-italic">Wong Hoi Len v Public Prosecutor </span>[2009] 1 SLR(R) 115; <span class="font-italic">Balbir</span><span class="font-italic"> Singh s/o Amar Singh v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</span> [2010] 3 SLR 784) and children or spouses (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Luan </span><span class="font-italic">Yuanxin</span> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 613). The Prosecution cites an Australian criminal state court authority for its proposition that persons waiting for, or using, public transport are vulnerable (<span class="font-italic">Va</span><span class="font-italic">eila v The Queen</span> [2010] NSWCCA 113 at [22]–[23]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Court has, on a number of occasions, made clear that one of the fundamental features of the criminal justice system is to regulate the protection of people, going about their ordinary business, from being attacked or set upon. These principles are fundamental to any system that seeks to regulate society and were summarised by Gleeson CJ in <span class="font-italic">R v </span><span class="font-italic">Ranse</span> (Court of Criminal Appeal, 8 August 1994, unreported) in which his Honour said, at p 8:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">One of the primary purposes of the system of criminal justice is to keep the peace.

This does not mean that whenever a weapon is used, the custody threshold is automatically breached. Factors such as the presence of significant provocation (such as in <span class="font-italic">Jewel </span><span class="font-italic">Shaikh Khorshad Ali </span>and <span class="font-italic">Du </span><span class="font-italic">Guangwen</span>) or the fact that the weapon used is not inherently dangerous (such as a ballpoint pen in <span class="font-italic">Kang</span><span class="font-italic"> Chuan Beng</span>) may still lead to the court imposing a fine instead. However, when a <span class="font-italic">dangerous weapon</span> is deliberately used without significant provocation, the sentencing norm should reflect this serious aggravating factor and the general deterrence needed. Although the injuries actually suffered by the victim may not be that serious or life-threatening, the <span class="font-italic">potential</span> serious harm that could be inflicted should be taken into account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In the present case, the Respondent had used a Martell bottle as a weapon to hit the victim on the head. This is an inherently dangerous weapon made of glass, and the Martell bottle had in fact smashed upon impact on the victim’s head, indicating the substantial amount of force used by the Respondent. The sharp edges of a broken bottle can potentially cause deep lacerations and serious bodily injuries. It is fortuitous that more serious injuries were not caused. I also have to take into account the fact that the attack with the glass bottle was directed at the victim’s head, a vulnerable part of the body (see also <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Phui Moi </span>at [14] and <span class="font-italic">Sulochana</span><span class="font-italic"> d/o Tambiah Dirumala Sakkrawarthi v Rajalakshmi Ramoo </span>[2004] 1 SLR(R) 214 at [20]), and that the nature of the attack extended beyond that one hit, with the victim having to stop the Respondent from attacking him further. Furthermore, the Respondent triggered the cycle of violence when he first used the Martell bottle as a weapon to hit the victim. The Respondent also caused the existing verbal fracas to turn into a physical one with others joining in. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 However some mitigating factors are present in this case: (i) the Respondent apparently acted on impulse without premeditation, in response to an on-going verbal fracas; (ii) the Respondent is a first-time offender; and (iii) the Respondent had pleaded guilty without delay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 However, I am of the view that the aggravating circumstances (laid out above at [32]), coupled with the fact that the incident occurred to a member of the public waiting for public transport in the early morning (see above at [24]–[27]), warrant the imposition of a longer custodial sentence beyond the term of two days imposed by the District Judge. I also note that there was an <span class="font-italic">existing</span> verbal fracas that led to the sudden physical attack and it was not a <span class="font-italic">random</span> attack on a stranger waiting for a taxi, which would have been much more aggravating. Nonetheless, an imprisonment term of two days is far out of sync with the sentencing precedents where weapons were used. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I agree with the Prosecution that an imprisonment term of four weeks would be appropriate in the present case. The present case is slightly more aggravated than <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Phui Moi</span>, where the offender was also the one who first resorted to violence, where the attack using a motorcycle helmet was also on a vulnerable part of the body, and where the attack was also a sustained one beyond the first attack. Here, the weapon used (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> a glass bottle) is inherently more dangerous (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> in comparison with a motorcycle helmet), and the attack occurred in a public place where the victim was waiting for public transport. The present case is also more aggravated than <span class="font-italic">Abdulla</span><span class="font-italic">h Al Imran </span>where there was significant physical provocation by the victim, who first pushed the offender and punched him on the head. Broadly speaking, the present case is less aggravated than<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Teo Hee Huat </span>where the victim’s injuries were more serious (potential permanent disfigurement of the face); as well as <span class="font-italic">Bian Yong Liang</span> where, although the victim had seriously provoked the offender first by hitting his head with a metal bunk bed ladder, the offender had retaliated viciously with a cooking pan and thereafter also a hammer (the latter after the fight had already broken up) to hit the victim from behind.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Cases of causing simple hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code may not be so easily dealt with in the absence of all the relevant facts material to sentence. Unless constrained by the plea bargaining process or other valid practical reasons, the SOF tendered by the Prosecution ought to paint a fuller picture and flesh out the relevant facts material to <span class="font-italic">both</span> guilt and sentence to assist the judge given that the factual circumstances in each case can vary greatly and the sentencing range for the offence is fairly wide. If the Prosecution objects to unsubstantiated assertions in mitigation which are material to sentence, the Defence must either withdraw those assertions, provide proof or call evidence via a <span class="font-italic">Newton</span> hearing. However, I recognise that there can be instances where the pure elements making out the charge(s) proceeded with by the Prosecution are not disputed and hence, the plea of guilt is taken on that basis with the SOF setting out just those facts sufficient to establish the elements of the offence(s), whilst leaving aside all other disputed matters of fact relevant to sentence to be decided later at a separate <span class="font-italic">Newton</span> hearing subsequent to a conviction on the charge(s). This will at least save some of the court’s time that would otherwise be needed for a trial on purely matters of guilt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Having said that, when the parties do not contemplate any need for a separate <span class="font-italic">Newton</span> hearing and they are proceeding on the basis that all matters of conviction and sentence are to be dealt with in one proceeding when the accused pleads guilty, it is necessary for all the parties to agree on the facts relied upon in support of the conviction, including those material facts to be relied upon as aggravating or mitigating facts by the respective parties for the purpose of sentence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Having considered the SOF and the material facts relevant to sentence that the parties have managed to agree on, and after taking into account the various sentencing precedents and the aggravating and mitigating circumstances in the present case, I find the Respondent’s sentence of two days’ imprisonment and a fine of $5,000 to be manifestly inadequate having regard to the unprovoked, sudden and sustained nature of the attack where a dangerous weapon had been directed with considerable force at the head of the victim who was waiting for public transport in the early hours of the morning. Accordingly, I allow the Prosecution’s appeal and enhance the imprisonment to a term of four weeks. The imprisonment term of two days and the fine of $5,000 are set aside.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chan Seng Onn<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mohamed Faizal and Ho Lian-Yi (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Appellant;<br/>Eddie Koh (S H Koh &amp; Co) for the Respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
