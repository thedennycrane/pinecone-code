This issue of fact lies at the heart of this case. In essence, it will require me to consider the plaintiff’s state of mind at the time he signed the DOT and whether he was influenced by the conduct of the second defendant and her father into signing it.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, should the DOT be set aside because of the circumstances in which the plaintiff signed it? This issue requires me to consider whether the DOT should be set aside because it was procured as a result of misrepresentation, mistake, undue influence or because it was an unconscionable transaction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 For the reasons detailed below, my view is that at the time the plaintiff signed the DOT, he was labouring under a misunderstanding of the DOT’s true legal effect, on which he had been misled by the second defendant’s false representations. I am also of the opinion that all four vitiating factors on which the plaintiff relies as the primary grounds for the invalidity of the DOT are made out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 A separate set of issues is raised by the plaintiff’s position on the validity of the DOT as a legal instrument, regardless of whether the vitiating factors he relies on are made out. This may be regarded as the plaintiff’s secondary case, in the sense that he has focused his case on attempting to set aside the DOT on the four vitiating factors. His secondary case raises the following issues:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Does the DOT define the trust property with reasonable certainty?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If it does, does the trust property extend to the plaintiff’s interest under his mother’s will, and if so, what is the scope of that interest which is trust property?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In brief, my view is that the DOT defines the trust property with reasonable certainty and includes, at the very least, the assets the plaintiff owned and the annuity his mother’s will provided him with. As I explain at [142] below, it is not necessary for me to consider whether it extends to the assets he obtained later by the deed of family arrangement he concluded with his sister. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Finally, in the event that the plaintiff’s primary and secondary cases are rejected, the plaintiff’s alternative case is that the second defendant is liable to him in damages in tort and contract for failing properly to advise him on the DOT. As I have decided in the plaintiff’s favour on his primary case, I need not consider whether his alternative case is made out. I also need not consider the defendants’ counterclaims.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: Why did the plaintiff sign the DOT?</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Five principal factual issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Having regard to the parties’ pleaded cases and the evidence, I consider that there are five principal factual issues that I must determine to decide why the plaintiff signed the DOT:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, prior to 26 March 2014, did the plaintiff intend to create a DOT like the one the second defendant presented to him that day?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, what was the plaintiff’s state of mind on 26 March 2014? In particular, was he suffering from grief to a degree that made him susceptible to the second defendant’s influence?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, how did the second defendant act towards the plaintiff on the evening of 26 March 2014? In particular, what representations, if any, did she make to the plaintiff before he signed the DOT?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, was the second defendant’s father with the plaintiff at or before the time he signed the DOT on 26 March 2014? If he was, what representations, if any, did he make to the plaintiff before he signed the DOT?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Fifth, what was the plaintiff’s understanding of the effect of his signing the DOT on 26 March 2014 at the time he signed it, and how did he come to have that understanding?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I will deal with each of these issues in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(1) Did the plaintiff intend to create a DOT before 26 March 2014?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In my view, the first step to discerning why the plaintiff signed the DOT is to understand his state of mind that evening. An important aspect of that state of mind is whether he had ever wanted to draw up a DOT like the one he signed. The defendants contend that he did, and that the second defendant had, on her understanding of such a wish, drafted the DOT. The plaintiff, on his part, says that he was “totally caught by surprise” when, upon his return to the Stevens Road property, she asked him to her bedroom, gave him the DOT, and simply told him to “sign this”.

It does not comport with common sense that a young father who is still building his career would wish to divest himself of all his assets to provide for his son, when he can do so by other less drastic means, such as making a will; creating a trust which is more limited in scope, like the trust of the Scotts Road apartment; or maintaining an insurance policy which names the first defendant as a beneficiary.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) There is no evidence, aside from the second defendant’s bare allegation, that the plaintiff told the second defendant that he wanted a DOT. The second defendant’s evidence is that the plaintiff personally “reassured [her] that he would structure a plan so that no matter what happened to either [the plaintiff] or [the second defendant], [the first defendant] would not have to worry about finances”.

</div> However, there is no date on this entry. A voucher on the opposite page in the diary suggests that it was written on or around 12 February 2015. Hence, the entry sheds no light on the plaintiff’s state of mind at or around 26 March 2014 when he signed the DOT. Furthermore, the plaintiff’s stated desire to put a $10bn fortune into a trust for his children in fact suggests that he did not intend to put his assets into a trust for his children until he had acquired $10bn worth of assets. This is also consistent with his evidence in cross-examination that he had in mind the kind of trust used by families “like the Rothschilds”.

</div> On this issue, three aspects of their evidence are of particular significance. The first aspect concerns their assessment of why the plaintiff, having initially refused to sign the DOT on the evening of 26 March 2014, changed his mind and decided to sign it. Their views are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Dr Ung observed that the plaintiff was initially trying to “hide his assets” by lying to the second defendant at lunch about his mother’s will, but he later changed his mind in the evening and agreed to hold his assets on trust for the second defendant. Dr Ung opined, “from a psychiatric perspective”, that these facts indicated that the plaintiff was vulnerable to influence.

</div> Dr Ung did however qualify that if it could be shown that if the plaintiff, prior to the DOT, “had in mind [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] to give away all he had to the family”, then there would have been “no acting out of character”.

I have found that the plaintiff did not in fact have any such intention: see [40]–[41] above.

</div> That is why he lied to the second defendant that he received nothing under the will. I therefore accept Dr Ung’s opinion that the plaintiff’s decision to change his mind was a decision out of character and a sign that he was vulnerable to influence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The second significant aspect of the expert evidence relates to the fact that the plaintiff was able to carry out his daily responsibilities. He was able to go back to work, and he was otherwise sensible and rational. Dr Fones relied heavily on these facts to say that the plaintiff’s grief did not make him vulnerable to influence. However, Dr Fones also accepted during cross-examination that the plaintiff’s case contained a number of “red flags”. These refer to stress indicators which increase the degree of vulnerability experienced by the patient.

Dr Fones opined that an isolated individual, that is, an individual whose world revolves around only a small number of individuals with whom he shares a strong relationship, is likely to render him vulnerable to their influence.

He was not close to his sister as he was much younger than her and she had lived abroad since he was young. The plaintiff’s sense of isolation was unwittingly revealed by the second defendant herself during her cross-examination:

Thus, at the confrontation of 12 February 2015 (see [23] above), when he asked her why she had told him to leave, she admitted, “I didn’t want you. I didn’t want you around”.

You were just angry.”

She then misrepresented to him that the DOT would take effect only upon his death, and that he would be free, until then, to deal with his assets as he wished: see [26] above. In my judgment, the plaintiff has proved on a balance of probabilities that she made such a misrepresentation to him. I also agree with the plaintiff that the second defendant’s motive for making that misrepresentation to procure his signature on the DOT was to create an instrument by which she could exert control on the plaintiff and his assets in the event that their relationship turned sour.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Plaintiff’s Reply Submissions dated 8 September 2017 at para 14.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> My reasons are as follows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 First, the second defendant’s account of how the plaintiff signed the DOT is incredible. It is not disputed that the plaintiff initially refused to sign the DOT on the evening of 26 March 2014 because he did not wish to gift his assets in their entirety to his son. What is in dispute is why he changed his mind. The plaintiff’s account – that he was pressured into signing it and was misled on its legal effect – is at least plausible. The second defendant’s account is not. Having denied that she forced him to make an uninformed decision, her explanation is that the plaintiff, left to himself for a moment, simply decided voluntarily to sign the DOT. This was allegedly because, having argued with her about whether he should take on a project to convert the Bukit Timah property into an art gallery for his mother, he “saw the light” and decided not to pursue that project and instead resolved to spend more time with the second defendant.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-681a335e-ef84-4bd2-9509-2e5772dd5b32" data-toggle="modal" type="button">100</button></sup>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 This is not a plausible explanation for the plaintiff’s change of mind. The substance of the second defendant’s complaint concerning the art gallery proposal is that taking charge of the proposal would prevent the plaintiff from spending time with her and with their son. This complaint, however, does not address the plaintiff’s concern over the DOT, namely, why he should gift all his assets to their infant child. The only plausible assurance for that concern would have been a response to the effect that the DOT would have no effect on how the plaintiff could deal with his assets. That would have been a false assurance, of course, but that is the assurance, I find, that the second defendant gave him that evening. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Second, the second defendant, in my judgment, suspected on 26 March 2014 that the plaintiff’s mother had left him something under her will. The second defendant admitted in cross-examination that she knew by noon that day that the plaintiff had read his mother’s last will. At lunch, the contents of that will were discussed. It is common ground that this discussion led the plaintiff and his sister, as they had agreed to do, to lie to the second defendant that their mother had willed all her assets to charity. The plaintiff avers that he told this lie because the second defendant was interrogating him about the contents of his mother’s will. He also did not want her to know the size of his inheritance out of fear that she might covet it to support her extravagant lifestyle.

</div> The second defendant denies asking him about the will, but I reject this assertion and accept that plaintiff’s evidence that she did ask him about the will.

Her knowledge and her intention to take advantage of the plaintiff in this respect may be inferred from the circumstances under which the DOT was drawn up – which indicate an inexplicable sense of urgency in the second defendant to have the plaintiff sign a document with serious implications – and also from the second defendant’s conduct after 26 March 2014:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The second defendant had no good reason for preparing the DOT. She claims to have done so because she understood from the plaintiff that he had intended to draw up a trust of his assets in favour of their son.

Moreover, she admitted during cross-examination that she did not recall the plaintiff mentioning the word “trust” to her in relation to that intention.

</div> I do not accept this explanation. If an instrument as drastic in effect as the DOT was what the plaintiff had specifically intended, the second defendant would have (i) simply said that it was the plaintiff who wanted an instrument like the DOT or (ii) produced evidence to prove that he had such a specific wish.

This may be contrasted with how she facilitated the drafting and signing of the DOT for the Scotts Road apartment, which involved (i) ensuring that the plaintiff received advice on it from a solicitor, Mr Mitchell, (ii) preparing a typewritten copy of the DOT, and (iii) inserting an appropriate carve-out in the DOT to allow the plaintiff to profit from the property until their child turns 21. No such care was taken in relation to the DOT signed on 26 March 2014, which is striking given that the DOT was more drastic in effect in that it covered a far wider range of assets than did the DOT for the Scotts Road apartment.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) After obtaining the plaintiff’s signature on the DOT and appending to it her own, she kept the DOT in a safe,

</div> These facts support the plaintiff’s case that the second defendant was not concerned about the immediate effect of the DOT, but was simply keeping it as a safeguard to exert control over the plaintiff’s assets in the event he walked out on her.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The second defendant as early as June 2014 began asking Mr Mitchell via e-mail for a list of the plaintiff’s assets for the purposes of the trust created under the DOT.

</div> Her evidence is that she kept the plaintiff informed of these communications, but the objective evidence shows otherwise: the plaintiff was not copied in these e-mails. At the confrontation of 12 February 2015, the second defendant did not deny the plaintiff’s assertion that Mr Mitchell forwarded him the second defendant’s e-mails only in December 2014 and not earlier.

</div> In my view, there can be no reason for such covert behaviour on the part of the second defendant unless her intention was to conceal from the plaintiff her attempts to crystallise what she would be able to control under the DOT as a trustee.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Finally, she did not explain the DOT to the plaintiff.

</div> These features include (i) the scope of the assets the plaintiff was settling; (ii) the irrevocability of the DOT; (iii) the fact that the DOT would take immediate effect; and (iv) the plaintiff’s and the second defendant’s powers and responsibilities as joint trustees.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 For the reasons above, I find that the plaintiff has proved on a balance of probabilities that on the evening of 26 March 2014, the second defendant told him that the DOT was intended as a safeguard and misrepresented to him that it would take effect only upon his death and that he would be free to deal with his assets until then.

The second defendant’s father denies that he was present in the room. The defendants’ case is that the second defendant went to her parents’ bedroom to inform them that the plaintiff was leaving the house, but her father did not go into her bedroom. The plaintiff subsequently signed the document by himself. In my judgment, the second defendant’s father was in fact with them in the bedroom when the second defendant made her representations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I begin with the observation that it is clear from the second defendant’s father’s defensive behaviour on the stand that his central aim during the trial was to distance himself from the affairs of the second defendant and the plaintiff.

I give two examples this behaviour. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The first is his inexplicable refusal to answer the question whether the DOT in his view was a standard document:

Whether I would sign or not sign is not an issue here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 It can be seen from this exchange that his initial response was to say that he did not know whether the document was a standard document. I find his claim of ignorance to be unbelievable, given that he is a senior lawyer. When counsel for the plaintiff persisted in that line of questioning, he retreated by declining to give his opinion on the basis that he was present only as a witness of fact. That appeared to me to be unnecessarily defensive and evasive. In cross-examination, it is a common and accepted practice to ask witnesses of fact for their opinion on a certain matter in order to establish whether they hold that opinion, not in order to establish whether that opinion is true. As a lawyer himself, the second defendant’s father must have known that the plaintiff’s counsel clearly intended the former and not the latter because it was the plaintiff’s very case that the DOT was not a standard document. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The second example is that during cross-examination, the second defendant’s father insisted that he and his wife had no reaction to the second defendant’s telling them that the plaintiff was leaving the Stevens Road property. I find this indifference surprising, given that the plaintiff was, after all, their son-in-law. Simple concern would have been apposite, but the second defendant’s father gave no reason for his equanimity. Again, this gave me the impression that he was trying to distance himself from the plaintiff’s affairs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Next, a key piece of evidence of his presence in the second defendant’s bedroom on the evening of 26 March 2014 comes from the transcript of the confrontation of 12 February 2015. During the confrontation, the plaintiff said to the defendant, “You even got your dad to read through it and to force me to sign it.”

</div> I find that the plaintiff has established on the balance of probabilities that the second defendant’s father was at some point in the evening of 26 March 2014 in the second defendant’s bedroom with the second defendant when she was trying to persuade the plaintiff to sign the DOT. The father conceded in cross-examination that he and the plaintiff shared a relationship of mutual respect. As the father lent a degree of legitimacy to the second defendant’s request, and as the plaintiff trusted the father, the plaintiff was willing to go along with her plan. I therefore accept the plaintiff’s case that he signed the DOT on the father’s assurance, “when he did not contradict anything that [the second defendant] said”, that the plaintiff was free to deal with his assets until he passed away, and that that the DOT was, in his words, “just a safekeeping”.

That was the very reason, he avers in his AEIC and also on the stand, for initially refusing to sign the DOT on the evening of 26 March 2014. In his AEIC, he said, “As I had no intention of giving away my assets to the 1st Defendant, I refused to sign the Declaration of Trust.”

</div> Likewise, his testimony during cross-examination was that in the evening of 26 March 2014, when the second defendant called him into her room and asked him to sign the DOT, he “refused to” and told her that “[he] was not prepared to give all my assets to [the first defendant]”.

</div> It is also reasonable to expect the plaintiff to at least have discerned from the DOT, which plainly bore the title “Trust Deed” (see [11] above), that he was by signing the deed creating a “trust”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Why then did he change his mind and sign the DOT? That is because the plaintiff was led by the second defendant to believe that he would be able freely to deal with the assets which he holds under that trust for his own benefit. While this may not be a correct conception of a trust as a matter of law, the important point is that it is the concept of the trust that the plaintiff had at the time he signed the DOT. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In this context, I gather the threads of my findings on the factual issues which I have already examined. First, the second defendant told the plaintiff on the evening of 26 March 2014 that (i) the DOT was in plain and simple English; (ii) the plaintiff could leave the Stevens Road property if he did not wish to sign the DOT; (iii) the DOT was simply a safeguard in the event that anything untoward happens to the plaintiff; and (iv) the legal effect of the DOT was that the plaintiff would be free to deal with his assets until his death. Second, the second defendant’s father was present when these assertions were made. He did not contradict them and thus lent weight to them. Third, the plaintiff accepted these assertions as true because (i) he was in a state of acute grief; (ii) he wanted to give the second defendant some reassurance so that she would stop hounding him; and (iii) he thought that the second defendant’s father legitimised his daughter’s assertions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 It is undisputed that after he had signed the DOT, he continued to spend his monies for his own benefit, even taking the second defendant on holiday to France.

</div> While he may well have done so using monies he obtained after he had signed the DOT, the point is that he used his assets for his personal benefit without drawing a distinction between assets which were beneficially his and assets which he and the second defendant held on trust for their son under the DOT. The DOT simply had no effect on the plaintiff’s understanding as to how he was to handle his assets. I infer from this that he must have considered that, after signing the DOT, he was free to deal with his assets as he pleased. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The second defendant argues that the plaintiff must have known the effect of the DOT as early as 9 May 2014, when he made a second DOT in respect of the Scotts Road apartment.

</div>
</div> It is undisputed that the plaintiff was properly advised on this matter and that he signed the DOT for the Scotts Road apartment willingly. He understood that its effect was to vest immediately his interest in the Scotts Road apartment into his son’s name. But this was subject to a proviso that he would retain certain rights in the property, one of which is the right to collect rent on the property for his own benefit until his son was 21 years of age. The defendants say that the plaintiff, with the benefit of being properly advised on how a trust operates, would have realised how the DOT he signed in March was intended to operate. Therefore, his decision not to challenge that DOT until February the following year shows that he did so as an afterthought. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 I do not agree. This is because the DOT for the Scotts Road apartment and the DOT of 26 March 2014 are very different documents. The DOT for the Scotts Road apartment was plainly a legally binding document, drafted by appointed solicitors, and it obviously took effect from the time he signed it. By contrast, the DOT of 26 March 2014 was a handwritten document which for a long time did not even see the light of day. The second defendant told him that it was simply a safeguard in the event that he dies unexpectedly. Therefore, nothing on the face of these documents and nothing about the circumstances in which they were signed would have readily suggested to the plaintiff that they would operate in the same way.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The defendants’ remaining contention on the plaintiff’s understanding of the DOT on 26 March 2014 is that he must have known how a trust operated because he holds a Masters of Law or LLM in corporate and commercial law from University College London. I reject this contention. First, it is against the weight of the evidence above. Second, as the plaintiff says, his LLM was earned through distance learning some six to eight years ago, when he was performing National Service.

</div> Accordingly, the mere fact that he has an LLM makes no difference to my assessment of his understanding of the DOT of 26 March 2014 at the time he signed it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74  One may nevertheless ask: Why did the plaintiff not attempt to ascertain or at least clarify the true effect of the DOT of 26 March 2014 earlier? This issue concerns the plaintiff’s conduct after 26 March 2014. The issue is crucial because it impacts upon the plaintiff’s credibility and his narrative of what happened that night. This requires me to consider the plaintiff’s perspective. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The evidence suggests that after the stormy night of 26 March, the couple settled into a new status quo. The DOT had been stored away in her safe, and neither of them referred to it again. The plaintiff was unaware that the second defendant had sent it to Mr Mitchell. He relied upon her advice to settle issues with his sister, and to deal with the Scotts Road apartment. In May 2014, the plaintiff and the second defendant decided to give their relationship a fresh start and soon, a second child was expected. It is likely that that after the parties reconciled, the plaintiff did not wish to jeopardise their relationship’s new footing and the second defendant’s second pregnancy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 It was only in December 2014 when Mr Mitchell copied him in an email that the plaintiff focused on the DOT: see [20]–[21] above. It was then that he realised that he ought to seek legal advice on the DOT, which he did from his current solicitors. He testified that he was very upset when he learned of its true effect, but he decided not to confront the second defendant about it: he did not want to agitate her in her last trimester and he wanted the baby to be safely delivered.

</div> I accept his explanation as truthful. After considering legal advice, he prepared a parting letter which he delivered to the second defendant on 12 February 2015. He told her then, for the first time, that he would not have signed the DOT if he had been properly advised on it. When they quarrelled on 12 February 2015, he asked her why she had not advised him to make a will. This was another demonstration that until December 2014, he understood that the DOT was to take effect upon his death, like a will. When the second defendant asked why the deed was at that point “suddenly an issue”, he explained, “Because I have <span class="font-italic">only come </span>to realize that” [emphasis added], “that” referring to his earlier statement in the quarrel that he “disagree[s] with the whole premise of [the DOT]”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In coming to these findings, I accept that the plaintiff is essentially a truthful witness. On the stand, he gave his answers in a forthright and honest manner. He also readily accepted that he lied to the second defendant twice, once at the lunch and then, when the question arose in his cross-examination, he conceded that he had lied again when he told her that a new will had been found in which he inherited half his mother’s estate: see [13] above. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the first issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Accordingly, I find on the first issue that on 26 March 2014, the second defendant did falsely represent to the plaintiff that the DOT would take effect only upon his death, and that until then, he was entitled to deal freely with all his assets. I find that the plaintiff believed this representation because he was assured of its truth by the physical presence of the second defendant’s father, who did not contradict his daughter, and because he was suffering from acute grief following the death of his mother, which made him vulnerable to the second defendant’s influence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Should the DOT be set aside because of the circumstances in which the plaintiff signed it?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I turn now to the second broad issue in this case, which is whether the DOT should be set aside on the ground of misrepresentation, mistake, undue influence and unconscionability. I consider each of these vitiating factors in turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Misrepresentation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The elements of misrepresentation are well-established. As the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Panatron Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Lee Cheow Lee and another </span>[2001] 2 SLR(R) 435 at [14], the plaintiff must establish five elements to succeed in a claim on misrepresentation: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, there must be a representation of fact made by words or conduct.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the representation must be made with the intention that it should be acted upon by the plaintiff or by a class or persons which includes the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, it must be proved that the plaintiff has acted upon the false statement.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, it must be proved that the plaintiff suffered damage by so doing.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Fifth, the representation must be made with the knowledge that it is false; it must be wilfully false, or at least made in the absence of any genuine belief that it is true. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The first and fifth elements are made out. The defendant made a representation of fact by words in telling the plaintiff that the DOT would leave him free to deal with the assets which were caught under the DOT until his death. This was a false representation. The DOT – if it is valid – had effect from the moment it was signed by the plaintiff and the second defendant, as the defendants now contend and as I have observed at [57(g)] above. And the second defendant knew, at the time she made the false representation, that it was false. She does not deny that she knew exactly how the DOT was to operate. Indeed, having drafted it herself, she must have known its true legal effect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The second and third elements are also made out. The second defendant made this false representation with the intention of persuading the plaintiff to sign the DOT, as I have found. Indeed, she admitted at the confrontation on 12 February 2015 that she wanted the plaintiff to sign the DOT.

</div>
</div> He had initially refused to sign the DOT because he did not want to give away all his assets, so she allayed this concern by lying to him that the DOT would take effect only upon his death. The plaintiff relied on this misrepresentation. That is why he changed his mind and decided to sign the DOT. And that is why he acted, in the months after he signed the DOT, as if the DOT had no effect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Finally, the fourth element is made out. As a result of signing the DOT, the plaintiff has suffered damage in the form of losing his beneficial interest in all the assets he owned as at 26 March 2014. As I will explain below at [136] and [142], that is the true effect of the DOT.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 For these reasons, the DOT should be rescinded on the ground of misrepresentation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mistake</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The leading English case on setting aside a voluntary disposition on the ground of mistake is <span class="font-italic">Pitt </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Holt and another </span>[2013] 2 AC 108 (“<span class="font-italic">Pitt</span><span class="font-italic"> v Holt</span>”).

A useful summary of those principles is found in <span class="font-italic">Kennedy v Kennedy </span>[2014] EWHC 4129 (Ch) at [36]:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There must be a distinct mistake as distinguished from mere ignorance or inadvertence or misprediction relating to some possible future event. Forgetfulness, inadvertence or ignorance can lead to a false belief or assumption which the court will recognise as a legally relevant mistake. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) A mistake may still be a relevant mistake even if it was due to carelessness on the part of the person making the disposition, unless the circumstances are such as to show that he or she deliberately ran the risk, or must be taken to have run the risk, of being wrong.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The causative mistake must be sufficiently grave as to make it unconscionable on the part of the donee to retain the property. That test will normally be satisfied only where there is a mistake either as to the legal character or nature of a transaction or as to some matter of fact or law which is basic to the transaction. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The injustice of leaving a mistaken disposition uncorrected must be evaluated objectively but with an intense focus on the facts of the particular case. The court must consider in the round the existence of a distinct mistake, its degree of centrality to the transaction in question and the seriousness of its consequences, and make an evaluative judgment whether it would be unconscionable, or unjust, to leave the mistake uncorrected.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In my judgment, because of the second defendant’s conduct, the plaintiff made the mistake that the effect of the DOT was that until the time of his death, he remained free to deal with his assets. This was the operative mistake of sufficient gravity which satisfies the test in <span class="font-italic">Pitt v Holt</span>. This mistake was not brought about by carelessness on his part but, as I have found, by the second defendant’s misrepresentation, which he believed because of his altered mental state. It is a mistake of sufficient gravity because it strikes at the heart of the DOT, whose purpose is precisely to divest the plaintiff of his right to use his assets according to his wishes and vest that power in him and the second defendant jointly to be applied for the benefit of their son. It is also a causative mistake because, as I have found, had he not held this belief, he would not have signed the DOT. I consider that the seriousness of this mistake makes it unconscionable for the disposition not to be corrected because it is a disposition of serious consequence: the plaintiff has been deprived of a significant portion of his assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 I should make clear that the above is the mistake which I find the plaintiff made <span class="font-italic">on the evening of 26 March</span>, when he was in a precarious mental state. I should make clear that I have taken into consideration that his 11 February letter alludes to a mistake as to her intent: “It was only when David Mitchell told me that you have sent him a copy of the document last December that I realized that you intended to treat this as a legal document.” If there was a mistake as to her intent, it may be regarded as a misprediction and not a mistake: see <span class="font-italic">Pitt v Holt</span> at [109]–[114]. I am of the view, taking into account the various factual findings which I have summarised at [69], that because of his acute grief, he did not on 26 March 2014 have any clarity of mind as to how or why it was exactly that the DOT did not have immediate legal effect. He genuinely accepted and believed, as he was told, that signing the DOT would leave him free to deal with his assets until his untimely death, whenever that might happen. I find that this was the mistake that was operative in his mind at the time he made the decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 For the reasons above, I am persuaded that the plaintiff has made out his case on mistake, and that it is an independent ground upon which to set aside the DOT.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Undue influence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The law on undue influence is well-settled. In essence, there are two broad ways for a plaintiff to establish undue influence. First, the plaintiff may attempt to prove that the defendant has in fact exercised undue influence on him in procuring the transaction he seeks to set aside. This is known as “Class 1” undue influence. Second, the plaintiff may attempt to raise a presumption that the defendant has exercised undue influence. This requires proof of two requirements: (i) that there is a particular relationship which enabled one party to influence the decisions of the other; and (ii) the resulting transaction was manifestly disadvantageous to the other, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, one that calls for an explanation: <span class="font-italic">Rajabali Jumabhoy and others v Ameerali R Jumabhoy and others </span>[1997] 2 SLR(R) 296 (“<span class="font-italic">Rajabali</span>”) at [184]; <span class="font-italic">Royal Bank of Scotland plc v Etridge (No 2) </span>[2002] 2 AC 773 (“<span class="font-italic">Etridge</span>”) at [21]. Once these elements are proved, the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to show that he did not exercise undue influence on the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 As regards the first requirement under presumed undue influence, a plaintiff may attempt to raise an irrebuttable presumption of a relationship of trust and confidence by showing that his relationship with the defendant falls under one of the legally recognised categories of relationships of trust and confidence. These include solicitor and client, parent and child, and doctor and patient; they are the functional equivalent in equity of the common law concept of <span class="font-italic">res ipsa loquitor</span>. This form of presumed undue influence is known as “Class 2A” undue influence: <span class="font-italic">Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd v Tan Teck Khong and another (committee of the estate of Pang Jong Wan, mentally disordered) and others </span>[2005] 2 SLR(R) 694 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Teck Khong</span>”) at [34]. It is also well-established that husband and wife is not one of the relationships to which the Class 2A principle applies: <span class="font-italic">Etridge</span> at [19]. Next, the plaintiff may also furnish actual proof that a relationship of trust and confidence exists. This form of presumed undue influence is known as “Class 2B” undue influence: <span class="font-italic">Tan Teck Khong</span> at [34]. In the present case, the plaintiff relies only on “Class 1” and “Class 2A” to establish undue influence, so I shall deal only with them below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(1) “Class 1” undue influence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The requirements for actual undue influence are well-established. As Judith Prakash J (as she then was) explained in<span class="font-italic"> Rajabali</span> at [186], in order to establish a plea of actual undue influence, a plaintiff must show that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the other party to the transaction (or someone who induced the transaction for his own benefit) had the capacity to influence the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the influence was exercised;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) its exercise was undue; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) its exercise brought about the transaction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In my view, the second defendant had the capacity to influence the plaintiff for a number of reasons. First, she was his wife. Although he did not trust her enough to disclose to her the contents of his mother’s will, she had previously advised him on matters of law: see [98] below. Second, he was in a state of grief and isolation, and thus susceptible to influence. She was aware of this, and acted with great urgency to take advantage of that susceptibility and of her capacity to influence him. Third, her attempt to persuade the plaintiff was legitimised by her father, who is a senior lawyer whom he respected and who was in their presence on the evening of 26 March 2014. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The second defendant exercised the influence she had by persistently asking him to sign the DOT and by misrepresenting to him its true legal effect. The exercise was undue because the plaintiff was persuaded to sign the DOT based on a lie that he would remain free to deal with his assets. In this regard, it is well-established that undue influence may arise from misrepresentation: <span class="font-italic">Etridge</span> at [103]. Furthermore, the plaintiff did not have the benefit of independent legal advice before signing the DOT. In these circumstances, it is clear to me that the second defendant “twisted the mind” of the plaintiff to have him sign the DOT: see <span class="font-italic">Daniel v Drew</span> [2005] EWCA Civ 507 at [31]. Finally, the second defendant’s influence caused the plaintiff to decide to sign the DOT. For these reasons, the DOT should be set aside on the ground of actual undue influence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(2) “Class 2A” undue influence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The plaintiff also seeks to establish an implied retainer existing between him and the second defendant, and him and the second defendant’s father. I begin here by accepting that as a matter of principle, an implied retainer is capable of giving rise to a solicitor and client relationship. Such a relationship creates an irrebuttable presumption that there was a relationship of trust and confidence that brings the case under the Class 2A analysis. The parties do not dispute this proposition.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The test for the existence of an implied retainer was stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Anwar Patrick Adrian and another v Ng Chong &amp; Hue LLC and another </span>[2014] 3 SLR 761 (“<span class="font-italic">Anwar Patrick Adrian</span>”) at [49]: a retainer might be implied where, on an objective consideration of all the circumstances, an intention to enter into such a contractual relationship ought fairly and properly to be imputed to all the parties. It is essential to take into account the putative client’s perspective by asking whether he reasonably believed that a solicitor-client relationship had arisen: <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Uthayasurian Sidambaram </span>[2009] 4 SLR(R) 674 at [41], citing Jeffery Pinsler, <span class="font-italic">Ethics and Professional Responsibility</span><span class="font-italic">: A Code for the Advocate and Solicitor </span>(Academy Publishing, 2007)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 14-005. Also, it is essential to take into account the putative solicitor’s perspective and to inquire as to whether he must have known that he was acting as a solicitor: <span class="font-italic">CIFG Special Assets Capital I Ltd (formerly known as Diamond Kendall Ltd) v Polimet Pte Ltd and others </span>[2016] 1 SLR 1382 (“<span class="font-italic">CIFG Special Assets</span>”) at [105]. This forms the general approach to identifying an implied retainer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In <span class="font-italic">CIFG Special Assets</span>, George Wei J at [118] listed a number of circumstances, taken from the case law, in which an implied retainer was found. In these cases, the solicitor:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) provided advice to the alleged putative client without qualifying the answers or informing the latter to seek independent advice;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) failed to clarify that he was not acting for the alleged putative client;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) signed off as the solicitor for the alleged putative client on a legally important document;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) issued an invoice that included work done and services rendered to the alleged putative clients; or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) took instructions from the alleged putative client.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In the present case, the parties’ submissions also invite an opinion on the significance of the fact that it is the putative solicitor (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the second defendant) who initiates the alleged solicitor-client relationship by offering the client advice and services (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by presenting the DOT to the plaintiff for his signature), and not the client who seeks advice or services. As a matter of principle, I do not think the cases lay down any rule on whether such a circumstance rules out the existence of an implied retainer. The question is simply whether on an objective view an intention to enter into an implied retainer may be imputed to the parties. The fact that it was the putative solicitor who initiated the relationship may point to one inference or the other, as the case may be. An objective analysis will have to consider the effect of all the circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In my judgment, there was an implied retainer between the plaintiff and the second defendant at the time the plaintiff signed the DOT. The context, as the plaintiff correctly observes,

</div> is that the second defendant is in fact a trained lawyer. She was the one who drafted the DOT. And she has a demonstrable familiarity with the law on trusts as she advised the plaintiff on holding the Scotts Road property on trust to avoid Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty. It is clear that, while the plaintiff did regard her as his wife, he also relied upon her <span class="font-italic">because</span> she was a trained lawyer. In this regard, I accept the plaintiff’s evidence that the second defendant had on many occasions prior to 26 March 2014 advised the plaintiff on legal matters.

</div> Most importantly, as I have found, the second defendant prepared the DOT for the plaintiff to sign on the evening of 26 March 2014 essentially on her own accord, as he had never instructed her to draw up such a document: see [40]–[41] above. Given that he had a history of approaching her for legal advice, there is merit in the plaintiff’s submission that on that evening, the second defendant was “proffering her legal work product to the Plaintiff and demanding that he sign it”.

</div> And she failed eminently to qualify her work or advice, preferring instead to assert misleadingly that the DOT had been written in “plain, simple English” and required no explanation: see [57] above. He relied upon her as his closest legal advisor, albeit also as a wife.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 On these facts, and having regard to the five circumstances listed in <span class="font-italic">CIFG Assets</span>, I find that there was an implied retainer, on the specific facts of this case, between the plaintiff and the second defendant at the time the plaintiff signed the DOT on 26 March 2014. The upshot is that there is an irrebuttable presumption of the Class 2A type raised in favour of the plaintiff that there was a relationship of trust and confidence between him and the second defendant. Next, it is clear also that the DOT was manifestly disadvantageous to him. It divested him of all his assets at the time he signed it for nothing in return. The burden thus falls on the second defendant to show that she did not exercise undue influence on him. For the reasons I have already given, she clearly has not discharged that burden. Therefore, the DOT ought to be set aside on the ground that Class 2A undue influence has been made out. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Unconscionability</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Finally, I turn to the doctrine of unconscionability. This is a doctrine of uncertain scope and existence in Singapore law. It currently possesses a narrow remit in English law, although that has not always been the position. By contrast, it has enjoyed lively development and application in other Commonwealth jurisdictions, including Australia and New Zealand. In this case, the plaintiff invites me to adopt the modern Australian version of the doctrine. To evaluate this contention, I find it appropriate for me first to examine the doctrine’s origin and development in England. I will then briefly describe the Australian position. Having taken these perspectives in account, I will then examine the local context. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(1) Origin of the doctrine</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The English courts of equity intervened to relieve prospective heirs from the disposition of their expectant estates on unfavourable terms. They were considered by the courts to warrant protection as they had sold their “expectancy” or reversionary interest at an undervalue in order to raise funds to satisfy some real or imagined immediate need, and the other party to the transaction had taken advantage of them. The relief existed to protect families and their estates from ruin (<span class="font-italic">Cole v Gibbons</span> (1734) 3 P Wms 290 Ch at 293 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Talbot) and to protect expectant heirs from their own prodigality (<span class="font-italic">Gwynne v Heaton</span> (1778) 1 Bro CC 1 Ch at 9 <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Thurlow LC). In <span class="font-italic">Earl of Chesterfield</span><span class="font-italic"> and Others Executors of John Spencer v Sir Abraham Janssen</span> (1751) 2 Ves Sen 125 (“<span class="font-italic">Earl of Chesterfield</span>”) at 155–157, Lord Hardwicke LC explained that the doctrine applied on proof of actual fraud on the part of the heir’s counterparty or on a presumption of fraud, inferred from the unconscionability of the bargain, which the counterparty bore the burden of rebutting, failing which the transaction would be set aside. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 As the doctrine developed, there came a point where a person who sold a reversionary interest could obtain relief by simply proving that the sale was at an undervalue: see <span class="font-italic">Peacock v Evans</span> (1809) 16 Ves Jr 512, where Grant MR set aside the transaction solely on the basis of its undervalue, noting that “there was nothing dishonourable or immoral in [the buyer’s] conduct” (at 518); see also <span class="font-italic">Bowes v Heaps</span> (1814) 3 V &amp; B 117 at 121. The law was then changed by the Sales of Reversions Act 1867 (UK), now re-enacted in s 174 of the Law of Property Act 1925 (c 20) (UK), which provided that no purchase of a reversionary interest made bona fide and without fraud was to be opened or set aside “merely on the ground of under-value”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The 1867 Act did not remove the court’s equitable jurisdiction to set aside unconscionable transactions. That jurisdiction was re-asserted by the Court of Appeal in Chancery in <span class="font-italic">Earl of Aylesford v Morris</span> [1861-73] All ER 300 (“<span class="font-italic">Earl of Aylesford</span>”). In that case, the plaintiff, soon after he came of age and while his father was alive, borrowed from the defendant a large sum. As security he gave the defendant bills which, with interest and discount, together exceeded 60% of the principal. The bills were renewed and, after the death of the plaintiff’s father, the defendant sued the plaintiff for payment on the bills. The plaintiff then applied for an injunction to restrain that action. The court granted the injunction. It held that his being an actual tenant in tail in remainder, instead of being merely an expectant heir, made no difference. Lord Selborne LC affirmed at 303 in the following terms the principle laid down by Lord Hardwicke (in <span class="font-italic">Earl of Chesterfield</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at 157):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">These changes of the law [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the 1867 Act] have in no degree whatever altered the onus probandi in these case which, according to the language of Lord Hardwicke,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">from the circumstances or conditions of the parties contracting – Weakness on one side, extortion and advantage taken of that weakness on the other</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">– raise a presumption of fraud. Fraud does not here mean deceit or circumvention; it means an unconscientious use of the power arising out of these circumstances and conditions; and when the relative position of the parties is such as prima facie to raise this presumption, the transaction cannot stand unless the person claiming the benefit of it is able to repel the presumption by contrary evidence, proving it to have been in point of fact fair, just, and reasonable. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [I]t is sufficient for the application of the principle, if the parties meet under such circumstances as to give the stronger party dominion over the weaker, in the particular transaction; and such power and influence are generally possessed, in every transaction of this kind, by those who trade on the follies and vices of unprotected youth, inexperience, and moral imbecility.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Lord Selborne’s main statement of principle was approved by the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Hugh </span><span class="font-italic">O’Rorke v John Joseph Bolingbroke</span> (1876-77) LR 2 App Cas 814. Notably, his Lordship also observed that a common feature of catching bargains with expectant heirs was that the heir would have entered into the transaction without parental or professional advice (at 303). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 In <span class="font-italic">Fry v Lane </span>(1888) 40 Ch D 312, the plaintiffs were impoverished and uneducated workers – a plumber and a laundryman earning £1 a week – who sold the reversionary interests in their uncle’s estate to the defendant for £170 and £270 respectively. They were advised on the sale by an inexperienced solicitor. When their aunt died in 1886, the interests were each worth £730, and in 1878 when they sold them to the defendant, the interests were said to have been worth £475. Upon discovering this they brought an action for the sale to be set aside. Kay J gave them judgment and held that the principle in <span class="font-italic">Earl of Aylesford</span> applied. He analysed the cases and stated the law as follows (at 322): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The result of the decisions is that where a purchase is made from a poor and ignorant man at a considerable undervalue, the vendor having no independent advice, a Court of Equity will set aside the transaction.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The circumstances of poverty and ignorance of the vendor, absence of independent advice, throw upon the purchaser, when the transaction is impeached, the onus of proving, in Lord Selborne’s words, that the purchase was “fair, just and reasonable”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The plaintiffs in <span class="font-italic">Fry v Lane </span>were therefore not accorded the law’s protection on account of their being expectant heirs but because they were, in Kay J’s words, “poor, ignorant men, to whom the temptation of the immediate possession of £100 would be very great” (at 323).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(2) Developments in England and Australia</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Subsequently, the doctrine of unconscionability in England, according to Dr David Capper, “effectively went into hibernation” for nearly 90 years between <span class="font-italic">Fry v Lane </span>in 1889 and <span class="font-italic">Cresswell v Potter </span>[1978] 1 WLR 255 (“<span class="font-italic">Cresswell</span>”) in 1978: David Capper, “The unconscionable bargain in the common law world” (2010) 126 LQR 403 at 403 (“<span class="font-italic">Capper</span>”). Nevertheless, when the doctrine first resurfaced in England, it retained the essence of Kay J’s and Lord Selborne’s statements of principle. In <span class="font-italic">Cresswell</span>, the plaintiff was a divorcing wife who had transferred her half interest in the parties’ matrimonial home to the defendant husband in return for an indemnity against the liabilities under the mortgage on the home but for no other consideration. The defendant later sold the home, and the plaintiff claimed an entitlement to half the sale proceeds. Megarry J adopted a modern interpretation of <span class="font-italic">Fry v Lane</span>, and explained the law in terms of three main requirements, which together constitute a non-exhaustive example of a circumstance of “oppression or abuse of confidence which will invoke the aid of equity” (at 257G–H):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The judge [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Kay J in <span class="font-italic">Fry v Lane</span>] thus laid down three requirements. What has to be considered is, first, whether the plaintiff is poor and ignorant; second, whether the sale was a considerable undervalue; and third, whether the vendor had independent advice. I am not, of course, suggesting that these are the only circumstances which will suffice; thus there may be circumstances of oppression or abuse of confidence which will invoke the aid of equity. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Eighty years ago, when <span class="font-italic">Fry v. Lane</span> was decided, social conditions were very different from those which exist today. I do not, however, think that the principle has changed, even though the euphemisms of the 20th century may require the word “poor” to be replaced by “a member of the lower income group” or the like, and the word “ignorant” by “less highly educated.” … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Megarry J went on to find that the plaintiff had fulfilled all three of the main requirements, and that the defendant failed to discharge his burden of proving that the transaction was “fair, just and reasonable” (at 259H). He therefore held that the plaintiff was entitled to half of the sale proceeds. <span class="font-italic">Cresswell</span> was applied to similar facts in <span class="font-italic">Backhouse v Backhouse</span> [1978] 1 WLR 243. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Subsequent English cases narrowed the position in <span class="font-italic">Cresswell</span> by embracing the requirement that the defendant must have “imposed the objectionable terms in a morally reprehensible manner, that is to say, in a way which affects his conscience”: <span class="font-italic">Multiservice Bookbinding Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and others v Marden</span> [1979] Ch 84 (“<span class="font-italic">Marden</span>”) <span class="font-italic">per</span> Browne-Wilkinson J (as he then was). This <span class="font-italic">dictum</span> was approved by the Privy Council in <span class="font-italic">Boustany v Pigott </span>[1995] 69 P &amp; CR 298. In that case, Lord Templeman took the view that unconscionability relates not just to the terms of the bargain but to the behaviour of the stronger party, which must be characterised by some moral culpability (at 303). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Elsewhere in the Commonwealth exist broader approaches to the doctrine. For example, in Australia, the leading High Court decision in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd v Amadio and another</span> (1983) 151 CLR 447 (“<span class="font-italic">Amadio</span>”) lays down the principle for setting aside an unconscionable transaction, “which may be invoked whenever one party by reason of some condition or circumstance is placed at a special disadvantage vis-à-vis another and unfair or unconscientious advantage is then taken of the opportunity thereby created” (at 462 <span class="font-italic">per </span>Mason J). Significantly, no overt unconscionable conduct or morally reprehensible behaviour is said to be required. Instead, in applying the <span class="font-italic">Amadio</span> principle, the court’s task is to determine “whether the whole course of dealing between the parties has been such that, as between the parties, responsibility for the plaintiff’s loss should be ascribed to unconscientious conduct on the part of the defendant”:<span class="font-italic"> Kakavas v Crown Melbourne Limited</span> [2013] HCA 25 at [18].

In <span class="font-italic">Blomley</span>, Fullagar J at 405 observed that the circumstances adversely affecting a party who needs the aid of equity to set aside a transaction cannot be “satisfactorily classified”, but their common characteristic is that they have the effect of “placing one party at a serious disadvantage vis-à-vis the other”. Relying on Fullagar J’s statement, Khoo J said that although the principle on unconscionable bargains originated to protect young expectant heirs from being swindled of their inheritance, now it “has been extended to all cases in which the parties contracting do not meet on equal terms” (at [7]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Two subsequent High Court cases, where <span class="font-italic">Fong</span><span class="font-italic"> Whye Koon</span> was not considered, take the view that <span class="font-italic">Cres</span><span class="font-italic">swell </span>represents the law in Singapore: <span class="font-italic">Rajabali</span> ([89] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [196] and <span class="font-italic">E C Investment v Ridout Residence Pte Ltd and another (Orion Oil Ltd and another, interveners)</span> [2011] 2 SLR 232 (“<span class="font-italic">E C Investment</span>”) at [63]. In <span class="font-italic">Rajabali</span>, Prakash J declined to expand the first criterion in <span class="font-italic">Cresswell</span> from poverty and ignorance to a general form of “special disability” or “special disadvantage” in line with the <span class="font-italic">Amadio</span> principle (at [198]). In her view, this is because inequality of bargaining power is not a sufficient reason to set aside a transaction (at [198]). In <span class="font-italic">E C Investment</span>, Quentin Loh J agreed with Prakash J’s rejection of <span class="font-italic">Amadio</span> principle and held at [66] that a doctrine of unconscionability, in that form, was not part of Singapore law. He opined that adopting such a doctrine would “inject unacceptable uncertainty in commercial contracts and in the expectations of men of commerce”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 In this case, the plaintiff’s counsel encourages me to embrace the <span class="font-italic">Amadio</span> principle, at least in the area of voluntary dispositions, the DOT being such a disposition. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 In evaluating this submission, I first record my agreement with the point made in <span class="font-italic">Rajabali</span> and <span class="font-italic">E</span><span class="font-italic"> C Investment</span> that inequality of bargaining power is not a sufficient reason to set aside a contract. An approach based purely on inequality of bargaining power would undermine the certainty which is critical to commercial transactions. The <span class="font-italic">Amadio </span>principle is not, of course, based purely on such inequality. However, neither does it require overt unconscionable conduct. Instead, the court undertakes a broad inquiry to determine whether fault can be ascribed to the defendant’s unconscientious conduct. In my view, this breadth of this inquiry would promote too much uncertainty. Furthermore, the exclusion of a requirement for overt unconscionable conduct would appear to undermine the historical fraudulent basis of the doctrine: see [103] above. In my view, these reasons militate in favour of applying the test in <span class="font-italic">Cresswell</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Should the doctrine of unconscionability take a different approach along the lines of the <span class="font-italic">Amadio</span> principle for voluntary dispositions, as the plaintiff suggests? It is clear that such a disposition would not attract the importance of ensuring commercial certainty, which <span class="font-italic">Rajabali</span> and <span class="font-italic">EC Investments</span> emphasises. Indeed, the law’s interest in protecting bargains, and in the security of contracts, is not engaged in the case of a gift, even if made by deed: <span class="font-italic">Pitt</span><span class="font-italic"> v Holt</span> ([85] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [114] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Walker, citing with approval Dominic O’Sullivan, Steven Ballantyne Elliott &amp; Rafal Zakrzewski, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Rescission</span> (Oxford University Press, 2008) at para 29.22. The law recognises a distinction between voluntary dispositions and dispositions supported by consideration. An example of this distinction is the rule that if the promise to create a trust is contained in a deed unsupported by consideration, it will be unenforceable by an equitable decree for specific performance since equity will not assist a volunteer: <span class="font-italic">Sheares Betty Hang Kiu v Chow Kwok Chi and others</span> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 285 (“<span class="font-italic">Sheares Betty</span>”) at [24], citing Underhill &amp; Hayton, <span class="font-italic">Law Relating to Trusts and Trustees</span> (Butterworths, 15th Ed, 1995) at p 7. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Nevertheless, in my view, the mere fact that a transaction is a voluntary disposition should not make it more likely that it was procured by unconscionable conduct. Such dispositions are made for a wide variety of reasons, and in the family context, many a voluntary disposition may appear unduly generous even if legitimate. Of course, neither should one deny the existence of room for abuse in that context. But the <span class="font-italic">Cresswell</span> test already takes that into account: it requires the transaction to be at an undervalue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 With that in mind, I turn to the <span class="font-italic">Cre</span><span class="font-italic">sswell</span> criteria. The three primary requirements are: first, the plaintiff must be poor and ignorant, in the sense that he is of a lower income group and is less well educated (Megarry J’s gloss on Kay J’s original first requirement); second, the transaction must be at an undervalue; and third, the plaintiff must not have received independent legal advice. Alternatively, “there may be circumstances of oppression or abuse of confidence which will invoke the aid of equity”: <span class="font-italic">Cresswell</span> at 257F. As <span class="font-italic">Cresswell </span>concerned the three primary requirements, Megarry J did not give the alternative limb of oppression or abuse of confidence any further consideration. It is important, however, to bear in mind the fact that the three requirements are, taken together, only a non-exhaustive example of a circumstance of oppression or abuse of confidence, as I have mentioned at [107] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 In the present case, the first limb of <span class="font-italic">Cres</span><span class="font-italic">swell</span> is clearly not made out because the plaintiff is not of low income and is well-educated. Oppression or abuse of confidence is therefore the limb under the <span class="font-italic">Cresswell</span> test with which I am concerned. The issue of principle at hand, therefore, is the true content of this limb. In this connection, I begin by noting the historical characteristics of the expectant heir involved in a catching bargain. The heir was in financial need, often because he was put on a thin allowance. He felt unable to reveal his financial need to his family because he was afraid to endanger his expectancy. Unable to communicate with his family, he was left with his inexperience and without proper advice. He was therefore easily tempted to trade his future inheritance for money up front, which might in turn lead him to a dissolute life: Catherine MacMillan, “<span class="font-italic">Earl of Aylesford v Morris</span>” in <span class="font-italic">Landmark Cases in Equity</span> (Charles Mitchell and Paul Mitchell eds) (Hart Publishing 2014) at p 332. So to a degree, the expectant heir was poor and ignorant, though not in the sense of being of a lower income group and being uneducated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Importantly however, Lord Hardwicke, in deciding such a case in <span class="font-italic">Earl of Chesterfield</span>, did not restrict the doctrine to those circumstances. His Lordship’s general principle was that equitable fraud which vitiates a transaction may be presumed “from the circumstances or conditions of the parties contracting: weakness on one side, usury on the other, or extortion and advantage taken of that weakness” (at 157). In my view, this is the principle that Megarry J must have sought to preserve under the test of “oppression and abuse of confidence” in <span class="font-italic">Cresswell</span>. Crucially, under that test, the requirements of undervalue and lack of independent advice do not lose significance. They remain important because they were the very factors present in the early cases decided by Lord Hardwicke and Lord Selborne which led to the finding of equitable fraud in the first place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Thus, returning to the words of Lord Hardwicke in <span class="font-italic">Earl of Chesterfield</span>, it is possible to formulate two requirements for what amounts to oppression or abuse of confidence. First, there must be weakness on one side. Such weakness could arise from poverty, ignorance or other circumstances, like acute grief in this case. Lack of independent advice would almost always deepen the weakness. Second, there must be exploitation, extortion or advantage taken of that weakness. A transaction at an undervalue would be a necessary component of this requirement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 In formulating these two criteria, I am aware that in <span class="font-italic">Rajabali</span>, Prakash J declined to expand the first primary criterion in <span class="font-italic">Cresswell</span> from poverty and ignorance to a general form of “special disability” or “special disadvantage” in line with the <span class="font-italic">Amadio</span> principle (at [198]). Her comments were in the context of adopting the whole of the <span class="font-italic">Amadio</span> principle. In the case at hand, while I have suggested weakness as one of two requirements for establishing oppression or abuse of confidence, I have also set out a second requirement of exploitation, extortion or advantage taken. In other words, the test retains the need for overt unconscionable conduct which <span class="font-italic">Amadio</span> does not. This second criteria is narrow and meets the concern that inequality of bargaining power, in itself, cannot vitiate a transaction. It also meets the concern expressed in the 1867 Act not to set aside transactions “merely on the ground of under-value”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Finally, once these two elements are established, it will be for the defendant to show that the transaction was, in the words of Lord Selborne in <span class="font-italic">Earl of Aylesford</span>, “fair, just and reasonable” (at 303): <span class="font-italic">Cresswell</span> at 259H; <span class="font-italic">Chitty</span><span class="font-italic"> on Contracts</span> (Hugh Beale gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 32nd Ed, 2015)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 8-139. If he is unable to do so, then the transaction is liable to be set aside on the ground of unconscionability.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">(4) Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Turning to the facts of this case, I find that the first element is made out. The plaintiff was in a state of weakness at the time he signed the DOT due to his grief and isolation, his relationship with the second defendant, his lack of independent legal advice, and his trust in her ability as a lawyer. These circumstances created a window of opportunity for oppression. The second element is also made out. The second defendant deepened that window of opportunity by asking him to leave. Misrepresenting to him that the DOT would take effect only upon his death, she took advantage of his emotionally vulnerable state in order to persuade him to part with the entirety of his assets, which were substantial. Lastly, the DOT, being made voluntarily, was undoubtedly a transaction at an undervalue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 These two elements having been established, it falls on the second defendant to persuade me that the DOT is fair, just and reasonable. I have no doubt that it was not. The plain effect of the DOT, as the plaintiff emphasised to the second defendant on 12 February 2015, was to make him a pauper on the day he signed it, because it had the effect of stripping him of his beneficial entitlement to all his assets. The DOT was not a fair and reasonable means by which he was to provide for his family and must be set aside on the ground of unconscionability.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Before leaving this section, I highlight that in adopting and adapting the <span class="font-italic">Cresswell</span> test, I have deliberately avoided the somewhat narrower present English limitation requiring morally reprehensible conduct on the defendant’s part. The rationale for my doing so may be explained by reference to the case of <span class="font-italic">Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland NV v Burch</span> [1997] 1 All ER 144 (“<span class="font-italic">Burch</span>”). In that case, the defendant was procured by her employer to mortgage her flat as a security without limit for an increase in his company’s overdraft. She did so without legal advice and without knowledge of the company’s indebtedness to the bank. After the company became insolvent, the bank issued proceedings to possess her flat. The English Court of Appeal held that she was presumed to have mortgaged her flat under her employer’s undue influence because the transaction was manifestly disadvantageous to her. It held also that the bank had failed reasonably to avoid being fixed with constructive notice of that undue influence, with the result that the legal charge on the flat was set aside. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Unconscionability was not pleaded. Millett LJ suggested that the case could have been run on that ground, but if so, the plaintiff would have had to show additionally that the defendant was “morally reprehensible” in procuring the transaction (at 153<span class="font-italic">a</span>). As a matter of principle, it seems to me that the frame, “morally reprehensible”, is more appropriately regarded as a characterisation of the facts, rather than as an element to be proved. Moral reprehensibility would be present in most cases where a plaintiff has been exploited or taken advantage of, but the label perhaps overemphasises the need for subjective, high moral judgment. By imposing it as an additional requirement, the English courts may have introduced a gloss that could have been perceived by the defendant’s counsel in <span class="font-italic">Burch</span> to be more restrictive than intended, which in turn may be why he did not rely on it. Yet on the facts of that case, it is not clear whether the court had any reason apart from the manifestly disadvantageous transaction itself to infer that undue influence had been exercised. Millett LJ concluded that “[n]o court of equity could allow such a transaction to stand”, being a transaction “which, in the traditional phrase, ‘shocks the conscience of the court’” (152<span class="font-italic">g</span>–<span class="font-italic">h</span>). There was no direct evidence of a relationship of trust and confidence between the defendant and her employer in that case. Millett LJ inferred the relationship simply from the improvidence of the transaction. In my view, <span class="font-italic">Burch</span> may have been more satisfactorily dealt with under the revised <span class="font-italic">Cres</span><span class="font-italic">swell</span> criteria adopted in the present case. Indeed, as Nourse LJ said in <span class="font-italic">Burch </span>at 151<span class="font-italic">b</span>–<span class="font-italic">f</span>, it was “very well arguable that [the defendant] could, directly against the bank, have had the legal charge set aside as an unconscionable bargain” on the authority of <span class="font-italic">Earl of Aylesford</span>, <span class="font-italic">Fry v Lane</span> and <span class="font-italic">Cresswell</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the second issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 I have, in this case, considered four equitable remedies. I close by outlining the factual findings that are foundational to the plaintiff’s success on each of them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 First, misrepresentation is essentially the making of a false statement by a defendant which induces a plaintiff to do a certain act. In the present case, as I have summarised at [69], the plaintiff relied on the second defendant’s misrepresentation that the DOT takes effect only upon his death, and his reliance on that misrepresentation in signing the DOT, are the critical facts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Next, the doctrine of mistake, for the purpose of setting aside voluntary transactions, focuses simply on whether the party entering that transaction by reason of a mistake of sufficient gravity. In the present case, the factual matrix of the second defendant’s misrepresentation explains the cause of the plaintiff’s mistake. That mistake, which is the critical fact for his claim on mistake, is his is mistaken belief at the time he signed the DOT that the DOT would take effect only upon his death.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Undue influence is principally concerned with pressure exercised by virtue of a relationship: <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract</span> ([110] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at para 12.096. Thus, in the present case, the critical facts on the Class 2A form of this remedy concern (i) the circumstances under which the DOT was signed which go towards establishing an implied retainer between the plaintiff and the second defendant and (ii) the fact that the DOT is manifestly disadvantageous to him. The fact of misrepresentation is strictly not necessary this analysis because the burden falls on the second defendant to show that she did not exercise undue influence. The critical facts on Class 1, on the other hand, concern the second defendant’s exercise of influence on the plaintiff, and therefore overlap with the facts which go towards unconscionability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 Unconscionability is concerned with overt unconscionable conduct on the defendant’s part. In the present case, the critical facts on this doctrine are the plaintiff’s weakness, constituted among other things by his acute grief and sense of isolation, and also the second defendant’s exploitation of that weakness by way of misrepresentation and exertion of pressure. In this context, it is not surprising that Class 1 undue influence and unconscionability depend on the same facts to be established. The overlap between the doctrines of undue influence and unconscionability is well-documented, and it has been asked whether there is any distinction between the two: see <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, Andrew Phang, “Undue Influence – methodology, sources and linkages” [1995] JBL 552; <span class="font-italic">Capper</span> at p 418. Nevertheless, Professor Phang (as he then was) accepted at p 569 of his article that “a situation of unconscionability need not (unlike one pertaining to undue influence) necessarily entail a fiduciary relationship”. Moreover, cases like <span class="font-italic">Burch</span> suggest that it remains important to preserve an independent life for the ancient remedy of unconscionability to police transactions which reflect manifest exploitation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Fundamentally, where a case plainly presents the facts of weakness in one party being exploited by another, those facts deserve to be confronted directly by the court, to whom the more specific hurdles of undue influence may justifiably appear less important or perhaps less suited to the analysis. In the present case, the court is faced with a trust over “all assets, both personal and immoveable, owned by [the plaintiff], whether legally or beneficially” on a completely voluntary basis. This is sufficiently onerous to cry out for an explanation. There is no doubt that the second defendant’s exploitation of the plaintiff’s grief, isolation and lack of independent advice to lay claim to all he owns is properly to be described as an act of oppression and abuse of confidence that shocks the conscience of the court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Should the DOT be set aside because it is a legally defective instrument?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 I will turn now to analyse whether the DOT is a legally valid instrument on its own. The following issues are raised by the parties’ submissions, and I consider them in sequence:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Is the DOT void because it does not define the trust property with reasonable certainty?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Does the trust property extend to the plaintiff’s interest under his mother’s will, and if so, what is the scope of that interest?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Does the DOT define the trust property with reasonable certainty?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 The plaintiff contends that the DOT is void because the trust property is not indicated with sufficient certainty. The test for voidness for uncertainty was described by the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Whishaw and another v Stephens and </span><span class="font-italic">others, In re Gulbenkian’s Settlement</span> [1970] 1 AC 508. While the uncertainty in that case concerned the class of beneficiaries to which the trust applied, their Lordships opined in general terms on the language necessary to create a trust for persons. Thus, Lord Reid observed at 517F that “[a] client must not be penalised for his lawyer’s slovenly drafting”, and that the court’s task was to consider whether underlying the words used any reasonably clear intention can be discerned. Lord Upjohn at 522B-D gave further guidance on the court’s approach:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There is no doubt that the first task is to try to ascertain the settlor’s intention, so to speak, without regard to the consequences, and then, having construed the document, apply the test. The court, whose task it is to discover that intention, starts by applying the usual canons of construction; words must be given their usual meaning, the clause should be read literally and in accordance with the ordinary rules of grammar. But very frequently, whether it be in wills, settlements or commercial agreements, the application of such fundamental canons leads nowhere, the draftsman has used words wrongly, his sentences border on the illiterate and his grammar may be appalling. It is then the duty of the court by the exercise of its judicial knowledge and experience in the relevant matter, innate common sense and desire to make sense of the settlor’s or parties’ expressed intentions, however obscure and ambiguous the language that may have been used, to give a reasonable meaning to that language if it can do so without doing complete violence to it. The fact that the court has to see whether the clause is “certain” for a particular purpose does not disentitle the court from doing otherwise than, in the first place, try to make sense of it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 In the present case, the clause in the DOT that the plaintiff impugns for uncertainty reads: “… all assets, both personal and immoveable, owned by me, whether legally or beneficially …”. In particular, the plaintiff’s counsel argues that the word “owned by me” is ambiguous because it is capable of being combined with a number of auxiliary verbs to read, for example, “which are owned”, “which are and shall be owned” or “which may be owned”.

</div> As the latter two interpretations cover future property, which cannot be the subject of a trust, and as the DOT does not contain a severability clause which preserves the validity of the DOT as to trust property defined with reasonable certainty, the entire DOT should be invalidated.

Bearing Lord Upjohn’s guidance in mind, I consider that on a plain reading, the clause provides that all the assets the plaintiff “owned” (in the past simple tense) at the time he signed the DOT would become the subject of the trust created by the DOT. No one before the start of the trial ever suggested that the clause be read in any other way. The plaintiff himself understood that to be meaning of the clause: that is why he resisted signing the DOT initially. And that is why after being advised on the DOT he later claimed that the second defendant, by procuring his signature on it, had made him a “pauper”.

</div> The defendants do not suggest that the DOT covers future property. Their argument is that the plaintiff’s interest in his late mother’s estate subsisted at the time he signed the DOT, not that it accrued to him after he signed the DOT but was caught by the DOT’s language. The nature of that interest, and whether it has the effect for which the defendants contend, is a separate matter which I shall consider below.

</div> The defendants, on the other hand, argue that as at the time of the DOT, the plaintiff already had a right to enforce the proper administration of his late mother’s will. That right was a chose in action, and the plaintiff by the DOT created a trust over it. The trust has also since captured the fruits of the plaintiff’s exercise of that chose in action, which comprise the assets he has been apportioned under the deed of family arrangement after terminating with his sister the testamentary trust under his late mother’s will. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 It is well-established that a beneficiary of a will has an equitable right or a chose in action to have the deceased estate properly administered, and such a right may be the subject of a settlement: <span class="font-italic">Sheares Betty</span> ([115] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [38].

Thus Buckley J said in <span class="font-italic">In re Leigh’s Will Trusts</span> [1970] 1 Ch 277 at 282B, “[i]f a person entitled to such a chose in action can transmit or assign it, such transmission or assignment must carry with it the right to receive the fruits of the chose in action when they mature.” This proposition was approved by Lord Templeman in <span class="font-italic">Marshall (Inspector of Taxes) v Kerr</span> [1994] 1 AC 148 at 158A.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 This being the case, the plaintiff argues that even if the trust created by the DOT extends in any way to the plaintiff’s interest under his mother’s will, it extends only to his right to withdraw an allowance of $10,000 from his mother’s estate every month:

</div> see [9] above. This is because the plaintiff obtained his share of his late mother’s estate not by exercising his right to have the estate administered properly. He did it by (i) entering into a deed of family arrangement with his sister concerning how the assets of the estate should be apportioned between them, (ii) exercising his right under <span class="font-italic">Saunders v Vautier</span>, with his sister as co-beneficiary of their late mother’s will, to terminate their mother’s testamentary trust, and then (iii) dividing the assets according to the agreement contained in the deed of family arrangement. Qualitatively therefore, the plaintiff by choosing this course of action was not exercising his right to enforce the proper administration of his mother’s estate. In fact, he could not plausibly be regarded to have exercised that right: the will prescribes the division of the estate into “equal shares” as between the plaintiff and his sister, whereas the division agreed under deed of family agreement was unequal in terms of both number and value of the assets under the estate. What the plaintiff did was to exercise, jointly with his sister, his right under <span class="font-italic">Saunders v Vautier </span>to terminate their mother’s testamentary trust, and then contractually to apportion between themselves the assets under that trust by way of the deed of family arrangement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 The defendants contend that the DOT covers the plaintiff’s share of the estate as settled under the deed of family arrangement. They argue that the <span class="font-italic">Saunders v Vautier</span> principle confirms that the beneficiaries collectively have the beneficial interest in the property and have the right to bring the trust to an end.

</div> This right, on the part of the plaintiff, would have existed at the time the DOT was signed. Under the DOT, the plaintiff purported to place “all” his assets on trust for the first defendant, and that could be read as including his right under <span class="font-italic">Saunders v Vautier</span> to terminate his mother’s testamentary trust. This last point is a complex point that would have benefited from full arguments, which were not made, in part because the plaintiff responded substantively to the point  in his late written reply. The plaintiff’s response is to highlight that the apportionment of the estate’s assets was not a given, but was contingent on (i) a contractual arrangement with his sister; and (ii) his sister’s decision to exercise her right under <span class="font-italic">Saunders v Vautier</span> jointly with him. Having not responded to this argument, however, the defendants may simply have taken the view that the plaintiff, having held his <span class="font-italic">Saunders v Vautier</span> right on trust under the DOT, and having exercised that right with his sister, exercised it in keeping with his fiduciary duty to the first defendant under the DOT. On this hypothesis, the fruits of his exercise of the right still comprise the part of his mother’s estate which he was apportioned and which he continues to hold on trust for the first defendant under the DOT. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 I did not pursue these points with counsel and I highlight them only briefly here because it is not strictly necessary for me to decide the issue. My findings on the plaintiff’s primary case and my conclusion that the DOT defines the trust property with sufficient certainty are sufficient to dispose of this case. To the extent that actionable damage is required to establish misrepresentation, the plaintiff was already a man of substantial means at the time he signed the DOT, with two apartments in the Marina Bay Sands area. These assets are within the scope of the DOT. The points discussed here are perhaps more relevant to the claim on unconscionability, as they make clear the possible extent of the voluntary disposition. Even in that regard, nevertheless, the specific extent of the plaintiff’s wealth is less important than the fact that the second defendant intended to secure its fullest possible measure. Her attempt to do so – in the plaintiff’s moment of vulnerability – is that which shocks the conscience of the court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Judgment  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 In the result, the DOT of 26 March 2014 is set aside.
