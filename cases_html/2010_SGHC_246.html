<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Thumb (China) Holdings Group Limited
                    (“Thumb”) is an investment holding company incorporated in the
                    British Virgin Islands (“BVI”). It filed the present action for a
                    declaration that on a true and proper construction of a Deed of Release dated
                    23 September 2009 (“the Deed of Release”) entered into
                    between Thumb and Hero Key Limited (“Hero Key”), a company
                    incorporated in Hong Kong, Hero Key is under an obligation to take all necessary
                    steps to effect the release of a share charge dated 13 March 2008
                    (“the Share Charge”) in respect of 138,235,390 shares in Radiance
                    Group Limited, formerly known as Radiance Electronics Limited
                    (“Radiance”) including, by itself or by instructing its depository
                    agent Philip Securities Pte Ltd (“Philip Securities”) the
                    execution of a form, referred to as Form L, with The Central Depository
                    (Pte) Ltd (“CDP”) and also for consequential orders. After hearing
                    arguments, I made the substantive declaration sought, with Philip Securities to
                    execute Form L as Hero Key’s depository agent and consequential
                    orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The court’s reasons</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Thumb is wholly owned by Sun Jiangrong
                    (“SJR”) who is also the sole director of Thumb. Thumb’s
                    major asset is its interest in 138,235,390 shares in Radiance (“the
                    Radiance Shares”) which represents 52.41% of the issued capital of
                    Radiance. Radiance is a company listed on the mainboard of the Singapore Stock
                    Exchange.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Hero Key is owned and was controlled by
                    SJR’s brother Sun Shao Feng.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 13 August 2007, a Notes Trust Deed was
                    entered into between Thumb (previously known as Sino Fortune Union Investment
                    Limited) of the first part, SJR of the second part, and The Bank of New York
                    Mellon (“BNYM”) (previously known as The Bank of New York), as
                    trustee of the notes of the third part (the “Notes Trust Deed”).
                    The Notes Trust Deed was subsequently amended and restated by an Amendment and
                    Accession Deed dated 5 March 2008 (the “Amendment and Accession
                    Deed”). Pursuant to the terms of the Notes Trust Deed, Thumb issued notes
                    (“the Notes”) to noteholders in the aggregate principal amount of
                    S$120 million. Under the terms of the Notes Trust Deed, Thumb was scheduled to
                    repay the principal amount outstanding under the Notes on 15 February
                    2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Subsequently, by a loan agreement entered into
                    between Thumb and Hero Key dated 13 March 2008 (“the Loan
                    Agreement”), Hero Key was said to have made available to Thumb a loan of
                    HK$180 million.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement,
                    Thumb executed the Share Charge in favour of Hero Key over the Radiance Shares
                    as security for the loan granted by Hero Key to Thumb under the Loan
                    Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Share Charge was registered in the Register
                    of Corporate Affairs of the BVI (“the BVI Share Register”) a year
                    later on 20 March 2009 and endorsed in the register of charges maintained
                    with CDP by the lodgement of the relevant executed form with CDP.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 14 August 2009, an action was commenced
                    by BNYM against Thumb and Hero Key in Suit 703/2009/Y (“Suit 703”)
                    in Singapore. On 24 August 2009, upon the application of BNYM made by way
                    of ex-parte Summons No 4455 of 2009/G filed on 21 August 2009, an interim
                    injunction was granted against Thumb and Hero Key (the “24 August 2009
                    Order”). Pursuant to the 24 August 2009 Order, it was ordered that
                    Thumb and Hero Key by themselves, their officers, employees, servants and/or
                    agents or otherwise howsoever be restrained from effecting a transfer of the
                    Radiance Shares to Hero Key or any other party, or otherwise dealing with the
                    same, until further order or the final determination of the action in Suit
                    703.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 1 October 2009, BNYM filed a statement
                    of claim in Suit 703 against Thumb and Hero Key, alleging, <em>inter alia</em>, that the entry into the Loan Agreement and the
                    issuance of the Share Charge was in breach of certain covenants in the Notes
                    Trust Deed. BNYM sought, <em>inter alia</em>, a declaration
                    that the Share Charge was void and/or unenforceable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Subsequent to the 24 August 2009 Order,
                    Thumb and Hero Key executed the Deed of Release on 23 September 2009
                    pursuant to which Hero Key released the Share Charge. The Deed of Release was
                    prepared by Hero Key’s solicitors, Yeo-Leong &amp; Peh LLC
                    (“YLP”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 2 October 2009, upon compliance with
                    the requirements under the laws of the BVI for a cessation of charge, the Share
                    Charge was deregistered from the BVI Share Register, with the knowledge and
                    consent of Hero Key.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 3 November 2009, Christopher Stride,
                    Cosimo Borrelli and Hamish Christie were appointed as joint and several
                    liquidators of Thumb by an order of court of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court
                    of BVI.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Pursuant to s 130N of the Companies Act
                    (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed in Singapore), a discharge of a charge over
                    shares effected by endorsement of the charge against the subject shares
                    registered with CDP is effected by a cancellation of the endorsement of the
                    charge against the shares in the register of charges and in the account of the
                    chargor. Section 130N of the Companies Act read with Reg 23 of the Companies
                    (Central Depository System) Regulations provides that the said cancellation is
                    effected by the execution and lodgement of Form L with the CDP. Form L
                    can only be executed by the chargee or its depository agent. Accordingly, in the
                    present instance, Hero Key or its depository agent, Philip Securities would have
                    to execute and lodge Form L with CDP to effect the cancellation of the
                    endorsement of the Share Charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Accordingly, following the liquidators’
                    appointment, the liquidators’ solicitors, Tan Kok Quan Partnership
                    (“TKQP”) wrote to Hero Key’s solicitors, YLP on
                    10 December 2009 to request that Hero Key execute Form L. A
                    Form L, with the particulars of Thumb filled in, was enclosed with the
                    letter. It was also stated that for the avoidance of doubt, the liquidators made
                    no admission as to the validity of the Share Charge, the Deed of Release
                    (described as Discharge of Charge in the letter) or the debt the Share Charge
                    purported to secure. The liquidators said that they could not admit to the said
                    matters as they were the subject matter of Suit 730 and were matters that needed
                    to be investigated by the liquidators in discharge of their duties. Further,
                    since these transactions preceded the liquidators appointment, the liquidators
                    said they were not bound by them or any admissions made therein. The
                    liquidators’ position was therefore reserved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In reply, YLP wrote to TKQP on
                    21 December 2009, stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that
                    TKQP’s letter dated 10 December 2009 insinuated that the Share Charge
                    and the underlying debt were invalid or improperly obtained/incurred and that
                    this position was unacceptable to Hero Key. YLP requested that the liquidators
                    rectify their position by acknowledging the validity of the Share Charge and the
                    underlying debt before parties proceeded further in the matter. YLP also
                    requested for a copy of the document described as ‘Discharge of
                    Charge’ in TKQP’s letter dated 10 December 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     TKQP replied to YLP on 22 December 2009
                    (the letter is incorrectly dated 10 December 2009) stating that the
                    liquidators did not insinuate that the Share Charge and the underlying debt were
                    void and/or unenforceable and that the liquidators were unable to take a
                    position on such issues as they were matters that they had to examine. The
                    letter also stated that positions taken by Thumb prior to the appointment of the
                    liquidators did not bind the liquidators.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In the same letter, Hero Key was again
                    requested to execute Form L. Hero Key was told that in light of the
                    execution of the Deed of Release, the liquidators had reasonably assumed and
                    were entitled to say that Hero Key would execute Form L in performance of
                    the Deed of Release.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The liquidators said that they were
                    subsequently given to understand that Philip Securities would not execute
                    Form L without a variation of the 24 August 2009 Order (made in the
                    suit commenced by BNYM) to allow for the same. Accordingly, the liquidators, on
                    behalf of Thumb, made an application by way of Summons 339/2010/T on
                    22 January 2010 for the 24 August 2009 Order to be varied to allow for
                    all necessary steps to be taken to perform the Deed of Release and discharge the
                    Share Charge, including the execution of Form L by Philip
                    Securities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On 5 February 2010, Hero Key’s
                    counsel, Mr Kenny Chooi, said to the court hearing the variation
                    application that Hero Key was not objecting to the application to vary without
                    any admission to the allegations made by the liquidators. Accordingly, the court
                    granted an order in terms of the liquidators’ application on
                    5 February 2010 (“the 5 February 2010 Order”) thereby
                    varying the 24 August 2009 Order such that Thumb and Hero Key, by
                    themselves, their officers, employees, servants and/or agents, including Philip
                    Securities, were granted liberty to take any necessary action required for the
                    discharge of the Share Charge including and without limitation the execution of
                    documents to effect the same with CDP.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Following the making of the 5 February
                    2010 Order, the liquidators requested Philip Securities to execute Form L
                    by a letter from TKQP dated 12 February 2010. The letter was copied to YLP
                    and enclosed a copy of the 5 February 2010 Order and TKQP’s letter to
                    YLP dated 10 December 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     However, Philip Securities declined to execute
                    Form L unless it received instructions to do so from Hero
                Key.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Accordingly, TKQP wrote to YLP on
                    17 February 2010, pointing out that the 24 August 2009 Order has been
                    varied by the 5 February 2010 Order to allow for the discharge of the Share
                    Charge and requested that Hero Key and/or its depository agent execute
                    Form L within seven days from the date of the letter. It was reiterated
                    that Form L had been forwarded to YLP for Hero Key’s execution as
                    Hero Key had executed the Deed of Release and the liquidators had reasonably
                    assumed and were entitled to therefore say that Hero Key would execute and/or
                    instruct its depository agent to execute Form L to implement the covenants
                    in the Deed of Release. YLP’s response, which is discussed in the next
                    paragraph, did not deny or take issue with this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     On 25 February 2010, YLP replied pointing
                    out that the name of the chargor had been spelt incorrectly in the copy of
                    Form L which had been forwarded to YLP under cover of TKQP’s letter
                    dated 10 December 2010, <em>ie</em>, two and a half
                    months earlier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     TKQP then forwarded Form L, duly
                    corrected, to YLP under cover of their letter dated 4 March 2010. In the
                    same letter, Hero Key was requested to arrange for the execution of Form L
                    without delay as the matter had been outstanding for a long time. The urgency
                    stemmed from an imminent sale of the Radiance Shares by the
                liquidators.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In response, by a letter dated 8 March
                    2010 from YLP, Hero Key took several positions. The liquidators summarised the
                    positions as follows. First, Hero Key asserted for the first time that it was
                    under no legal obligation to execute and lodge Form L. This was the first
                    unequivocal indication that Hero Key would not do so. Secondly, Hero Key
                    asserted, again for the first time, that the liquidators’ expectation that
                    Hero Key would execute and lodge Form L was not reasonable and did not give
                    rise to a cause of action. Thirdly, Hero Key took the position that it might not
                    be in a position to sign Form L as the Radiance Shares were not registered
                    under its name. The liquidators were therefore told to liaise with Philip
                    Securities with regard to the execution of Form L.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     By their letter dated 10 March 2010, TKQP
                    said that Philip Securities would require direct instructions from YLP or Hero
                    Key before Philip Securities would proceed to execute Form L. YLP was
                    therefore requested to instruct Philip Securities to execute Form L and to
                    forward TKQP a copy of the written instructions to Philip Securities as soon as
                    possible, latest by 12 March 2010. TKQP did not receive any response from
                    YLP.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The liquidators then filed an application in
                    Summons 1191 of 2010 in Suit 703 for Hero Key and/or its agents to take all
                    necessary steps to discharge the Share Charge. However, the application was not
                    successful because of procedural objections which I need not elaborate
                    on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Eventually, the liquidators had to resort to
                    the present action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     It appeared that Hero Key refused to
                    co-operate because the liquidators had not admitted the validity of the
                    underlying loan which gave rise to the creation of the Share
                Charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Hero Key sought to justify its position by
                    pointing out that the Deed of Release was executed gratuitously, <em>ie</em>, Hero Key did not receive any payment for the same.
                    This was irrelevant since there was no issue of absence of consideration as the
                    instrument was a deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Secondly, Hero Key pointed out that there was
                    no express provision in the Deed of Release requiring it or its agent to execute
                    Form L. While that was true, the liquidators were relying on an implied
                    undertaking or obligation of Hero Key for Hero Key or its agent to do
                so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Thirdly, Hero Key pointed out that the
                    omission to execute Form L did not deprive the Deed of Release of all
                    validity. Thumb had been released from various obligations under the Share
                    Charge and Hero Key would not be able to enforce its power of sale over the
                    Reliance Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     It seemed to me that this submission
                    reinforced the liquidators’ position. Hero Key was not disputing that the
                    charge was released. However, it refused to give full effect to the release by
                    refusing to execute Form L or to give instructions to Philips Securities to
                    do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Hero Key said that it was for the liquidators
                    to take a more conciliatory approach towards it to win its co-operation, citing
                    the case of <em>Bee See &amp; Tay v Ong Hun Seang</em>
                    [1997] 1 SLR(R) 469.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     As for the variation of the 24 August 2009
                    Order by the 5 February 2010 Order, Hero Key took the position that the
                    variation was permissive only and did not compel Hero Key to execute or procure
                    the execution of Form L.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In my view, Hero Key’s position was
                    untenable. The case it relied on was based on materially different facts. The
                    defendant there was under no obligation to do as the plaintiffs sought. That was
                    why the plaintiffs there ought to have adopted a less combative
                stance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In the present case, the issue was whether
                    Hero Key was obliged to execute or procure the execution of Form L. If it
                    was so obliged, there was no need for the liquidators to take a more
                    conciliatory approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I was of the view that as a matter of
                    commercial efficacy, it must be implied that Hero Key would do all that was
                    reasonably necessary to give full effect to the very substance under the Deed of
                    Release, <em>ie</em>, the release of the
                charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Furthermore, I was of the view that Hero Key
                    was estopped from refusing to co-operate as it had by its conduct, <em>ie</em>, its omission to object to the variation of the
                    24 August 2009 Order led the court and Thumb to believe that it would
                    execute or procure the execution of Form L even though the variation order
                    did not specifically direct it to do so. I should, however, add that the
                    liquidators did not rest their case primarily on estoppel in order to avoid any
                    suggestion that there was a dispute of fact which might require a
                trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In the circumstances, I made the substantive
                    declaration sought, with Philip Securities to execute Form L as Hero
                    Key’s depository agent, and consequential orders which included costs
                    against Hero Key. It then filed an appeal against my decision which it withdrew
                    prior to the finalisation of my grounds of decision.</p>
