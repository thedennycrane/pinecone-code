It is not in dispute, however, that the money which the plaintiff lent to the Biomax Group ultimately came from Mr Han. It is for this reason that Mr Han frequently referred to the unpaid loans in his cross-examination as “his” money and to himself as the lender.

The first two of these investments were the subject matter of an earlier action which the plaintiff brought against SCP and BT by way of Suit No 765 of 2016 (“S765”) (see <span class="font-italic">Ma </span><span class="font-italic">Hongjin v SCP Holdings Pte Ltd</span> [2018] 4 SLR 1276); <span class="font-italic">Ma </span><span class="font-italic">Hongjin v SCP Holdings Pte Ltd and another</span> [2019] SGHC 277; affirmed on appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ma </span><span class="font-italic">Hongjin v SCP Holdings Pte Ltd</span> [2020] SGCA 106).

</div> The defendant’s defence does not attack any other element of the plaintiff’s claim. Thus, for example, the defendant does not assert in the alternative that the Representations are not representations of present fact or are true.

Nor does the defendant assert that he owed the plaintiff no duty to take reasonable care in making the Representations or that he exercised reasonable care in doing so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 To determine the plaintiff’s claim, therefore, I need only analyse the two specific elements of the plaintiff’s claim to which the defendant has confined his defence.

</div> Rather, her affidavit identifies which of the Representations she can recall and which she cannot.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The critical weakness in Ms Chua’s evidence, however, is that she was shown the plaintiff’s pleaded case on the Representations and then asked to comment on them in her affidavit of evidence in chief. Thus, para 15 of Ms Chua’s affidavit cites verbatim para 16 of the plaintiff’s statement of claim. That is the paragraph in which the plaintiff pleads in detail the Representations and Background Representations. It is only after citing para 16 of the statement of claim verbatim that Ms Chua comments on each Representation as the plaintiff has pleaded it.

</div> I accept the defendant’s submission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Unlike a witness who is shown a contemporaneous document and asked to recall material events from her own memory, Ms Chua was shown a set of contentious and detailed assertions in a document which the plaintiff created after the fact, specifically for the purpose of advancing her case in this action. Ms Chua was then asked to confirm whether these assertions were true. I consider that affidavit evidence in chief which is elicited in this way is no different from oral evidence in chief elicited in the witness stand by means of impermissible leading questions. The manner in which the evidence is elicited diminishes much of the weight which can be attached to it as the product of Ms Chua’s memory and her own recollection of events. It also diminishes much of the weight which can be attached to the claim that Ms Chua’s evidence in chief is independent of the plaintiff’s recollection, evidence and case in this action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 I therefore accept the defendant’s submission that Ms Chua’s evidence does not merit the substantial weight which would ordinarily be accorded to the independent recollection of a disinterested witness.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 My finding is supported by observations on the memory of factual witnesses made in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Sandz Solutions (Singapore) Pte Ltd and others v Strategic Worldwide Assets Ltd and others </span>[2014] 3 SLR 562<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Sandz</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Sandz</span>, the Court of Appeal noted that witnesses are “particularly vulnerable and susceptible to suggestion and misinformation where the passage of time has allowed the original memory to fade” (at [54]). Information which is framed in a contentious manner and which is supplied to a witness after the events in question can make the witness more likely to recall key details of those events incorrectly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 To be clear, there is no allegation or finding of impropriety on the part of plaintiff’s counsel in taking this approach. Neither is there any finding or suggestion that Ms Chua shaped her evidence consciously or unconsciously to be consistent with the plaintiff’s pleaded case, let alone that she was lying. Rather, my point simply is that the approach taken in preparing Ms Chua’s affidavit of evidence in chief diminishes significantly the weight which I can attach to her evidence on the two counts which I have mentioned (see [33] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Second, I find it wholly improbable that Ms Chua would have been able to remember the contents of one of many discussions in 2015 five years later in 2020 if she had not been primed by being shown the plaintiff’s pleaded case.

</div> if the defendant did make the Sole Use Representation in July 2015, the inherent probabilities are that the Master Loan Agreement, signed less than a month later, would be consistent with that Representation. At the very least, the Master Loan Agreement would not contradict the Sole Use Representation. But that is precisely what it does. It is wholly inconsistent with the Sole Use Representation for the Master Loan Agreement to give BT the power to use the loans for wholly different purposes: for BT’s expansion plans and working capital.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The course of dealings between the parties shows that they have in other contracts specified the use of loan monies.

With their combined business knowledge and acumen, Mr Han was content to negotiate, and the plaintiff was content to sign, the Master Loan Agreement containing these two terms and with no mention of the contradictory Sole Use Representation. The inherent probabilities are that the Master Loan Agreement would have recorded the Sole Use Representation or that, if it did not, or if it contained contradictory terms, the plaintiff and Mr Han would have objected or even declined to execute it.

In July 2015, Mr Han reported to the Chinese authorities in the PRC as he was required to do. On 12 October 2015, Ms Chua messaged the plaintiff asking after her and Mr Han. The plaintiff replied, “I’m quite alright, [Mr Han] did not say and I did not ask, believe he is more anxious than I, waiting.” At trial, the plaintiff testified that this message referred not to any anxiety about how the PRC authorities would treat Mr Han, but to anxiety about the large investment she and Mr Han had made in the Biomax Group. She said that, as she and Mr Han “focused on each and every step of the business… [they] would more or less have worries about it”.

In <span class="font-italic">Broadley</span>, a subcontractor had difficulty paying its supplier because of the main contractor’s conduct. To address this difficulty, the parties signed a tripartite undertaking authorising the main contractor to pay the supplier directly on the subcontractor’s behalf. The undertaking also released the subcontractor from all liability to the supplier. Just before the parties signed the undertaking, the supplier told the subcontractor that, if the main contractor did not pay the supplier, the subcontractor would remain liable to the supplier. The subcontractor remained silent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The Court of Appeal found that the supplier could not rescind the undertaking for fraudulent misrepresentation. Even if the subcontractor’s silence amounted to a misrepresentation that it accepted that it would remain liable to the supplier if the main contractor failed to pay, any misimpression which the supplier was labouring under was corrected by the terms of the undertaking. Because the undertaking expressly provided that the subcontractor was released from liability, the supplier could not have been induced by the misrepresentation into signing the undertaking (at [32]). The Court held that a plaintiff “would not ordinarily be held to be induced by a misrepresentation if the express contractual terms, which the plaintiff placed importance on, read and signed, and which the defendant expected that the plaintiff would read and understand, contradict or correct the defendant’s misrepresentation” (at [36]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Recital A and cl 1.1 of the Master Loan Agreement correct the Sole Use Representation by stating that the unpaid loans will be for the broad purposes of BT’s expansion plans and working capital (see [42] above).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The plaintiff argues, in other words, that this is not a case where the parties “placed importance on” (<span class="font-italic">Broadley</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [36]) the express contractual terms regarding the purpose of the unpaid loans. For three reasons, I reject the plaintiff’s submission that <span class="font-italic">Broadley</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>does not apply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 First, I do not read <span class="font-italic">Broadley</span> as authority for the proposition that a plaintiff may be induced by a misrepresentation that is corrected by the express contractual terms where the plaintiff does not place importance on the contractual document. The reason the express terms of a contract preclude a finding of inducement by a prior misrepresentation is that the plaintiff is taken to have read the contract and to know from the express terms that the misrepresentation is false. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Broadley</span> pointed out that parties to a contract are responsible for reading the contracts they sign (at [36]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… it is a corollary of the basic principle of contract law that a person is bound by the terms of the contract he signs, notwithstanding that he may be unaware of its precise legal effect. Such a claimant should be taken to have actually read the contract and known the falsity of the earlier representation. To hold otherwise would undercut the basis of the conduct of commercial life – that businessmen with equal bargaining power would read their contracts and defend their own interests before entering into contractual obligations, and that they would rely on their counterparties to do the same. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Second, the evidence of the defendant’s own understanding of the Shares Investment Agreement does not suffice to establish the parties’ alleged intention that the Master Loan Agreement would not contain their whole agreement as to the purpose to which the unpaid loans could be applied. The plaintiff and Mr Han’s own understanding that the unpaid loans would be used solely for enzyme digestor machines does not suffice either.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Finally, whatever the parties’ intention may have been, the question is whether the Sole Use Representation induced the plaintiff to extend the unpaid loans to BT. If the plaintiff chose to sign the Master Loan Agreement, despite Recital A and cl 1.1, on the assumption that the funds would be used only for the production of enzyme digestor machines, then like the alleged representee in <span class="font-italic">Broadley</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>she was induced to enter into the contract not by any representation but by her own assumption. The plaintiff does not plead that the defendant made any representation, whether by words or conduct, as to the contents of the Master Loan Agreement or the effect of Recital A and cl 1.1. And if the plaintiff chose instead to sign the Master Loan Agreement without making any assumption as to the use of the funds, the truth or falsity of the Sole Use Representation was not important to her in the first place.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 It is true that the Master Loan Agreement came after the July Loan, and so could not have corrected the Sole Use Representation in connection with the July Loan.

</div> I nevertheless find that the plaintiff did not rely on the Sole Use Representation when she entered into the July Loan, as seen from her conduct when she signed the Master Loan Agreement. If the plaintiff had relied on the Sole Use Representation in July 2015, one would expect her to have sought clarification upon reading the terns of the Master Loan Agreement which contradicted the Sole Use Representation. She did not.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Sales and Profitability Representations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The plaintiff’s case is that the following parts of the Sales and Profitability Representations are actionable representations:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) That BT had secured orders from prospective clients for enzyme digestor machines but was unable to meet them only because it lacked money; and that at least ten enzyme digestor machines could be sold in 2015; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) That BT was making profits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Because the Sales and Profitability Representations concern BT’s revenue and profitability, they have a direct effect on BT’s ability to repay the unpaid loans. Therefore, it is at least conceivable that these Representations could have induced the plaintiff to grant loans to BT. But I decline to draw that inference for four reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 First, the plaintiff’s evidence suggests that she did her own research and formed her own view that BT’s business was profitable before deciding to extend the unpaid loans to it. When defendant’s counsel put it to the plaintiff that she could have insisted that she would not lend money to BT unless she saw SCP’s and BT’s accounts showing their profitability, she said that the defendant refused to let her and Mr Han see the accounts but that they chose to invest because of other information:

On the plaintiff and Mr Han’s own account, the defendant had disappointed them in the months before July 2015 with a project that had failed, contrary to the defendant’s expectations. Specifically, around the time the plaintiff entered into the Convertible Loan Agreement with SCP in January 2015, the defendant allegedly told Mr Han that he had a project in the US. The defendant allegedly said that the project would produce a result in one or two months such that, in Mr Han’s words, “we can earn a lot of money”. But one or two months later, the defendant told Mr Han that the project had failed.

The loan envisaged was not ultimately extended only because its purpose could not be carried out.

</div> If the Sales and Profitability Representations played a real and substantial role in the plaintiff extending the unpaid loans, one would expect the plaintiff or Mr Han to express concern and ask about the payment terms of the non-performing buyers. Sales of enzyme digestor machines which resulted in bad debts would affect BT’s profitability. What Mr Han did, however, was to agree readily to roll over the loans and merely to ask the defendant to recover payment for the machines as soon as possible.
