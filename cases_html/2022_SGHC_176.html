Upon collision, the first victim was flung off her motorcycle. The appellant’s motor car swerved right and collided into the right rear portion of the second victim’s motor car.

At [15] of the SOF, it is stated that the appellant had caused grievous hurt to the first victim under s 320(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”), as she had sustained a fracture. During the hearing of the appeal, the Prosecution conceded that this was incorrect as the fracture was merely a “suspicious” or suspected fracture. Instead, the grievous hurt caused in the present case related to the category of hurt whereby the sufferer was unable to follow his ordinary pursuits during the space of 20 days, under s 320(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the PC. Notwithstanding this error, I accept that the Prosecution’s reliance on s 320(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the PC to establish grievous hurt is borne out by the facts admitted to by the appellant in the SOF. Moreover, this irregularity does not cause any prejudice to the appellant who, in any event, does not contest that grievous hurt was caused. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The DJ accepted the Prosecution’s submission that a possible starting point to determine the appropriate sentence in the present case was the framework set out in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Cullen Richard Alexander </span>[2020] SGDC 88 (“<span class="font-italic">Cullen</span>”), hereinafter referred to as the <span class="font-italic">Cullen </span>framework which is reproduced at Annex A. <span class="font-italic">Cullen</span> similarly concerned an offender charged with an offence under s 65(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the RTA.

This thereby fails to account for Parliament’s stratification of the offences under s 65 of the RTA into different sub-provisions based on the type of harm caused to the victim.

</div> Indeed, this concern is similarly shared by Ms Gopalan in her submissions, which I will consider below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 On the facts, the appellant asserts that the DJ had erred in classifying the harm caused to the first victim as “very serious”.

Moreover, notwithstanding that she had been admitted to TTSH in a comatose state, her condition had gradually improved, and she was subsequently moved from the Intensive Care Unit (“ICU”) to the acute care wards on 3 January 2021.

We will also streamline the offences into two classes: the first category is Reckless or Dangerous Driving, which I will refer to as Dangerous Driving in the rest of the speech. The second category is Driving without Due Care or Reasonable Consideration which I will refer to as Careless Driving. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The definitions of Dangerous Driving and Careless Driving are currently in the RTA. We will maintain the current definitions. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Dangerous Driving is more serious than Careless Driving. The two can be differentiated, on a case-by-case basis. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">When determining the punishment, we will look at the circumstances under which the offence is committed. The threshold for Dangerous Driving is higher than Careless Driving; so too the penalties.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Besides looking at the circumstances of the offence, our enhanced approach will also consider the level of harm caused. If the motorist causes more harm, the level of punishment will be higher. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There will be four levels of harm: Death, Grievous Hurt, Hurt and Endangering Life. Such tiering of harm is not new in our laws – the Penal Code already has it. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">To summarise, we will enhance our overall approach to penalise irresponsible driving depending on: (a) the circumstances of the offence – whether it constitutes Dangerous Driving or Careless Driving; and (b) the level of harm caused – whether they result in Death, Grievous Hurt, Hurt, or Endangering Life. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I make two key observations in relation to the legislative amendments which are especially pertinent in the context of careless or inconsiderate driving offences under s 65 of the RTA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 First, as was observed by Sundaresh Menon CJ (“Menon CJ”) in <span class="font-italic">Wu Zhi Yong </span>at [15] (albeit in the related context of s 64 of the RTA), the Amendment Act envisaged a new scheme of penalties for careless or inconsiderate driving in a tiered structure calibrated according to the degree of hurt caused. This is codified in the RTA as ss 65(2) to 65(5). The maximum punishments which may be imposed for each category of harm increase concomitantly with the seriousness of the harm caused; this translates into wider ranges of punishments where more serious harm is occasioned. For instance, where death is caused, s 65(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) provides that a first-time offender is liable to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or to both. In contrast, the residual category (where no actual physical harm is caused, but which includes cases of non-personal injury or potential harm) captured in s 65(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) provides that a first-time offender is liable to a fine not exceeding $1,500 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 By tiering the punishment provisions in accordance with the type of harm suffered, Parliament has given clear expression to the need to give explicit consideration to the <span class="font-italic">outcomes</span> that result from instances of careless or inconsiderate driving. This is a stark departure from the structure of s 65 of the pre-2019 RTA, where there was a single range of punishment with no differentiation based on the type and/or degree of harm caused.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Second, while Parliament has retained the distinction between reckless or dangerous driving under s 64 of the RTA and careless or inconsiderate driving under s 65 of the RTA, this distinction has been made more pronounced through the refining of the punishment provisions. These two provisions reflect the differing circumstances under which an irresponsible driving offence can occur. As can be seen from the Minister’s speech quoted above at [36], the former offence is regarded as being more serious than the latter, reflecting primarily the differing levels of culpability of the offenders. Accordingly, the current architecture of the RTA concerning irresponsible driving offences tiers the punishment provisions according to <span class="font-italic">both</span> harm and culpability, not dissimilar to the PC.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The appropriateness of a sentencing framework </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Having made these preliminary observations on the legislative amendments to the RTA, I now turn to consider whether it is appropriate to lay down a sentencing framework for offences under s 65(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the RTA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Purpose of sentencing and sentencing frameworks </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 At its core, sentencing is an exercise of judicial discretion. However, this discretion is neither unprincipled nor unfettered. The sentencing court is guided in arriving at the appropriate sentence in each case by considering and weighing the four classical principles of sentencing, namely, deterrence, retribution, prevention and rehabilitation. The court is also to have regard to sentencing factors which reflect the seriousness of the offence(s) committed by the offender and other circumstances unique to the individual offender. These are often categorised as offence-specific factors and offender-specific factors respectively. Behind this approach is the keen desire to deliver individualised justice which is sensitive to the particular facts and circumstances of each case and offender. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Apart from the endeavour to deliver individualised justice, another key aspect of sentencing has also been to ensure consistency in both outcome and approach. To put it simply, the courts strive to treat like cases alike, while being flexible enough to accommodate the subtle differences in every case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 One of the means by which the courts have sought to translate these principles of sentencing into practice has been through the adoption of sentencing frameworks. In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Pang Shuo </span>[2016] 3 SLR 903 at [28], Chan Seng Onn J (as he then was) eloquently described the function of sentencing frameworks as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A good sentencing framework thus provides the analytical frame of reference to allow the sentencing judge to achieve a reasoned, fair and appropriate sentence in line with other like cases while having due regard to the facts of each particular case. Such guidelines also promote public confidence in sentencing, and enhance sentencing transparency and accountability in the administration of criminal justice. Broad consistency in sentencing also provides society with a clear understanding of what and how the law seeks to punish and allows for members of society to have regard to this in arranging their own affairs and making their own choices.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The key aims of a good sentencing framework can thus be distilled into three main goals: (a) to be instructive (without being prescriptive); (b) to be communicative; and (c) to deliver consistent outcomes. These serve as helpful evaluative criteria to ascertain the suitability of a sentencing framework for a particular offence. The first criterion assesses the quality of the guidance provided to sentencing judges. In this connection, the sentencing framework should strike a balance between preserving the flexibility of sentencing judges to deliver individualised justice while providing a clear structure to guide the exercise of their sentencing discretion. Another aspect of this criterion relates to the ease of application of the sentencing framework by the courts. The second criterion assesses the sentencing framework’s consonance with legislative intention and public policy considerations and the effectiveness of the manner in which these are conveyed to the public at large. Finally, the third criterion assesses the sentencing framework’s ability to set out a consistent approach which results in consistent outcomes. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Reasons for a sentencing framework for offences under s 65(3)(a) of the RTA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Having set out the general principles concerning sentencing and the purpose behind the adoption of sentencing frameworks, I now turn to set out the specific reasons why I agree with the parties and Ms Gopalan that a sentencing framework for offences under s 65(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the RTA is appropriate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 It has been observed that it would not be wise to formulate a framework when there is an insufficient body of case law before the court: see <span class="font-italic">Kwan Weiguang v Public Prosecutor </span>[2022] SGHC 121 at [44]. As mentioned above, s 65(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the RTA is a relatively new provision which came into effect only on 1 November 2019. Consequently, there is a paucity of reasoned decisions to enable the court to plot out with clarity a discernible sentencing pattern on which to base a sentencing framework. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 However, the lack of a large corpus of case law to draw from does not form an absolute bar to the promulgation of a sentencing framework for a particular offence. In <span class="font-italic">Wu Zhi Yong</span>, Menon CJ formulated a sentencing framework for offences under s 64(2C)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with s 64(2C)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the RTA. This was done despite the dearth of sentencing precedents involving offences under those specific provisions. Indeed, in some cases the lack of reasoned decisions has been cited as one of the reasons to adopt a sentencing framework. In <span class="font-italic">Huang Ying-Chun v Public Prosecutor </span>[2019] 3 SLR 606 (“<span class="font-italic">Huang Ying-Chun</span>”) at [32], See Kee Oon J (“See J”) observed that it would be useful for the High Court to set out a sentencing framework for cash laundering offences under s 44(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed) (“CDSA”) in order to provide guidance on sentencing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 More importantly, the key reason for setting out a sentencing framework for this offence arises from a pressing need to ensure consistency in this area for the following reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 First, there has been a high number of road traffic accidents where grievous hurt has resulted which have been prosecuted under s 65(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the RTA in the lower courts since the 2019 RTA amendments took effect. A search helpfully conducted by Ms Gopalan on 15 January 2022 in the State Courts Sentencing Information and Research Repository database revealed that there have been no less than 115 charges brought for offences under s 65(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). The frequency with which such cases land themselves in the lower courts makes it especially important to ensure a measure of consistency. It has also come to my attention that there are a number of appeals arising from the lower courts’ decisions concerning offences under s 65(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the RTA which are awaiting the outcome of this decision, in view of the possibility that a sentencing framework would be formulated to guide future cases. In <span class="font-italic">Huang Ying-Chun </span>at [34], See J similarly accepted that sentencing guidance from an appellate court would be especially useful due to the “pipeline” of pending prosecutions and appeals against decisions relating to offences under s 44(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CDSA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Second, as the Prosecution highlights, two differing sentencing frameworks for offences under s 65(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the RTA have surfaced in the courts below.

</div>
</div> In <span class="font-italic">Cullen</span>, the district judge set out a two-stage, five-step sentencing framework based on the sentencing approach adopted in <span class="font-italic">Logachev</span>. In contrast, the district judge in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Chuah Choon Yee </span>[2021] SGDC 264 declined to follow the approach in <span class="font-italic">Cullen</span> as she found that there was a lack of range of outcomes on the harm axis and the suggested working or functional definition for each degree of harm was difficult to apply in practice (at [22]). Instead, she proposed an alternative framework based on the sentencing bands approach set out in <span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 2 SLR 449 (“<span class="font-italic">Terence </span><span class="font-italic">Ng</span>”). It does not conduce to certainty and consistency for differing approaches to be adopted by the lower courts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 On balance, I find that it is desirable for this court to clarify the law and lay down a sentencing framework for offences under s 65(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the RTA. Nevertheless, I must emphasise that the sentencing framework set out below is not to be taken as one that is cast in stone. With the gradual accretion of case law and the manifold factual situations that present themselves before the courts, subsequent amendments and modifications may have to be made to refine the approach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Thus, having determined that a sentencing framework is appropriate, I now turn to address the question of which sentencing approach should be adopted. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The appropriate sentencing framework </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Types of sentencing approaches</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Over the years, the courts have promulgated numerous sentencing frameworks for a wide range of offences. These sentencing frameworks have taken on different forms and various descriptive labels have been used to classify them based on their primary characteristics. In many ways, this has made the selection of particular sentencing frameworks for different types of offences a simpler exercise. However, despite the development of new sentencing frameworks utilising new approaches, the nomenclature used to classify them has unfortunately failed to develop at the same pace. This has resulted in some confusion in the submissions made before this court. I therefore find it timely to restore some clarity in this area.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 It is helpful to begin with the various approaches set out in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> at [26] and [39]. The Court of Appeal set out five main approaches: (a) the “single starting point” approach; (b) the “multiple starting points” approach; (c) the “benchmark” approach; (d) the “sentencing matrix” approach; and (e) the “sentencing bands” approach. Subsequently, in <span class="font-italic">Logachev </span>at [75], Menon CJ laid down a two-stage, five-step sentencing framework (the “<span class="font-italic">Logachev</span>-hybrid approach”) inspired by the “sentencing bands” approach adopted in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I consider in particular the “sentencing matrix”, “sentencing bands” and the “<span class="font-italic">Loga</span><span class="font-italic">chev-</span>hybrid” approaches, on which the parties and Ms Gopalan have focused their submissions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The sentencing matrix approach </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 A typical example of a sentencing matrix approach can be found in <span class="font-italic">Poh</span><span class="font-italic"> Boon Kiat v Public Prosecutor </span>[2014] 4 SLR 892 (“<span class="font-italic">Poh Boon Kiat</span>”). This approach comprises a two-stage analysis. At the first stage, the court considers the seriousness of an offence by reference to the “principal factual elements” of the case, which is used to determine the indicative starting sentence/range within a sentencing matrix. It is implicit in this approach that the court should be able to identify two principal sentencing elements with which to fashion the matrix: see <span class="font-italic">Wu Zhi Yong </span>at [27]. These principal factual elements are closely related to: (a) the culpability of the offender in carrying out the offence and (b) the harm resulting from the offender’s actions: see <span class="font-italic">Wu Zhi Yong </span>at [22]. At the second stage of the analysis, once an indicative starting sentence/range is determined, the precise sentence to be imposed will be determined by having regard to any other aggravating and mitigating factors, which do not relate to the principal factual elements of the offence: see <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [33], citing <span class="font-italic">Poh</span><span class="font-italic"> Boon Kiat </span>at [79]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 This approach, however, is dependent on the availability of a set of principal facts which can significantly affect the seriousness of an offence in all cases: see <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [34], citing <span class="font-italic">Koh Yong Chiah v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 3 SLR 447 at [47]. This was found to be the case in <span class="font-italic">Poh Boon Kiat</span>, in the context of vice-related offences under the PC. There, the court found that the “principal factual elements” were: <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">(a) the manner and extent of the offender’s role in the vice syndicate (which is the primary determinant of his culpability) and (b) the treatment of the prostitute (which is the primary determinant of the harm caused by the offence): see </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Terence Ng </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">at [34], citing </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Poh Boon Kiat</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> at [75]–[76].  </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The sentencing bands approach </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Both Ms Gopalan and the appellant submit that the appropriate sentencing framework to adopt in respect of offences under s 65(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the RTA is the “sentencing bands” approach set out in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>. Before I address their submissions on this in detail, I first highlight the key aspects of this approach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Under the “sentencing bands” approach, the analysis is similarly conducted in two steps. First, the court has to consider the <span class="font-italic">offence</span>-specific factors to determine the appropriate “band” in which the particular offence should be situated. The factors which the court should have regard to include the manner and mode by which the offence was committed as well as the harm caused. The court should then determine precisely where within that range the present offence falls in order to derive an “indicative starting point”: see <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [39(a)]. Second, the court has to have regard to the relevant <span class="font-italic">offender</span>-specific aggravating and mitigating factors to further calibrate the sentence: see <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [39(b)]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 As compared to the sentencing matrix approach, this approach is more suitable where the offence can take place in a wide variety of different circumstances, and it is difficult to identify any set of “principal factual elements” which can affect the seriousness of such an offence across the board: see <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [34]. To this, I would add that this approach is also more viable where there are difficulties dividing the categories of harm and culpability into varying levels of seriousness to populate a sentencing matrix. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Logachev-hybrid approach</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In contrast, the Prosecution urges the court to adopt a sentencing framework based on the <span class="font-italic">Logachev-</span>hybrid approach. As explained in <span class="font-italic">Ye Lin Myint v Public Prosecutor </span>[2019] 5 SLR 1005 at [46], this approach comprises a two-stage, five-step framework which eschews a focus on the “principal factual elements” of the case (unlike the sentencing matrix approach) and instead employs at the first step a general holistic assessment of the seriousness of the offence by reference to all the offence-specific factors. For analytical clarity, the offence-specific factors are broken down into two main groups that go towards the offender’s culpability and the harm caused by the offender’s actions. The second and third steps involve first identifying the applicable indicative sentencing range within the sentencing matrix based on the corresponding level of harm and culpability and thereafter identifying the appropriate starting point within that indicative sentencing range. The fourth step involves making adjustments to the starting point to account for any offender-specific factors. The fifth step calls for the court to make any final adjustments to take into account the totality principle.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In form, this approach resembles the sentencing matrix approach, where harm and culpability are represented as two axes mapped onto a sentencing matrix. However, in substance, it instead closely adopts the analytical framework behind the sentencing bands approach -– requiring a holistic assessment of the various offence-specific factors at the first stage and the offender-specific factors at the second stage. Accordingly, it would be improper, as Ms Gopalan appears to suggest, to regard the <span class="font-italic">Logachev-</span>hybrid approach as a sentencing matrix in its purest form (as in the case of <span class="font-italic">Poh Boon Kiat</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The sentencing matrix approach and the <span class="font-italic">Logachev</span>-hybrid approach are conceptually different. The latter approach combines the granularity of a sentencing matrix model with the holistic nature of the sentencing bands approach. This approach may be better suited for offences where a broad range of outcomes can arise under the specific axes of harm or culpability: see <span class="font-italic">Wu Zhi Yong </span>at [28]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appropriate sentencing approach</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In my judgment, having considered the submissions of the parties and Ms Gopalan, I am of the view that the most suitable sentencing approach to adopt in respect of offences under s 65(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the RTA is the <span class="font-italic">Logachev-</span>hybrid approach. I must, however, emphasise that my reasons for this view as expounded upon in the following paragraphs apply strictly to this specific punishment provision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Before I examine the objections raised by the appellant and Ms Gopalan in respect of adopting a sentencing framework based on the <span class="font-italic">Logachev-</span>hybrid approach, I find it necessary to clarify the language used in the latter’s written submissions to avoid the potential for confusion. In her submissions, Ms Gopalan took the position that a sentencing framework based on a “sentencing matrix” approach, like the one in <span class="font-italic">Cullen</span>, is unworkable in principle. However, as I have sought to clarify earlier at [63]–[64], a pure sentencing matrix approach is conceptually different from the <span class="font-italic">Logachev-</span>hybrid approach which was adopted in <span class="font-italic">Cullen</span>. With this in mind, I regard Ms Gopalan’s objection to be against the latter approach. In the same vein, I understand her criticisms of the “sentencing matrix” to relate to the sentencing matrix <span class="font-italic">model</span> (as distinct from the framework) comprising the two axes of harm and culpability which is utilised as part of the <span class="font-italic">Logachev-</span>hybrid approach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Having made the necessary clarifications, I return to address the appellant’s and Ms Gopalan’s concerns relating to the adoption of a sentencing framework based on the <span class="font-italic">Logachev</span>-hybrid approach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 First, Ms Gopalan submits that harm should not feature as a principal sentencing element in the sentencing matrix because the factor of harm has already been factored into the statutory scheme by the tiering of the punishment provisions.

</div> To support her objection she makes reference to Menon CJ’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Wu Zhi Yong</span>. It is thus useful to reproduce the observations at length:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">27 … In <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">some</span> of these situations, such as where death is caused, the nature of harm ceases to be a relevant differentiating factor for the purposes of sentencing offenders falling within the ambit of the applicable provision. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The same may also be said to some, albeit varying, degrees even in cases of simple hurt, or of harm other than personal injury</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">28 In short, the specific harm factors identified in s 64 do not themselves allow for a harm-culpability framework to be deployed in relation to <span class="font-italic">at least some</span> of the defined harm categories, because such frameworks would typically be appropriate where a <span class="font-italic">broad range of outcomes </span>can arise under the specific axes of harm or culpability. This allows any case to be situated at an appropriate point within the matrix by calibrating across <span class="font-italic">both</span> axes. Due to the structure of s 64, however, the <span class="font-italic">range</span> of outcomes on the harm axis that can arise under <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">some</span> of the limbs could be essentially non-existent or very narrow, as I have already explained. Put another way, the factor of “harm” is, in large part, already reflected in the different penalty-prescribing provisions and in the choice between the different provisions, such that it is no longer significant enough to justify it as a principal sentencing element in a matrix for a specific provision. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 With respect, I find that this submission does not pay sufficient regard to the context in which Menon CJ’s observations were made. In <span class="font-italic">Wu Zhi Yong</span>, Menon CJ was tasked with laying down a sentencing framework specifically for reckless driving offences where no personal injury had been caused, which is punishable under s 64(2C)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with s 64(2C)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the RTA. With this context in mind, he explained that in those limbs of s 64 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the various sub-provisions of s 64) where the range of outcomes on the harm axis were “essentially non-existent or very narrow”, harm would no longer be significant enough such as to justify it being a principal sentencing element in a matrix. This he found to be the case in relation to the particular limb concerned in <span class="font-italic">Wu Zhi Yong</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the limb where no personal injury had been caused. However, this is not to say that in <span class="font-italic">every </span>limb there would not be material gradations in the level of harm caused, and that harm would not be significant enough to be regarded as a principal sentencing element suitably represented in a matrix. In particular, Menon CJ was careful to note that his reservations concerning the suitability of representing harm in a sentencing matrix may only be relevant in <span class="font-italic">some</span> situations. For example, where death is caused the nature of harm would cease to be a relevant differentiating factor for the purpose of sentencing offenders falling within the ambit of the applicable provision. The same may also be said to “some, albeit varying, degrees even in cases of simple hurt, or of harm other than personal injury” (at [27]). Perhaps, somewhat tellingly, Menon CJ did not comment on whether the nature of harm was similarly denuded of its relevance as a differentiating factor in the specific context where grievous hurt is caused. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 This segues neatly to my next point. This is in relation to the spectrum of grievous hurt and whether it is sufficiently broad to be represented on a harm axis. In s 64(8) of the RTA, it is stated that “grievous hurt” for the purpose of ss 64 and 65 has the meaning given by s 320 of the PC, with the exclusion of death which is provided for in s 320(<span class="font-italic">aa</span>). As the Prosecution submits, s 320 encompasses many different forms of grievous hurt, some representing more severe injuries than others.

</div> For instance, it includes not only simple fractures which require no significant medical or surgical intervention, but also permanent injuries such as the privation of sight or hearing. The expansiveness of the types of injuries that are captured in this provision was expressly recognised by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v BDB </span>[2018] 1 SLR 27 (“<span class="font-italic">BDB</span>”) at [56], where it was observed that “[s] 325 encompasses a broad spectrum of different forms of grievous hurt ranging from a simple fracture to death”. Even though “death” has been expressly excluded from the definition of grievous hurt for the purpose of ss 64 and 65 of the RTA, it is plain that the remaining forms of grievous hurt nonetheless cover a wide range of injuries of varied severity. Therefore, I find that the specific concern raised in <span class="font-italic">Wu Zhi Yong</span> concerning the potential limited range of outcomes that may be reflected on the harm axis of a sentencing matrix to be of little relevance in the context of s 65(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the RTA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 A separate but related concern that Ms Gopalan raises is that it would not be appropriate to subdivide grievous hurt into categories.

</div> To this end, she cites the observations of this court in <span class="font-italic">Muhammad Khalis bin Ramlee v Public Prosecutor </span>[2018] 5 SLR 449 at [56], where Menon CJ opined that “it is less useful to delineate the types of harm caused by an accused person into two broad categories, as opposed to treating such injuries as spread along a spectrum having regard to the nature and permanence of the injury”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In my view, the subdivision of grievous hurt into categories corresponding to “low harm”, “moderate harm” and “serious harm” pays sufficient regard to the broad spectrum in which such injuries are spread. These categories, as I have developed below at [87], do not serve to set out a range of starting points for each type of grievous hurt, neither are they so overly prescriptive as to define categorically the forms of grievous hurt which may fall under each category. The descriptive labels of the respective categories of harm are flexible enough to account for the varied forms of grievous hurt that may be caused and they in no way inhibit the court’s discretion to have due regard to the nature and permanence of the injury in each case.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Second, the appellant and Ms Gopalan suggest that to consider harm as one of two central considerations for the purpose of sentencing would have the effect of placing undue weight on this factor given that it has already been featured in the choice between the different provisions.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> With respect, I find that this argument misses the point. Sections 65(2) to 65(4) of the RTA, set out different ranges of punishment corresponding to different types of harm suffered: death, grievous hurt, hurt and any other case where no personal injury is caused. These different ranges of punishment are differentiated by the maximum prescribed punishment that may be imposed by the court. Essentially, the more severe the type of harm suffered, the higher the maximum prescribed punishment. This reflects Parliament’s intention that higher sentences should be imposed where greater harm has resulted. In this way, the factor of harm is taken into account first in determining the appropriate range of punishment (including the maximum prescribed punishment) which signals the gravity with which the offence is to be viewed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 However, this does not then obviate the need for sentencing judges to consider the harm again within each limb/sub-provision to assess the extent of the type of harm suffered in order to determine where within that sentencing range a particular offence should be situated. There is no question of undue weight being placed on harm as such. It would detract from legislative intention to say that harm should no longer be treated as one of the other principal sentencing factors together with culpability simply by virtue of the tiering of the punishment provisions. If harm were to be regarded only as <span class="font-italic">one of several</span> sentencing factors in the determination of the sentence to be imposed as would be the case under a sentencing bands approach, this would not give meaningful effect to Parliament’s intention of increasing the punishment ranges based on the type of harm caused. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Moreover, the legislative tiering of punishment provisions to reflect differing types of harm suffered is not without precedent. One such example can be found in the PC. Sections 337 and 338 of the PC provide for different punishment provisions where hurt and grievous hurt respectively are caused by either a rash (ss 337(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 338(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)) or negligent act (ss 337(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 338(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)). In <span class="font-italic">Tang Ling Lee</span>, See J laid down a sentencing framework for road traffic cases prosecuted under s 338(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the PC. See J did not consider that there was any issue of double counting the element of harm, despite Parliament having provided for higher prescribed maximum sentences in respect of offences under s 338 as compared to s 337 based on the type of harm caused (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, grievous hurt and hurt). Harm thus remained one of the twin factors in the determination of the ultimate sentence to impose. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 I pause to make one additional observation on the sentencing framework adopted in <span class="font-italic">Tang Ling Lee</span>. On the one hand, the Prosecution interprets the framework as having essentially adopted the <span class="font-italic">Logachev-</span>hybrid approach.

</div>
</div> I agree with the Prosecution’s interpretation. While the sentencing framework in <span class="font-italic">Tang Ling Lee </span>was described as comprising “three broad sentencing bands” (at [25]), in substance, the court had utilised a two-by-two sentencing matrix model, with lesser and greater harm on one axis and lower and higher culpability on the other axis. In order to determine the appropriate sentence to be imposed, See J observed that the court should undertake a two-step inquiry (reflecting the two stages of the <span class="font-italic">Logachev-</span>hybrid approach). <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">First, the court should identify the sentencing band within which the offence in question falls, and also where the particular case falls within the applicable presumptive sentencing range, having regard to the twin considerations of harm and culpability, in order to derive the starting point sentence. Second, further adjustments should then be made to take into account the relevant mitigating and aggravating factors, which may take the eventual sentence out of the applicable presumptive sentencing range: see </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Tang Ling Lee </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">at [32].</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 For the reasons above, I am unable to agree with the appellant and Ms Gopalan that the <span class="font-italic">Logachev-</span>hybrid approach is necessarily the wrong one to adopt in principle. However, the question remains whether it is to be the preferred approach over the sentencing bands approach which the appellant and Ms Gopalan propose. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78  At this juncture, it is useful to have recourse to the evaluative criteria reflecting the key aims of a good sentencing framework discussed above at [45]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In relation to the first criterion, I agree with the Prosecution that the <span class="font-italic">Logachev</span>-hybrid approach would helpfully guide sentencing judges to arrive at the appropriate sentence through a process of increasing granulation which enhances analytical clarity and promotes the transparent articulation of reasons for the eventual sentence imposed.

</div> It ensures that all relevant sentencing factors are considered and adequate flexibility is built into the approach to allow for sentencing judges to conduct their own assessment and weighing of the relevant harm and culpability factors to arrive at a principled sentence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Conversely, if a sentencing bands approach were to be adopted, a potential difficulty may arise in that this approach does not satisfactorily account for how the range of harm caused is to be reflected in the overall sentence. Based on the sentencing bands approach proposed by Ms Gopalan (see Annex D), the sentencing bands correspond to the <span class="font-italic">number</span> of offence-specific aggravating factors present. For instance, where two or more offence-specific aggravating factors are present, the offender would fall within Band 2 of the framework. Yet, it is unclear how this approach accommodates the range of grievous hurt that may be caused to the victim by the offender’s careless or inconsiderate driving. Ms Gopalan suggests that the grievous hurt suffered by the victim would be regarded as an offence-specific aggravating factor where the harm suffered is at the higher end of the continuum.

</div>
</div> However, I do not find it appropriate to only have regard to grievous hurt as an offence-specific aggravating factor where its severity has crossed a certain arbitrary threshold. This would, in my view, not accord sufficient weight to the wide range of grievous hurt that could be suffered by the victims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In relation to the second criterion, much has been said already about legislative intention. Thus, I shall say no more apart from reiterating that the <span class="font-italic">Logachev-</span>hybrid approach properly takes into account Parliament’s intention for harm to be one of the two main factors in the determination of the sentence to impose. In contrast, on the sentencing bands approach, the role of harm is significantly reduced to being only <span class="font-italic">one of several</span> offence-specific factors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In relation to the third criterion, flowing from my conclusion that the <span class="font-italic">Logachev-</span>hybrid approach provides more structured guidance to sentencing judges in arriving at the appropriate sentence to impose in each case, I am of the view that this too promotes a consistency of approach, which is better able to translate to consistency of outcome as between like cases.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Formulation of the sentencing approach  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The <span class="font-italic">Logachev-</span>hybrid approach involves the application of the five following steps in sequence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The first step: Identifying the level of harm and the level of culpability  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 At the first step, the court must have regard to the offence-specific factors set out below at [87]–[95] and identify: (a) the level of harm caused by the offence; and (b) the level of the offender’s culpability. The harm caused by the offence may be categorised into three levels of increasing severity: low, moderate and serious. Likewise, the offender’s culpability may be categorised into three levels: low, moderate and high.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The Prosecution, however, suggests the adoption of <span class="font-italic">four</span> levels of harm as proposed by the district judge in <span class="font-italic">Cullen</span>. I share Ms Gopalan’s concern that such a categorisation unnecessarily narrows the breadth of each level of harm. Thus, the differences between each level of harm become less significant which may in turn have the effect of arbitrarily resulting in higher sentences for an offender where a marginal increase in harm has been occasioned. I am aware that in <span class="font-italic">Stansilas Fabian Kester v Public Prosecutor</span> [2017] 5 SLR 755<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Stansilas</span>”) at [75(a)], the court divided the category of harm into four levels: slight, moderate, serious and very serious, not unlike that proposed by the Prosecution in this case. Yet, it is important to bear in mind that the court in <span class="font-italic">Stansilas</span> was concerned with an offence under s 67(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the pre-2019 RTA, which provided a single punishment range for the entire range of possible harm that could be caused – with the lowest end of the range concerned only with property damage and the highest end of the range concerned with death. Accordingly, the range of harm that may be occasioned under s 67(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the pre-2019 RTA is substantially wider than the range of harm that may be occasioned under s 65(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the RTA, which is concerned only with grievous hurt. Therefore, in my view, the range of grievous hurt can adequately be taken into account by division into the three levels of low, moderate and serious harm. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I now turn to set out the non-exhaustive list of factors within the broad categories of harm and culpability which fashion the two axes of the matrix. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Factors going to harm </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The degree of harm caused would generally refer to the nature and degree of the grievous bodily injury caused to the victim(s): see <span class="font-italic">Tang Ling Lee </span>at [25]. In my judgment, the levels of harm can thus be broadly divided based on the severity of the grievous hurt suffered as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-underline">Low</span>: The hurt caused can be managed with conservative treatment, with no or short periods of hospitalisation and/or medical leave. The harm occasioned would typically involve minor fractures/dislocation at less vulnerable parts of the body. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-underline">Moderate</span>: The injuries are of a more permanent nature and/or involve more complex fractures/dislocation which necessitate some surgical procedures with a moderate period of hospitalisation and/or medical leave. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-underline">Serious</span>: The injuries are of a very serious or permanent nature and/or necessitate significant surgical procedures. The victim’s daily living is usually permanently and severely affected. This includes injuries resulting in loss of limb, sight, hearing, member or other major bodily functions or paralysis.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 In addition, there are two other factors which may contribute to the severity of the harm caused, namely: (a) property damage; and (b) potential harm. These factors are to be considered in tandem with the above descriptions of each level of harm. I deal with each of these factors briefly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The extent of property damage is an established sentencing factor. The general rule as noted in <span class="font-italic">Wu Zhi Yong </span>at [36(b)], is that the amount of any loss or damage may serve as a proxy indicator of harm. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Potential harm that might have resulted is also a relevant factor going towards harm. However, I must highlight the pertinent observations by Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">Logachev </span>at [38], where he noted that the categorisation of the relevant sentencing considerations is simply intended to provide a convenient framework for identifying and analysing such sentencing considerations as may arise. Consequently, not too much should be made of the labels used, and the categories may not always be watertight. For instance, where circumstances arise which call for the offender to exercise special care such as when he is driving through a school zone and the offender fails to do so, this has been treated as an offence-specific factor going towards the offender’s culpability (see below at [94]). Yet, in some situations it may also relate to the harm caused by the offence in so far as it affects the likelihood of harm (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, potential harm). Ultimately, how a sentencing judge takes into account these factors would turn on the precise facts of the case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Factors going to culpability </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The Prosecution urges the court to adopt the three levels of culpability and the corresponding functional definitions for each level as set out in <span class="font-italic">Cullen</span> at [109]. However, to better reflect the requisite mental state for offences under s 65 of the RTA, reference was made to “carelessness” as the primary determinant of culpability for each level. The Prosecution’s proposed working definitions thus read as follows:

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I share the same concern. Invariably, there may in some cases be an overlap between the two offences. For example, where an offender charged with careless driving under s 65 of the RTA has exhibited some manner of dangerous driving behaviour, I accept that this would necessarily constitute a culpability enhancing factor for the s 65 offence. Nonetheless, this is far from saying that the different levels of culpability in respect of a careless or inconsiderate driving offence should primarily turn on the extent of dangerous driving behaviour exhibited as the Prosecution appears to propose.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 It is trite that the degree of culpability generally refers to the degree of relative blameworthiness disclosed by an offender’s actions: see <span class="font-italic">Tang Ling Lee </span>at [25]. In my judgment, for offences under s 65 of the RTA, this can be measured based on the following factors: (a) circumstances which required the offender to exercise extra care or consideration; (b) the manner of driving; and (c) the offender’s conduct following the offence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 First, in assessing an offender’s culpability, due regard must be had to circumstances surrounding the incident which call for the exercise of extra care or consideration. Some examples of these circumstances include where the offender drives: (a) within a school or residential zone; (b) a heavy vehicle that is more difficult to control and requires a quicker reaction time; or (c) in poor road conditions (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, heavy rain or heavy traffic). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Second, the offender’s manner of driving is also a relevant factor going to culpability. Under this factor, it is apposite to consider any dangerous driving behaviour exhibited by the offender. This would include, for example, driving against the flow of traffic, speeding, sleepy driving, drink-driving, driving while under the influence of drugs, driving while using a mobile phone, flouting traffic rules, or “hell-riding” situations: see <span class="font-italic">Tang Ling Lee </span>at [28]. In addition, considerations pertaining to the duration of the offender’s inattention (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, momentary or prolonged/sustained), the avoidability of the offender’s distraction or the reasonableness of the offender’s misjudgment are also relevant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Third, the offender’s conduct following the commission of the offence is also relevant. In particular, it has been said that an offender’s conduct that is “belligerent or violent” upon arrest would constitute an aggravating factor: see <span class="font-italic">Edwin s/o Suse Nathen v Public Prosecutor </span>[2013] 4 SLR 1139 (“<span class="font-italic">Suse Nathen</span>”) at [32]. In a similar vein, where the offender fails to stop in an attempt to evade arrest or to avoid apprehension by the authorities, this should also weigh against him: see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Lee Meng Soon </span>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 240 at [33]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 To afford sentencing judges with more flexibility in the exercise of their sentencing discretion, I decline at this stage to provide a working definition for the different levels of culpability to avoid being overly prescriptive. In any event, I have some doubt as to the utility of any attempt to condense the wide range of factors into a working definition that would accurately capture the diverse factual circumstances in which the offence may occur. Accordingly, I shall leave the proper categorisation of an offender’s level of culpability in each case to be determined by the sentencing court after an assessment and weighing of the various factors discussed above. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The second step: Identifying the applicable indicative sentencing range in the sentencing matrix</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Having regard to the entire sentencing range stipulated in s 65(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the RTA, I consider the following sentencing ranges to be appropriate in situations where the offender has elected to claim trial:<br/></div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-right font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Harm</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Culpability</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Low</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Moderate</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Serious</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Low</span></div></td><td><div class="Table-Text justify-content-center">Fine</div></td><td><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">Fine or up to 4 months’ imprisonment</div></td><td><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">Between 4 to 8 months’ imprisonment</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Moderate</span></div></td><td><div class="Table-Text justify-content-center">Fine or up to 4 months’ imprisonment</div></td><td><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">Between 4 to 8 months’ imprisonment</div></td><td><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">Between 8 to 12 months’ imprisonment</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">High</span></div></td><td><div class="Table-Text justify-content-center">Between 4 to 8 months’ imprisonment</div></td><td><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">Between 8 to 12 months’ imprisonment</div></td><td><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">Between 12 to 24 months’ imprisonment</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Three points are worthy of note. First, it is important to bear in mind that any term of imprisonment imposed may be accompanied by a fine of up to $5,000, if appropriate. This is explicitly provided for in s 65(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the RTA. The sentencing judge should thus be alive to possibility of imposing such a combination of punishments in order to properly take into account the full sentencing range prescribed by Parliament. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The second point relates to the relationship between the two axes of harm and culpability. The proposed sentencing matrix in the Prosecution’s Modified <span class="font-italic">Cullen </span>framework prescribes lower and more flexible sentencing ranges in cases where culpability is low, compared to cases where culpability is found to be moderate or high.

</div>
</div> This places more emphasis on culpability as compared to the harm caused by the offence, translating to a sharper rate of increase of the sentencing ranges on the culpability axis vis-à-vis the harm axis. To illustrate, where culpability is low, the Prosecution’s proposed framework prescribes that fines may be appropriate even where serious harm is caused, and where very serious harm is caused the maximum indicative sentence is capped at eight months’ imprisonment. Where culpability is moderate, the starting point is two months’ imprisonment even where harm caused is low, increasing to an indicative sentencing range of between 12 and 16 months’ imprisonment where very serious harm is caused:

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 To my mind, placing unequal emphasis on considerations of harm and culpability in the context of offences under s 65 of the RTA is not supported by Parliament’s intention. Indeed, Parliament has stressed the importance of both factors and did not suggest that one factor should be given more weight in the sentencing analysis than the other. This was underscored during the Parliamentary Debate, where the Minister emphasised: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Besides looking at the circumstances of the offence, our enhanced approach will also consider the level of harm caused. If the motorist causes more harm, the level of punishment will be higher.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">To summarise, we will enhance our overall approach to penalise irresponsible driving depending on: (a) the circumstances of the offence – whether it constitutes Dangerous Driving or Careless Driving; and (b) the level of harm caused – whether they result in Death, Grievous Hurt, Hurt, or Endangering Life.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Third, the proposed sentencing framework and the corresponding indicative ranges set out above are concerned solely with s 65(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the RTA. Nonetheless, it bears emphasis that an offender facing a charge under s 65(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is liable not only to a fine and/or a term of imprisonment but also to a disqualification order of at least five years pursuant to s 65(6)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the RTA (except where special reasons are found). As observed in <span class="font-italic">Suse Nathen</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [13], a disqualification order combines three sentencing objectives: punishment, protection of the public and deterrence. Thus, where an offence <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">reflects a blatant </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">disregard for the safety of other road users and a lack of personal responsibility, there is a public interest in taking such a driver off the roads for a substantial period of time. The duration of the disqualification order should therefore increase in tandem with the severity of the offence, whether or not it is also accompanied by a substantial fine or period of imprisonment: see </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Suse</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> Nathen </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">at [14].</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The third step: Identify the appropriate starting point within the indicative sentencing range</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Following the identification of the indicative sentencing range at the second step, the third step is for the court to identify the appropriate starting point within that range.

The totality principle has been expressed in <span class="font-italic">Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor </span>[2014] 2 SLR 998 at [54] and [57] as comprising two limbs.

I am unimpressed by the appellant’s submission that the harm caused should be regarded as falling within the range of “low” to “moderate” harm despite none of the medical reports indicating that the first victim suffered permanent injury or that she would suffer a permanent loss in her quality of life. Moreover, I am of the opinion that the mere fact of her being moved from the ICU to the acute care wards did not demonstrate that her condition had improved to any significant extent. It is uncontroverted that the first victim suffered extensive and debilitating injuries extending to vulnerable parts of her body (see [7] above). While admitted at TTSH, she underwent multiple surgical procedures and her course in the ICU was described as being “very stormy”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 As a preliminary point, I should add that at the hearing before me, the Prosecution invited the court to review the in-car camera footage obtained from a neighbouring vehicle which recorded the accident. After having viewed the footage, it was pointed out to the Prosecution that the appellant had in fact engaged his brakes moments before the collision with the first victim’s motorcycle. The Prosecution conceded this after reviewing the footage again. On the basis of the Prosecution’s concession and my own observations from the footage, I find that it was wrong for the DJ to conclude that the appellant had failed to brake prior to the collision.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Nevertheless, I accept the DJ’s observation that the appellant was driving at a speed that was relatively higher than the vehicles travelling alongside him at the time. The footage recorded the appellant’s brake lights lighting up only momentarily in the seconds before the collision. Despite the appellant’s last-minute attempt at braking, he was unable to slow down sufficiently in order to avoid the collision, indicating that he was travelling at such a speed that left him scarcely enough time to brake. Moreover, immediately after the collision, the appellant can be seen disengaging his brakes and losing control of his motor car, swerving right and colliding into the rear of the second victim’s motor car. Due to the heavy traffic conditions, the appellant should have exercised more care in regulating his speed of travel to ensure that he had adequate response time to react to any unexpected situations. Therefore, I find that there is no reason to disturb the DJ’s finding that the appellant’s culpability fell on the higher end of “low”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The second step</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 At the second step, the court is to identify the applicable indicative sentencing range taking into account the level of harm and culpability established at the first step. Based on the matrix set out at [98] above, the applicable indicative sentencing range would be between four to eight months’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The third step</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 The third step requires the identification of the appropriate starting point within the indicative sentencing range. I agree with the DJ that the appellant’s sentence should fall at the higher end of the indicative sentencing range (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, around eight months’ imprisonment) for the reasons canvassed above at [111] to [114].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The fourth step</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 At the fourth step, adjustments should be made to the starting point where necessary to take into account the offender-specific factors listed at [105] above. The DJ properly took into account the appellant’s plea of guilt. However, I should add that the appellant’s clean driving record is no more than a neutral factor in the sentencing analysis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The DJ was similarly right to place no weight on the appellant’s submission that his imprisonment would cause hardship to his family.

</div> In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik </span>[2008] 1 SLR(R) 601 at [98], the Court of Appeal stated that “in the <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">absence of very exceptional or extreme circumstances, little, if any, weight should be attached to the fact that the accused’s family will suffer if the accused is imprisoned for a substantial period of time</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">.”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 I am of the view that the DJ’s decision to calibrate the appellant’s sentence downwards to six months’ imprisonment taking into account his plea of guilt cannot be faulted. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The fifth step</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 It is unnecessary for me to consider the totality principle in the present case as the appellant only faces one charge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 In my judgment, the sentence of six months’ imprisonment imposed by the DJ for the s 65(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) charge was not manifestly excessive. For completeness, I also find that the minimum disqualification order of five years was appropriate on the facts. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 For the reasons above, I dismiss the appellant’s appeal against sentence. It is always a Herculean task to set out a comprehensive sentencing framework for any particular offence.
