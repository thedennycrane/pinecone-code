Having heard the parties, I granted most of the reliefs sought, including orders for accounts to be taken on a common basis, and repayment of the specific sums. The sole executor and trustee has appealed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The patriarch of the family (“the Testator”) passed away on 9 July 1999 leaving behind his son and two daughters. By virtue of a handwritten will dated 2 July 1999 (“the Will”), the validity of which was not challenged, the Testator provided for his son to inherit 50% of his estate and for the remaining 50% to be divided equally between his daughters, who are the plaintiffs in this action (“the Plaintiffs”). The Testator also provided in the Will that his estate (“the Estate”) was to be administered by his son and his brother as co-executors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Grant of probate was issued on 13 February 2001 to the executors based on an incomplete schedule of assets. On 20 March 2002, the Testator’s son passed away intestate, leaving behind no spouse or issue. Two consequences flowed from this. One, the Plaintiffs became the lawful beneficiaries to the son’s share of the Testator’s estate, and were accordingly each a beneficiary to 50% of the Estate. Two, the Testator’s brother, who is the defendant in this case (“the Defendant”), bore the duty of distribution as the sole surviving executor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Thereafter, a finalised Schedule of Assets with 41 assets dated 31 December 2008 was filed with the Commissioner of Estate Duties (“Schedule of Assets”), upon which permission to distribute the assets of the Estate was granted after the estate duties were finalised and paid. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 For easy of reference, the names of the Testator’s and the Defendant’s siblings are as follows in decreasing order of age: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Lalwani Moti (“Moti”) deceased; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Lalwani Bhagwan Bherumal (“Bhagwan”) deceased; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Lalwani Gobind Bherumal, who is the Testator; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) Lalwani Jiwan Bherumal (“Jiwan”) deceased;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) Lalwani Rajan Bherumal (“Rajan”); and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(f) Lalwani Ashok Bherumal, who is the Defendant. </div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Plaintiffs’ Case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Plaintiffs’ present suit related to the Defendant’s discharge of duties as executor and/or trustee in relation to certain assets of the Estate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Plaintiffs’ first set of claims related to the taking of accounts. They submitted that the Defendant, as sole executor of the estate, owed fiduciary duties to the Plaintiffs as beneficiaries in relation to the administration of the Estate. By virtue of this, the Defendant was liable to furnish to them accounts relating to the Estate’s assets. In particular, the Defendant had allegedly failed to properly account for the following assets of the Estate: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) shareholding in Basco Enterprises Pte Ltd (“Basco”) and Eltee Development Pte Ltd (“Eltee”);</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) interest in Bob’s Partnership (“Bob’s”) and any dividend payment or interests therefrom;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) the balance compensation (“the Property Proceeds”) arising from the compulsory acquisition of 48 and 50 North Bridge Road Singapore (“the North Bridge Road Property”) and 39 Stamford House Singapore (“the Stamford House”); and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) the Estate’s share in the estate of the Testator’s mother, Lalwani Lilan Bherumal (“Lilan”).</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 In addition, the Plaintiffs sought recovery of specific sums that they alleged were misappropriated by the Defendant in breach of his fiduciary duty:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) a total sum of $118,000 which was withdrawn in 13 tranches by the Defendant from a UOB account designated to receive and hold all monies belonging to the Estate (“the Estate Account”);</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) a sum of $136,561.76, being half of the monies maintained in a UOB account held jointly by the Defendant and the Testator while the Testator was alive (“the Joint UOB Account”); and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) a sum of $40,641.78 being the remaining debt owed by the Testator’s eldest brother, Moti, to the Estate under High Court Suit No 349 of 1997, which according to the Plaintiffs had since become time-barred under s 6 of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed) (“Moti’s Debt”).</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Defendant’s Case </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The Defendant did not contest that he owed a fiduciary duty to the Plaintiffs in relation to his administration of the Estate as the executor and/or trustee, but denied all allegations of breach. In relation to the accounts sought to be taken, the Defendant argued that he had, at various times prior to or during the trial, given sufficient account as regards the Estate’s assets to the Plaintiffs, whose allegations to the contrary were baseless, untrue, or based on their own poor recollection of the matter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 In relation to the three specific sums claimed, the Defendant conceded that he withdrew the $118,000 from the Estate Account but submitted that his liability in that respect could be set off against his cross-claim against the Estate. This cross-claim allegedly arose because of his half-share interest in the constituent shares of a Central Depository Account (“the CDP Account”), the proceeds of which were later deposited into the Estate Account, and which was held in the Testator’s sole name while he was alive when it was in truth under the joint ownership of the Testator and the Defendant.

</div>
</div> As regards the monies from the Joint UOB Account, the Defendant maintained that the sum was properly expended and used, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, to pay off the Testator’s funeral expenses, medical bills, and outstanding debts. Finally, the claim for Moti’s Debt against the Defendant was argued to be premature as there was no evidence that Moti’s estate was denying liability, or that a defence of time bar would be raised if a claim for recovery were brought against Moti’s estate. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Most of the prayers sought in relation to the taking of accounts on a common basis were granted. The trustee’s duty to furnish accounts to the beneficiary in relation to his administration of the trust assets is continuous and on demand. There may be limits to this duty, but none were applicable on the facts of this case. The transfer of some trust assets to the Plaintiffs, and the substitution of the Plaintiffs as the new executors and trustees of certain other assets, did not obviate the Defendant’s duty to account for his conduct during his term as trustee. The mere provision of some financial documents by the Defendant during the course of trial also did not necessarily constitute full satisfaction of his duty to furnish accounts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In relation to the claims in breach of trust, the Defendant was found liable for misappropriation of the sums of $118,000 from the Estate Account, and $136,561.76 from the Joint UOB Account. The Plaintiffs’ claim for repayment of Moti’s Debt of $40,641.78 was, however, premature, and the taking of accounts in relation to the said debt was instead ordered.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Duties of an executor and trustee </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 In the present proceedings, it was not disputed that both executors and trustees owe fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries of an estate in relation to the administration of that estate. In <span class="font-italic">Lee Yoke San and another v Tsong Sai Cecilia and another</span> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 516 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee Yoke San</span>”), the High Court held that (at [35]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">An executor "calls in” the estate that collects and converts the assets into cash, and pays all the funeral and testamentary expenses, estate duty, debts and legacies. When he has done this, he has discharged his duties as an executor. Then he steps into the shoes of a trustee. He owes a fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries, whether he is an executor or trustee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 As an incidence of this fiduciary relationship, the executor or trustee owes several specific duties to the beneficiaries of the estate, including the duty to determine the extent of the testator’s assets and liabilities, to act diligently in the realisation of such assets, and to pay for the testator’s debts and testamentary expenses (see generally <span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Boo and another v Foo Jhee Tuang and others</span> [2016] SGHC 260 (“<span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Boo</span>”) at [73]-[83]). These specific duties are set against the backdrop of a general duty on the part of the executor or trustee to act with impartiality in the best interests of the beneficiaries (<span class="font-italic">Lee Yoke San</span> at [35]; <span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Boo</span> at [83]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In the present case, the position of the executor is not significantly distinct from that of a trustee and, for ease of reference, the latter term will be used.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Taking of accounts </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The law on accounts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 In addition to the specific duties identified above, a critical aspect of the custodial fiduciary relationship is the duty of the trustee to keep accounts of the trust and to allow the beneficiaries to inspect them as requested. This accounting procedure serves two primary purposes: (a) “the informative purpose of allowing the beneficiaries to know the status of the fund and what transformations it has undergone”, and (b) a “substantive purpose… [to ensure] that any personal liability a custodial fiduciary may have arising out of maladministration is ascertained and determined” (Steven Elliott, <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> (John McGhee QC gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 33rd Ed, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span>”) at para 20-013; see generally, Yip Man &amp; Goh Yihan, “Navigating the Maze: Making Sense of Equitable Compensation and Account of Profits for Breach of Fiduciary Duty” (2016) 28 SAcLJ 884 at 899-900).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Generally, the claim for an account on a common basis may be divided into three stages: (a) whether the claimant has a right to an account; (b) the taking of the account; and (c) any consequential relief (<span class="font-italic">Chng Weng Wah v Goh Bak Heng</span> [2016] 2 SLR 464 (“<span class="font-italic">Chng Weng Wah</span>”) at [22], [38]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In this case, it was not in dispute that the Plaintiffs, as beneficiaries of the Estate, had a <span class="font-italic">prima</span><span class="font-italic"> facie </span>right to take an account of the trust assets. As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Seng v Foo Jhee Tuang </span>[2012] 4 SLR 339 (“<span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Seng</span>”), “[b]eneficiaries are entitled, within proper bounds, to be furnished with an account of the funds in the trust” (at [87]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 For avoidance of doubt, even though there are often allegations of breach of trust that precede litigation on this matter, as was the case at present, the trustee’s duty to furnish account is not contingent on any allegation or establishment of such breach. This was clarified by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Seng </span>(at [87]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There is no necessity to allege any breach of fiduciary duties on the part of the trustees. Of course, if there is such a breach, they would all the more be entitled to an account and if the trust were to suffer any loss on account of such breach, the trustees would be obliged to make good the same.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The duty to furnish account is continuous, on demand, and does not simply have to be discharged at the time of distribution of the trust assets. In the context of personal representatives, the High Court has rejected the proposition that such persons standing in a fiduciary position were only obliged to provide a full account of the estate to the beneficiaries at the time of distribution of the estate: “The duty in the case of a personal representative is a continuing duty, much like the duty imposed on a trustee...” (<span class="font-italic">Chiang Shirley v Chiang Dong Pheng</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2015] 3 SLR 770 (“<span class="font-italic">Chiang Shirley</span>”) at [88]). This principle applies generally, including to executors, who in particular bear an additional obligation to submit full accounts for the beneficiaries’ perusal and approval prior to their distribution of the assets comprising the estate (<span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Boo</span> at [80]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 There may be limits to the trustee’s continuing duty to furnish account on demand. In <span class="font-italic">Foo Jee </span><span class="font-italic">Boo</span>, the High Court observed that the court may decline to make an order for the taking of accounts in the exceptional case where “it would be oppressive to require the [trustee] to so account, or for some other good reason” (at [81]). One such situation may be where the demands are made without a reasonable interval between them, or without reasonable time for the trustee to furnish the necessary information. As the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Chiang Shirley</span> observed:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">89     Whilst both trustees and personal representatives have a duty to maintain accounts and generally to provide them at the beneficiary’s request, this does not mean that any beneficiary can keep on demanding accounts and information without giving the trustee/personal representative some respite. In my view, it is common sense that there must be reasonable intervals between the demands and a trustee/personal representative should not be considered to be in breach of trust simply because he does not always supply the documents and information immediately upon the beneficiary’s demand. Whether the trustee/personal representative has complied with his duty to supply documents and information is a fact-sensitive exercise in every case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 A further situation where an order for the taking of accounts may not be granted is where the trustee, as an alternative to providing an actual account of the trust assets, is able to show on a balance of probabilities that he had entered into a settlement with the counterparty as regards the provision of the trust accounts. This follows from the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Chng Weng Wah</span>:  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">38     … if a trustee is able to produce a document evincing both parties’ agreement that accounts have been settled conclusively, in the absence of any other evidence to the contrary, that should suffice and the trustee should not be made to go through the laborious, and if we may add, unnecessary, process of providing an actual account in the course of defending the action… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">39     While it is acknowledged that, unlike the example given in the preceding paragraph, Chng has not managed to produce any documentary evidence to show that parties had agreed that accounts have been settled, that does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that Chng has to provide an actual account in the course of defending the present claim by Goh. Based on the evidence that has been led (such as the correspondence between the parties), the court may be able to draw an inference, on a balance of probabilities, that settled accounts have <span class="font-italic">already been provided</span> (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, at some earlier point in time)…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 As regards the level of disclosure necessary to discharge the duty to furnish account on a common basis, regard must be had to the twin purposes of this duty as identified above. At its core, the accounting process is a means to hold the trustee accountable for his stewardship of trust property. Accordingly, the trustee must by this accounting process give proper, complete, and accurate justification and documentation for his actions as a trustee. This requires information as to the current status of, and past transactions that relate to, each of the constituent trust assets actually received by the trustee (see <span class="font-italic">Glazier Holdings Pty </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd v Australian Men’s Health Pty Ltd (No 2)</span> [2001] NSWSC 6 at [38]). What precisely is required for the discharge of this duty is fact-specific. More will likely be required for the specific assets and transactions against which there are allegations of breach of trust. More will also likely be required of a professional trustee, as compared to a non-professional trustee who may be granted “fair and reasonable allowances” (<span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> at para 20-018). Thus, merely providing some financial documents in relation to the trust assets may not be enough (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Boo </span>at [93]-[96]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The taking of accounts on a common basis must, however, be distinguished from two related concepts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 First, it is different from the taking of an accounts on a wilful default basis<span class="font-italic"> </span>(see <span class="font-italic">Chng Weng Wah</span> at [21]). Conceptually, the taking of accounts on a common basis supposes and requires no misconduct, while that on a wilful default basis is entirely grounded on misconduct (<span class="font-italic">Partington v Reynolds</span> (1858) 62 ER 98 at 99). Practically, in order to obtain an order for account on wilful default basis, it is necessary that the claimant allege and prove at least one act of wilful neglect or default (<span class="font-italic">Ong Jane Rebecca v Lim Lie Hoa and Others </span>[2005] SGCA 4 (“<span class="font-italic">Ong Jane Rebecca</span>”) at [61]). Further, as the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Ong Jane Rebecca</span>, the taking of account on a wilful default basis is significantly more onerous for the trustee (at [55]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In a common or standard account… the trustee need only account for what was actually received and his disbursement and distribution of it. In an account on the basis of wilful default, the trustee is not only required to account for what he has received, but also for what he might have received had it not been for the default. In the latter case, the accounting party also carries a much more substantial burden of proof than that which applies to him in the case of a common account: see <span class="font-italic">Glazier v Australian Men’s Health</span> (No 2) [2001] NSWSC 6.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Second, the taking of accounts on either basis above should not be conflated with an account of profits. While there is a common aspect between the taking of accounts and the accounting of profits in that they both attempt to quantify the deficit, if any, in the trust fund that must be made good by the defendant to the claimant, the taking of accounts is a process, while accounting of profit is a remedy. Thus, an account of profits is usually the very relief sought by claimants, whereas the taking of accounts may only be the first step, to be followed by the beneficiary’s objections to the accounts presented and his claim for specific reliefs (<span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity </span>at para 20-017; Lord Millett NPJ, <span class="font-italic">Libertarian Inve</span><span class="font-italic">stments Ltd v Hall</span> (2013) 16 HKCFAR 681 at [168]). There are other nuanced differences. For instance, the taking of accounts arises generally in custodial fiduciary relationships, such as <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> trustees, executors, or custodial agents. An account for profits, however, may be relevant as a remedy for the breach of any form of fiduciary duty, regardless of whether the relationship is predicated on the custody of assets. Indeed, an account of profits may exceptionally be invoked even in cases beyond the fiduciary context (<span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Bok Eng Holdings Pte Ltd and another v Wong Ser Wan</span> [2005] 4 SLR(R) 561 at [54]).

This was also premised on the narrow language of the Plaintiffs’ Statement of Claim. To this end, the number and value of the relevant shares had been obvious to the Plaintiffs as early as February 2001 and had since remained unchanged. No dividends had been declared by the two companies. The Defendant had thus properly fulfilled his duty to account in relation to Basco and Eltee.

</div> I could not accept that as the trustee’s duty to account is continuous and on demand. The Plaintiffs’ request for trust accounts was not so unreasonable or oppressive in the circumstances as to fall within the narrow limits to the trustee’s duty to account as identified by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Chiang Shirley </span>and <span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Boo</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Nor did I consider appropriate to infer, from the transference of shareholdings and the disclosure of certain financial statements, that there had therefore been a settlement of the Plaintiffs’ claim.

The Plaintiffs’ agreement to the transfer of shareholdings in a bid to take over trust administration cannot be construed as their agreement to release the Defendant of his existing duty to account in relation to his tenure as trustee. There was also no indication that the Plaintiffs considered the mere disclosure of the companies’ audited financial statements as satisfaction of their claim in respect of Basco and Eltee. Indeed, at the time of acceptance of the Defendant’s offer to disclose, the Plaintiffs had not assessed the financial statements and was not fully appraised as to what information would be disclosed. Any inference of settlement would thus have been artificial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 A trustee may discharge his responsibility, as noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chng Weng Wah</span>, by providing accounts in the midst of proceedings for such accounts: <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">“</span>it is accepted that a trustee may, at the first stage of the claim [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, when establishing a right to account], be able to prove that he or she no longer owes a duty to account by <span class="font-italic">providing an actual account</span> in the course of legal proceedings” [emphasis in original] (at [38]).

The Plaintiffs thus submitted that as beneficiaries of the Testator’s estate, they were entitled to a one-third share of the proceeds of the Katong Property and an account of the same. They also pointed out that the Defendant had been declaring the 1st Plaintiff’s share of profits in Bob’s to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore for the purpose of tax assessment between 2007 and 2014, when no such profits had in fact been paid out.

</div> In these circumstances, the Defendant acted reasonably in leasing out the Katong Property. However, the rental proceeds were retained by Rajan, against whom the Defendant could not in good conscience take legal action. This was because Rajan suffered from a medical condition and had undertaken to repay, after the sale of the Katong Property, the excess of the retained rental proceeds over his entitlements in the sale proceeds. The Defendant therefore offered that the Plaintiffs be substituted as executors so that they may directly pursue their claim against Rajan if they so wished. The Defendant also admitted to making the tax declarations over the 1st Plaintiff’s share of profits, which he conceded had not been distributed but, rather, kept in Bob’s bank account which was maintained by Rajan.

Even taking his case at the highest, disclosure of the state of affairs in relation to the sale proceeds of the North Bridge Road Property in 2011 by way of a lawyer’s letter, and in 2012 at a meeting between the parties, did not in this case constitute satisfactory discharge of his duty to account at or around the commencement of this suit in 2015.

</div> The trustee’s duty to account is continuous and on demand, and there was again no indication of oppression or unreasonableness on the part of the Plaintiffs.

For avoidance of doubt, the Defendant as trustee was liable to account for his conduct during his term as trustee, which includes both action and inaction, in relation to these proceeds. The mere fact that the proceeds had been obtained by the family a long time ago did not mean it was thus, as he claimed, “water under the bridge” and beyond the scope of his trusteeship.

That related to the proper discharge of duties by the executor of <span class="font-italic">Lilan’s estate</span>.

The status of the monies that had been paid from Lilan’s estate to the Testator’s Estate remained in question. Thus, the Plaintiffs’ claim for accounts in relation to the proceeds of Lilan’s estate remained a live one. The facts also did not show that the Plaintiffs’ request for accounts was unreasonable, or that an inference of settled accounts relating to the Defendant’s conduct as trustee was justified.

</div> The Plaintiffs’ claim was thus allegedly extinguished. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Having considered the evidence, I did not accept either of the Defendant’s justifications. It was not disputed that the Defendant had withdrawn the sum of $118,000 from the Estate Account, and that that sum was part of the trust assets. It was thus incumbent on the Defendant to bring evidence to show that he had a good basis for making such withdrawal. The Defendant had not done so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 First, in respect of the purported loan, no legal authority was cited for the proposition that a trustee could unilaterally take a loan from the trust assets. Indeed, it was not apparent to me how this loan would be a proper discharge of the Defendant’s duty to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries. This was particularly so when the Defendant had conceded that the purported loan had been taken for his personal use, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, to pay for his daughter’s education.

</div> the Defendant’s evidence as to his entitlement did not, to my mind, stand scrutiny.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Apart from the facts, the Defendant also did not establish the legal basis of his case. In particular, no authority was cited for the proposition that the Defendant had been entitled to set off a personal claim by him, as against the property of the trust. Indeed, there was authority that a “[s]et-off is only available in respect of debts or liquidated demands due between the same parties in the same right. So… to a claim against the defendant as executor, the latter cannot set-off a debt due to him personally” (Foo Chee Hock JC, <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span><span class="font-italic"> 2017</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2017) at para 18/17/3). It did not appear to me that the Plaintiffs’ and Defendant’s claims were “in the same right”, and the Defendant made no arguments in this regard. The Defendant’s failure to establish his basis and right to set-off meant that he had no defence to the Plaintiffs’ claim for breach of trust, even assuming that he factually established a half-share entitlement to the CDP Account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 For the foregoing reasons, having regard to both the facts and the law, I found that the Defendant did not established his defence of set-off and/or his entitlement as to any interest in the CDP Account.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I agreed with the Defendant that an order on the specific sum claimed by the Plaintiffs would be premature at this stage of the proceedings. However, an account by the Defendant on a common basis of the said debt owed by Moti was appropriate, and I accordingly so ordered. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 As explained, no specific orders were made in respect of Basco and Eltee as the relevant shareholding had been transferred by the Defendant to the Plaintiffs (see above at [33]). The position in relation to the Stamford House was also left to the taking of accounts (see above at [47]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Further, I made no orders in respect of the Plaintiffs’ prayers as to (a) damages and (b) indemnification for losses suffered in relation to the accounts and inquiries sought. The latter prayer was not necessary if the accounting process as explained had been properly understood. In respect of (a), I observe that the claim, which was premised on a breach of trust in equity, was crafted as a general one for damages, and not equitable compensation as it should have been (see, generally, <span class="font-italic">Quality Assurance </span><span class="font-italic">Management Asia Pte Ltd v Zhang Qing</span> [2013] 3 SLR 631 at [31]-[50]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In the circumstances, I granted the following orders: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) an account to be taken of the Estate Account and the monies due to the Estate pursuant to the Schedule of Assets, including, but not limited to the debts owed by Basco, Eltee and Bobby-O; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) an account to be taken of Bob’s, including but not limited to any dividend payments and interest; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) an account to be taken of the debt owed by Moti to the Estate; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) an account to be taken of the Estate’s share in the estate of Lilan; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(e) sums of $136,561.76 and $118,000 to be repaid to the Estate with interest at 5.33% per annum. This award is compensatory, and for that reason interest may be awarded under the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed).</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 As to the issue of costs, I was of the view that costs on an indemnity basis was not called for here; costs was thus awarded to the Plaintiffs on the standard basis. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Aedit Abdullah  <br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Nandwani Manoj Prakash and Ong Xuan Ning, Christine (Weng Xuanning) (Gabriel Law Corporation) for the Plaintiffs;<br/>Lim Thian Siong Sean and Han Shanru Gloria Bernadette <br/>(Hin Tat Augustine &amp; Partners) <br/>for the Defendant.<br/></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
