                            the incident. Both the deceased and Seah were then involved in various
                            illegal trades such as illegal money-lending and dealing in illegal
                            drugs in the Geylang area.</p>

                            Lorong 10 or Lorong 12, Geylang, Singapore.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10    Following this report, paramedics from the SCDF
                            arrived at Lorong 10 Geylang at about 6.33 am. They attended immediately
                            to the deceased, who was seen lying in a pool of blood in the middle of
                            road at Lorong 10 Geylang, between two coffee shops. As the deceased had
                            no pulse and was not breathing, the paramedics proceeded to commence
                            Cardio Respiratory Resuscitation on him, before conveying him to the
                            hospital in the ambulance. At 6.50 am, the ambulance arrived at Tan Tock
                            Seng Hospital [“TTSH”] and the deceased was referred to
                            Accident and Emergency Department. Efforts to revive the deceased proved

                            arrested in the following days thereafter. Police investigations then
                            revealed that the deceased was killed by the accused persons following

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12    On 18 February
                            2008, the deceased and his brother, Seah, agreed to purchase 2.5 grams
                            of “ICE” [“methamphetamine”] for $800 from

                            previously purchased such
                            drugs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13    The
                                2<sup>nd</sup> accused promised the deceased and
                            Seah that he would deliver the methamphetamine to them within 45
                            minutes. The 2<sup>nd</sup> accused then apparently
                            contacted the 7th accused, Ahmad Suhaimi, who in turn made arrangements
                            to obtain the methamphetamine from an unknown drugs supplier. The
                                2<sup>nd</sup> accused however failed to deliver the
                            drugs to the deceased and Seah as promised. The deceased and Seah
                            therefore attempted to find out the whereabouts of the
                                2<sup>nd</sup> accused from his friends and
                            acquaintances in the Geylang, including some of the accused persons as
                            well as the two accomplices, Nur Azimah (the
                                2<sup>nd</sup> accused’s girlfriend) and
                            [C].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14    On the early morning of
                            the next day, 19 February 2008, when the deceased and Seah
                            eventually managed to meet up with the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                            accused and the methamphetamine was passed over to them, they rejected
                            the methamphetamine as the quantity handed over was substantially less
                            than what they had paid for. The deceased and Seah then asked the
                                2<sup>nd</sup> accused to pay back the $800, but the
                                2<sup>nd</sup> accused refused. Instead, the
                                2<sup>nd</sup> accused called the
                                7<sup>th</sup> accused to explain the discrepancy in
                            the amount of methamphetamine delivered. Eventually the
                                2<sup>nd</sup> accused took back the methamphetamine
                            and assured both the deceased and Seah that he would deliver the correct
                            quantity of methamphetamine to them later. After the
                                2<sup>nd</sup> accused left, the
                                7<sup>th</sup> accused informed the deceased and
                            Seah that he knew some drugs suppliers and there was therefore no need
                            for the deceased and Seah to worry about the delivery of the
                            methamphetamine. Both the deceased and Seah however did not take kindly
                            to what they perceived was the 7<sup>th</sup>
                            accused’s boasting and making of empty assurances, as they saw
                            that he was merely a young boy then about 15 years of age, and who was
                            attempting to trivialise the issue of the failure to deliver the drugs.
                            Seah admonished the 7<sup>th</sup> accused and told him
                            not to interfere in the affair. The 7<sup>th</sup>
                            accused felt slighted by the deceased and Seah’s retort to
                            him.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15    Despite his promise to
                            deliver the correct amount of drugs, the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                            accused failed to deliver the methamphetamine to the deceased and Seah
                            and remained uncontactable for the next two days. This again caused the
                            deceased and Seah to look for some of the accused persons and the
                            accomplices to get them to reveal the whereabouts of the
                                2<sup>nd</sup> accused. When the deceased and Seah
                            subsequently bumped into the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                            accused’s girlfriend, Nur Azimah, the deceased and Seah pestered
                            her about the whereabouts of the 2<sup>nd</sup> accused.
                            However, Nur Azimah told the deceased and Seah that she did not know the
                            whereabouts of the 2<sup>nd</sup> accused. She further
                            told them to “fuck off from Geylang”. Seah became angry
                            with Nur Azimah, and scolded her, given that the
                                2<sup>nd</sup> accused, who was her boyfriend, was
                            the party at fault for failing to deliver the requisite amount of
                            methamphetamine.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16    On an
                            occasion, in the course of looking for the
                                2<sup>nd</sup> accused, the deceased and Seah drove
                            past Lorong 18 Geylang and chanced upon a group of persons that included
                            the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup>
                            accused. When the deceased queried them about the whereabouts of the
                                2<sup>nd</sup> accused, the group turned hostile.
                            Seeing that they were outnumbered, the deceased told Seah to get a
                            watermelon knife, and thereafter brandished the knife at the group. The
                            deceased also told them to find the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                            accused, who had now apparently disappeared with their
                        $800.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17    On the same day, the
                            deceased and Seah approached Nur Azimah again in her hotel room to ask
                            her where the 2<sup>nd</sup> accused was. When she again
                            replied that she did not know, the deceased and Seah decided to take
                            some items from Nur Azimah’s room that they suspected belonged to
                            the 2<sup>nd</sup> accused, as collateral for the return
                            of the $800. The deceased then took an amplifier in the hotel room. Nur
                            Azimah resisted attempts by the deceased and Seah to take the amplifier
                            resulting in a scuffle between her and the deceased. In the midst of the
                            scuffle, Nur Azimah claimed that the deceased had slapped her, although
                            this was denied by Seah.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18    The
                            following day, when Nur Azimah called the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                            accused, she told him that she was beaten up by the deceased and Seah.
                            When Nur Azimah subsequently met the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                            accused in their hotel room, the latter assured her that he was going to
                            “settle things out” with the deceased and
                        Seah.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19    Investigations by the police
                            also revealed that about two or three days before the commission of this
                            offence, while they were trying to ascertain the whereabouts of the
                                2<sup>nd</sup> accused, the deceased and Seah met
                            with the 1<sup>st</sup> accused, Sufian, and they
                            proceeded to consume some drugs in the 1<sup>st</sup>
                            accused’s hotel room. When the 1<sup>st</sup>
                            accused fell asleep thereafter, Seah took away the
                                1<sup>st</sup> accused’s handphone, MP4 player
                            and portable DVD player. When the 1<sup>st</sup> accused
                            discovered that his belongings were missing, he became angry with the
                            deceased and Seah and told the 7<sup>th</sup> accused in
                            Malay <em>“Aku kalau jumpa dorang mati lah dorang.
                                Aku dah standby untuk gantung”</em> (meaning,

                            The 7<sup>th</sup> accused told Mohamed Najiman, who was
                            employed as a bouncer to maintain order at the gambling stalls in the
                            back lanes, that the deceased and Seah were giving them problems. The

                            and possession of contraband cigarettes. Hafiq was closest to the
                                7<sup>th</sup> accused. Later that day, Hafiq called
                            the 7<sup>th</sup> accused and asked him to raise $200

                            gambling stall. Tan worked for one Ng Kum Seng [“Ng’], who
                            operated several gambling stalls in Geylang, and was also regarded as a
                            senior member of the “Sio Loh Kuan” secret society group.
                            With Ng’s agreement, Tan handed over $200 to the
                                7<sup>th</sup> accused in the presence of Seah. It

                            had periodically demanded the return of this money from

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30    At about 5.00 am,
                                Tan and Ng called Seah and the 7<sup>th</sup> accused to

                            The deceased and Seah arrived at the location soon thereafter. The
                            deceased was armed with a metal rod that he concealed under his
                            shirt’s sleeve, while Seah wore a metal belt. Shortly thereafter,

                            accused and Mohamad Najiman also arrived at the scene. Upon their
                            arrival, the 5<sup>th</sup> accused approached the
                                7<sup>th</sup> accused and told him that he did not
                            have any weapon with him, whereupon the 7<sup>th</sup>

                                6<sup>th</sup> accused, who was himself armed. Soon
                            thereafter, the 1<sup>st</sup> accused also arrived,
                            armed with his own knife.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31    Facilitated by Tan and Ng, the initial issue discussed was between the
                                7<sup>th</sup> accused and Seah about the $200 that
                            Tan passed to the 7<sup>th</sup> accused to pay the
                            composition fine, and which money was now unaccounted for. The
                                7<sup>th</sup> accused denied that he had pocketed
                            the money, while Seah insisted that the 7<sup>th</sup>
                            accused did not hand over the money to him. This issue ended with the
                                7<sup>th</sup> accused stating that if he had taken
                            this money, he would pay it back to Tan. The deceased and Seah then
                            claimed that they had been cheated by the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                            accused of $800, which they had handed over to the
                                2<sup>nd</sup> accused for the purchase of
                            methamphetamine. The 2<sup>nd</sup> accused claimed that
                            out of the $800, he had kept $200 as a reward for procuring the
                            methamphetamine, while the remaining $600 was passed to the
                                7<sup>th</sup> accused as he was the one liaising
                            with the drugs supplier for the supply of the
                        methamphetamine.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">32    Upon hearing
                            this, Seah grabbed the neck of the 7<sup>th</sup>
                            accused, and stated that all the misunderstandings were created by him.
                            The deceased and Seah then asked the 7<sup>th</sup>
                            accused to repay them $50 every day in order to repay the full $800.
                            Before they left Lorong 19 Geylang, the deceased took the
                                7<sup>th</sup> accused’s handphone away, and
                            passed it to Seah, stating that the handphone would be kept as
                            collateral until the 7<sup>th</sup> accused had repaid
                            the money. Both the deceased and Seah then walked away towards Lorong 10
                            Geylang. Tan and Ng also left the

                                walked away from Lorong 19 Geylang, Mohamad Najiman felt that the
                            deceased should not be let off without getting back the
                                7<sup>th</sup> accused’s handphone. Addressing
                            the 2<sup>nd</sup> accused, Mohamad Najiman asked him
                            whether he was going to allow the deceased and Seah to go just like
                            that. According to the 2<sup>nd</sup> accused, he also
                            heard someone ask him whether he wanted to ask the deceased about the
                            matter concerning “Sepet” (i.e. Nur Azimah). The
                                1<sup>st</sup> accused also queried loudly where the
                            deceased and Seah were going. The 1<sup>st</sup> accused
                            then drew out his knife, and all the accused persons left Lorong 19
                            Geylang to confront the deceased and
                            Seah.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34    In the meantime, the
                            deceased and Seah went into the coffee-shop located at No. 232 Geylang
                            Road, at the vicinity of Lorong 10 Geylang, to have breakfast. As they
                            were about to order their food, they were suddenly confronted by a group
                            of persons led by the 2<sup>nd</sup> accused, with the
                                3<sup>rd</sup> accused standing on his left. The
                                2<sup>nd</sup> accused shouted, “Who slapped
                            Sepet (i.e. Nur Azimah)?” before landing a punch on the
                            deceased’s face. This was quickly followed by some of the accused
                            persons, who unleashed their knives to attack the deceased. Before the
                                2<sup>nd</sup> accused could do anything else, he
                            realised that his right hand was slashed deeply by someone from his back
                            and he retreated backwards out of the coffee shop to tend to his
                            injury.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">35    In the meantime,
                            seeing that they were vastly outnumbered, Seah threw a chair and pushed
                            a table aside. Both Seah and the deceased then ran out of the coffee
                            shop to the road at Lorong 10 Geylang where they were chased by the
                            accused persons. While Seah managed to run away, the deceased was
                            confronted by the 7<sup>th</sup> accused in the middle
                            of the road between the two coffee shops. The deceased was floored by a
                            kick delivered by the 7<sup>th</sup> accused, who
                            claimed that he saw the deceased charging at him with a metal rod

                            blood on his knife as he had slashed the deceased
                            “lightly”. The 6<sup>th</sup> accused also
                            stated that thereafter, when Seah ran back towards the deceased with the
                            iron rod that was with the deceased earlier, he took out his knife and
                            challenged Seah to come forward. However, Seah fled and he (i.e. the
                                6<sup>th</sup> accused) also left the
                        scene.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">43    After the assault, Mohamad Najiman, who had himself
                            not assaulted the deceased, shouted “cukup” (meaning
                            enough) in Malay and all the accused persons fled the scene. After the
                            accused persons had left, Seah returned to the scene and approached the
                            deceased, who was lying in a pool of blood on the road. He noticed that
                            the deceased’s lips had turned pale, and that the deceased did not
                            respond to his calls.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">45    Police investigations further reveal that after the

                            “confirmed will die”. Along the way near Lorong 14
                            Geylang, the 1<sup>st</sup> accused also met one Fareed

                            in the back lanes of Geylang, and told him that he had stabbed the
                            deceased in the neck, and that the deceased was going to die. The
                                1<sup>st</sup> accused also subsequently told Mak

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">57    In furtherance of the common object of the said
                            unlawful assembly, Mohamad Najiman and the
                                1<sup>st</sup> accused instigated the other accused
                            persons to attack the deceased and Seah at Lorong 10 Geylang. The
                                2<sup>nd</sup> accused started the assault by
                            punching the deceased while the 7<sup>th</sup> accused
                            kicked the deceased, causing him to fall onto the road. Thereafter, the
                            deceased was attacked with knives by the 1<sup>st</sup>,

                            accused persons. Blows and kicks were also inflicted on the deceased as
                            he lay on the road. The deceased died from the injuries inflicted on him
                            as a consequence, which injuries the accused persons knew to be likely
                            to be inflicted in the prosecution of the common object of that
                            assembly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Reasons for sentencing</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Counsel for B3 sought probation or reformative
                    training. Counsel for B5, B6 and B7 submitted that reformative training was
                    appropriate. Counsel for B1 submitted that the sentence should not be life
                    imprisonment. Counsel for B2 submitted that the custodial sentence should not be
                    more than ten years and that B2 should receive the least severe of the
                    sentences. Counsel for B4 submitted that a sentence of less than ten years would
                    be appropriate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The prosecution submitted that the principles of
                    retribution, deterrence and prevention should prevail. The prosecution sought a
                    custodial sentence towards the upper end of 20 years’ imprisonment for B3
                    to B7 and life imprisonment for B1 and B2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       I have considered whether rehabilitation should
                    be the dominant consideration especially for each of those accused persons below
                    the age of 21 years of age.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In <em>Public Prosecutor v Leong
                        Soon Kheong</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 63, the Court of Appeal
                    said at [26] to [28] and [31]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    In this genre of group violence, the two most
                            pressing sentencing considerations are the principles of general
                            deterrence and retribution. In PP v Law Aik Meng [2007] 2 SLR(R) 814 , the High Court
                            emphatically underscored the particular relevance of general deterrence
                            in cases involving group offences. The court noted at
                        [25(b)]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Examples of particular circumstances of an offence which may attract
                        general deterrence include:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    Group/syndicate offences: The fact that an offence
                            was committed by two or more persons may be regarded as an aggravating
                            factor (see Sentencing Practice at p 84). Group offences generally
                            result in greater harm. Another significant factor is that the victim is
                            likely to be in greater fear in cases where physical intimidation is
                            exerted. Further, group pressure to perpetuate such offences may add to
                            their persistency, and group dynamics necessarily imply greater harm or
                            damage: see Professor Andrew Ashworth in Sentencing and Criminal Justice
                            (Cambridge University Press, 2005, 4th Ed) ('Sentencing and Criminal
                            Justice') at p 157. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27    Furthermore, the court noted (at [25(c)]), that
                            gratuitous violence would fall under the broad category of public
                            disquiet, which would also invoke the principle of general deterrence.
                            As was said in PP v V Murugesan [2005] SGHC 160 (at [55]),"[violent]
                            [p]erpetrators are punished not just for the physical harm they inflict
                            but also for the life-long trauma, debilitating emotional distress and
                            anguish they callously and cruelly inflict and sentence their victims to
                            suffer in silence". To this, we need only add that the traumatic effect
                            of a violent crime on a victim's family and loved ones ought not to be
                            forgotten.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    This is not to say that other sentencing
                            considerations such as specific deterrence and rehabilitation are
                            invariably irrelevant in cases such as this. Their relevance and the
                            weightage to be given will have to be assessed carefully in the light of
                            the circumstances prevailing in each matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31    In our view, relevant considerations in sentencing
                            (some of which may be aggravating factors) for group violence include
                            facts such as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    the actual train of events leading to the attack.
                            It will be relevant to take into account the level of pre-meditation or
                            planning involved. This is not to say, however, that incidents that
                            erupt suddenly are to be evaluated more benignly;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    the number of offenders involved;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    whether weapons were used. This factor is usually
                            connected with the level of planning that precedes an incident: see (a)
                            above. The use of a weapon is often an aggravating circumstance although
                            the absence of one is at best a neutral consideration. A fist can also
                            be a lethal instrument of harm;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    the response of the victim to the attack.
                            Assaulting a defenceless and vulnerable victim who offers no resistance
                            can never be viewed lightly. This, of course, does not mean that the
                            response of a victim who seeks to protect himself can ever justify an
                            attack or the continuation thereof;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(e)    the duration of the attack;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(f)    the extent and nature of the injuries inflicted on
                            the victim;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(g)    the role and participation of each of the
                            offender(s) in the sequence of events leading to as well as during the
                            attack, assuming this can be clearly delineated;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(h)    the reasons for the assault including the
                            existence of "provocation" by the victim. Here, we should add that any
                            manner of retaliatory conduct by the accused, short of what is
                            permissible under the PC, ought not to be condoned;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(i)    the level of public fear or alarm generated by the
                            incident;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(j)    the nature of violence involved;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(k)    whether gratuitous violence was
                        involved;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(l)    the commission of any other offence by the
                            offender(s) during the course of the attack;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(m)    the prevalence of the particular offence;
                            and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(n)    whether the violence was directed against a
                            vulnerable victim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In the circumstances before me, there was some
                    pre-meditation and planning. The group was planning to act violently and that
                    was why some of them armed themselves before going for the “settlement
                    talk”. Even then, the attack did not occur at the talk but only after the
                    talk ended and the deceased and Seah had gone away. They were having breakfast
                    when the group set upon them. The group comprised seven or more persons and
                    knives were used. The attack was not confined to the coffee shop. The group
                    continued to chase the deceased and Seah as they ran out of the coffee shop.
                    Seah managed to run away but the deceased was confronted again in the middle of
                    the road between two coffee shops and was floored by a kick. The group then
                    surrounded and attacked him, except that B2 and Mohamed Najiman did not
                    personally attack the deceased then. Multiple serious and vicious injuries were
                    inflicted on the deceased. The attacks took place in a public place and must
                    have caused alarm and fear to innocent bystanders. Indeed, they were at risk of
                    serious injury as can be seen by the fact that B2 was himself injured, probably
                    by one of the attackers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     B2 and Mohamed Najiman appeared to be the
                    leaders. B2 was also the one who signalled the attack by landing the first blow
                    on the deceased although he himself was not armed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     B2 and B7 were the most responsible, among the
                    accused persons, for the matters that gave rise to the tension with the deceased
                    and Seah, although B7 was the youngest among the accused persons. B7 was not
                    armed during the attacks but that was because he had handed his weapon to
                    B5.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     B1 did query loudly where the deceased and
                    Seah were going. Presumably, this was the instigation by B1 which the
                    prosecution was referring to (see paras 33 and 57 of the agreed SOF). However,
                    the person who led the group to go after Seah and the deceased was B2 (see para
                    34 of the agreed SOF). B1 also had reasons to be angry as his personal
                    belongings were taken by Seah. He did make a statement to suggest that he would
                    kill the deceased and Seah (see para 19 of the agreed SOF) but that could have
                    been his instantaneous response upon discovering that items were missing. He
                    also did make a statement after the group was leaving the scene that the
                    deceased “confirmed will die” (see para 45 of the agreed SOF) but
                    it is not clear whether that was a boast or not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     B1 was said to be particularly vicious (see
                    para 37 of the agreed SOF which also states that the deceased was viciously
                    attacked by all the accused persons).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     B6’s knife did not have any blood but,
                    in my view, that was fortuitous. There was no suggestion that he deliberately
                    missed his target.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On the other hand, the deceased and his
                    brother were partly to blame for the tension which arose and which led to the
                    attacks. The deceased was also armed with a metal rod.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Having considered all the circumstances,
                    including the seriousness of the nature of the offence, I am of the view that
                    deterrence and retribution are the more pressing considerations. A strong signal
                    must be sent to those who are minded to group or gang together to attack others
                    in a public place that such attacks will be treated severely. Accordingly, I am
                    of the view that reformative training is not appropriate for those accused
                    persons below the age of 21. I would however mention that I am not saying that
                    reformative training is never appropriate in a case including s 304(a) read
                    with s 149. It depends on the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     As for all the accused persons, I am of the
                    view that they should all be treated similarly except for B2. I do not accept
                    the prosecution’s submission that B1 should be treated more harshly and be
                    placed in the same category as B2 because he had attacked more vigorously than
                    the others and because of the statements he had made before and after the
                    attacks. Considering the totality of all the evidence and his role in the
                    matter, I am of the view that the points mentioned by the prosecution did not
                    justify treating B1 more harshly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     As for B2, he is the oldest of the accused
                    persons. He and B7 were the most responsible among the accused persons for the
                    tension which arose. He was also a leader among the accused persons. He led them
                    to the coffee shop and landed the first blow which signalled the attack.
                    Although he stopped participating in the attacks, this was not due to an act of
                    restraint on his part but because he had been inadvertently
                injured.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In addition, B2 has an antecedent of a violent
                    crime whilst being a member of an unlawful assembly which resulted in the death
                    of the victim. On 29 January 2004, he was convicted in DAC No 51846 of 2003
                    on a charge under s 325 read with s 149 of the Penal Code of
                    voluntarily causing grievous hurt and was sentenced by a District Court to six
                    years and 12 strokes of the cane. There was a fatality in this
                incident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     He was also on the same day convicted and
                    sentenced as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     in DAC No 23998 of 2003 on a charge
                        under s 147 of the Penal Code – three years’ imprisonment
                        and six strokes of the cane (the sentence of imprisonment to run
                        concurrently with DAC 51846 of 2003). Apparently, there were two persons who
                        were injured in this incident;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     in DAC No 23999 of 2003 on a charge under s 379 of
                        the Penal Code – nine months’ imprisonment (the sentence to run
                        consecutively with DAC No 51846 of 2003).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">He was released
                    from prison on 5 December 2007 and committed the present offence within a
                    few months, <em>ie</em>, on 23 February
                2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     On the other hand, I have taken into account
                    the following as well:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     All the accused persons pleaded
                        guilty;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     B3 to
                        B7 were below 21 years of age when the crime was committed and B1 was 22
                        years of age;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"></a>(c)     B1, B3, B5 to B7 were first time offenders in respect of a violent crime.
                        In this regard, I did not single out B4 for harsher sentence in the totality
                        of the circumstances even though he had been convicted and sentenced to one
                        month’s imprisonment for a charge under s 332 of the Penal Code,
                        which involved voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant. Neither did the
                        prosecution press for a harsher sentence for him.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_d"></a>(d)     The deceased and Seah were not
                        entirely innocent victims. They had contributed to the events which led to
                        the attacks. The deceased himself was armed with a metal rod. However, I did
                        not accept the submissions of various defence counsel that those accused
                        persons who were armed, were armed solely for the purpose of defence as a
                        result of past incidents and in view of the “settlement

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I have also considered sentencing precedents
                    for s 304(a) offences. In doing so, I took into account the fact that under
                    the previous s 304(a), the permissible custodial sentence was life
                    imprisonment or imprisonment for up to ten years whereas under the present
                    s 304(a), it is life imprisonment or imprisonment for up to 20 years. The
                    liability in principle for fine or caning remains the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In the circumstances, I sentence the first and
