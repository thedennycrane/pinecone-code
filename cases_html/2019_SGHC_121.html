Having acquired knowledge of the project in his capacity as a company representative, the director then successfully tendered for the project and managed to acquire it for himself.  At the time he did this, it is said that he had already resigned as a director and also that the company had no chance securing the project itself.  The director set up a corporate vehicle to execute the project.  His principal, the aggrieved company, has now brought a claim against him and his corporate vehicle.  This raises issues as to the duties of directors in respect of corporate opportunities as well as accessory liability of the corporate vehicle in relation to the alleged breach of fiduciary duties.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The plaintiff, Innovative Corporation Pte Ltd, was incorporated in Singapore on 16 August 2004.

The Project cost was stated to be S$115 million, and it was expected to be completed in two and a half years.  There was also a statement that, of the 82 units of semi-detached houses to be constructed, FYTA would be allocated ownership of 27 units, and THC allocated 55 units.  The Cooperation Agreement ended with, “[o]ther matters not discussed in this agreement shall be negotiated separately.  This agreement (…) shall become effective on the date of signing”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 In his evidence, Mr Liu explained FYTA’s thinking behind the Cooperation Agreement.  He said that the idea was that FYTA would not have to mortgage the land at 33 Holland Link for financing, so the developer who partnered with them, that is, THC, would have to finance the entire cost of the Project.  In return, it would be given 55 units of the semi-detached houses to be built.  This was why the allocation of the units was provided for in the Cooperation Agreement, and it was also stated that “[FYTA] shall not mortgage the property nor incur debts”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 At a meeting of the board of directors of FYTA, an update was given to them on the Cooperation Agreement.  The minutes of the meeting record Mr Chan as saying that “[FYTA] cannot be developer itself.  Therefore [FYTA] entrusted the entire development project to the developer – [THC]”.

The first defendant’s evidence was that he was happy to hear that FYTA was going to invite him to bid, but he told them he was going to tender with the plaintiff.  He was then told unequivocally by Mr Leow that, if he colluded with or worked with Ms Chen, he would not be considered.

</div>  In summary, the arrangement between the parties was as follows.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The second defendant had a paid-up share capital of S$1 million, which was provided by its sole shareholder, Clydesbuilt Investment Pte Ltd.  Representatives of FYTA were issued 1,000,000 preference shares at a par value of S$0.01 each, totalling the amount of S$10,000.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) At the time of its incorporation, the first defendant and his brother were appointed to the board of directors of the second defendant.  On 20 October 2010, four more directors were appointed – the first defendant’s sister, and three representatives from FYTA, including Mr Chan and Mr Leow. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) FYTA was entitled to 25 of the 82 residential units that would be built, while Clydesbuilt Investment Pte Ltd was entitled to 57 units.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) On 20 October 2010, pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement, the second defendant acquired from the trustees of FYTA the land on which the residential units would be built.  The purchase price was S$70 million, and it would be paid by setting off against FYTA’s share of the development costs for the Project.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The Project was completed sometime in 2014.  Subsequently, a dispute arose between the parties to this joint venture.  Legal proceedings were commenced by FYTA in 2017 against the two defendants and Clydesbuilt Investment Pte Ltd but were then later withdrawn.  There was presumably some form of settlement reached.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 On 31 July 2018, 21 of the 25 units (as four had been sold earlier on) earmarked for FYTA were transferred to them pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement entered into between the second defendant and FYTA on 26 February 2018.  Thereafter, the 1,000,000 preference shares held by FYTA were cancelled, and FYTA’s representatives resigned as directors from the second defendant’s board.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 As at the time of the trial of the matter before me, only Clydesbuilt Investment Pte Ltd remained as the shareholder of the second defendant.  The second defendant’s board presently comprises the first defendant, his daughter and his brother.  According to the defendants, the second defendant still holds 48 of its earmarked 57 residential units, with nine units having been sold.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The plaintiff’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The plaintiff’s primary case against the first defendant is founded on a breach of director’s duties.  Its claim that the first defendant breached his duties is based on several key arguments: as a director of the company, the first defendant owed fiduciary duties not to act in a manner contrary to the interests of the plaintiff, the Project had been a maturing business opportunity which the plaintiff had been actively pursuing and the first defendant tendered his resignation with the intention of procuring the Project for himself.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The plaintiff alleges that, in procuring the Project for the second defendant, the first defendant usurped a maturing business opportunity in breach of his fiduciary duties as a director.

</div>  But this is completely inconsistent with his evidence that the ACRA searches had alerted him to the plaintiff’s supposed inaction.  According to his evidence, there were at least five searches done on his instructions in the period from March to June 2010.  A more likely explanation is that these searches were conducted with the intention of monitoring the status of the plaintiff whilst the defendants were in the process of securing the Project from FYTA.  I find that, contrary to his evidence, the first defendant did not appear to be too concerned that he was still a director of the plaintiff while he was tendering for the Project for himself.  In my judgment, the evidence points to the first defendant making the conscious decision to only resign in early August 2010.

</div>  While this is true to a certain extent, ultimately, it did not affect my findings as to the scope of his fiduciary duties.  Even if the first defendant had resigned in early March 2010, as he now says, the first defendant’s liability for breach of his fiduciary duties would largely be dependent on the motivation behind his resignation.  If he had resigned for the purpose of pursuing the Project on his own, and it is shown that in doing so, he had appropriated a maturing corporate opportunity of the plaintiff’s that it was still pursuing, he would nonetheless be in breach of his fiduciary duties owed to the plaintiff.  Put another way, simply resigning as a director of the company would not absolve him of liability for his actions.  This issue is discussed in more detail below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Did the first defendant breach his fiduciary duties to the plaintiff? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 As a preliminary point, I make a brief observation as to the scope of the first defendant’s fiduciary duties.  A fiduciary is “someone who has undertaken to act for or on behalf of another in a particular matter in circumstances which give rise to a relationship of trust and confidence” (<span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto Emporium Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Yeo Boong Hua and others and another appeal</span> [2018] 2 SLR 655 (“<span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto</span>”) at [42].  Put another way, a fiduciary is a party who has voluntarily assumed power over, and responsibility for, the affairs of another party.  This relationship generates a legitimate expectation that a fiduciary will not utilise his or her position in a manner that is adverse to the interests of the principal.  Directors fall within the settled categories of fiduciary relationships and there is a strong rebuttable presumption that they consequently owe fiduciary duties to their companies (<span class="font-italic">Turf Club Auto </span>at [43]).  However, ultimately, whether such duties exist and their extent turns on the <span class="font-italic">nature and scope</span> of the parties’ relationship as shown by the facts of the case.  This is important because a director may not be liable for profits derived by him outside the scope of the company’s business or be obliged to protect the company’s interests outside such scope.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The defendants submit that the first defendant’s duties were limited to the agreement to collaborate with Ms Chen and THC, and would only arise <span class="font-italic">upon the award of</span><span class="font-italic"> the Project to the plaintiff</span>, which never happened.

</div>  In other words, even though the first defendant became a director of the plaintiff, he did not have the usual fiduciary duties that a director would normally have because there was no general relationship of trust and confidence between the first defendant and the plaintiff.  Duties were only undertaken in respect of the Project.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In my judgment, I find that this submission is not supported by the evidence.  While the defendants rely on the first defendant’s email to Ms Chen dated 4 December 2009 (see [21] above), there is nothing in the email which seeks to limit the scope of the first defendant’s duties such that they arise only when the Project is awarded to the plaintiff.  There is also nothing in the correspondence between the parties which suggests that the first defendant’s duties as a director of the plaintiff were so limited.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Quite apart from this, it is important to note that the first defendant only gained access to FYTA's representatives through the introduction of Ms Chen <span class="font-italic">after</span> he and Ms Chen had come to an agreement that they would collaborate through the auspices of the plaintiff and <span class="font-italic">after</span> the first defendant became a director of the plaintiff.  This is relevant because this shows that this was not an opportunity which the first defendant would have been able to exploit on his own if he had not become a director of the plaintiff.  There is no suggestion that the first defendant was someone that FYTA was aware of as a developer and would have invited to tender for the Project even if he had not been introduced to them by Ms Chen in February 2010.  The fact that this was the case indicates that the first defendant must have fully understood that the expectation on him was that he would have to act in the best interests of the plaintiff and subordinate his own interests to that of the plaintiff’s.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Further, I find that the defendants’ submission about the limited scope of the first defendant’s fiduciary duties is contradicted by the first defendant’s own evidence under cross-examination that he was fully aware of his fiduciary duty as a director of the plaintiff not to place himself in a position of conflict of his interest and his duty.  He explained that this was why he wanted to resign from the plaintiff as quickly as possible before he pursued the Project for himself, even though by then, it was clear to him that FYTA would not be awarding the Project to the plaintiff.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 For the above reasons, I find that the first defendant owed the usual fiduciary duties that are imposed on individuals when they become directors of companies.  While it is true that the first defendant only became a shareholder and director of the plaintiff because of the likelihood at that time that the plaintiff would become the developer of the Project, it does not change the fact that, when appointed as a director, he would have assumed the obligations and duties of a director of the company.  These included the duty of loyalty, to act honestly, in the best interests of the plaintiff and not to place himself in a position of conflict.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 I turn now to whether there was a breach of these duties.  A director is not allowed to obtain for himself any property or business advantage which “properly belongs to his company or for which it has been negotiating” (Tan Cheng Han <span class="font-italic">et al</span>, <span class="font-italic">Walter Woon on Company Law</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Ltd, 3rd Ed, 2009) (“<span class="font-italic">Walter Woon</span>”) at [8.58]).  This duty is a confluence of the rules that a director must not place himself in a position where his personal interests would conflict with his duty to the company and that a director must not abuse his position to make an unauthorised profit.  This fiduciary obligation of loyalty is an inflexible one that persists even after the director’s resignation.  A former director would be in breach of his duties to a company in respect of his resigning to procure a corporate opportunity of the company, if three conditions are satisfied, as explained by the Supreme Court of Canada in the oft-cited <span class="font-italic">Canadian Aero Service Ltd v O’Malley </span>(1973) 40 DLR (3d) 371 at 382 (“<span class="font-italic">Canadian Aero Service</span>”): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) first, there must be a “maturing business opportunity”;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) secondly, the company must have been “actively pursuing” that opportunity; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) thirdly, the director’s resignation may “fairly be said to have been prompted or influenced by a wish to acquire for himself” that opportunity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The conditions laid in <span class="font-italic">Canadian Aero Service </span>have been accepted in a number of English and local decisions, including by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tokuhon (Pte) Ltd v Seow Kang Hong</span><span class="font-italic"> and others </span>[2003] 4 SLR(R) 414 at [50] and by Judith Prakash J, as she then was, in <span class="font-italic">Personal Automation Mart Pte Ltd v Tan Swe Sang </span>[2000] SGHC 55 at [56].    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Was the Project a maturing business opportunity? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 For there to be a maturing business opportunity, the company must have invested its efforts and resources in attempting to secure that opportunity.  There must therefore be a concretised opportunity, and the mere prospect of future business is insufficient: <span class="font-italic">Canadian Aero Service </span>at 390.  A director would not be precluded from exploiting general knowledge acquired in the course of his directorship upon assuming a new position.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In their closing submissions, the defendants have relied on two decisions which they argue illustrate that a proper application of this principle would show that the Project was not a maturing business opportunity.  However, when I examined the facts of these two decisions, I found them to be quite clearly distinguishable from the facts in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The first was the Hong Kong Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">Akihiro Oba</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Kishimoto Sangyo Co Ltd and another </span>[1996] HKCA 581 (“<span class="font-italic">Akihiro</span>”).  In that case, the plaintiff companies alleged that the actions of a former director had prevented them from obtaining a significant number of contracts from a Taiwanese company.  The director had developed goodwill with this company whilst he was employed by the plaintiffs.  Through his efforts, the plaintiffs had secured two contracts from the company for a pilot production plant project.  Upon the director’s resignation, he then entered into his own discussions with the company for a mass-production project.  The Court found that the plaintiffs’ anticipation of obtaining further contracts from the company was too remote for equitable relief to bite as these contracts were “nowhere in sight” when the director resigned (at [46]).  There was no connection between the opportunity that enured to the former director’s benefit and the opportunities he gained knowledge of whilst he remained in the plaintiffs’ employment.  The mass-production project in <span class="font-italic">Akihiro </span>was thus more akin to an “embryonic”, rather than maturing, opportunity.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The reasoning of the Court in <span class="font-italic">Akihiro</span> is also found in the English High Court decision in <span class="font-italic">Island Export Finance Ltd v Umunna and another</span> [1986] BCLC 460 (“<span class="font-italic">Island Export</span>”), the other case relied on by the defendants.  There, the managing director of the plaintiff company had secured a contract for postal caller boxes from Cameroon’s postal authorities.  He later resigned and formed him own company.  The former director then obtained, for his own company, two contracts from the postal authorities.  Hutchinson J found that at the material time, the plaintiff company had not been actively seeking new orders for postal caller boxes.  Thus, the mere hope of further orders could not be regarded as a maturing business opportunity.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In this case, the nature of the opportunity in relation to the Project differed significantly from the facts in <span class="font-italic">Akihiro</span> and <span class="font-italic">Island Export</span>.  It was an identifiable opportunity that was clearly particularised in the Cooperation Agreement and the Joint Venture Agreement, that is, the development of the site at 33 Holland Link into a residential project and a cultural centre.  Money had also been expended for the Project’s excavation works.  I should add that it is the first defendant’s own evidence that the financial institutions that he had approached were prepared to give an indicative term sheet for financing even without a finalised agreement between the plaintiff and FYTA.

</div>  From a commercial perspective therefore, this was clearly a real, and not a speculative, business opportunity for the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Also, one could not say that the opportunity was at an embryonic stage given that there is no dispute that the plaintiff and FYTA were in the midst of trying to finalise the terms of the revised JVA when FYTA decided that it did not wish to proceed with the plaintiff as the developer.  Most importantly, it was the <span class="font-italic">same</span> opportunity that was subsequently acquired by the first defendant.  I therefore reject the argument that the Project was not a maturing business opportunity of the plaintiff’s.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Was the Plaintiff actively pursuing the Project?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 This inquiry ties into the foregoing point.  As noted at [73], for an opportunity to be maturing, a company would have to pursue it in some way.  The defendants submit that it was impossible that the plaintiff was actively pursuing the Project at the material time.  This was because FYTA had lost confidence in the plaintiff and, even if it had secured the Project, it lacked the requisite experience and financial resources to complete the development.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In <span class="font-italic">Industrial Development Consultants Ltd v Cooley </span>[1972] 1 WLR 443 (“<span class="font-italic">Industrial Development Consultants</span>”) at 453G, Roskill J, as he then was, held that, in determining whether there is an active pursuit of an opportunity, the likelihood of the company actually acquiring that opportunity for itself is <span class="font-italic">irrelevant</span>.  The inherent nature of fiduciary obligations compels directors to disregard their personal interests.  On the facts of <span class="font-italic">Industrial Development Consultants</span>, the former managing director of the plaintiffs withheld information that the Eastern Gas Board was willing to offer him a project which the plaintiffs had been unsuccessfully pursuing.  Although there was no possibility of the plaintiffs obtaining the project in question, this did not exonerate the director’s conduct.  His fiduciary obligations took precedence.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Roskill J explained that “[i]t is an over-riding principle of equity that a man must not be allowed to put himself in a position in which his fiduciary duty and his interests conflict” (at [453H]).  He also referred to language used in <span class="font-italic">Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver</span> <span class="font-italic">and others</span> [1967] 2 AC 134 (“<span class="font-italic">Regal</span>”) that a director “must account for any benefit which he obtains in the course of and owing to his directorship” (at [453G]).  In <span class="font-italic">Regal</span>, the House of Lords rejected the argument that the impossibility of the company to realise the corporate opportunity was in any way a defence to the claim against the directors for acquiring the opportunity for themselves (see 149G).    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82  The view in<span class="font-italic"> Industrial Development Consultants </span>was affirmed locally in<span class="font-italic"> Hytech Builders Pte Ltd v Tan Eng Leong and another </span>[1995] 1 SLR(R) 576 at [58].  Warren L H Khoo J found that the fact that a company cannot take advantage of a corporate opportunity “does not make it any the less a diversion if the director takes that opportunity for himself” (at [59]).  In my view, this conclusion flows from the underlying rule that a director must account for any unauthorised profits, and that a constructive trust will be imposed on such profits or their traceable proceeds.  It is not relevant in such an analysis that the company itself could not have made those profits or would have suffered no loss.  That being case, and following that reasoning, in the case of a diversion of a corporate opportunity, it is irrelevant that the company could not have ultimately exploited the opportunity for itself.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 An exception to this would be the scenario in <span class="font-italic">Peso Silver Mines Limited (NPL) v Stanley E Cropper </span>[1966] SCR 673 (“<span class="font-italic">Peso Silver Mines</span>”) where the Supreme Court of Canada found that Peso’s board of directors had expressly considered and rejected an offer from a prospector to sell mine claims to the company.  The managing director’s subsequent decision to form a company to acquire these claims himself was not in breach of his duties.  A pillar of the Court’s reasoning was also that the director had not obtained the mine claims by reason of the fact that he was a director and in the course of the execution of that office (at 682).  It was therefore distinguishable from the decision in <span class="font-italic">Regal</span>, where the directors obtained the opportunity “by reason and only by reason of the fact that they were directors of Regal” and were therefore accountable for profits gained in the course of the execution of their office (per Lord Russell of Killowen at 149F). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Peso Silver Mines </span>has no application in this case.  The first defendant only acquired knowledge of the Project through his association with Ms Chen and then the plaintiff.  His interactions with FYTA occurred through the lens of him being the plaintiff’s representative even though he was not introduced to FYTA’s officer-bearers at the lunch on 24 February 2010 as a director, shareholder or employee of the plaintiff.  The circumstances leading to that meeting are also telling.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The first defendant and Ms Chen were in discussions in the last quarter of 2010 for him to participate as a 50% shareholder in the plaintiff.  To that end, after agreement on the terms of their cooperation were reached, the first defendant signed the documents for him to become a director of the plaintiff.  In January and February 2010, the concern that was discussed between the first defendant and Ms Chen was that the Project might not eventually be awarded to the plaintiff because of the new FYTA office-bearers in charge not being confident of Ms Chen’s abilities.  It was in this context that the first defendant suggested that he meet with FYTA’s representatives to assure them that the plaintiff could perform as promised.  Following from this suggestion, the first defendant attended the lunch meeting on 24 February 2010, and before that, he was appointed a director of the plaintiff on 18 February 2010. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86   Given the circumstances, the first defendant was well placed to cultivate the trust and confidence of FYTA and he eventually used this to his advantage.  Ms Chen’s evidence, which I accept, is that, after the lunch meeting on 24 February 2010 when the first defendant was introduced to FYTA’s representatives, she left it to the first defendant to try to engage with and persuade them to award the plaintiff the Project.  In her words, “I told [the first defendant] to deal with them because he’s also a Singaporean (…) so I told him that I would be in charge of the works while he would be in charge of dealing with these Hakka people”.

</div>  My analysis of the evidence, in its totality, is that Ms Chen had entrusted the first defendant with the job of trying to get the Project because she believed that he could impress FYTA’s representatives with his credentials and experience, and because she felt, quite rightly, that the new Project committee was less than enamoured with her.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In any case, there was no written evidence that the plaintiff had given any indication that it was withdrawing from the Project.  I do not accept the suggestion that the draft termination agreement sent by Mr Leow to Ms Chen was a reflection of the parties’ intentions to dispose with the Cooperation Agreement and the Joint Venture Agreement.  Both Mr Chen<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>Xin and Ms Chen consistently maintained that they did not approve or confirm the plaintiff’s withdrawal from the Project.

</div>  Following quickly from that, the first defendant volunteered his attendance at the URA meeting with Mr Leow on 2 March 2010 to assist in getting the PP for the Project extended by another six months.  The evidence of the first defendant’s architect, Mr Ho, another witness called by the defendants, was that the first defendant was effectively being presented to the URA as the new developer for the Project.  Hence, there can be little doubt that the first defendant’s plan of action to take over this business opportunity was already being executed even before he attempted to resign, on his own evidence, in early March 2010.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The defendants’ argument that the first defendant resigned to ensure good corporate governance is misconceived and does not provide any defence.  The fact remains that he resigned because he was motivated to secure the Project for himself.  He had been specifically cautioned by Mr Leow that working or colluding with the plaintiff and Ms Chen would disqualify him from the tender.

</div>  His resignation was thus a clear move to disassociate himself with the company in order to achieve his purpose.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 I should add that I have analysed this issue of the plaintiff’s resignation on the assumption that he gave notice of his intention to resign in early March 2010, as he claimed he did.  As I have explained above at [57] to [64], I found that the evidence indicated that it was more likely that the first defendant only attempted to resign as a director of the plaintiff in early August 2010.  Since he still remained a director of the plaintiff in the period of April to June 2010, the first defendant’s tendering for the role as the developer for the Project during this period of time was a clear breach of his fiduciary duties.  Even if he had given notice of his resignation before he bid for the Project in April 2010, that would have made no difference given that his resignation was for the purpose of acquiring that corporate opportunity of the plaintiff’s for himself.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 For the above reasons, I find that the first defendant breached his fiduciary duties to the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Did Ms Chen give the first defendant her consent for him to bid for the Project? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In<span class="font-italic"> Viking Airtech</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Foo Teow Keng and another </span>[2008] 1 SLR(R) 225<span class="font-italic">, </span>Judith Prakash J, as she then was, observed that the director had breached his duties in failing to inform other directors of the company’s inability to carry out certain projects, thereby preventing them from “mak[ing] a consensual decision in consultation with him as to what was to be done with those contracts” (at [18]).  The suggestion therefore is that, had the director not acted unilaterally, this would have legitimised his behaviour.  According to the first defendant, he informed Ms Chen of FYTA’s call for a fresh tender and his intention to participate on his own (at [50] above).  Ms Chen then gave him her “blessing” and in fact warned him to be careful in dealing with FYTA as the plaintiff’s efforts had all come to naught.

</div>  Ms Chen’s evidence was that she never gave any consent for the first defendant to pursue the Project on his own.  In fact, she believed that he was trying to secure the Project for the plaintiff.  It was only sometime later that she found out that the first defendant had tendered for the Project on his own.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In my judgment, Ms Chen’s conduct does not indicate that she had consented to the first defendant’s independent pursuit of the Project.  It does not make sense to me why she would have continued to take a backseat in the discussions with FYTA after February 2010 if she was aware of the first defendant’s plans to secure the Project for himself.

</div>  It is more likely that she was ignorant of the true nature of the first defendant’s discussions with FYTA.  In this regard, I find it quite difficult to accept the first defendant’s version that Ms Chen would have so easily agreed to give up on the Project by giving him her “blessing”, when the evidence showed that she was extremely invested in this Project since the middle of 2009.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 That Ms Chen had never consented to the first defendant going ahead on his own is also supported by her email to the first defendant dated 7 September 2010 where she lamented that she had chosen him as her business partner “because your words, your [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] talking and speech really gave me a very good impression, your project is so lovely, your A-Z theory is so nice, that was a really wonderful time when I worked with you for those days … sorry i cant [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] stop my stupid tears and cant [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] write more …”

While Ms Chen was certainly not the perfect witness, she came across as a straightforward and candid person, who answered the questions put to her directly whenever she could do so during the three days when she was being cross-examined.  On the other hand, I had serious difficulty with the evidence of the first defendant.  He was extremely defensive throughout his cross-examination, and was keen to keep repeating the contents of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief at length instead of answering the questions directly.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Some parts of the first defendant’s evidence also showed a lack of internal consistency.  He testified that, as an experienced businessman, he knew from what Ms Chen was telling him in January 2010 about her difficulties with the new Project committee at FYTA, that the plaintiff would not be awarded the role as developer for the Project.

</div>  He did not just call off his arrangement with Ms Chen.  This suggested to me that, in truth, the first defendant was really trying to secure the Project <span class="font-italic">either</span> with the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">or</span> on his own, depending on the ultimate decision of FYTA.  As such, the groundwork that he was doing in terms of legal documentation and financing would not go to waste.  It was with this frame of mind that the first defendant attended the lunch on 24 February 2010 with FYTA’s representatives, invited them to view Lornie 18 and also volunteered his help for the meeting with the URA on 2 March 2010.  It was because he had this mindset that the first defendant’s evidence was that, if things fell through for the plaintiff, “I will opt out, I will not stick around.  I will opt out”.

Mr Leow gave evidence that, in April 2010, when he first discovered that the first defendant was a director and shareholder in the plaintiff, he asked the first defendant to explain his involvement with the plaintiff.  Remarkably, the first defendant’s response was that he had never agreed with Ms Chen to become a director or shareholder of the plaintiff.

</div>
</div>  This was a blatant untruth, even on the first defendant’s own case.  It bears reiteration that Mr Leow was the defendants’ witness.  If it was indeed true that Ms Chen had consented to the first defendant going ahead with the Project on his own, I find it difficult to understand why the first defendant could not have just told Mr Leow that.  Instead, he falsely attempted to disavow any connection with Ms Chen and the plaintiff.       </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In any event, regardless of whether Ms Chen had given her consent to the first defendant’s actions, as a matter of law, a breach of fiduciary duties by a director can only be consented to or ratified by the shareholders of the company.  Generally, all the shareholders must agree, but a resolution passed by a simple majority of the shareholders may be sufficient, unless it amounts to a fraud on the minority or where it would constitute disregard of a minority shareholder’s interest: <span class="font-italic">Cook v Deeks and others</span> [1916] 1 AC 554 (“<span class="font-italic">Cook</span>”).  This point is well illustrated in <span class="font-italic">Cook</span>, where a shareholder resolution was passed to declare that the Toronto Construction Co had no interest in a corporate opportunity, which had been appropriated by the defendants.  This resolution was held to be invalid by the Privy Council because it was passed by way of the voting power of the three defendants.  The Court observed that the defendants had sought to make a present of the company’s property to themselves and the resolution amounted to oppression of the remaining 25% minority shareholder (at 564).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 An informal assent of all the shareholders may be sufficient to effectively ratify a director’s breach of his fiduciary duties.  The proprietary interests of shareholders entitle them as a general body to be regarded as the company when questions of the duties of directors arise.  If, as a general body, they authorise or ratify a particular action of the directors, there can be no challenge to the validity of what the directors have done: <span class="font-italic">Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd v Lim Eng Hock Peter and others and other appeals </span>[2013] 1 SLR 374 at [45] citing Street CJ in <span class="font-italic">Kinsela v Russell Kinsela Pty Ltd (in liq) </span>(1986) 4 NSWLR 722 at 730.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Consistent with this, the Court of Appeal has held that directors may be released from their obligations to the company by unanimous or, at the very least, majority agreement of the shareholders to “forgive and approve” their conduct, provided of course there is full disclosure of the relevant facts: <span class="font-italic">Ho Kang Peng v Scintronix Corp Ltd (formerly known as TTL Holdings Ltd)</span> [2014] 3 SLR 329 at [59] citing <span class="font-italic">Bamford v Bamford</span> [1970] Ch 212 at 238B.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Here, there was no resolution passed by the shareholders of the plaintiff approving the first defendant’s intended pursuit of the Project for himself.  It is also not disputed that Mr Yang, who was known to the first defendant, became a shareholder of the plaintiff in January 2010, first holding 50,000 shares, and then in February 2010, holding 100,000 shares.  In total, he paid S$100,000 for his 10% shareholding in the company.  Mr Yang was also a director of the plaintiff at the material time after he became a shareholder.

</div>
</div> There was no evidence before me that Mr Yang had consented to, or was even aware of, the actions of the first defendant in pursuing the plaintiff’s corporate opportunity on his own.  At the end of the day, it is for the defendants to show to the court’s satisfaction that the shareholders had either consented to or validly ratified the first defendant’s breach of fiduciary duties (<span class="font-italic">Walter Woon</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [9.20]).  This burden has not been discharged. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Was there a binding contract between the plaintiff and FYTA to develop the Project and did the first defendant induce a breach of that contract? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 I now consider whether the first defendant had procured FYTA to act in breach of a binding contact between the plaintiff and FYTA and is thus liable to the plaintiff for damages for the tort of inducement of breach of contract.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The elements for establishing this tort are as follows (<span class="font-italic">Tribune Investment Trust Inc v Soosan Trading Co Ltd</span> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 407 at [17]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the procurer must have acted with the requisite knowledge of the existence of the contract; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the procurer had the intention, determined objectively, to interfere with the performance of the contract; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the contract in question must be shown to be a valid one.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 I should add at this juncture that the first defendant’s liability for breach of his fiduciary duties as a director of the plaintiff is not contingent on the legal enforceability of any contract between FYTA and the plaintiff.  It is clear that the requirement that the plaintiff must have lost a maturing business opportunity does not require the plaintiff to show that it had a legally enforceable agreement for it to become the developer for the Project. It is enough that the plaintiff was negotiating a maturing business opportunity (<span class="font-italic">Canadian Aero Service</span> at 382).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The plaintiff’s case that there was a binding contract between it and FYTA rests on the court finding that there was an oral agreement for the plaintiff to develop the Project on terms that were evidenced by various documents.  In my judgment, the only documents that would be relevant to such an argument must be those that were signed by the parties or sent by one party to the other.  In this regard, the Cooperation Agreement and the Joint Venture Agreement are the most relevant to the plaintiff’s case.  Documents such as the minutes of FYTA, which are internal and were never communicated to the counterparty, would be irrelevant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The Cooperation Agreement was an agreement between THC and FYTA, which did not mention the plaintiff.  At the time it was made, it was not even contemplated that the plaintiff would have any role in the Project.  As such, while it does reflect an intention by FYTA to work with THC in relation to the Project, it cannot evidence any contract between the plaintiff and FYTA.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 As for the Joint Venture Agreement, it is undisputed that this was never executed by all the intended parties to the agreement.  In the first place, there were four trustees which held the land in question for the benefit of FYTA.  Only three of them were named as intended parties in the Joint Venture Agreement.  The plaintiff and two of the three named trustees did not execute the Joint Venture Agreement.  Under FYTA’s constitution, the trustees were empowered to deal with matters relating to the land, which would include the Joint Venture Agreement to develop the Project.  Given this, I find that the Joint Venture Agreement was incomplete in the sense that there was, in law, no agreement at all.  The necessary persons were not parties to and had not executed the agreement.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 While this in itself does not suggest that there can be no binding oral contract between the parties on the essential terms of the joint venture, the fact that parties were negotiating the terms of the revised JVA suggests that parties intended to record the terms of their eventual agreement in written form, and an enforceable legal relationship would be created only upon the execution of the written agreement.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 In my view, when assessed holistically, the parties’ conduct suggests that this was a joint venture arrangement that was still being finalised, with many terms yet to be agreed and subject to further negotiations.

</div>  As already mentioned, there were several irregularities in the execution of the Joint Venture Agreement and even the plaintiff anticipated that a more detailed and formalised agreement would follow.  This was the reason Ms Ng was instructed by Ms Chen and the first defendant to come up with revised drafts of the Joint Venture Agreement.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 The plaintiff points out that the draft termination agreement sent by Mr Leow to Ms Chen on 27 March 2010 states in its preamble, amongst other things, that FYTA and the plaintiff had entered into an agreement dated 23 September 2009 to develop the Project, which is a reference to the Joint Venture Agreement.

</div>  However, as I have mentioned earlier, I find that the Joint Venture Agreement was not a valid contract in the first place.  The statements in the draft termination agreement cannot in law change that fact.  In any event, the plaintiff’s pleaded case is not that the Joint Venture Agreement constitutes the contract between the plaintiff and FYTA, but only that it evidences the terms of agreement that were orally agreed.

Instead, the evidence showed that Mr Leow, who was now chairman of the Project committee, and the person who would recommend to FYTA whether to move ahead with the Project with the plaintiff, had decided not long after he took over that the plaintiff was insufficiently experienced to be able to develop the Project.  I do not find that there was anything that the first defendant did which caused Mr Leow to form this view of the plaintiff.  In fact, by the time the first defendant first met Mr Leow at the lunch meeting on 24 February 2010, it appears to me that Mr Leow had more or less made up his mind about the plaintiff.  That is why, barely a week later, he had invited the first defendant to the meeting with the URA on 2 March 2010.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Did the plaintiff and the first defendant enter into the profit-sharing agreement? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 This issue arises from a meeting held on 25 July 2010 between FYTA’s representatives (Messrs Leow, Lew, Ho and Chan), the first defendant, Ms Chen and another representative of the plaintiff, Ms Laska, as well as Mr Goh Huck Heng (“Mr Goh”), who was a friend of Ms Chen.  By that time, the Project had already been awarded to the first defendant even though the formal documentation had not yet been executed between FYTA and the defendants.  Having been informed of this, the plaintiff sought a sum of compensation during the meeting.  According to the plaintiff, the first defendant conceded that he had been introduced to the Project through his association with the plaintiff.

</div>
</div>  These will be dealt with in turn. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 A claim for knowing receipt concerns the liability of a person who has received assets, which is subject to a trust, with the requisite level of awareness or knowledge that the assets in question are trust assets.  Such a person would be a constructive trustee of the assets he has received and would be under a duty to immediately restore the assets to the beneficiary. The well-known requirements of knowing receipt are threefold and were set out by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">George Raymond Zage III </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Ho Chi Kwong</span> <span class="font-italic">and another</span> [2010] 2 SLR 589 at [23] (“<span class="font-italic">George Raymond Zage III</span>”): </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) there is a disposal of the plaintiff’s assets in breach of fiduciary duty;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) there is beneficial receipt by the defendant of assets which are traceable as representing the assets of the plaintiff; and </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) there is knowledge that the assets received are traceable to a breach of fiduciary duty and this state of knowledge makes it unconscionable for the defendant to retain the benefit of the receipt (endorsing the test in <span class="font-italic">Bank of Credit and Commerce International (Overseas) Ltd v Akindele </span>[2001] Ch 437). </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 I first deal with the question of whether there has been a disposal of the plaintiff’s assets in breach of fiduciary duty.  In this regard, it has been held by Lawrence Collins J in <span class="font-italic">CMS Dolphin Ltd v Simonet</span> [2001] 2 BCLC 704 at [96]) (“<span class="font-italic">CMS Dolphin</span>”) that:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In my judgment the underlying basis of the liability of a director who exploits after his resignation a maturing business opportunity of the company is that <span class="font-italic">the opportunity is to be treated as if it were property of the company in relation to which the director had fiduciary duties.  By seeking to exploit the opportunity after resignation he is appropriating for himself that property.</span>  He is just as accountable as a trustee who retires without properly accounting for trust property.  In the case of a director he becomes a constructive trustee of the fruits of his abuse of the company’s property, which he has acquired in circumstances where he knowingly had a conflict of interest, and exploited it by resigning from the company. [emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The principle set out above in <span class="font-italic">CMS Dolphin</span> has been endorsed by Woo Bih Li J in <span class="font-italic">Swiss Butchery Pte Ltd v Huber Ernst</span> <span class="font-italic">and others and another suit</span> [2010] 3 SLR 813 at [11] (“<span class="font-italic">Swiss Butchery Pte Ltd</span>”).  There can be no doubt as to the correctness of this principle insofar as it describes the basis of why the errant director is liable to account for trust assets.  The question, though, is whether the passage from <span class="font-italic">CMS Dolphin</span> quoted above goes so far as to decide that maturing business opportunities <span class="font-italic">are the company’s </span><span class="font-italic">assets</span> to determine if there is accessory liability in knowing receipt.        </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The issue of whether maturing business opportunities would be regarded as trust assets for the purposes of knowing receipt was considered by Lewison J in <span class="font-italic">Ultraframe (UK) Ltd v Fielding &amp; o</span><span class="font-italic">thers</span> [2005] EWHC 1638 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">Ultraframe</span>”).  The judge there found that a corporate opportunity “is to be treated as the property of the company (in the sense of an intangible asset) and hence is treated for this purpose as trust property” (at [1355(iii)]).  At [1491] of <span class="font-italic">Ultraframe</span>, the judge stated:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In <span class="font-italic">Satnam Investments Ltd v Dunlop Heywood</span> [1999] 3 All ER 652 the Court of Appeal were prepared to assume that confidential information could count as trust property.  Thus in the ‘corporate opportunity’ cases, a director who diverts a corporate opportunity away from the company and towards himself holds any resulting chose in action (e.g. a contract enabling him to exploit that opportunity) on trust for the company, provided that there is a sufficient nexus between the property acquired and the breach of duty.  It is possible that the corporate opportunity itself may be regarded as trust property, in the sense of being an intangible asset of the company.  Even then, there may be difficulties in tracing the information or opportunity into the resulting chose in action for the purposes of a proprietary remedy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Based on the principles set out above, in my judgment, although it was uncertain whether FYTA would ever appoint the plaintiff to be the developer of the Project, I am prepared to accept that this business opportunity was an asset of the plaintiff.  The fact that there was no binding contract between the plaintiff and FYTA in relation to the development of the Project does not detract from this conclusion.  The first defendant had fiduciary duties in respect of this opportunity.  There was a disposal of this asset of the plaintiff’s in that the first defendant had appropriated the opportunity and tendered for the Project for himself, in breach of his fiduciary duty.  He thus held the fruits of the appropriation of this asset on constructive trust for the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 The next question is whether there was a beneficial receipt of the plaintiff’s assets by the second defendant.  This is key to a finding of liability for knowing receipt – receipt of traceable trust assets.  In this regard, the second defendant was incorporated by the first defendant in May 2010 as the corporate vehicle to carry out the development of the Project.  Hence, the second defendant carried out the role which the plaintiff would have done if the plaintiff had been awarded the contract to develop the Project.  However, while the second defendant may have benefited in this sense, I am of the view that the second defendant cannot be said to have been in beneficial receipt of trust assets belonging to the plaintiff.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 All the plaintiff had was a chance or opportunity to have participated as a developer for the Project.  While this opportunity was appropriated by the first defendant when he tendered for the Project, the second defendant cannot be said to have received that same opportunity.  Instead, the second defendant entered into a joint venture agreement with, amongst others, FYTA in October 2010 and was appointed as the developer for the Project.  By doing so, the second defendant acquired a bundle of contractual rights that were enforceable against FYTA.  But, these rights are conceptually quite different from the opportunity that the plaintiff had.  It cannot be equated with that opportunity.  Neither can it be said that the second defendant’s contractual rights against FYTA are traceable to the opportunity that the plaintiff had in the period from September 2009 to April 2010.  Rather, the rights spring from the contract between the second defendant and FYTA.  In my judgment, I find that the plaintiff has not shown that the second defendant received a trust asset for the purpose of the claim in knowing receipt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 I should add that the allocation of a certain number of units in the residential development upon its completion to the second defendant was also not part of the corporate opportunity belonging to the plaintiff.  Rather, it was a consequence of being the Project’s developer.  It is property held by the second defendant which is a product of the first defendant’s breach of fiduciary duty, but it is not traceable from the plaintiff or the first defendant to the second defendant.  I draw support for this view from the English Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">Satnam Investments Ltd v Dunlop Heywood</span> [1999] 3 All ER 652 where it was held that, even if one was to assume that confidential information and consequential corporate opportunities are assets for the purposes of a claim in knowing receipt, one cannot trace such information and opportunities into real property acquired by a third party using such information and opportunities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 For the above reasons, I find that the plaintiff has not made out its claim against the second defendant for knowing receipt.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Was there dishonest assistance by the second defendant? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 The plaintiff also claims that the second defendant is liable to it in dishonest assistance.  Such a claim would be available against a person who has dishonestly assisted in the misapplication of trust property.  By doing so, he becomes liable <span class="font-italic">as a constructive trustee</span>.  He is not an actual trustee like a knowing recipient, but becomes subject to the same liabilities as if he was one, including having to account for any profits from his wrongdoing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 The Court in <span class="font-italic">George Raymond Zage III </span>provided guidance on the elements of dishonest assistance (at [20]).  There must be a subsisting trust which is breached, a third party who renders assistance towards that breach and a finding that this assistance was dishonest.  On the evidence, I find that the first defendant had breached his fiduciary duties and became a constructive trustee for the plaintiff in respect of the fruits of this opportunity to participate in the Project (see [123]).  By retaining the Project for himself and the second defendant, he breached this trust.  The issue is whether the second defendant had dishonestly assisted the first defendant’s breach.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 I first considered whether there could have been any assistance by the second defendant.  The first defendant successfully tendered for the Project, in breach of his director’s duties, in May 2010.  However, the second defendant was only incorporated after the successful tender.  What assistance then could the second defendant have rendered to the first defendant in the breach of his duties?  This was addressed by Lord Millett in <span class="font-italic">Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley and others</span> [2002] 2 All ER 377 at [107] where he set out the scope of liability under dishonest assistance: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The cause of action is concerned with attributing liability for misdirected funds. Liability is not restricted to the person whose breach of trust or fiduciary duty caused their original diversion. His liability is strict. Nor is it limited to those who assist him in the original breach. It extends to everyone who consciously assists in the <span class="font-italic">continuing diversion</span> of the money. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 I find that it is immaterial that the opportunity to participate as developer of the Project had already been lost by the plaintiff before the time of the second defendant’s incorporation.  The fact remains that the second defendant assisted the first defendant in his breach of trust by subsequently carrying out the development of the Project, which was for the benefit of, amongst others, the first defendant.  Put another way, it is with the second defendant’s assistance that the first defendant is able to enjoy the fruits of his appropriation of the plaintiff’s asset.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Secondly, to show dishonesty, one would require a finding that the second defendant had (<span class="font-italic">George Ra</span><span class="font-italic">ymond Zage III</span> at [22]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">such knowledge of the irregular shortcomings of the transaction that ordinary honest people would consider it to be a breach of standards of honest conduct if he failed to adequately query them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Besides incorporating the company, the first defendant was also one of the second defendant’s directors.  Other directors included his brother and his daughter.

</div>  In the circumstances, it is appropriate that his knowledge of his breach of director’s duties and the consequences therein be imputed to the second defendant.

</div>  In the usual case, the claimant must elect the relief it is seeking from the fiduciary that has breached its duties (see John McGhee <span class="font-italic">et al</span>, <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 33rd Ed, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span>”) at [7-052]).  In <span class="font-italic">Swiss Butchery</span> (referred to at [121]), Woo J found that the defendants had breached their fiduciary duties for appropriating the plaintiff company’s business opportunity, and ordered damages to be assessed or an account of profit (at [182]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 On the facts of this case, however, I find that the plaintiff has no realistic claim for equitable compensation.  The plaintiff cannot be compensated for its loss when it appears, from the facts, that it would have suffered no loss.  This is because I have found that the plaintiff would probably not have been awarded the contract by FYTA in any event given Mr Leow’s antipathy towards Ms Chen from February 2010 onwards.  By the time the first defendant was invited by Mr Leow to tender for the Project, the plaintiff’s chances of being able to participate as developer of the Project had all but evaporated.  That being the case, the plaintiff is effectively left to its remedy of an account of profits from the first defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 In this regard, the observations of Belinda Ang Saw Ean J in <span class="font-italic">Dayco Products Singapore Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Ong Cheng Aik</span> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 318 are apposite.  After finding the defendant there had breached his fiduciary duty as a director by acting in conflict of interest, the judge went on to state at [34]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The liability to account arises from the fiduciary’s breach of duty.  Having improperly profited or gained from his position, the defendant has to account to the plaintiff for the profits or gains he has obtained.  It is no defence that the plaintiff was unlikely or unable to make the profits for which an account is to be taken.  It also does not depend upon detriment to the plaintiff.  Gibbs J in <span class="font-italic">Consul Development Pty Limited v DPC Estates Pty Limited</span> (1975) 132 CLR 373 at 394 stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where the rule applies, the liability of the person in a fiduciary position does not depend on the fact that the person to whom the duty is owed has suffered an injury or loss.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 For completeness, I make an observation on the plaintiff’s claim for a 50% share of the profit made by the first defendant as mentioned in its closing submissions.  <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">It seems to me that the plaintiff would be entitled to an account for </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">all</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> the profits made by the first defendant</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> in relation to the development of the Project.  The purpose of a disgorgement of profits is not to compensate the plaintiff but to ensure that the fiduciary does not profit from his breach of duty (</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">United Pan-Europe Communications NV v Deutsche Bank AG</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> [2000] 2 BCLC 461 at [46] – [47]).  Relief by way of an account of profits “is measured by the gain made by the wrongdoer irrespective of whether the claimant has suffered </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">a corresponding loss” (</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Snell’s Equity</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> at [20-039]).  The fact that the plaintiff might receive an unexpected windfall is therefore immaterial.  This was accepted by the Court of Appeal in </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Mona Computer Systems (S) Pte Ltd v Singaravelu Murugan</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> [2014] 1 SLR 847 at [17] where Chao Hick Tin JA</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, as he then was, stated: </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he fiduciary should not be allowed to retain any of the profit derived from his breach of duty. A deduction for what the company would have had to pay the defendant had he dutifully secured the benefits for the company is out of place given the gains-based basis for disgorgement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Applying this reasoning, the fact that the plaintiff would have shared half of its profits with the first defendant if it had successfully acquired the Project has no bearing on the relief claimable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 As for the second defendant, I have found that it is liable as a constructive trustee to the plaintiff for dishonest assistance of the first defendant’s breach of fiduciary duties.  The second defendant's liability “duplicates the liability of the trustee whose breach of trust [it] assisted” (Charles Mitchell, <span class="font-italic">Constructive and Resulting Trusts</span> (Hart Publishing, 2009) at p 150).  In such circumstances, like the first defendant, the second defendant must disgorge its profits from its involvement in the Project.  The second defendant must account to the plaintiff for its profits.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Given that I have made this order for an account of profits against the second defendant, I do not have to consider the vexed question of whether the account of profits by the first defendant should also encompass the profits of the second defendant.  In <span class="font-italic">CMS Dolphin</span>, Lawrence Collins J had no trouble finding that the errant director was required to account for the profit made by the corporate vehicle that had been set up by him to exploit the business opportunity.  It was stated at [104] of the judgment:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Nor in my judgment does it make a difference whether the business is taken up by the corporate vehicle directly, or is first taken up by the directors and then transferred to a company.  <span class="font-italic">Imperial Mercantile Credit Association v Coleman</span> and <span class="font-italic">Cook v Deeks</span> show that a director who places the benefit of the business opportunities in a partnership or a company will be liable for the whole profit, and also make it clear that a director who is the active agent in a breach of fiduciary duty cannot evade responsibility by transferring the benefit to others.  I do not consider that the liability of the directors in <span class="font-italic">Cook v Deeks</span> would have been in any way different if they had procured their new company to enter into the contract directly, rather than (as they did) enter into it themselves and then transfer the benefit of the contract to a new company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">However, this portion of the judgment in <span class="font-italic">CMS Dolphin</span> has been doubted in later decisions in England, such as in <span class="font-italic">Ultraframe</span> at [1550] – [1576], where Lewison J appeared to prefer the orthodox view that a fiduciary should only be liable to account for his own gains, and not that of a third party company in which the fiduciary owns shares, save where it can be shown that the company is the alter ego of the fiduciary, where it might then be appropriate to pierce the corporate veil.  Since parties have not made any submissions on this point, I will say no more about it.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 For the reasons above, I allow the plaintiff’s claim against the defendants to the extent set out in this judgment.
