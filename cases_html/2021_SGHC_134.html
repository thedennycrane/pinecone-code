The ultimate question was whether there was “sufficient material” before the court to warrant the exercise of its discretion under O 45 r 6(2). The exercise of this discretion would necessarily turn on the precise facts of each case. In most cases, evidence demonstrating “some form of contumelious conduct” would likely suffice, whereas a one-off failure to comply with an order for the payment of money was unlikely to suffice. If the person having to comply with the order had not manifested <span class="font-italic">any</span> intention to comply with the order, the court should be slow to accede to any request for an extended timeframe for compliance as this might have the unintended effect of further delaying or frustrating the applicant’s attempt to enforce the order (<span class="font-italic">Mok</span><span class="font-italic"> Kah Hong </span>at [46]–[47]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 However, the court would also take into account any potential prejudice which might be occasioned to the person having to comply with the order.

A court order had been made dividing the parties’ matrimonial assets between them. The wife applied for an order specifying the timeframe within which the husband had to pay her a sum of money to which she was entitled. The Court of Appeal was satisfied that there was sufficient material to warrant the exercise of its discretion under O 45 r 6(2) because the husband had already breached various other court orders and had been “extremely uncooperative” in complying with those orders. Further, the husband had filed an application to stay the wife’s enforcement proceedings and to vary the lump sum maintenance order that had been made, in spite of the fact that the Court of Appeal had already affirmed the maintenance order in the substantive appeal. In these circumstances, the Court of Appeal found that the husband’s attempt to vary the lump sum maintenance order was “no more than a disingenuous attempt to frustrate the wife’s enforcement proceedings by way of relitigating the issues already decided in the substantive appeal” (<span class="font-italic">Mok</span><span class="font-italic"> Kah Hong </span>at [52]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The principles set out in <span class="font-italic">Mok</span><span class="font-italic"> Kah Hong </span>were subsequently applied in <span class="font-italic">Viking Engineering Pte Ltd v Feen, </span><span class="font-italic">Bjornar and others </span>[2019] SGHC 158 (“<span class="font-italic">Viking Engineering</span>”).

Instead of providing the Liquidators with the soft copies of the requested documents, the Respondents chose to generate and print hard copies of each and every document. This demonstrated the Respondents’ lack of good faith in cooperating with the Liquidators towards the fulfilment of the October 2020 Orders, and pointed towards the Respondents’ (and Yangbum’s) ultimate objective of stifling the liquidation of the Companies.

The Liquidators’ first request for the Companies’ books and assets was made to the Respondents on 31 March 2020.

Yangbum had already filed proofs of debt amounting to $10.8m. The Liquidators’ key tasks were to adjudicate Yangbum’s proofs of debt and to value the fixed assets of the Companies for the purpose of liquidating them. It was unclear how the documents sought by the Liquidators related to these key tasks.

The Respondents did not have possession, custody or power over the Companies’ records, which were instead in Yangbum’s possession. This was because the administrative, human resource and book-keeping functions of the Companies were outsourced to Yangbum and entirely undertaken by Yangbum employees. In particular, although Ms Chin and Mr Su (the second and third respondents) were involved in maintaining the Companies’ financial and human resource records, this work was done purely in their capacities as employees of Yangbum. They were never employees of the Companies and they could access the Companies’ books and assets only to the extent necessary to carry out Yangbum’s instructions. Yangbum made clear that it would release these records directly to the Liquidators and designated Mr Su to act as its liaison in this respect. Further, notwithstanding that it was a non-party to the October 2020 Orders, Yangbum had consistently endeavoured to comply with the Liquidators’ requests by preparing and delivering a large proportion of the documents specified in the October 2020 Orders to the Liquidators, at least in hard copy form, on multiple occasions. Yangbum also indicated that further documents were forthcoming and was prepared to continue to assist in the preparation and delivery of the Companies’ records. As such, there was no relevant contumelious conduct that would warrant granting the Liquidators’ applications.

According to the Respondents, a timeframe of five days would be “unrealistic and oppressive” to the Respondents and Yangbum. The Liquidators sought a large volume of documents, many of which had not yet been prepared by the Respondents or were otherwise not readily available. Further, Yangbum was operating with seriously diminished manpower due to business continuity measures arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the Respondents contended that a timeframe of five days would occasion significant prejudice to, and cause administrative and logistical difficulties for, the Respondents and Yangbum.

</div> No appeal was filed against the October 2020 Orders. The present proceedings were, therefore, not the appropriate forum to relitigate the issues raised in the s 313(5) Applications. Instead, the issue to be determined in the present proceedings was whether there was “sufficient material” before me to warrant the exercise of my discretion to make the orders sought by the Liquidators under O 45 r 6(2).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 After having considered the submissions made by both parties, I was of the view that there was indeed sufficient material to warrant the making of orders under O 45 r 6(2) fixing a time for the Respondents to comply with the October 2020 Orders. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The clear terms of the October 2020 Orders required the Respondents to deliver up and surrender <span class="font-italic">all</span> monies, property, books, papers and/or other documents belonging and/or relating to each of the Companies, which were in their possession, custody or power, to the Liquidators. It was not disputed that the Respondents had not yet done so, despite repeated requests by the Liquidators. While the Respondents could be said to have manifested some intention to comply with the October 2020 Orders by delivering many documents to the Liquidators, albeit in hard copy form, the Respondents’ inexplicable refusal to provide soft copies of these documents (as I had ordered them to do in the October 2020 Orders) indicated their unwillingness to comply with the terms of the October 2020 Orders and disclosed their failure to cooperate with the Liquidators. The haphazard, piecemeal and incomplete manner in which the Respondents delivered these documents further supports this finding.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In addition, it appeared that the Respondents were attempting to relitigate points in these proceedings that had already been resolved in the Liquidators’ favour when I made the October 2020 Orders. In particular, the Respondents argued that they did not have possession, custody or power over the Companies’ books and assets as Ms Chin and Mr Su performed financial and human resource work for the Companies purely in their capacities as employees of Yangbum (see [39] above). However, this argument had already been raised, unsuccessfully, by counsel for the Respondents at the hearing on 2 October 2020.

I was unable to accept these submissions. Section 313(5) of the Companies Act provided a statutory mechanism for liquidators to obtain the books and assets of a company in liquidation. Such books and assets are necessary for liquidators to discharge their duties. As the requirements of s 313(5) had been satisfied, I made the October 2020 Orders to give effect to this statutory mechanism. The Respondents could not now argue that the books and assets sought were unrelated to the Liquidators’ tasks or that the Liquidators’ applications were made for an extraneous purpose. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Bearing in mind the guidance set out in <span class="font-italic">Mok</span><span class="font-italic"> Kah Hong </span>and <span class="font-italic">Viking Engineering</span>, I found that there was evidence of contumelious conduct on the part of the Respondents. I, therefore, exercised my discretion to make an order under O 45 r 6(2) of the ROC fixing a time for the Respondents to comply with the October 2020 Orders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 At this point, I note that the possibility of fixing a time for compliance with the October 2020 Orders was raised by counsel for the Liquidators at the hearing of the s 313(5) Applications on 2 October 2020. Counsel for the Respondents had justifiably resisted this on the ground that the Liquidators had not sought the imposition of a timeframe in the s 313(5) Applications. Counsel for the Respondents had further remarked that if the Respondents failed to comply with the October 2020 Orders, the Liquidators would “have their rights”.

However, I agreed with the Liquidators’ submission that acceding to the Respondents’ request for an extended timeframe for compliance might have the unintended effect of further delaying their attempts to enforce the October 2020 Orders.

This preliminary issue required the determination of the operative date of the IRDA and the date OS 1061 was filed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 As explained at the Second Reading of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Bill (Bill No 32/2018), the IRDA was enacted to consolidate all statutory provisions relating to corporate and personal insolvency and debt restructuring, which were previously found in the Companies Act and the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed), into a single Act. This was to enhance the clarity, certainty and accessibility of these areas of law (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(1 October 2018) vol 94 (Edwin Tong Chun Fai, Senior Minister of State for Law, for the Minister for Law). Accordingly, the relevant provisions dealing with corporate insolvency and restructuring under the Companies Act, the Bankruptcy Act and other consequential and related statutory provisions were repealed and re-enacted under the IRDA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 OS 1061 was filed on 21 October 2020, after the IRDA came into force on 30 July 2020. Thus, Yangbum and Mr Loong’s application for the removal of the Liquidators should have been made under s 174 of the IRDA. In Yangbum and Mr Loong’s submissions, they explained that s 302 of the Companies Act was applicable because the <span class="font-italic">liquidation</span> of the Companies was commenced before 30 July 2020.

</div>
</div> I disagreed with this reasoning. The relevant time for determining whether the Companies Act or the IRDA applied was the date of the <span class="font-italic">application</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 21 October 2020. By this date, s 302 of the Companies Act had already been repealed and s 174 of the IRDA had come into force. Hence, OS 1061 should have been made under s 174 of the IRDA, instead of s 302 of the Companies Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 As s 174 of the IRDA is identical to s 302 of the Companies Act, the same principles regarding standing applied under both provisions. However, I shall refer to s 174 of the IRDA in explaining my findings and decision as the application should rightly have been made under this provision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Section 174 of the IRDA (formerly s 302 of the Companies Act) provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Removal of liquidator</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">174.</span> The Court may, on cause shown, remove a liquidator and appoint another liquidator.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The plain text of s 174 did not place any restrictions on who could apply for the removal of a liquidator. However, in my view, that did not mean that anyone and everyone who was able to show cause would have standing to bring an application under s 174. In the absence of any decisions by the Singapore courts expressly addressing this point, I found the Privy Council’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Deloitte &amp; </span><span class="font-italic">Touche AG v Johnson and another </span>[1999] 1 WLR 1605 (“<span class="font-italic">Deloitte</span>”) instructive. Lord Millett, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, explained that the question of standing required the court to consider two distinct issues. Lord Millett’s remarks (at 1611) are worth setting out in full: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[T]wo different kinds of case must be distinguished when considering the question of a party's standing to make an application to the court. The first occurs when the court is asked to exercise a power conferred on it by statute. In such a case the court must examine the statute to see whether it identifies the category of person who may make the application. This goes to the jurisdiction of the court, for the court has no jurisdiction to exercise a statutory power except on the application of a person qualified by the statute to make it. The second is more general. <span class="font-italic">Where the court is asked to exercise a statutory power or its inherent jurisdiction, it will act only on the application of a party with a sufficient interest to make it. This is not a matter of jurisdiction. It is a matter of judicial restraint.</span> Orders made by the court are coercive. Every order of the court affects the freedom of action of the party against whom it is made and sometimes (as in the present case) of other parties as well. <span class="font-italic">It is, therefore, incumbent on the court to consider not only whether it has jurisdiction to make the order but whether the applicant is a proper person to invoke the jurisdiction.</span><span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Hence, notwithstanding that s 174 did not specifically identify the category of persons who could apply for the removal of a liquidator, the court would nevertheless “act only on the application of a party with a sufficient interest” to make the application, as a matter of “judicial restraint”.      <span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 <span class="font-italic">Deloitte </span>was decided based on s 106(1) of the Cayman Islands’ Companies Law (1995 Revision), the wording of which was substantially similar to s 174 of the IRDA. The Privy Council held that s 106(1) did not limit the category of persons who could make the application, but that the plaintiff nevertheless had to have a “legitimate interest” in the relief sought (at 1611). On the facts of <span class="font-italic">Deloitte</span>, which concerned the liquidation of an insolvent company, the Privy Council found (at 1611) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The only persons who could have any legitimate interest of their own in having the liquidators removed from office as liquidators are <span class="font-italic">the persons entitled to participate in the ultimate distribution of the company’s assets</span>, that is to say the creditors. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Therefore, in my view, the applicable test for determining whether an applicant had standing to apply for the removal of a liquidator under s 174 of the IRDA was whether the applicant had a <span class="font-italic">legitimate interest</span> in the removal of the liquidator. In ascertaining whether an applicant had such a legitimate interest, the court would consider whether he was entitled to participate in the ultimate distribution of the liquidated company’s assets.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The parties’ submissions</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) Yangbum and Mr Loong’s submissions</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Yangbum and Mr Loong submitted that they both had standing to apply for the removal of the Liquidators under s 174 of the IRDA.

</div> In particular, the Liquidators submitted that the phrase “any person alleged to be a contributory” could not include a self-proclaimed contributory who alleged himself to be a contributory. If that were the case, any person could simply claim to be a “contributory” and become entitled to participate in the ultimate distribution of the company’s assets. Instead, the Liquidators submitted that the phrase referred to persons who were placed on the provisional list of contributories by the liquidator or the court, but whose status was disputed.

</div> As for the phrase “a person liable to contribute to the assets of the company in the event of its being wound up”, the Liquidators argued that this referred to: persons who were expressly included by statute as being liable to contribute, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, past and present members of the company (pursuant to s 250(1) of the Companies Act (now s 121(1) of the IRDA)); past and present directors whose liability was unlimited (pursuant to s 250(2) of the Companies Act (now s 121(2) of the IRDA)); the personal representative of a deceased contributory (pursuant to s 252(1) of the Companies Act (now s 123(1) of the IRDA)); and the trustee of a contributory who has become bankrupt (pursuant to s 252(2) of the Companies Act (now s 123(2) of the IRDA)).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Further, the Privy Council’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Deloitte</span> did not go so far as to support such a restrictive rule. The issue before the Privy Council in <span class="font-italic">Deloitte </span>was whether a debtor of a company in insolvent liquidation, who was neither a creditor nor a contributory of the company, could apply for the removal of a liquidator (at 1607). The Privy Council answered this question in the negative. Notwithstanding Lord Millett’s observation that the English courts had “consistently regarded the creditors (in the case of an insolvent liquidation) and the contributories (in the case of a solvent liquidation) as the proper persons to make the application, being the only persons interested in the liquidation” (at 1610), Lord Millett then went on to state that the threshold for an applicant to be regarded as a proper person to invoke the jurisdiction of the court was whether the applicant had “a <span class="font-italic">legitimate interest</span> in the relief sought” [emphasis added] (at 1611). As the applicant in <span class="font-italic">Deloitte</span> was “not merely a stranger to the liquidation”, but (as a debtor) had interests <span class="font-italic">adverse</span> to the liquidation and the interests of the creditors, the Privy Council held that the applicant lacked standing. In my view, the Privy Council’s reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Deloitte </span>did not preclude a court from finding, in the appropriate circumstances, that a creditor of a company in solvent liquidation had a legitimate interest in the removal of a liquidator. <span class="font-italic"> </span> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 <span class="font-italic">Petroships</span> also did not support the restrictive approach to standing proposed by the Liquidators. In <span class="font-italic">Petroships</span>, Coomaraswamy J held that a solvent company was liquidated <span class="font-italic">primarily </span>in the members’ interest, whereas an insolvent company was liquidated <span class="font-italic">primarily </span>in the creditors’ interest. Hence, the court would give predominant weight to the members’ wishes in ascertaining the real, honest and substantial interest of a solvent liquidation, while giving predominant weight to the creditors’ interest in an insolvent liquidation (<span class="font-italic">Petroships</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [132]–[135]). However, Coomaraswamy J did not state that <span class="font-italic">only </span>the members of a solvent company could have an interest in its liquidation. Further, although Coomaraswamy J said that the creditors had “no real interest” in a solvent liquidation because it was obligatory to commence and conduct a solvent liquidation on the basis that the creditors would be paid in full and within one year (under s 293(1) of the Companies Act, now s 163(1) of the IRDA), it should be borne in mind that Coomaraswamy J was considering the meaning of the phrase “interest of the liquidation”. I agreed entirely with Coomaraswamy J’s statement of the applicable principles in that context and applied them in considering whether Yangbum and Mr Loong had succeeded in showing cause for the removal of the Liquidators (see [101] below). However, in <span class="font-italic">Petroships</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Coomaraswamy J was not required to specifically consider what it meant for an applicant to have a “legitimate interest” for the purposes of <span class="font-italic">standing</span>. Therefore, in my view, <span class="font-italic">Petroships</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was not authority for the proposition that the creditors of a solvent company could not have any legitimate interest in the removal of the liquidators, and thus could have no standing to bring an application under s 174 of the IRDA.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Having said this, I did not think that <span class="font-italic">Yap Jeffery Henry </span>supported Yangbum and Mr Loong’s position. In <span class="font-italic">Yap Jeffery Henry</span>, Judith Prakash J (as she then was) recognised the possibility of a creditor applying for the removal of a liquidator in a voluntary liquidation. There, the creditors of a company in voluntary liquidation had applied for the removal of the liquidator. The liquidator then took out his own application for an order permitting him to resign from the office of liquidator, and this was granted. Prakash J held that if the liquidator had not resigned, a creditor could apply for his removal under s 302 of the Companies Act (now s 174 of the IRDA) (<span class="font-italic">Yap Jeffery Henry </span>at [20]). Indeed, on the facts, Prakash J would have acceded to the creditors’ application for the removal of the liquidator if he had not resigned (<span class="font-italic">Yap Jeffery Henry </span>at [36]). However, it appeared that <span class="font-italic">Yap Jeffery Henry </span>concerned a <span class="font-italic">creditors’ </span>voluntary liquidation (of an <span class="font-italic">insolvent</span> company), and not a members’ voluntary liquidation (of a solvent company). Indeed, the liquidator found that the company had become insolvent several years before the liquidation (<span class="font-italic">Yap Jeffery Henry </span>at [9]). <span class="font-italic">Yap Jeffery Henry </span>was, therefore, not a case where a creditor was held to have standing to apply for the removal of a liquidator in a <span class="font-italic">solvent </span>liquidation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Be that as it may, on the facts of the present case, I was satisfied that Yangbum had a legitimate interest in the removal of the Liquidators as a major creditor of the Companies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Although Yangbum’s proofs of debt had not yet been adjudicated by the Liquidators, Yangbum had provided detailed descriptions of its claims against each of the Companies as well as supporting documents.

</div> I was, therefore, satisfied that Yangbum was a creditor of the Companies for the purposes of establishing standing under s 174 of the IRDA. In my view, it would be self-serving for a liquidator to be able to stymie an application for his own removal by refusing or delaying to adjudicate or accept the proofs of debt submitted by the very creditor seeking to remove him. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Further, although the Companies were in voluntary solvent liquidation, the close business relationship between the Companies and Yangbum showed that the latter had a legitimate interest in the conduct of the Liquidators. The reality of this case was that the Companies were incorporated to undertake subcontract work exclusively for Yangbum and that Yangbum was the most significant creditor of each of the Companies, being owed provisional debts amounting to more than $10.8m (see [7] and [11] above). I was unable to agree with the Liquidators’ submission that allowing a creditor such as Yangbum to apply to remove the liquidator of a solvent company would allow parties with no real interest in the ultimate distribution of the company’s assets to wrest control of the liquidation (see [72] above). In this case, Yangbum evidently had an interest in the distribution of the Companies’ assets as it had an interest in its debts being paid in full. Therefore, Yangbum had a legitimate interest in ensuring that the Liquidators administered the liquidation of the Companies properly and fairly.  <span style="color: rgba(0,112,192,1)"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Hence, Yangbum had standing to apply for the removal of the Liquidators under s 174 of the IRDA. However, whether Yangbum could satisfy the court that there was cause for the removal and replacement of the Liquidators was a separate issue that will be discussed in greater detail below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) Standing of Mr Loong </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 I turn now to Mr Loong. In my view, unlike Yangbum, Mr Loong did not have standing to apply for the removal of the Liquidators under s 174 of the IRDA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Mr Loong’s submission that he had a legitimate interest in the removal of the Liquidators was based on his status as the alleged beneficial owner of the Companies. However, whether Mr Loong indeed had a beneficial interest in the Companies was the subject matter of separate proceedings which the court in S 345 had to ultimately decide. It was not disputed that Mr Loong was not reflected as a beneficial owner of the Companies in any of the documents before me. Indeed, during the hearing, counsel for Yangbum and Mr Loong admitted that there were no documents evidencing Mr Loong’s alleged interest before this court. He also admitted that there was no provision permitting the court to take cognisance of such contingent beneficial interests in these proceedings.

</div> Therefore, on the facts as they stood at the time of the hearing, Mr Loong did not have a legitimate interest in the removal of the Liquidators for the purpose of establishing standing under s 174 of the IRDA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In this regard, I noted that Mr Loong’s application in Summons No 1698 of 2020 (“SUM 1698”) for an interlocutory injunction restraining Ms Liang and Mr Zhang from taking any further steps as director and/or shareholder of the Companies and from taking any further step in the liquidation of the Companies, which was made in S 345, had been dismissed by Mavis Chionh JC (as she then was).

</div> In SUM 1698, Mr Loong had argued that Ms Liang held the Companies’ shares on trust for him. Chionh JC stated that Mr Loong had not satisfied the court that there was a serious question to be tried and observed that there were “a number of deep-seated problems in [Mr Loong]’s case”, primarily because it was “entirely unclear what the nature and the terms of the alleged trust [were]”.

</div>
</div> As SUM 1698 was only an injunction application, it did not conclusively decide the issue of whether Mr Loong indeed had a beneficial interest in the Companies. However, Chionh JC’s findings undermined Yangbum and Mr Loong’s submission that Mr Loong’s assertion of beneficial ownership was supported by “powerful evidence” (see [67] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Further, I was unable to accept Yangbum and Mr Loong’s submission that Mr Loong had a legitimate interest in the removal of the Liquidators because he fell within the definition of a “contributory” in s 2(1) of the IRDA (which adopts the definition in s 4(1) of the Companies Act). Section 4(1) of the Companies Act defines “contributory” as:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… a person liable to contribute to the assets of the company in the event of its being wound up, and includes the holder of fully paid shares in the company and, prior to the final determination of the persons who are contributories, [“contributory”] includes any person alleged to be a contributory … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Yangbum and Mr Loong sought to rely on the phrase “any person alleged to be a contributory” to argue that Mr Loong was a contributory because he had made a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> claim to be the beneficial owner of the Companies (see [67] above). During the hearing, counsel for Yangbum and Mr Loong relied on the comments made in <span class="font-italic">McPherson’s Law of Company Liquidation </span>(A R Keay gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3rd Ed, 2013) (“<span class="font-italic">McPherson</span>”) that “contributory” may include “one who, although his or her name does not appear on the register, is prepared to make a <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>admission that he or she is a member of the company” (at para 10-003).

</div>
</div> However, in my view, <span class="font-italic">McPherson </span>did not support the proposition that anyone who alleges himself to be a contributory would fall within the statutory definition. On the contrary, the comments relied on by counsel for Yangbum and Mr Loong were made as one of two qualifications of the general statement that (at para 10-003):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [I]n order to establish that a person is a contributory it must be shown either that with the contributory’s own assent and own knowledge the person’s name has been entered on the register of members, or it must be shown that a contract was entered into by the person with the company which ought to be specifically performed, so that the court would be justified without the assent of the alleged contributory in putting him or her on the register.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 These requirements were not satisfied by Mr Loong in the present case. The ACRA records did not show that Mr Loong had any interest in the Companies. Neither the Companies’ registers nor their records revealed that Mr Loong was a shareholder, director, or beneficial owner. Indeed, even after recognising the qualification set out above, the view taken in <span class="font-italic">McPherson </span>was that (at para 10-003, footnote 27):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[I]n such cases [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, cases where an applicant is prepared to make a <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>admission that he is a member of the company] the applicant is bound to offer <span class="font-italic">some </span>evidence in support of the allegation that the applicant is a contributory; <span class="font-italic">quaere </span>whether the applicant ought not to be required also to give an undertaking to apply for rectification of the register.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Therefore, I agreed with the Liquidators that the phrase “any person alleged to be a contributory” could not include a self-proclaimed contributory who alleged himself to be a contributory, where no evidence was adduced in support of that allegation. Instead, I agreed with the Liquidators’ submission that this phrase would refer to persons who are placed on the provisional list of contributories by the liquidator, or by the court (in the exercise of its function to settle a list of contributories under s 152 of the IRDA), but whose status is disputed.

</div> In my view, this was a more logical reading of the statutory definition of a “contributory” in s 4(1). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In any event, however, Mr Loong was not alleging himself to be a contributory, in the sense of being “a person liable to contribute to the assets of the company in the event of its being wound up”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Hence, even if Mr Loong had been able to establish that Ms Liang (as the sole registered shareholder of the Companies) held the shares in the Companies on trust for him, Ms Liang would be the “contributory” for the purposes of s 4(1) of the Companies Act (and, therefore, s 2(1) of the IRDA), and not Mr Loong.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In view of the above, Mr Loong did not have the requisite legitimate interest to apply for the removal of the Liquidators under s 174 of the IRDA. Mr Loong’s claim to be the beneficial owner of the Companies had yet to be decided in S 345. There was no evidence that Mr Loong was “the holder of fully paid shares in the company” within the definition of a “contributory” in s 4(1) of the Companies Act and s 2(1) of the IRDA. In addition, Mr Loong was neither a “person liable to contribute to the assets of the company in the event of its being wound up” nor a “person alleged to be a contributory” for the purposes of s 4(1) of the Companies Act and s 2(1) of the IRDA. Consequently, Mr Loong failed to establish that he had a legitimate interest in the removal of the Liquidators as a beneficial owner of the Companies or as a contributory. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Conclusion on standing </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 For the foregoing reasons, I found that Yangbum had standing to make an application under s 174 of the IRDA as a major creditor of the Companies, which had a close working relationship with Yangbum. Based on the authorities, there was no rule that only the shareholders of a company in solvent liquidation could have a legitimate interest in the removal of a liquidator. On the facts of this case, I was satisfied that Yangbum had a clear legitimate interest in the distribution of the Companies’ assets and in the removal of the Liquidators.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 However, I found that Mr Loong did not have standing to make an application under s 174 of the IRDA as he had not established that he was the beneficial owner of the Companies or a contributory. Consequently, on the facts as they stood at the time I heard OS 1061, Mr Loong was unable to establish a legitimate interest in the removal of the Liquidators. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Cause for the removal of the Liquidators</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Having found that Yangbum had standing to apply for the removal of the Liquidators under s 174 of the IRDA, the next major issue to be determined was whether cause had been shown for the removal of the Liquidators.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The applicable law</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 As noted at [60] above, s 174 of the IRDA empowers the court to remove a liquidator “on cause shown”. The leading case on applications for the removal of liquidators under s 302 of the Companies Act was <span class="font-italic">Petroships</span>. As s 174 of the IRDA is identical to s 302 of the Companies Act, the same principles regarding cause would have applied under both provisions (see [59] above). I summarise below the principles set out by Coomaraswamy J in <span class="font-italic">Petroships</span> in so far as they were pertinent to the present proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 First, to show cause under s 174, the applicant had to establish that the removal of the liquidator was “in the real, substantial and honest interest of the liquidation” and would “advance the purposes for which the liquidator was appointed” (<span class="font-italic">Petroships</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [109(b)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 The interest and purpose of a <span class="font-italic">solvent </span>liquidation (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a members’ voluntary liquidation) was distinct and different from the interest and purpose of an <span class="font-italic">insolvent </span>liquidation (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a creditors’ voluntary liquidation or a compulsory liquidation) in two main ways (<span class="font-italic">Petroships</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [126]–[138]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, to determine the interest of a solvent liquidation, a court would ordinarily take into account the views of the members, and not the views of the creditors (whereas the converse was true in an insolvent liquidation). A solvent company was liquidated primarily in the members’ interest. The creditors of a solvent company had no real interest in the liquidation because it was obligatory to commence and conduct a solvent liquidation on the basis that the creditors would be paid in full and within one year (s 293(1) of the Companies Act, now s 163(1) of the IRDA). Therefore, the court would give predominant weight to the wishes of the members in ascertaining the real, honest and substantial interest of a solvent liquidation.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, in deciding whether cause had been shown under s 174, a court had to assess the allegations against the liquidator in the light of the purpose of the liquidation. For instance, a liquidator of a solvent company had only a limited duty to investigate the company’s affairs. Nevertheless, the liquidator still had a duty to conduct such an investigation, with two objectives: (i) to maximise the return to those interested in the liquidation by increasing the company’s assets or reducing its debts; and (ii) to uphold standards of commercial morality by identifying improper or dishonest conduct by officers of the company that should be punished by prosecution or civil action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 However, regardless of whether the liquidation was a solvent or an insolvent liquidation, the liquidator had a duty to act impartially in carrying out the liquidation (<span class="font-italic">Petroships</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [144]). Thus, to establish that the removal of the liquidator was in the real, substantial and honest interest of the liquidation and would advance the purposes for which the liquidator was appointed, the applicant could attempt to show that the liquidator lacked impartiality. For instance, the applicant could show that the liquidator was biased in favour of any one or more of the members or creditors of the company. To succeed on the ground of partiality, the applicant could show either that the liquidator was guilty of actual bias or that he had so conducted himself as to give rise to a perception of bias (<span class="font-italic">Petroships</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [109(c)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Bias on the part of the liquidator could be demonstrated by the liquidator’s failure to investigate the affairs of a company in liquidation without rational basis, or in not exercising his discretion in good faith (<span class="font-italic">Petroships</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [163] and [168]–[169]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The court would give significant weight to an applicant’s perception of bias if the applicant could demonstrate (<span class="font-italic">Petroships</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [109(d)]): </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) a subjective belief that the liquidator was biased; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) that that belief was reasonable; and </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) that as a result, the applicant had lost confidence in the ability of the liquidator to carry out the liquidation without fear or favour.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 If the applicant sought to present a decision by the liquidator as evidence of the liquidator’s bias, the burden lay on the applicant to show that the liquidator took that decision without a rational basis (<span class="font-italic">Petroships</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [109(e)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 While the liquidator’s lack of impartiality (actual or perceived) was often determinative of the interest of the liquidation, the court would take into account all aspects of the liquidation in arriving at a decision, including the practical consequences of exercising the power under s 174 to remove the liquidator. These included (<span class="font-italic">Petroships</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [109(g)] and [174]): </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) the costs, delay and disruption associated with the removal and replacement of the current liquidator; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) the stage of the liquidation;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) the familiarity of the current liquidator with the company; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) the impact of removal on the liquidator’s professional standing and reputation.</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The parties’ submissions </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) Yangbum and Mr Loong’s submissions</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Yangbum and Mr Loong submitted that it was in the real, substantial and honest interest of the liquidation that the Liquidators be removed and replaced with impartial and objective liquidators.

</div> The costs, delay and disruption associated with the Liquidators’ removal would be minimal as Yangbum and Mr Loong had already identified alternative liquidators who had provided their consent to act. The Liquidators had not raised any objection to these individuals or their ability to act as the liquidators of the Companies. Further, the liquidation of the Companies was still in early stages, given that the Liquidators claimed that they required further documents in order to proceed with the liquidation and had not yet adjudicated Yangbum’s proofs of debt. In addition, the removal of the Liquidators would have no evident impact on their professional standing or reputation.

</div> The issue before me was whether the alleged acts of trespass either demonstrated actual bias or created a reasonable perception of bias on the part of the Liquidators.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 In my view, the Liquidators’ acts neither demonstrated actual bias nor created a reasonable perception of bias. It was undisputed that the Liquidators had attended at Yangbum’s office on 18 March 2020 to obtain the books of the Companies, which were kept at Yangbum’s office and store. I agreed with the Liquidators that Ms Liang, as a director of the Companies, had the right to inspect the Companies’ books pursuant to s 199(3) of the Companies Act. Moreover, as the prospective liquidators of the Companies, the Liquidators would have needed to inspect the Companies’ books in order to familiarise themselves with the Companies’ affairs. The Trespass Allegation, therefore, did not support Yangbum and Mr Loong’s allegation of bias.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) The Prior Relationship Allegation </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Secondly, Yangbum and Mr Loong submitted that the Liquidators had a prior professional relationship with Ms Liang which pre-dated their appointment as the liquidators of the Companies. This is because they were already acting as Ms Liang’s accountants in her disputes with Mr Loong.

</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) It was not the law that a liquidator could not have had any prior contact with the company or its directors or officers. It was commonplace for a company to seek professional advice with respect to actual or apprehended insolvency, often from someone who later accepted appointment as the company’s liquidator. Hence, there would be “an air of commercial unreality about any suggestion that this course of events is necessarily improper” (<span class="font-italic">Irving </span>at 177). Indeed, creditors were frequently well served by the appointment of a liquidator with some familiarity with the affairs of the company, provided that the reasons leading to this familiarity did not give rise to an apprehension of lack of impartiality or reflect an actual or perceived conflict (<span class="font-italic">Advance Housing </span>at 234).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Where personal associations were suggested to give rise to perceptions of possible bias, questions of judgment and degree would no doubt arise. On one end of the scale, “mere professional acquaintanceship” and “professional connections of a passing nature” would not create actual bias or a reasonable perception of bias. On the other end of the scale, “[i]ntimate relationships of long standing” likely would (<span class="font-italic">Irving </span>at 176). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) However, substantial involvement with a company prior to its liquidation would disqualify a person from appointment as that company’s liquidator. This is because such involvement would be seen to detract from that person’s ability to act fairly and impartially during the course of the liquidation (<span class="font-italic">Irving </span>at 177).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In the present case, Yangbum and Mr Loong’s allegation of a prior relationship between Ms Liang and the Liquidators was based entirely on one line in an affidavit of Ms Liang filed in S 345. This line was ambiguous and did not, on a plain reading, amount to an admission that the Liquidators were <span class="font-italic">Ms</span><span class="font-italic"> Liang’s</span> <span class="font-italic">accountants</span>. During the hearing, counsel for Yangbum and Mr Loong acknowledged that there was no other evidence of prior association between the Liquidators and Ms Liang apart from the following facts: that they had been approached by Ms Liang on or around 10 March 2020 in relation to the potential liquidation of the Companies,

</div> These facts provided an extremely weak basis on which to allege bias on the part of the Liquidators. There was no evidence of any longstanding personal or professional relationship between the Liquidators and Ms Liang, nor any evidence of substantial involvement with the Companies prior to their liquidation, that could give rise to actual bias or a reasonable perception of bias. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The facts of the present case stood in sharp contrast to the facts of <span class="font-italic">Advance Housing </span>and <span class="font-italic">Irving</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Advance Housing</span>, the Supreme Court of New South Wales held that there was an “inherent conflict of a liquidator investigating his firm’s own debt” which gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias (<span class="font-italic">Advance Housing </span>at 238). In <span class="font-italic">Irving</span>, the Federal Court of Australia found that there was a longstanding relationship between the liquidator (Mr Irving) and one of the former directors of the company in liquidation (Mr Townsend). In his professional practice over many years, Mr Irving had looked to Mr Townsend for legal advice. It was implicit in this that Mr Irving regarded Mr Townsend’s professional advice and judgment as sound. Further, Mr Irving and Mr Townsend had a publicised close association and personal friendship. In those circumstances, a reasonable person might apprehend that Mr Irving might tend to favour Mr Townsend if required to investigate Mr Townsend’s conduct as a past director of the company. This was a case where the prior association between the parties went beyond mere professional acquaintanceship (<span class="font-italic">Irving </span>at 177). In the present case, the alleged prior association between Ms Liang and the Liquidators fell far short of this threshold.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 During the hearing, counsel for Yangbum and Mr Loong drew my attention to a letter from Ms Liang and Mr Zhang’s solicitors to the Liquidators dated 6 April 2020.

</div> I disagreed. In my view, it ran contrary to common sense for Yangbum and Mr Loong to allege bias on the ground that the Liquidators had conducted themselves <span class="font-italic">professionally</span> in requesting documents from Ms Liang, particularly in the context of a formal letter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 I, therefore, found that Yangbum and Mr Loong had not succeeded in showing that there was actual bias or a reasonable perception of bias based on the Prior Relationship Allegation.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) The Irrational Targeting Allegation</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Thirdly, Yangbum and Mr Loong submitted that the Liquidators took an irrationally targeted approach from the outset, hounding Mr Loong and his affiliates at Yangbum for documents (such as by filing SUM 310, SUM 303 and SUM 330) while not filing any similar applications against Ms Liang. According to Yangbum and Mr Loong, it was clear that Ms Liang had a significant store of documents and was herself an appointed director of the Companies. However, the Liquidators simply took Ms Liang’s word that she had none of the documents sought.

The Liquidators argued that any rational liquidator would have done the same, and that any rational creditor or contributory would have recognised that the s 313(5) Applications were necessary to advance the interest and purpose of the liquidations. In particular, the Liquidators submitted that the Respondents’ refusal to deliver up and surrender a complete set of the Companies’ books and assets to the Liquidators left the Liquidators with no choice but to obtain court orders to compel the Respondents to do so. On the other hand, the Liquidators did not need to pursue Ms Liang for any further books of the Companies in her possession as she had cooperated with the Liquidators’ requests from the outset. Further, it would have been illogical for Ms Liang to wind up the Companies, appoint the Liquidators, and then proceed to obstruct the liquidations.

In view of my previous findings in favour of the Liquidators in relation to the s 313(5) Applications, I was unable to accept that the Liquidators’ s 313(5) Applications were made without a rational basis or not made in good faith.

Hence, s 293(1) of the Companies Act (now s 163(1) of the IRDA) was applicable and it required a majority of directors to make a declaration of solvency. Further, s 293(4) of the Companies Act (now s 163(4) of the IRDA) imposed criminal liability on a director who made the declaration without reasonable grounds.

It was not for this court to determine the truth of Yangbum and Mr Loong’s allegation that Ms Liang and Mr Zhang had wrongfully appointed themselves as directors of the Companies. For present purposes, Ms Liang and Mr Zhang were the registered directors of the Companies at the time of their liquidation. It was not disputed that valid declarations of solvency had been made in respect of the Companies. It was also not disputed that the Companies were in fact solvent at the time of their liquidation. In these circumstances, I was unable to accept that the Liquidators’ reliance on these declarations of solvency demonstrated actual bias or created a reasonable perception of bias. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(E) The Refusal to Withdraw Allegation </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Fifthly, Mr Loong wrote to the Liquidators (through his solicitors) on 25 March 2020 stating that he was the beneficial owner of the Companies and drawing the Liquidators’ attention to the allegedly wrongful acts of Ms Liang and Mr Zhang (the “25 March Letter”).

Mr Loong’s claim to be the beneficial owner of the Companies in the 25 March Letter was not supported by any objective evidence. For example, Mr Loong had not disclosed a deed of trust or any other documentation as evidence that Ms Liang held the shares in the Companies on trust for him. Hence, the Liquidators concluded that no valid grounds had been disclosed for them to withdraw their consent to act. In view of this, the Liquidators contended that no rational creditor or contributory would have concluded that the Liquidators were biased for refusing to withdraw.

In the 30 March Reply, the Liquidators declined to take a position or view in relation to the allegations made against Ms Liang as it was “neither appropriate nor necessary” for them to do so. The Liquidators stated that the content of the 25 March Letter “[did] not provide any valid reasons or grounds for [the Liquidators] to withdraw their consent to act as Liquidators of the Companies”. The 30 March Reply concluded with the Liquidators stating that, in the event that they were appointed to act as the liquidators of the Companies, they “fully intend[ed] to carry out their powers, functions, and duties impartially and in accordance with the law”.

</div> In my view, this was a sensible response on the part of the Liquidators given that Ms Liang was the sole registered shareholder of the Companies and one of its appointed directors. The Liquidators were not in a position to make a determination on whether she held the shares in the Companies on trust for Mr Loong or whether Ms Liang’s appointment as a director was wrongful. In these circumstances, it was entirely rational for the Liquidators to decline to withdraw their consent to act as the liquidators of the Companies on the basis that no valid grounds had been provided for them to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Therefore, I found that the Refusal to Withdraw Allegation did not support Yangbum and Mr Loong’s allegation that the Liquidators were biased.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(F) The Termination of Employees Allegation </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Sixthly, Yangbum and Mr Loong submitted that on 14 April 2020, shortly after the Liquidators assumed office, the Liquidators stated that they intended to terminate all of the Companies’ 121 employees, of whom 86 were foreign employees. According to Yangbum and Mr Loong, no rational or sensible liquidator would have acted in such a rash manner. Further, when Yangbum proposed to transfer the employment of these employees to Yangbum to ensure that they were not left jobless, the Liquidators (in a letter dated 7 May 2020 (the “7 May Letter”)) “stonewalled” and “came up with ludicrous allegations” of Yangbum and Mr Loong acting in bad faith.

He clarified that the allegation of bias was based on the Liquidators’ <span class="font-italic">response</span> to Yangbum’s proposed transfer of the employees. In the 7 May Letter, the Liquidators had stated that the steps taken by Mr Loong to effect the transfer of various employees of the Companies to Yangbum was inconsistent with the injunction order sought by Yangbum in SUM 1698. The Liquidators had stated that Mr Loong’s conduct was in bad faith as the Liquidators had agreed to take no further steps in the voluntary winding up of the Companies pending the disposal of SUM 1698 on the basis that Mr Loong would also seek to maintain the <span class="font-italic">status quo </span>within the Companies. Despite this, Mr Loong had acted to transfer employees from the Companies for his own benefit.

In complete disregard of this agreement, Mr Loong had surreptitiously attempted to transfer the employees from the Companies to Yangbum without notifying the Liquidators.

</div> During the hearing, counsel for the Liquidators also explained that they had asked for the unwinding of the transfers as a matter of proper process. Half of the Companies’ employees were foreign workers, in respect of which the Liquidators were potentially accountable to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore, the Ministry of Manpower and the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority. Therefore, counsel for the Liquidators contended that Yangbum and Mr Loong should have written to the Liquidators with a list of employees to be transferred instead of surreptitiously transferring these employees to Yangbum.

The termination of the employees of a company in liquidation was undertaken as a matter of course when the business of that company ceased. In any event, the Liquidators had not yet terminated any of the employees as Yangbum and Mr Loong had obstructed the Liquidators from obtaining the complete employment records of the Companies’ employees which were in their possession.

</div> It was Mr Loong who had breached this agreement by taking steps to transfer the employment of various employees to Yangbum. In these circumstances, the Liquidators certainly had a rational basis for reserving their rights to seek orders for Mr Loong to cease taking any further steps to transfer any employees from the Companies to Yangbum and for Mr Loong to take all necessary steps to unwind the transfers that had already been effected.

As I have noted at [11] above, the provisional debt owed by the Companies to Yangbum amounted to more than $10.8m.

Without these books and assets, the Liquidators were unable to properly examine and adjudicate Yangbum’s proofs of debt. While Yangbum and Mr Loong were not the Respondents in the summonses, the first respondent in each of the summonses was a director of the Companies who had been appointed by Mr Loong and who took instructions from him (see [9] above). The second and third respondents were employees of Yangbum and took instructions from Yangbum (see [1] and [39] above). Having contributed to the delay in the Liquidators’ adjudication of Yangbum’s proofs of debt, Yangbum and Mr Loong could not now rely on the Liquidators’ delay in adjudicating these proofs as evidence of actual bias on the part of the Liquidators. Nor could this delay give rise to a reasonable perception of bias in the circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(H) Practical consequences of removing the Liquidators</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 As both parties made submissions on the practical consequences of removing the Liquidators, I shall also address this point for completeness. In my view, the practical considerations further supported my conclusion that the removal and replacement of the Liquidators was not in the real, substantial and honest interest of the liquidation of the Companies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 Although the Liquidators’ work was hindered by the fact that they had yet to receive a complete set of the Companies’ books and assets, it had been more than a year since the Liquidators were appointed (on 30 March 2020). In these circumstances, it was likely that their removal and replacement with the alternative liquidators proposed by Yangbum and Mr Loong would occasion further costs, delay and disruption in the liquidation process of the Companies. Further, given the history of the acrimonious relationship between Mr Loong and Ms Liang, it was unlikely that Ms Liang, as the sole registered shareholder and director of the Companies, would accept the appointment of these alternative liquidators without contention.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 In view of my findings that Yangbum and Mr Loong’s allegations of bias on the part of the Liquidators were unsubstantiated, I also agreed with the Liquidators’ submission that their removal would cast an unwarranted shadow over their professional standing and reputation. This would not have been fair to the Liquidators. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 Therefore, Yangbum and Mr Loong failed to show cause that justified the removal of the Liquidators. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 On the contrary, I agreed with the Liquidators that they had acted to advance the interests and purpose of the liquidations from the outset of their appointment. The Liquidators were appointed on 30 March 2020. The day immediately after their appointment (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 31 March 2020),<span class="font-italic"> </span>they made their first request for the relevant documents, books and assets of the Companies (see [35] and [52] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 Unfortunately, Yangbum and Mr Loong were uncooperative and tried to frustrate the work of the Liquidators as they were against the liquidation of the Companies. I shall now summarise some of their actions as elaborated in the Liquidators’ submissions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Yangbum and Mr Loong’s attempts to frustrate the work of the Liquidators</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 Before the final disposal of Mr Loong’s injunction application in SUM 1698, and in breach of the parties’ agreement to maintain the <span class="font-italic">status quo</span>, Mr Loong surreptitiously took steps to transfer the Companies’ employees to Yangbum without notifying the Liquidators. Yangbum and Mr Loong then argued that the Liquidators had acted in an unreasonable and biased manner because they had asked for the transfers of the employees to be unwound (see [141]–[142] above).

Further, the Liquidators emphasised that the Respondents had resisted the imposition of a timeframe for compliance with the October 2020 Orders at the hearing on 2 October 2020, yet had subsequently refused to comply with the October 2020 Orders.
