The Defendant has, for a number of years, provided the Plaintiff with book-keeping services for his money-changing business as well as income tax filing services. The Plaintiff’s position was that the Defendant had provided such services since 2008

</div>
</div>
</div> The two men became friends over the years, until their relationship broke down as a result of the present dispute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In gist, between 1 October 2014 and 19 March 2015, the Plaintiff made a number of payments to the Defendant amounting to a total of US$1 million. The Plaintiff’s case was that he had paid these moneys to the Defendant pursuant to an oral contract whereby he would invest in the Defendant’s investment scheme. According to the Plaintiff, each sum he invested “in the Defendant” was to be locked in for a period of 18 months. The Defendant was to invest the moneys “in the foreign exchange market” and to pay him a “monthly guaranteed return of 8% per month”,

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> with the return of the principal sum also being guaranteed. The Plaintiff claimed that after paying him a total of US$216,800 in “monthly returns”, the Defendant ceased paying any of the remaining “guaranteed” returns and also failed to return the principal sum paid. The Plaintiff sought various reliefs against the Defendant, including a declaration that the Defendant had breached or wrongfully repudiated the alleged oral contract; the return of the US$1 million; the payment of allegedly outstanding “guaranteed returns” totalling US$1,320,000; an “account and inquiry” of “secret commissions” allegedly received by the Defendant; and damages for breach of fiduciary duty and/or breach of trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Defendant’s case, in contrast, was that the Plaintiff had asked him for a recommendation of “contacts” who might be able to lend him money, as he needed to settle loans taken from unlicensed moneylenders and to finance his money-changing operations. The Defendant did not know anyone who could lend the Plaintiff money. However, he did tell the Plaintiff about his investment in a company called “Maxim Trader” which was promising investors fixed monthly returns on the amounts invested. These investment sums had to be locked in for 18-month periods. The Plaintiff expressed interest in investing in Maxim Trader himself. As the Plaintiff had difficulty leaving his money-changing counter, he asked the Defendant to let him use the latter’s investment account with Maxim Trader for his first two investments; subsequently, to help him open his own investment account; and also to help collect and transfer his monthly returns from Maxim Trader. The Plaintiff invested a total of US$1 million with Maxim Trader of his own volition. The Defendant invested a total of US$230,000. In June 2015, Maxim Trader stopped paying returns to its investors. In January 2018, the press reported that three representatives of Maxim Trader had been charged for offences including that of promoting an illegal multi-level marketing scheme.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 At the conclusion of the trial, I dismissed the Plaintiff’s claims. As the Plaintiff has filed an appeal, I now set out the reasons for my decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases  </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Plaintiff’s claims</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 I start by setting out the various causes of action pleaded in the Plaintiff’s statement of claim as they provide context to the evidence given by the parties. Firstly, as mentioned above, the Plaintiff claimed that he had an investment contract with the Defendant which was made orally on the following terms:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) that the Plaintiff be entitled to a “guaranteed return” of 8% per month on the sums invested with the Defendant;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) that each sum invested would be locked in for 18 months from the date of payment;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) that the guaranteed return of 8% per month would be paid to the Plaintiff by the Defendant for every calendar month until the expiry of the 18-month period;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) that this monthly guaranteed return would be paid within two calendar months from each investment; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) that the sums paid to the Defendant were guaranteed and immediately due and payable on the expiry of the 18-month period.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Plaintiff also pleaded the following further contractual terms which he said were implied terms:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) that the Defendant would invest the Plaintiff’s moneys in the foreign exchange market;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) that the Defendant would use all reasonable endeavours and/or due care and skill in investing the Plaintiff’s moneys;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) that the Defendant owed the Plaintiff a fiduciary duty whereby he would serve the Plaintiff honestly and in good faith; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) that the Defendant would not receive and/or retain a secret profit and/or commission; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) that the Defendant would not invest in any illegal investments to the Plaintiff’s detriment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Plaintiff contended that the Defendant had breached “the express and/or implied terms” of the oral contract by failing to pay outstanding guaranteed returns totalling US$1,320,000 and failing to return the total investment sum of US$1 million.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Secondly, the Plaintiff claimed in the alternative that the Defendant had made the following oral representations to him which he had relied on in entering into the alleged oral investment contract:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) that the Defendant would exercise reasonable care and invest the Plaintiff’s moneys in the foreign exchange market in order to achieve the guaranteed returns of 8% per month;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) that the Defendant, being a successful investor and foreign exchange trader, possessed the necessary knowledge, skills and ability to undertake the investment contract and to achieve the guaranteed returns; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) that the Defendant would not undertake any commitments he was unable to fulfil.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The Plaintiff contended that the above representations were made “fraudulently and/or negligently” by the Defendant “knowing that they were false, untrue and misleading, or recklessly not caring whether they were true or false”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Further and/or in the alternative, the Plaintiff also claimed that the Defendant had exercised “undue influence” over him in procuring his payment of US$1 million under the alleged oral investment contract. According to the Plaintiff, the Defendant had “placed himself in a position of trust and confidence vis-à-vis the Plaintiff” through the book-keeping services he had provided, by portraying himself as “an honest book-keeper and a trusted friend”, and by doing various favours for the Plaintiff such as “[r]ecommending a physiotherapist for the Plaintiff’s wife” and [v]isiting the Plaintiff at his business premises to either collect documents, to chat, to change money or to have lunch”. The Plaintiff contended that it was “only due to the Defendant’s longstanding relationship [with him] and position of trust and confidence” that the Plaintiff was “induced by the Defendant’s said representations” to invest in his foreign exchange investment scheme.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Thirdly, the Plaintiff claimed in the alternative that he had paid the total amount of US$1 million to the Defendant “on trust for the sole purpose of the Defendant investing in the foreign exchange market”. The Defendant was alleged to have breached this trust by “misapplying” this investment sum. From the Plaintiff’s pleadings, it would appear that the “misapplication” lay in the Defendant allegedly putting all of the Plaintiff’s moneys in Maxim Trader, which – according to the Plaintiff – was not in compliance with the purpose of “investing in the foreign exchange market”. It should be highlighted that in the earlier iterations of the statement of claim, the Plaintiff had pleaded that he had never heard of Maxim Trader until September 2016

</div> I highlight this change in position as the issue of the Plaintiff’s awareness of Maxim Trader and his dealings with them formed an important aspect of his case and of the Defendant’s defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Fourthly, the Plaintiff pleaded in the alternative that he had appointed the Defendant as his agent and given the Defendant instructions to invest his moneys “in the foreign exchange market”. According to the Plaintiff, the Defendant had breached his fiduciary duties as agent by failing to comply with these instructions. In addition, according to the Plaintiff, the Defendant had admitted to making “a secret profit and/or commission in the sum of $50,000” while acting as his agent, and was liable to account for such secret profit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Finally, the Plaintiff claimed in the alternative the return of the sum of US$1 million as “money had and received by the Defendant to the use of the Plaintiff under the [alleged] oral investment contract”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Defendant’s defence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The Defendant’s defence has largely been set out at [3] above. The bottomline to his version of events may be summed up in [3] and [4] of the Defence, which asserted that the Plaintiff knew that the Defendant was not a trader in foreign currencies or commodities; that he was not doing such trading for himself or on behalf of anyone else; that the Plaintiff had been aware all along that he was investing in Maxim Trader for his sole benefit and not in any investment scheme of the Defendant’s; and that he had also been aware all along that the Defendant was helping him with his investment-related matters gratuitously, at his request, only because they were good friends and he (the Plaintiff) was unable to leave his money-changing counter to attend to such matters.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The Defendant also asserted that it was only in late January 2018 – after the media reported the prosecution of the Maxim Trader representatives – that the Plaintiff started claiming that the Defendant was the party with whom he had entered into an investment agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 I next summarise the evidence given at trial by the parties and their witnesses.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Plaintiff’s evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Plaintiff’s relationship with the Defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The Plaintiff testified that he first became acquainted with the Defendant in 2008 when the latter started providing audit-related services to his money-changing business. The Plaintiff subsequently recommended the Defendant’s services to his daughter, Shakila binte Mohd Sham (“Shakila”), who ran a restaurant business, and to several fellow money-changers. At the same time, the Defendant also became a customer of the Plaintiff’s money-changing business. The two of them grew to be close friends over the years and the Plaintiff claimed that he came to rely “heavily” on the Defendant’s “advice” for his “business and also [his] personal matters”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Defendant’s “investment scheme”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant first approached him in mid-August 2014 about investing in his (the Defendant’s) investment scheme.

He also declared that he was “seeking funds from his own investors” so as to “increase the return on his investments” and that he wanted to “extend” the “opportunity” to his family and close friends to “participate in his scheme of investment”,  Indeed, he assured the Plaintiff that his (the Defendant’s) wife and close friends had already invested in his investment scheme and were “reaping good monthly income”.

He asked the Defendant why his investment had to be in US dollars and whether the lock-in period could be reduced to 12 months. The Defendant then informed the Plaintiff that his investment would be “tied to the terms of [the Defendant’s] own investment which had to be in USD and that the ‘lock-in’ period had to be 18 months because [the Defendant’s] investment was also locked in for 18 months”. The Plaintiff was also cautioned not to tell his family about the investment.

A few days later, the Defendant visited the Plaintiff at his office and “boasted” about “his investment abilities and his ability to promptly pay the 8% profit”. The Plaintiff claimed that he asked the Defendant how he was able to reap such good profits that he was able to pay his investors 8% monthly returns and guarantee their capital – to which the Defendant responded by revealing that his “main investment” was “in a foreign exchange company called Maxim and their returns were very attractive and reaped profits of more than 8% per month”. The Defendant then suggested that the Plaintiff invest more funds in his scheme, which suggestion the Plaintiff agreed to think over. On 25 November 2014, he received news from the Defendant that his “second monthly profit” on his total investment of US$150,000 – amounting to US$12,000 – would be paid on 25 December 2014. The Defendant followed up by again trying to persuade the Plaintiff to make another larger investment on the same terms as before. This time, he suggested that the Plaintiff invest another US$450,000 to bring his total investments up to US$600,000 and repeated the same representations about guaranteeing 8% monthly returns and return of capital. The Plaintiff was so impressed by the Defendant’s boasts and the prompt payment of the monthly profits on his first two investments that he agreed to – and did – increase his total investments to US$600,000.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 On 29 December 2014, the Plaintiff received the promised returns of US$12,000 (S$15,200) from the Defendant.

Once again, the Defendant boasted of his investment abilities, and also repeated his story about “his Maxim investment… reaping good profits”.

The Plaintiff was reluctant to do so, however, as he had “depleted [his] personal savings and moneys [he] had borrowed from [his] business”.

The Plaintiff was still reluctant to do so and decided to wait for the next monthly payment of the US$48,000 returns on his total investments of US$600,000. This payment was made to him by the Defendant on 26 February 2015. On this occasion, the Defendant once again boasted of his investment abilities and also once again attempted to “lure” the Plaintiff into investing more money with him. According to the Plaintiff, the Defendant stated that he wished to increase his own investment in Maxim Trader – “his biggest and most lucrative investment”. This was presented to the Plaintiff as a “good opportunity” for him to increase his investment in <span class="font-italic">the Defendant’s</span> investment scheme; and the Defendant allegedly also repeated the same representations about guaranteeing 8% monthly returns and return of capital. The Plaintiff was also told that he “should not take too long to decide” because the Defendant’s “own investment in Maxim Trader had a deadline for further investments”.

</div> The Plaintiff claimed that he did not see this article at the time of its publication on 2 June 2015. However, he contended that the Defendant must have seen the article on 2 June 2015; that the Defendant deliberately concealed the information from him and that having realised on that date that “his investment in Maxim Trader was lost because it was a Ponzi scheme”, the Defendant “set out to hatch a false defence that he was only [the Plaintiff’s] agent” and that the Plaintiff had invested his US$1 million into Maxim Trader.

</div> The Plaintiff based his contention on the following. Firstly, the Defendant allegedly told him on 2 June 2015 that he had recommended to Maxim Trader that on the expiry of the Plaintiff’s contract with the Defendant in September 2016, the Plaintiff should “benefit directly” from investing in Maxim Trader “under the same terms agreed with the Defendant”. Secondly, according to the Plaintiff, the Defendant also started “frantically and deceptively chasing [him] to urgently” open “an I-account directly with Maxim Trader”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In respect of the first allegation, the Plaintiff claimed that he was not agreeable to investing “directly in Maxim Trader for another 18 months” after the expiry of his investment agreement with the Defendant.

The Defendant’s evidence about the “I-account” was not disputed. In any event, according to the Plaintiff, whilst he initially agreed to the Defendant’s suggestion that he open his own I-account, no I-account was opened for him because he decided not to proceed with the arrangement.

Many other people were also there “raising issues with Maxim Trader”. At this meeting, the Plaintiff was told by Sammi that Maxim Trader was “having some investment problems in Taiwan” which apparently necessitated the conversion of investors’ shares and consequent delay in the payment of the Defendant’s investment profits. According to the Plaintiff, it was also at this meeting that the Defendant revealed to him “for the first time” that his US$1 million had all been invested “into Maxim Trader” together with the funds from the Defendant’s “other investors” – and that the payment of his investment returns would therefore “depend on Maxim Trader’s dealings and recovery of their own options”.

</div> He made “many calls” to the Defendant expressing his “anguish”, but the latter was unable to confirm when he would be paid his promised monthly profit. On 15 July 2015, however, the Defendant allegedly informed the Plaintiff that he had managed to sell off 200,000 of his Maxim Trader shares for 20 cents each and that he would pay the Plaintiff “the proceeds towards the outstanding guaranteed monthly instalment of US$80,000” due for June. The Defendant did in fact pass the Plaintiff cash of S$52,000 (US$40,000) on 16 July 2015.

According to the Plaintiff, he was “very depressed”, “sick” and “felt cheated” by the Defendant, so much so that he finally confided the truth about his predicament to his daughter, Shakila. It was then that he learnt from Shakila that the Defendant had approached her in July 2014 to invite her to invest in his investment scheme; and it was only then that he realised the Defendant had “surreptitiously deceived” him into entering into the latter’s investment scheme and thereby “defrauded” him of his “whole life savings and borrowings”.

</div> his daughters had berated the Defendant for “surreptitiously” inducing the Plaintiff to invest substantial amounts in his (the Defendant’s) investment scheme; and they had also questioned him as to how he could “guarantee” the 8% monthly profit and return of capital. In the Plaintiff’s version of events, the Defendant responded by falsely alleging that it was the Plaintiff who had not wanted to tell his children about his investment. It was also at this “confrontation” that the Defendant allegedly revealed that Maxim Trader was “not on the Stock Exchange”; and that he was “not able to pay… the monthly profit and guaranteed amount because Maxim Trader were having financial problems in Taiwan where their funds were frozen”. The Defendant also allegedly asserted – “for the first time” – that the Plaintiff had entered directly into an investment agreement with Maxim Trader with the Defendant acting purely as his “gratuitous agent” and that the Defendant had kept all the investment contracts between the Plaintiff and Maxim Trader. On top of all this, the Defendant even admitted that he had received “commission” of US$30,000 for “introducing” the Plaintiff to Maxim Trader, which commission – according to the Plaintiff – was “unlawful” and amounted to “secret profits”.

</div> It was at this presentation that the Defendant learnt that Maxim Trader “was actually Maxim Capital Limited, a forex international company” whose core area of expertise was forex trading and who provided a platform for individual clients to “invest and trade” in forex directly for “high guaranteed monthly returns”. Such clients had to open investment accounts with Maxim Trader and enter into investment contracts which required them to “lock in” their investment sums in US dollars for 18-month periods. In return, they would be paid a “guaranteed monthly performance return” from 3% per month for a minimum investment of US$1,000 to 8% per month for investments of US$30,000 or more.

</div> These guaranteed monthly returns would be deposited in an investor’s Maxim Trader investment account after one month from the date of the investment, following which investors would be able to transfer the money to their personal bank accounts. Investors were also encouraged to open individual I-accounts as this online fund transfer platform allowed for faster transfers of their monthly profits from Maxim Trader to their bank accounts. Additionally, an investor who introduced a new investor to Maxim Trader would receive an “introduction fee of 10% of the first investment” of that new investor.

With Chin’s assistance, the Defendant opened an online investment account with Maxim Trader on 8 August 2014 and invested a sum of US$10,000, which he was told would yield a guaranteed monthly performance return of 6%.

At trial, the Defendant could not recall whether an I-Account was  successfully opened for the Plaintiff in the end. In any case, the issue of the I-Account opening was overtaken by other events: both men did not receive their guaranteed monthly returns for the month of June 2015; and at a meeting of Maxim Traders investors on 23 June 2015, Sammi informed the investors that the delay in payment “was because the authorities in Taiwan, Korea and Japan had frozen Maxim Trader’s funds and had begun investigations following some complaints”.

The Plaintiff then sought the Defendant’s help to sell his shares, but he wanted to sell at no less than US$0.50 per share, and no buyers could be found at that price. By then, the Plaintiff was desperate to settle his loan repayments, and he asked the Defendant to help him out. This led to the Defendant agreeing that the Plaintiff could use the former’s US$40,000 sale proceeds first.

The meeting was arranged for 19 September 2016 at the Plaintiff’s money-changing counter. The Defendant’s account of the “confrontation” differed substantially from the Plaintiff’s and his daughters’.

</div> According to the Defendant, Shakila did not tell him what the meeting was about. He assumed it was to discuss her company’s accounts, but upon arriving, he found the Plaintiff, his wife, his two daughters (Shakila and Haseena), and Haseena’s husband all present. The Plaintiff told the Defendant he had told his family members about his investments in Maxim Trader and they wanted to speak to the Defendant about it. The Plaintiff’s wife and daughters then asked the Defendant how much the Plaintiff had invested in Maxim Trader. When the Defendant told them the Plaintiff had invested a total of US$1 million, he saw that they were very shocked; and although he could not understand much of what they said to each other in Malay, he sensed that the Plaintiff had not been frank with his family about his investments.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 According to the Defendant, the Plaintiff’s family – and particularly his daughters – then scolded him for having agreed to help the Plaintiff invest with Maxim Trader and for not having told them about what the Plaintiff was doing. Haseena lamented that the Plaintiff had previously “put himself and his family in a similar situation” by borrowing money from unlicensed moneylenders, while Shakila – fretting that the Plaintiff would not have enough capital to run his money-changing business during upcoming festive periods – demanded that the Defendant make a written declaration stating that the Plaintiff’s US$1 million had been given to him and that he also provide the Plaintiff funds to run his business. When Shakila heard that the Defendant had received an introduction fee of US$30,000 for introducing the Plaintiff to Maxim Trader, she demanded that this amount should be given to the Plaintiff. The Defendant refused these demands. He felt that the Plaintiff’s family members were trying to make him the scapegoat when the Plaintiff himself had knowingly made an independent decision to invest with Maxim Trader. Shakila also demanded to have the Plaintiff’s investment contracts, which the Defendant explained had been left in his keeping at the Plaintiff’s request; and the Defendant agreed to give them the contracts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Throughout this “confrontation”, the Plaintiff did not say anything apart from asking his daughters to have the discussion at a nearby coffee shop instead – which request they ignored. The Defendant left the meeting feeling very harassed and traumatised. It was only when he left that the Plaintiff came up to him and apologised, claiming that he had not been in a position to speak up against his family. The Defendant retorted that he should let his family know he had invested in Maxim Trader of his own free will.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The events following the “confrontation”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In December 2016, the Defendant received a phone call from the Plaintiff’s daughters in which Shakila again demanded that he help the Plaintiff out with funds for his money-changing business

On 9 February 2018, he received a letter of demand from the Plaintiff’s lawyers repeating similar allegations and demanding payment of US$2,360,000. It was then that he responded with his letter of 19 February 2018 to point out that it was the Plaintiff who had been “keen” to “grab the opportunity” to invest in Maxim Trader; that there was no investment agreement between him and the Plaintiff; and that the latter had invested directly in Maxim Trader all along.

What was in dispute was whether the Plaintiff had contracted directly with and invested directly in Maxim Trader, such that Maxim Trader was the entity contractually obliged to pay him the “guaranteed” profits and capital sum – or whether the Plaintiff had entered into an investment agreement with the Defendant, who was then contractually obliged to pay him the promised profits and the “guaranteed” capital.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 As a preliminary aside, I should note that the Plaintiff did attempt (somewhat surprisingly) to suggest early on in cross-examination that he “[did] not know where the money went to”.

</div> This, however, was not a position he persisted in advancing for the rest of the trial. In any event, it was clear from his own pleadings, his AEIC, and the rest of his testimony throughout the trial that his case against the Defendant was not premised on any allegation as to the latter having stolen and/or personally pocketed the US$1 million. Rather, the case theory advanced by the Plaintiff – and put to the Defendant – was that the Defendant had been running his own investment scheme “back to back” with his personal investments in Maxim Trader; that the Defendant had represented to the Plaintiff that he would invest the latter’s funds “in the foreign exchange market” and that the Plaintiff had entered into the oral investment contract on this basis; that the Defendant had instead invested the entire US$1 million in Maxim Trader without the Plaintiff’s knowledge or consent; and that he had done so in order to earn “secret” commissions from Maxim Trader which (so the Plaintiff alleged) were paid on every individual amount invested.

In this connection, a fundamental – indeed, critical – aspect of the Plaintiff’s case related to the issue of when he first came to know that the Defendant was investing his money in Maxim Trader. This was because a key plank of the Plaintiff’s case rested on the contention that he could not have contracted directly with Maxim Trader when he had been ignorant even of the existence of Maxim Trader from the start, and remained ignorant of it until after sinking US$1 million into the Defendant’s “investment scheme”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The original Statement of Claim filed on 13 March 2018 made no mention of Maxim Trader.

</div>  On 22 June 2018, the Plaintiff amended his Reply – but his pleaded position as to when he first heard of Maxim Trader and when he became aware of the Defendant investing his (the Plaintiff’s) money in it remained unchanged.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 On 27 July 2018, as part of the discovery process, the Defendant filed a List of Documents which included, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the Whatsapp messages exchanged between him and the Plaintiff during the period 15 March 2014 to 22 January 2018. Subsequently, in the AEIC filed by the Plaintiff on 27 December 2018, it became clear that his position as to when he had first heard of Maxim Trader – and when he became aware of the Defendant investing <span class="font-italic">his</span> moneys in it – had undergone a material shift. According to the Plaintiff’s AEIC, he first heard of Maxim Trader <span class="font-italic">in August 2014</span> when the Defendant mentioned it as one of his “trading platforms” while pitching his investment scheme;

</div> As to when he actually became aware that <span class="font-italic">all</span> his money had been invested in Maxim Trader, the Plaintiff claimed in his AEIC that it was on <span class="font-italic">25 June 2015</span> – during a meeting with Sammi – that he learnt from the Defendant for the first time that the latter had invested his U$1 million “and other investor’s funds all into Maxim Trader”. The confrontation with the Defendant in September 2016 – which had been identified in the Reply as the date at which the Plaintiff heard of Maxim Trader for the first time – was instead described in his AEIC as being the date on which <span class="font-italic">the Defendant first advanced the claim that the Plaintiff had “entered into the investment directly with Maxim Trader</span>”.

</div> This last assertion was incorporated in the amended Reply filed on 12 February 2019 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the first day of trial), in substitution for the previous assertions as to the Plaintiff having first heard of Maxim Trader only in September 2016. I should add that in applying to amend the Reply, the Plaintiff did not explain in the affidavit filed in support of the application why the amendments were not made earlier.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 I found the above shift in the Plaintiff’s position to be material – and telling. Given that he had pleaded from the outset that his investment agreement was with the Defendant and that Maxim Trader had nothing to do with their investment agreement, it was highly suspicious that his recollection of when he first became aware of the Defendant investing his money in Maxim Trader should have been so unreliable and susceptible to revision.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 It was also highly suspicious that these revisions to the Plaintiff’s version of events should have come only after the Defendant’s disclosure of the Whatsapp messages exchanged by the parties during the material period. Oddly, none of the parties’ Whatsapp messages were disclosed by the Plaintiff in the List of Documents he filed on 26 July 2018, even though a good number of these messages involved communications about both parties’ investments and the payment of investment returns (after the filing of the Defendant’s List of Documents on 27 July 2018, the Plaintiff filed a Supplementary List of Documents on 18 September 2018 disclosing additional Whatsapp messages for the period from 2 November 2017 to 22 January 2018). It was the Whatsapp messages disclosed by the Defendant which exposed the fact that the Plaintiff had been aware of Maxim Traders – and had moreover been regularly following up with the Defendant for updates on the investments in the company – even before 25 June 2015, and certainly well before September 2016. As early as November 2014, the Whatsapp communications showed the Defendant explaining to the Plaintiff the process by which the monthly returns would be paid by Maxim Traders:

Given that subsequent to the disclosure of these messages, the Plaintiff pivoted to a noticeably different version of events in his AEIC and in the re-amended Reply, the inference to be drawn was that he had realised the damaging effect of the Whatsapp evidence on his original version of events and had come up with another version to explain away these messages. Thus, the references to Maxim Trader in the Whatsapp messages prior to 25 June 2015 were explained away on the basis that the Defendant had from the start “boasted” about the “good monthly profits”

</div> I have highlighted earlier instances where the Plaintiff was shown in various Whatsapp communications to be querying the Defendant and/or expressing concern about the investments in Maxim Trader. What was equally telling about these Whatsapp communications was the total absence of any reference by the Plaintiff to the Defendant’s contractual responsibilities under their alleged oral investment agreement. Even after the “shocking” revelation on 25 June 2015 that the Defendant had placed his entire US$1 million in Maxim Trader and that the payment of profits by Maxim Trader was delayed by its “investment problems in Taiwan”, the Plaintiff’s Whatsapp messages to the Defendant did not allude at all to the latter’s contractual obligation to pay him the amounts promised.

</div> Given that the Plaintiff’s position was that he had no investment agreement with Maxim Trader and it was the Defendant who was liable to pay him all “guaranteed” sums, it was odd that following the news of the share conversion exercise and the resulting delay in profit payments, he never once reminded the Defendant of his contractual obligations to pay, much less upbraided him for breaching those obligations. Indeed, whilst the Plaintiff claimed in his AEIC that he had reminded the Defendant the proceeds from the sale of his 200,000 shares on 15 July 2015 “would not… satisfy the agreed monthly return <span class="font-italic">under the Defendant’s investment scheme</span>”, this was not borne out by his contemporaneous Whatsapp messages to the Defendant which said something quite different.

By October 2016, the Defendant had also made it plain – through what he had said on 19 September 2016 and the provision of “fabricated” contract documents thereafter – that he was trying “to evade his contractual obligations”.  I did not find it at all believable that the Plaintiff would have viewed the situation with such equanimity that he would have been more worried about hurting the Defendant’s feelings than confronting him about his lies and contractual liabilities. This was all the more so in view of his high state of anxiety about his finances, as seen from the messages to the Defendant about the “very hard time” he was going through. It should also be noted that despite professing his “trust” in the Defendant to “come back with the money”, the Plaintiff was unable to offer any coherent explanation as to why he had such “trust” in someone who had allegedly been shown to be a fraudster. In fact, when asked why he thought the Defendant would repay him after having declared on 19 September 2016 that he was unable to pay up, the Plaintiff simply claimed that he could not understand “a lot of the things” the Defendant talked about.

The picture which emerged from these contemporaneous communications was far more consistent with the Defendant’s version of events. In particular, the Plaintiff’s failure to bring up the Defendant’s supposed contractual obligations in any messages prior to January 2018, and his reference to being upset with Maxim Trader, were consistent with the Defendant’s assertion that the Plaintiff knew very well his investment agreement was with Maxim Trader.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Logical flaws in the Plaintiff’s case theory</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Over and above the various evidential gaps and incongruities which beset the Plaintiff’s case, when one took a step back to consider the general narrative he was presenting, there appeared to me to be a fundamental lack of logic in his case theory. <span class="font-italic">Per</span> the Plaintiff’s narrative, the essential terms of his oral investment agreement with the Defendant were no different from the terms of the Defendant’s investment agreement with Maxim Trader – especially insofar as the rate of return (8% per month) and the lock-in period (18 months) were concerned.

</div> I would add that whilst the Defendant himself testified that he did receive from Maxim Trader a one-off 10% introduction fee for introducing a new investor, it was obvious – as a matter of common sense and logic – that the Defendant had no need to pretend to operate his own investment scheme merely to claim this one-off introduction fee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Visibly vexed at the concession made in cross-examination, the Plaintiff attempted in the course of the trial to come up with an explanation for the conundrum. In his counsel’s cross-examination of the Defendant, it was put to the Defendant that he had received commission from Maxim Trader for every investment made by the Plaintiff which he channelled into Maxim Trader. Counsel relied on a number of cash deposits shown in the Defendant’s OCBC account statements, which he said represented payment of secret commissions by Maxim Trader based on the Plaintiff’s investments.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 I did not find the above proposition at all credible. Firstly, it should be noted that this proposition – that the Defendant operated his own investment scheme in order to earn secret commissions from Maxim Trader for every investment made by his pool of investors – surfaced only for the first time during the cross-examination of the Defendant. It was never pleaded by the Plaintiff, even though I would have considered it a material fact since it supposedly explained the entire rationale of the Defendant’s investment scheme. Nor was it mentioned either in the Plaintiff’s AEIC or in his counsel’s opening statement.  That such a pertinent proposition should have emerged only for the first time in the Defendant’s cross-examination suggested that it was something the Plaintiff had belatedly invented after being confronted with the logical gap in his own narrative.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Secondly, in respect of the cash deposits relied on by the Plaintiff, these were explained by the Defendant as having been fund transfers made in error to his account by the Maxim Trader representatives he was dealing with (Chin and Sammi).

</div> The Defendant was also able to demonstrate that each of these deposits into his account was followed by a transfer of the same amount (or a very similar amount, allowing for some rounding-up) out of his account back to either Chin or Sammi; and nothing in the evidence presented by the Plaintiff persuaded me that the Defendant had retained the cash deposit amounts.

</div> there did not appear to me any sensible reason why the Defendant should have mentioned these fund transfers to the Plaintiff if they had in fact been made in error and subsequently returned. It must also be highlighted that despite charging in closing submissions that the Defendant had derived secret profits from his “<span class="font-italic">pool of 40 money changer clients</span>” by parking their investments with Maxim Trader, the Plaintiff’s counsel did not identify in cross-examination any other cash deposits representing the “secret” commissions made from “money changer clients” other than the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Thirdly, this belated case theory was in fact refuted by a third party, James Thomas. Thomas gave clear testimony that the commission paid to a member by Maxim Trader was strictly a “one-time bonus” of 10% on the first investment made by a new investor he or she introduced.

</div> If this were indeed the case, however, it made no sense for Maxim Trader to be paying the Defendant “commission” on each investment made in his own name when it was already paying him 8% monthly interest on such investments.

</div> In my view, the Plaintiff’s claim made no sense when juxtaposed against his other claim that the Defendant had already known by 2 June 2015 that his investment in Maxim Trader was “lost” to a Ponzi scheme. If indeed the Defendant had possessed such knowledge by 2 June 2015, and if indeed he were the calculating crook that the Plaintiff made him out to be, then there was no reason for him to give the Plaintiff US$40,000 in July 2015 – since he would have known by then the impossibility of being able to recoup such a payment. It should also be noted that the Defendant’s assertion that the Plaintiff had been “very desperate” at the time to settle his loans was corroborated by the evidence of the Plaintiff’s Whatsapp messages, which alluded to his anxiety about “settlements”:

Firstly, it was submitted that the contracts in the Defendant’s name featured a Maxim Trader watermark on each page, whereas those in the Plaintiff’s name – or at least the copies exhibited in the Defendant’s AEIC – did not feature any such watermark. However, it was pointed out that the copies of the contracts in the Plaintiff’s name which were exhibited in the Defendant’s Bundle of Documents did in fact bear the same Maxim Trader watermark seen in the copies of the contracts in the Defendant’s name. The Defendant’s counsel explained that the apparent absence of the watermark in the copies exhibited in the Defendant’s AEIC could have been due to the process of scanning and photocopying; and I did observe for myself that the photocopies exhibited in the Defendant’s AEIC were of somewhat poor quality. More importantly, the Defendant’s counsel produced for my inspection the originals of the contracts in question; and I verified for myself, after careful inspection, that all the contracts did in fact carry the same Maxim Trader watermark. In the circumstances, I saw no reason to doubt counsel’s explanation as to the possibly deleterious effects of the scanning and photocopying process on the clarity of the watermark in the copies exhibited in the Defendant’s AEIC; and with respect, I found the Plaintiff’s refusal to accept this explanation – as well as the aspersions cast on counsel’s explanation

</div> the crucial point is that P1 being a personal record, the Plaintiff would never even have known of its existence had the Defendant not disclosed it. This, in my view, showed that the Defendant was being transparent and that he was not given to “deliberately suppressing” evidence – contrary to the repeated accusations levelled in this respect by the Plaintiff in closing submissions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 As to the Defendant’s explanations for the entries made in P1, they appeared to me to be reasonable. At any rate, I was not persuaded that P1 proved the Defendant to be running his own investment scheme with “a pool” of his own investors. It should be remembered that it was the Plaintiff who was advancing the case that the Defendant had operated his own investment scheme “back to back” with Maxim Trader. That “he who asserts must prove” is a trite common law rule which finds statutory expression in ss 103 and 105 of our Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed): see <span class="font-italic">SCT Technologies Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">v Western Copper Co Ltd</span> [2016] 1 SLR 1471 at [17]; also <span class="font-italic">Loo </span><span class="font-italic">Chay Sit v Estate of Loo Chay Loo, deceased</span> [2010] 1 SLR 286 at [14]. That the Plaintiff (as the claimant in this trial) started out bearing both the legal and the evidential burden of proof – and that the legal burden could not be shifted – should also be uncontroversial. The most that could be said of P1, in my view, was that it seemed somewhat suggestive and called for an explanation from the Defendant – but the Defendant having provided a reasonable explanation, the evidential burden of proof fell back on the Plaintiff; and as I have noted in the course of these written grounds, the evidence adduced at trial simply did not support the Plaintiff’s case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Other points</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 As I noted earlier, the Plaintiff in his closing submissions made multiple allegations about the Defendant “deliberately suppressing” evidence.

</div> the Defendant had a reasonable explanation for omitting the September 2014 statement from the bank statements given in discovery, in that there was nothing in the September 2014 statement which was relevant to the issues in dispute. Furthermore, the Plaintiff himself had raised no queries or objections to the omission of the September 2014 statement in discovery, and had only made a demand (through his counsel) for this statement on 29 January 2019 – less than two weeks before the start of trial. The statement was then provided by the Defendant’s counsel on 31 January 2019. The Plaintiff claimed that the Defendant must have wanted to suppress the September 2014 statement so as to conceal the fact that the Plaintiff’s investment amount of US$50,000 (S$64,150) “was not credited into [the Defendant’s] account”.

</div> given the pending prosecution, it was highly probable that Sammi – and indeed the other key Maxim Trader representatives – would have been primarily concerned to avoid saying anything which could be used against them in the criminal proceedings, and would not have been willing to testify in a civil suit where the Plaintiff was making similar allegations about their running a Ponzi scheme.

I found him to be a glib and disingenuous witness; and I rejected his testimony, and that of his daughters, as being totally lacking in credibility. In contrast, I found the Defendant to be a credible witness whose version of events was consistent from the start, and moreover, corroborated in several important aspects by objective evidence. On the evidence before me, I was satisfied that the Plaintiff had contracted directly with Maxim Trader in respect of all his investments; and he knew from the outset that he was investing directly in Maxim Trader and that this company – not the Defendant – was the party liable to him for both the payment of profits and the return of capital. I was also satisfied that the Defendant had merely helped the Plaintiff – at his request and gratuitously – to make some of the arrangements for his investments: namely, by allowing him to park his first two investments under the Defendant’s name; by helping him open his own Maxim Trader investment account; by facilitating the transfer and pay-out of the monthly investment returns; and by keeping a record of his investments. In my view, it was clear that the Defendant had merely helped the Plaintiff as a friend, since the latter found it inconvenient to leave his money-changing business to attend to these administrative matters and also did not wish to let his family know about the large sums he was putting into Maxim Trader. There were  no “secret profits” or “secret commissions” made by the Defendant in respect of the Plaintiff’s investments: the only commission received by the Defendant was the one-off 10% introduction fee paid on the Plaintiff’s third investment of US$300,000 on 27 November 2014.

</div> There was no separate investment scheme operated by the Defendant: in my view, the story about the Defendant’s separate investment scheme was only invented by the Plaintiff after he realised in January 2018 that there was no prospect of recovering his money from Maxim Trader.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">My decision on the Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant for breach of oral investment agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 These being my key factual findings, it followed that the Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant for breach of an alleged oral agreement must fail.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">My decision on the Plaintiff’s claim for restitution of the US$1 million as “money had and received”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 As for the alternative claim that the US$1 million was “money had and received by the Defendant to the use of the Plaintiff under the oral investment contract” between the parties, it should be noted firstly that the underlying basis for a claim for “money had and received” has been subsumed under the rubric of unjust enrichment: <span class="font-italic">Alwie</span><span class="font-italic"> Handoyo v Tjong Very Sumito</span> [2013] 4 SLR 308 at [125].

They were not. Nor were they elaborated upon in closing submissions. In any event, this claim for restitution of the US$1 million appeared to be premised on the proposition that the money was paid to and accepted by the Defendant for the purpose of his investment scheme, pursuant to the parties’ alleged oral investment agreement. Given that I have rejected this proposition in my key factual findings, the alternative claim for restitution of the US$1 million as “money had and received” could not be sustained. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">My decision on the Plaintiff’s claims for breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty as agent</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 The Plaintiff’s alternative claims against the Defendant for breach of trust and for breach of fiduciary duty as his agent were both rooted in the same factual proposition – namely, that he had paid the Defendant a total of US$1 million on the basis that the Defendant would invest the money on his behalf “in the foreign exchange market”. Given my finding that the Defendant was merely helping the Plaintiff – as a friend – to pass the money to Maxim Trader for his investments with them, it followed that neither the claim for breach of trust nor the claim for breach of fiduciary duty as agent was factually sustainable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">My decision on the Plaintiff’s claim for misrepresentation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 As for the Plaintiff’s alternative claim in misrepresentation, it will be remembered that the misrepresentations relied on by the Plaintiff all related to the Defendant’s alleged investment scheme.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Having found that the Plaintiff had knowingly contracted with Maxim Trader from the outset and that there was never any separate investment scheme operated by the Defendant, I also found that there were never any such misrepresentations made by the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">My decision on the Plaintiff’s claim of alleged undue influence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 The last of the multiple alternative claims pleaded by the Plaintiff in his amended statement of claim was that of alleged undue influence by the Defendant. In gist, the Plaintiff alleged that there had been actual undue influence of the “Class 1” category (per <span class="font-italic">B</span><span class="font-italic">OM v BOK and another appeal</span> [2019] 1 SLR 349 (“<span class="font-italic">BOM</span>”) at [101(a)]), or presumed undue influence of the Class 2B category (per <span class="font-italic">BOM</span> at [101(b)(ii)]) and that it was only due to the undue influence exercised by the Defendant that he had been induced to invest in the latter’s “foreign exchange investment scheme”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 I did not find that the Plaintiff was able to make out his claim of undue influence. In the first place, as noted earlier, I disbelieved entirely his story about the Defendant running his own “foreign exchange investment scheme” and about his having entered into an oral investment agreement with the Defendant. This removed an essential piece of the factual stratum for his claim.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 In any event, the evidence relied on by the Plaintiff for the allegation of undue influence was wholly inadequate. This evidence, as summarised by counsel in cross-examination, was as follows

</div>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q. … (O)ver the years, the plaintiff and you became very good friends, and you have given instances like the Plaintiff would buy you food. And then you said… you were a regular customer of the Plaintiff’s money-changing counter. You and the Plaintiff discussed matters concerning yourselves and family matters. You say you also gifted him a pair of shoes to ease the Plaintiff’s leg pain. You helped the Plaintiff to buy a laptop for the Plaintiff’s nephew. You did work for the Plaintiff but did not charge him. You did work for the Plaintiff’s daughter too…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A.  Yes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 I should add that whilst it was suggested to the Defendant at one point that the Plaintiff relied on him for advice on his <span class="font-italic">personal</span> finances, this was denied by the Defendant; and no further details were provided by the Plaintiff nor was any independent evidence produced by him to substantiate what appeared to be a bare assertion.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 I should also add that despite the Plaintiff’s repeated claims about having trusted the Defendant so much that he followed his advice unquestioningly, the Plaintiff’s own evidence showed that he was perfectly capable of making up his own mind and disagreeing with the Defendant when he wanted to. Thus, for example, it was the Plaintiff’s own evidence that despite the Defendant urging him to open his own I-account, no such account was eventually opened because he changed his mind about doing so.

It was not possible to find on the basis of such evidence that the Defendant had the capacity to influence the Plaintiff, much less that he actually exercised such influence – the existence of such capacity to influence and the exercise of it being essential elements in proving actual undue influence (<span class="font-italic">BOM</span> at [101(a)]). Nor was it possible to find that there was between the parties a relationship of trust and confidence sufficing to give rise to a rebuttable presumption of undue influence (<span class="font-italic">BOM </span>at [101(b)(ii)]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Orders made at the end of trial</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 For the reasons I have given, I dismissed the present action and ordered that the Plaintiff pay the costs of these proceedings to the Defendant. It was not disputed that the Defendant had made the Plaintiff an offer to settle on 27 July 2018: the terms of the offer were that the Plaintiff should discontinue his action and each party should bear his own costs. It was also not disputed that in having had his action dismissed with costs, the Plaintiff had failed to beat the offer to settle. As such, I ordered that the costs awarded to the Defendant were to be costs on the standard basis from the date of the writ of summons to the date of service of the offer, and then on an indemnity basis thereafter. The quantum of costs payable was subsequently agreed between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Mavis Chionh  <br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">S Magintharan, Vineetha Gunasekaran and Tan Yixun Benedict (Essex LLC) for the plaintiff;<br/>Ravinran Kumaran and Subash s/o Rengasamy (Relianze Law Corporation) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
