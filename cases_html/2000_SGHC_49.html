<p align="justify">The facts</p></i>
<p align="justify">1. The plaintiffs are a firm of architects who used to practise at No.

149, Rochor Road, Fu Lu Shou Building, Singapore before they moved to No. 100 Beach Road,

Suite 29, Shaw Towers, Singapore. Their principal is one Ong Cher Keong (Ong) while Tay

Cheow Bin (Tay) is their director and associate architect. Ong’s wife Esther Tan Hwee

Cheng (Esther) is the plaintiffs’ accounts manager. The defendants are a Singapore

company incorporated in 1991 with a registered address at No. 180, Clemenceau Avenue

01-00, Haw Par Glass Tower, Singapore. The main business of the defendants is that of a

developer and holding company; it has at least ten (10) other property companies as its

subsidiaries. The defendants’ chairman, chief executive officer and majority

shareholder is one Goh Chin Soon (Ricky Goh) while his nephew Goh Teck Beng (Danny Goh) is

the vice-president.</p>
<p align="justify">2. In the early 90s, Ong was introduced to Ricky Goh by a mutual friend

with a view to assisting Ricky Goh in developing some projects. At that time, Ong said he

knew of Ricky Goh not as a developer but as a night-club owner (this was denied by Ricky

Goh). Subsequent to that introduction, the two not only became friends (who socialised

frequently) but commenced a business relationship as Ong’s firm (formerly

Architectmatrix) was appointed as architects for all Ricky Goh’s building projects.

By 1993, the plaintiffs had been commissioned by Ricky Goh to work on 21 separate projects

in Singapore; indeed, Ricky Goh became the plaintiffs’ best client. Apart from Ricky

Goh, only one other developer (Sin Chuan Development) gave all their projects to the

plaintiffs at any one time. I should point out however that when cross-examined, Ong

denied that he had requested for Ricky Goh’s support when he left Architectmatrix to

form the plaintiffs. He contended it was because he could service Ricky Goh that the

latter gave him many if not, all construction projects. Ong asserted that in those days,

Ricky Goh had no developer’s licence or experience and it was he who could assist

Ricky Goh, which assistance extended to becoming a director of Ricky Goh’s companies

in order to lend them ‘credibility’.</p>
<p align="justify">3. According to Ong, the plaintiffs were involved in projects in China

since early 1990, these included projects developed in Dalian, Donguan and Fujian, the

last being constructed by a Singapore company (Dragon Land Pte Ltd).</p>
<p align="justify">4. In early 1993, Ricky Goh decided that the defendants would invest in

the then booming China property market; he wanted to develop an International City (the

project). In that connection, a delegation comprising of Ricky Goh, Ong, Ricky Goh’s

lawyer (Patrick Chee) and businessmen from Singapore and Taiwan made at least 4

exploratory trips to China to look at potential sites for the project in Dalian, Xiamen,

Shanghai, Beijing and Dongshan. According to Ong, his task in those trips was to provide

technical assistance or advice as to the suitability of sites for the project and the

potential problems in developing particular sites. Because of his past experience in China

projects, Ong claimed his assistance to Ricky Goh was invaluable.</p>
<p align="justify">5. For every prospective site that the delegation visited, Ong

conducted a market survey (based on feedback from local Chinese officials) which he and

Ricky Goh would then assess. Eventually, the two of them narrowed down their choice of

site to either Shanghai or Qingdao and finally, they decided on Qingdao. The project

became known as the Qingdao High Tech Industrial Park.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Even after Qingdao was chosen, there was still the task of selecting

the actual site for development. The Qingdao authorities provided Ricky Goh and Ong with a

general layout of the entire city (which turned out to be largely inaccurate) and a master

plan; based on the former, Ong and Ricky Ong looked for the ideal locations. After the

site(s) were selected, Ong drew up concept plans which he then passed on to his partner

Tay and Tay’s team to work on.</p>
<p align="justify">7. After the concept plans had more or less been finalised and approved

by Ricky Goh, Ong and Tay flew to Qingdao to present them to the Chinese authorities in

relation to the specific plots which the defendants intended to purchase for development.

The defendants paid for the plots which were then assigned to them and their joint-venture

partner (Qingdao High Tech Industrial Park Economic Development &amp; Investment Company)

after their location and boundaries were confirmed, a process which Ong described as

‘tedious and time-consuming’. Thereafter, Ong and Tay would return to the

plaintiffs’ office to work on/out the details.</p>
<p align="justify">8. The project was divided into four (4) sectors:- Qingdao

International City (the International City), Qingdao Design Centre (the Design Centre),

Qingdao Marina (the Marina) and, Qingdao Grandlink Square (Grandlink Square). The site for

the International City was selected followed by those for the other three (3) sectors. For

the International City, the defendants planned to construct shophouses, bungalows,

semi-detached and terrace houses as well as flats; these were intended for locals as well

as overseas investors. For the concept of the Marina, Ricky Goh and Ong visited the

Raffles Marina in Singapore with a delegation from Qingdao, who had been invited to

Singapore by Ricky Goh for the sales exhibition of the project. To conceptualise the

Design Centre (which was supposed to be the headquarters of the defendants in Qingdao),

Ricky Goh and Ong visited a recreational club in Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify">9. In April 1994, the defendants held a sales exhibition for the

project at a local hotel; Ong was responsible for the sales brochures (D8), flyers, plans

and mock-ups while Ricky Goh took care of public relations and a Chinese delegation which

visited Singapore in connection therewith. The defendants needed and were issued, a permit

for foreign sale of commodity housing by the Chinese authorities (D10) for the exhibition.

The defendants engaged the services of property consultants (Debenham Tewson Pte Ltd) for

the exhibition and the plaintiffs sent out 1,000 invitations to their clients. After

Singapore, the defendants held a similar exhibition in Hong Kong (in October 1994 which

itself was preceded by one in Qingdao in August 1994). The defendants said they sold about

500 out of 1,200-1,300 units available; purchasers mostly of flats paid a booking fee of

$5,000 for a unit; no sales were effected for the shophouses or bungalows. Indeed right up

to the trial, the defendants did not manage to sell a single bungalow. The plaintiffs on

the other hand, asserted that the exhibition was a resounding success with many local and

foreign buyers despite which, and the large profits which they made therefrom, the

defendants did not pay the plaintiffs’ fees. </p>
<i>
<p align="justify"></p></i> 

<p align="justify"><i>The dispute</i></p>
<p align="justify">10. The plaintiffs claimed that in August 1993, Ong had informed Ricky

Goh that the plaintiffs’ architectural fees for the project would be based on 3% of

total construction costs; the fee was based on Ong’s experience with the Fujian

project developed by Dragon Land Pte Ltd (Dragon Land). In their subsequent casual

conversations, Ong claimed that the fee was mentioned to Ricky Goh who did not dispute the

figure. Indeed, the plaintiffs contended, up to the time of the dispute (July 1996), Ricky

Goh acted in a manner consistent with Ong’s proposed fee. The 3% fee was also stated

in the plaintiffs’ letter dated 3 June 1995 (signed by Tay) to the defendants, which

contained an estimate of $590,852,940 (with a breakdown) for the construction costs of the

project; based on that estimate, the plaintiffs’ fee of 3% amounted to $5,334,670.47.</p>
<p align="justify">11. The plaintiffs complained that the defendants were poor paymasters

– they did not pay the plaintiffs’ professional fees and disbursements between

1993 and May 1994. Consequently, after the defendants’ sales exhibition in April

1994, the plaintiffs decided it was time to bill the defendants for all the work they had

done. Accordingly, the plaintiffs sent the defendants a letter dated 3 May 1994 requesting

payment of $250,000 (see exhibit TCB-41 in Tay’s affidavit) as well as proposing a

monthly fee of $45,000; the letter was ignored as were subsequent requests for payment

sent by the plaintiffs (between October 1994 and August 1995) to the defendants. All the

reminders to the defendants for payment were signed by Tay who was apparently unaware (not

being told by Ong) that the defendants had paid a deposit of $200,000 to the plaintiffs

towards end May 1994.</p>
<p align="justify">12. Things came to a head when, by a letter dated 26 August 1995 to the

defendants, the plaintiffs stated they would not accede to the defendants’ request

for new/additional drawings for the project while the plaintiffs’ bills remained

unpaid. By October 1994, the plaintiffs had billed the defendants a total of $2,271,958.82

for the project. At Ricky Goh’s request, Danny Goh approached the plaintiffs’

office manager to arrange a meeting between Ong and Ricky Goh to discuss the

plaintiffs’ outstanding fees. A meeting was tentatively fixed for 7 September 1995

but Ricky Goh was unable to attend. Accordingly Danny Goh tried to re-fix another

appointment for Ong and Ricky Goh to meet. Before the parties could meet, the

defendants’ deputy general manager Carol Lee called the plaintiffs’ office on 15

September 1995 to arrange a meeting to discuss the layout for the project; she was

apparently informed ‘<i>no payment no meeting’</i>. </p>
<p align="justify">13. Ricky Goh was furious when told of the plaintiffs’ stand. On

the defendants’ behalf, he faxed a letter on the same day to the plaintiffs

instructing them to <i>‘stop all the Qingdao architect work with immediate

effect’</i> (see 15AB-229). The plaintiffs (through Tay) replied to the fax also on

15 September 1995, explaining their stand and forwarding again the plaintiffs’

outstanding bills.</p>
<p align="justify">14. There was no further correspondence between the parties until the

defendants received the plaintiffs’ letter dated 7 March 1996 (15AB-228) requesting a

confirmation of the plaintiffs’ fees (based on 1% and 1.5% of 4 items) before the

plaintiffs proceeded with further work. The plaintiffs gave notice that if the defendants

did not agree to the new fee structure, then their previous fee proposal (based on 3%)

would stand.</p>
<p align="justify">15. Sometime after the plaintiffs’ letter dated 7 March 1996,

Ricky Goh and Danny Goh met Ong to discuss drawings which the defendants requested of but

which were not provided by, the plaintiffs. The defendants followed up the discussion with

a letter dated 9 May 1996 to the plaintiffs enclosing the defendants’ estimate

($591,637.88) of the plaintiffs’ fees based on the estimated construction costs of

the project with a breakdown for each of the items. The estimate of $591,637.88 covered

the construction costs of the Marina (which included a hotel, marina clubhouse, shopping

mall/complex and office tower) as well as the residential portion (studio apartments,

shophouses, condominium and bungalows) of the project. The estimate was based on the

construction costs in China then prevailing converted into Singapore currency based on a

conversion rate of Chinese renminbi (RMB) 5.90 to S$1.00.</p>
<p align="justify">16. The defendants claimed that Ong, in a telephone conversation with

Danny Goh on or about 4 July 1996, had agreed to accept a lump sum fee of $600,000 for the

project and also to provide outstanding drawings as well as some additional drawings.

Taking into account the defendants’ deposit of $200,000, the defendants claimed that

Ong had requested that a sum of $300,000 be paid first and the balance of $100,000

($600,000 - ($200,000 <font face="Arial OUP">+</font> $300,000) be paid when the

plaintiffs provided the drawings requested by the defendants. They said on 5 July 1996,

Ong had visited the defendants’ office where Danny Goh handed him a letter dated 4

July 1996 (signed by Ricky Goh) together with the defendants’ cheque for $300,000; he

requested Ong to acknowledge the letter. Ong had inquired if it was because the defendants

did not trust him. Danny Goh replied that as the parties had reached an agreement, Ong

should sign the letter to confirm; Ong then signed his name above the date <b>5.7.97</b>

(which year is incorrect), made a notation against his signature and left with the

defendants’ Bank of China cheque no. 918844 (the cheque) dated 5 July 1996. </p>
<p align="justify">17. As the dispute between the parties centred on the interpretation of

this letter, it is necessary to set out in full its contents; the letter addressed to the

plaintiffs (see 15AB-233/234) reads:-</p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Further to the tele-conversation between your goodself and our Mr Danny

  Goh, we wish to put on record on the few issues that was agreed on. </p>
<p align="justify">During the discussion, it was agreed that the architectural fee for

  Qingdao International City and Marina City will be a lump sum of S$600,000.</p>
<p align="justify">To date a total of S$200,000 was paid for the project and there is a

  balance of S$400,000. You have proposed to us to pay your company a sum of S$300,000 and

  the remaining S$100,000 to be paid upon completion of all architectural drawings including

  detail drawings and dimensional drawings. </p>
<p align="justify">It was also agreed upon that the Architects Group Associates to provide

  layout plans for Marina 5-Star Hotel and Marina Club. We have requested your company to

  co-ordinate with our Consultants and China Architect and, also redesign a new plan for the

  5-star Hotel and Marina Club.</p>
<p align="justify">Architects Group Associates are to propose 5 designs for 15 blocks of

  22-storey apartments and 10 designs for the hilltops 2 and 3 storey bungalows for the

  Marina City. </p>
<p align="justify">It is made clear to Architects Group Associates that they are to

  co-ordinate with our China Architects for any amendments when the need arise. And upon

  completion of all these works due by your group, you are to furnish us 5 complete sets of

  the final drawings of the whole Qingdao project. </p>
<p align="justify">We would like Architects Group Associates to propose 5 bungalow designs

  and 5 semi-detached designs – south facing, for the International City.</p>
<p align="justify">Lastly, we would like to draw to your attention that we have not

  received bungalow design S1 elevation 3 drawings for Marina City. And in future should

  there be any shortage of the previous drawings, our Ms Carol Lee will liaise with your Mr

  Tay.</p>
<p align="justify">I trust the above is in order and looking forward to work harmoniously

  with you.</p>
</blockquote></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">18. To their surprise, on the following day, the defendants received

the plaintiffs’ letter dated 5 July 1996 signed by Ong (see 15AB-235) which inter

alia stated:-</p>
<blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3"><p align="justify">Your letter dated 4<sup>th</sup>

  July refers.</p>
<p align="justify">Your payment based on what we have agreed is acceptable. Computations

  of the total fee will be subject to final calculation later. This initial payment is to

  defray the works already done as agreed for both Qingdao International City and the

  Marinas</p></font>.

</blockquote>
<p align="justify">19. Ricky Goh telephoned Ong upon receipt of the letter and inquired

why Ong had reneged on their agreement. He claimed Ong apologised and gave the excuse that

Tay did not agree to the lump sum fee of $600,000. Ong added that the plaintiffs would not

present the cheque of $300,000 for payment until such time as a settlement was reached.</p>
<p align="justify">20. Nothing happened until shortly before 1 September 1997, when Ong

telephoned Ricky Goh to inquire whether the defendants’ offer of $600,000 could be

increased to $1m; Ricky Goh refused. The defendants then received a letter from the

defendants’ legal adviser dated 1 September 1997 (see 15AB-238) which reads as

follows:-</p>
<blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3"><p align="justify">We refer to the

  above and our letters dated 7 March 1996 and 5 July 1996 respectively, copies of which are

  enclosed herewith for your easy reference</p></font>.

  <font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3"><p align="justify">In particular, your

  good office had sent us a Bank of China cheque no. 918844 drawn in our favour for a sum of

  S$300,000 dated 5 July 1996. Subsequently, soon after, we received your instructions not

  to bank in the said cheque. </p>
<p align="justify">However, to-date, you have still not settled the outstanding fees due

  and owing to us. As such, we feel it appropriate to return the cheque as we deem you are

  not honouring the payment. In respect thereof, our agreement as enunciated in the

  aforesaid letters shall be construed as null and void by dint of your inaction.</p>
<p align="justify">Please note that we will therefore be forwarding you our billing as

  originally agreed in due course. </p>
<p align="justify">Please also note that we have been instructed by our Mr Ong Cher Keong

  to inform that legal action will be initiated against you and your Joint Venture partners

  in China or in Singapore as we deem fit without further reference if you fail and/or

Charges dated 8 September 1997 (the note of charges) in the sum of $5,334,670.47 covering

the period 1993-95 for work done on the International City, the Marina, Grandlink Square

and the Design Centre. On 22 September 1997, the defendants replied denying there was an

agreement to pay the plaintiffs based on the note of charges, reminding the plaintiffs of

the agreement reached between the parties on 4 July 1996. In the event, the plaintiffs

commenced these proceedings on 12 November 1997.</p>

<p align="justify">The pleadings</p></i>
<p align="justify">22. In the Statement of Claim, the plaintiffs alleged there was an

agreement reached in or about August 1993 (the 1993 agreement) whereby the plaintiffs

would provide certain architectural services to the defendants for the construction of the

project. The plaintiffs alleged it was further agreed that the plaintiffs’ fees for

the project would be 3% of the total construction costs payable by the defendants in

stages with 30% payable upon completion of the project. The plaintiffs asserted they

provided architectural services and in the process they incurred disbursements on behalf

of the defendants. Arising therefrom, the plaintiffs claimed the sum of $5,334,670.47 was

due and owing by the defendants which breakdown is as follows:-</p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">A. Agreed professional fee 3% of total construction cost</p>
<p align="justify">B. Estimated construction cost RMB 1,200/M²</p>
<p align="justify">C. Total estimated area of the project 2,905,026.96M²</p>
<p align="justify">D. Total estimated construction cost (B x C) S$590,852,940.90</p>
<p align="justify">E. Total architectural fee $17,725,588.23    (3% x

<p align="justify">F. Fee for work done up to design development stage (30% of total

architectural fees) $5,317,676.47</p>

<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">23. The plaintiffs alleged that apart from paying a sum of $200,000,

the defendants had, in breach of the 1993 agreement refused, neglected or failed to pay

the balance of the said $5,334,670.47 namely $5,134,670.47. In the alternative, the

plaintiffs averred that they were entitled to reasonable remuneration in carrying out the

said architectural works which sum was $5,134,670.47. The plaintiffs therefore claimed

$5,134,670.47 as the balance of agreed fees, alternatively based on quantum meruit. </p>
<p align="justify">24. In the Defence, the defendants denied that the 1993 agreement was

as alleged. They contended that the 1993 agreement reached between Ricky Goh and Ong was

to the effect that the plaintiffs would provide architectural services in the form of a

concept and master plan for the International City. They alleged that it was a term of the

1993 agreement that the plaintiffs’ fees for providing plans for the International

City would be agreed upon by the parties at a later stage, pending approval by the

relevant Chinese authorities of those plans. Further, it was an express alternatively an

implied term of the agreement, that the plaintiffs would make such amendments, changes,

modifications and or additions to the plans as required by the defendants and or the

relevant Chinese authorities.</p>
<p align="justify">25. The defendants contended that in or about late 1994 it was agreed

between Ong and Ricky Goh (the 1994 agreement) that the plaintiffs would provide a concept

and master plan for the Marina. They averred that it was similarly a term of the 1994

agreement that the plaintiffs’ fees for providing plans for the Marina would be

agreed upon at a later stage pending approval by the relevant Chinese authorities and,

that the plaintiffs would amend, modify, change or add to, the plans if the defendants or

the Chinese authorities so required.</p>
<p align="justify">26. The defendants contended that subsequent to the 1993 and 1994

agreements, namely on 4 July 1996, the parties had, by an oral agreement (the 1996

agreement) made between Ong and Danny Goh, expressly agreed that the plaintiffs would

charge a lump fee of $600,000 for the plaintiffs’ services in rendering and

finalising the plans for the International City and the Marina. They averred that the 1996

agreement was evidenced in the correspondence exchanged between the parties namely, a

letter dated 4 July 1996 from the defendants to the plaintiffs and a letter from the

plaintiffs to the defendants dated 5 July 1996.</p>
<p align="justify">27. The defendants asserted that of the lump sum fee of $600,000,

$200,000 had already been paid and $300,000 was to be paid by the defendants forthwith to

leave a balance of $100,000 which was payable upon completion of the plaintiffs’

work. The defendants contended they did pay the plaintiffs $300,000 by the (Bank of China)

cheque. As the plaintiffs’ plans for the International City and the Marina had not

yet been approved in their entirety by the Chinese authorities to whom the plans had been

submitted and, the plaintiffs had refused or neglected to complete their work, the balance

$100,000 of the lump sum fee was not yet payable.</p>
<p align="justify">28. The defendants asserted that as the parties were unable to agree on

the plaintiffs’ fees and the plaintiffs were not co-operative in rendering the

services they had agreed to provide, the defendants were left with no alternative but to

request the plaintiffs on 15 September 1995 to stop further work on the project pending

agreement on the plaintiffs’ fees. Between 15 September 1995 and 4 July 1996 the

parties made several attempts at negotiations which ultimately resulted in the 1996

agreement.</p>
<p align="justify">29. In its Reply, the plaintiffs contended that the scope of their

services for the project extended beyond providing a concept and master plan. They averred

it was further agreed between the parties that:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">a. the defendants would instruct the plaintiffs on their design brief

  containing the design parameters and the defendants’ general requirements in respect

  of the project;</p>
<p align="justify">b. the plaintiffs would make such amendments, modifications changes and

  or additions as the defendants requested so long as they fell within the plaintiffs’

  scope of works;</p>
<p align="justify">c. the plaintiffs’ fee for their services for the project would be

  equivalent to 3% of the total construction costs which amount was to be paid to the

  plaintiffs in stages with 30% upon completion of the design development stage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">30. The plaintiffs alleged that it agreed to the 1996 agreement because

of the defendants’ financial difficulties and, that the plaintiffs would only charge

$600,000 as a matter of goodwill for works done up to the design development stage, on

condition that $300,000 was to be paid immediately. They alleged that the defendants

issued the cheque in or around July 1996 to the plaintiffs but the plaintiffs were

informed not to present the cheque for payment as there were no funds in the

defendants’ bank account. The plaintiffs then returned the cheque to the defendants

in September 1997. The defendants were therefore in breach of the 1996 agreement which was

rendered null and void due to a total failure of consideration. In the circumstances, the

(original) fees under the 1993 agreement applied.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The evidence </p>
<p align="justify">(i) the plaintiffs’ case</p></i>
<p align="justify">31. I preface my review of the plaintiff’ evidence with certain

observations which are pertinent to my subsequent findings. Although Ong claimed in his

written testimony that the plaintiffs were ranked as one of the world’s top 500

architectural firms (by a magazine called World Architecture), it was adduced from him in

cross-examination that the ranking was based on architectural firms writing to the said

magazine ‘by invitation’ to volunteer information; Ong was unaware of the basis

of such ‘invitations’. Neither could he disagree with the suggestion of counsel

for the defendants that the magazine’s ranking was not based on reputation or quality

of service provided by the firms listed. It should be noted that at the material time, the

plaintiffs only had Ong and Tay as registered architects. </p>
<p align="justify">32. In his written testimony, Ong had also deposed that he had acted as

an independent expert witness in a few construction disputes. Questioned on this

credential, Ong clarified the disputes he was involved in were between purchasers and

contractors over the quality of floor finishes but he had never been involved in any case

concerning the quantum of architects’ fees.</p>
<p align="justify">33. Cross-examination of Ong (who was the first of the plaintiffs’

three (3) witnesses) adduced the following evidence:- </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">a. he asserted that the 21 projects he undertook for the

  defendants’ group of companies and/or Ricky Goh were based on the standard form of

  contract of the Singapore Institute of Architects (SIA), in that the plaintiffs’ fees

  were based on a percentage of the construction costs;</p>
<p align="justify">b. he was of the view that the mode of payment spelt out in the SIA

  form of contract applied to this case. In any event, the plaintiffs followed the SIA mode

  of payment and the defendants paid;</p>
<p align="justify">c. for a previous project at Dongshan (for which he provided concept

  plans to Ricky Goh), Ong said he worked on the project for almost a year during which he

  prepared less drawings (perhaps 100) than the 200 or so the plaintiffs produced for this

  case; the area developed at Dongshan was smaller (40-60 sq. km.) than that at Qingdao. He

  did not charge for his services for the Dongshan project as he was Ricky Goh’s

  co-investor;</p>
<p align="justify">d. however, he denied he was initially involved in the project as a

  co-investor and had agreed with Ricky Goh that the plaintiffs’ fees would be used to

  pay for his share of the investment. He denied that during the period he was a

  co-investor, there was no agreement by the defendants to pay him for plans he had done. He

  further denied he changed his mind about investing when the time came for him to pay, that

  Ricky Goh accepted his decision and agreed to appoint the plaintiffs as architects for the

  project on condition they were paid only for plans which were used or approved by the

  Qingdao authorities – that could not be the case as the defendants made sales at the

  exhibition based on the plaintiffs’ plans;</p>
<p align="justify">e. the construction of the International City was ‘complex’

  because Ricky Goh as a layman would/could not understand the infrastructure and support

  services that were needed to make the project viable;</p>
<p align="justify">f. the project encompassed 67 sq. km. and it was envisaged that

  development would span 25 years;</p>
<p align="justify">g. he denied there was no agreement on the 3% fee the plaintiffs

  claimed let alone that it was an afterthought which he tried to justify in his affidavit;</p>
<p align="justify">h. it was from figures discussed with Chinese officials and those he

  obtained from quantity surveyors Langdon Every &amp; Seah that he felt construction costs

  in China were 1/7<sup>th </sup>of those in Singapore;</p>
<p align="justify">i. of the twelve (12) or so China projects the plaintiffs were involved

  in (according to Ong’s list in exhibit OCK-2 of his affidavit), only one preceded the

  project;</p>
<p align="justify">j. he agreed that for the other 21 projects he undertook for Ricky

  Goh’s various companies, payment for the plaintiffs’ services was agreed on a

  lump sum basis but he denied that the fees were agreed <u>after</u> the plaintiffs had

  commenced work on the projects concerned. Ong asserted that the lump sum fees were final

  figures both sides accepted at a later stage of each project – either when

  construction was about to start or a project was about to be or was, launched. The reason

  was because he and Danny Goh could never agree on the cost of construction for purposes of

  calculating the plaintiffs’ architectural fees. Even then, the final figures agreed

  were very close to 3% of construction costs save that the plaintiffs compromised on the

  rates;</p>
<p align="justify">k. the plaintiffs’ staff were present at the defendants’

  sales exhibition to answer ‘technical questions’ from guests and potential

  purchasers including matters concerning orientation, location, site reference to other

  areas and sizes of units.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">34. I should point out that Ong’s testimony in para 33(j) was not

borne out by the example he cited; he had referred to a project of the defendants’

subsidiary Escada Development Pte Ltd at Lengkong Empat called Escada View, for which the

plaintiffs were paid $280,000 as architects’ fees. He testified that the figure was

based on 3% ($267,000 rounded up) of Danny Goh’s estimate of $8.9m construction costs

against his own figure of $10-$14m. However, counsel for the defendants drew Ong’s

attention to a letter dated 25 January 1994 (see 15AB-323) from the said developer (signed

by Ricky Goh) addressed to the main contractor awarding the construction contract at

$29.8m based upon which 3% should equate $894,000. Ong explained that the difference was

because the lump sum fee of $280,000 had been agreed earlier, in October 1992, at which

time he was not given the figure of $29.8m.</p>
<p align="justify">35. Although he denied that he had agreed to lump sum fees for the

project, Ong admitted he did tell Ricky Goh and Danny Goh at one stage that he would

charge fixed fees for designs of bungalow, terrace house and condominium. Even so, he

contended, that did not mean that the plaintiffs had agreed to a lump sum fee. However,

apart from the 200 or so drawings upon which the plaintiffs based their claim, Ong was

unable to substantiate the additional work he claimed to have carried out for the project,

including market surveys, studies and research. </p>
<p align="justify">36. I move next to the evidence of Tay (PW2). According to Tay (see

exhibit TCB1 in his affidavit), his time charges alone incurred on 6 trips to China for

the project came to $120,000 @ $250 per hour, for a minimum of ten (10) days per trip.

Based on the table set out in Tay’s exhibit TCB1, the plaintiffs would have spent 142

months (11 years 8 months) working continuously on the project. Due to the enormity of the

project, Tay said he worked on it exclusively and was assisted by a team of 10-15 staff

(including assistant architects, designers and clerk of works) who occupied the entire

floor at #05-08 Fu Lu Shou Complex and also devoted their time solely to the project.</p>
<p align="justify">37. Tay said he received piecemeal instructions from Ricky Goh to

provide architectural design drawings for the four (4) sectors of the project, for

submission to Chinese contractors for conversion into construction drawings. By Tay’s

estimate, the plaintiffs’ designs would be classified up to <font face="Monotype Hadassah">Ž</font> of the details that would go into drawings for

Singapore’s Building and Planning stage of design, under SIA’s standard form of

contract. Besides having to liaise with Chinese contractors to ensure they converted the

plaintiffs’ drawings according to the plaintiffs’ specifications and intent, Tay

claimed that the plaintiffs were also required to give regular presentations to Ricky Goh

(and his team) as well as full architectural drawing support by presentation to and

liaison with, the Chinese authorities. He also spent time visiting sites in Singapore and

looking at magazines to reinforce the plaintiffs’ design direction for particular

areas, prior to receiving the actual plans from Ong.</p>
<p align="justify">38. Although the plaintiffs produced eleven (11) volumes of drawings in

the course of this lengthy trial, Tay said they were incomplete and the plaintiffs did at

least 20% more drawings, designs, layout plans, elevations and artistes’ impressions

which he was unable to produce for three (3) reasons:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">1. nearly all the designs done were subject to numerous amendments,

  re-amendments and changes; some initial designs were not kept but discarded;</p>
<p align="justify">2. the plaintiffs moved office from Fu Lu Shou Complex to their present

  premises in September 1997; in the process, many designs and drawings were not packed but

  discarded while others were misplaced;</p>
<p align="justify">3. some missing drawings were in the defendants’ possession or

  with their Chinese contractors for purposes of converting into constructions drawings;

  others were borrowed by the defendants and not returned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">39. Tay said he first became aware of the project in or about September

1993. When Ong commenced his exploratory trips to China, Tay would receive instructions

from Ong by fax or telephone; the first instruction came on 15 September 1993 via a faxed

plan of the area in Qingdao to be developed for the project. This was followed by

subsequent faxes containing Ong’s rough sketches of plots chosen by Ricky Goh and

what would be contained in those plots. Tay and his team would then prepare drawings and

designs based on those sketches encompassing sectors (6) which were described as:- </p>
<p align="justify">(i) general housing/condominium; </p>
<p align="justify">(ii) studio apartments; </p>
<p align="justify">(iii) shophouse/recreational areas; </p>
<p align="justify">(iv) war gaming centre; </p>
<p align="justify">(v) turf club;</p>
<p align="justify">(vi) bungalow/semi-detached units.</p>
<p align="justify">The drawings included flats and bungalow units of different variations

(including studio apartments, 2-3 and 4-5 room units). Amendments were made to zoning and

layout plans and there were at least three (3) changes of plots for the studio apartments,

gaming centre and turf club. As there was a resultant change in the shapes of the plots,

the drawings and designs had to be re-done. Tay testified that one change of plot was due

to the presence of an underground electric power cable, another was to provide for a

buffer zone between edges of different plots, a third was due to the presence of

villages/brick factory, a fourth was because rocks embedded below the surface made piling

impossible, the entire bungalow sector was shifted and yet another shift was needed to

accommodate a rock known as ‘Old Man’s Rock’ – in March 1995, the

Qingdao authorities wanted a protruding rock in the sea to be visible right through the

Marina as it had a historical significance; this requirement necessitated amendments to

drawings previously prepared.</p>
<p align="justify">40. According to Tay, no designs, drawings or sectors were spared from

amendments and changes. As examples, he testified that units of low cost housing were

increased, blocks of studio apartments were increased to 16 from their original six (6)

storeys (necessitating the installation of lifts), one (1) design for the bungalows was

changed to 12 variations while a bungalow (with a ‘grand’ design) was sited on a

hilltop for Ricky Goh’s occupation, semi-detached houses had two (2) variations, the

Marina was pushed further out to sea, the podium of the hotel was raised to four (4)

levels, a four-storey shopping complex was added to the office units, the height of the

office towers was increased to 38 storeys (although the Chinese authorities actually

wanted 52 storeys) with a penthouse added for Ricky Goh’s self-occupation. Ricky Goh

also wanted the low cost housing units and certain other developments, to be more

‘grand’. Finally, because the hotel had to be air-conditioned, the plaintiffs

had to liaise with air-conditioner suppliers Daikin (as well as other suppliers) to make

sure that the development was air-conditioner friendly.</p>
<p align="justify">41. Tay had filed a lengthy affidavit for his evidence-in-chief

comprising 139 paragraphs in 27 pages much of which was taken up with the amount of work

done and the time spent, by the plaintiffs on the project, in order to justify the quantum

of the plaintiffs’ claim. Further, the plaintiffs had an alternative claim in quantum

meruit. Not surprisingly, for the two (2) days he spent in the witness box, Tay was

cross-examined at length on both bases of the plaintiffs’ claim.</p>
<p align="justify">42. In the course of cross-examination Tay revealed that:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">a. he was assisted by ten (10) other architects who were not registered

  architects as such but included graduates from the local school of architecture;</p>
<p align="justify">b. he had relied solely on endorsements in his and Ong’s passports

  to work out the number of trips to China the plaintiffs charged the defendants but, he had

  also made trips to China on other businesses and so did Ong;</p>
<p align="justify">c. he prepared drawings and designs based on Ricky Goh’s

  instructions that approximately 10 [not 2] sq. km (out of a total of 67 sq. km allocated

  by the Qingdao government for the project) was slated for residential development, the

  area involved was as big as Toa Payoh;</p>
<p align="justify">d. the plaintiffs made provision for at least 2,000 units of bungalows,

  phases 1 and 2 consisted of 1,124 units (including semi-detached units) and formed the

  basis of the plaintiffs’ fees; eventually only 32 bungalows were built; </p>
<p align="justify">e. he was unaware that the defendants only used 6 out of the 12

  variations of bungalow designs;</p>
<p align="justify">f. he disagreed that even after the plaintiffs amended their drawings

  for the Marina to accommodate the ‘Old Man’s Rock’, the plaintiffs’

  plans were still not approved by the Qingdao authorities but conceded he did not follow up

  with the Chinese engineers/contractors on the amended plans;</p>
<p align="justify">g. he was not aware that the plaintiffs’ plans for Grandlink

  Square were not approved as the defendants did not inform him;</p>
<p align="justify">h. he was not privy to what transpired in July 1996 between Ong and

  Ricky Goh or Danny Goh, he concentrated on the architectural side of the services provided

  to the defendants while Ong handled the business side of the relationship including

  negotiation of the plaintiffs’ fees;</p>
<p align="justify">i. before the Qingdao project, he had worked (without charge) on Ricky

  Goh’s Dongshan project but disagreed with Ong’s estimate that the latter spanned

  a year – all in, the time spent was about three (3) months;</p>
<p align="justify">j. when he wrote to the defendants on 17 October 1994 to ask for

  payment of $2,271,958.82, the bill was based on 1.5% not 3% of total construction costs

  based on gross floor area (GFA) because he knew the defendants would be difficult when it

  came to payment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">43. Tay clarified under re-examination that when he/Ong made

presentations to the Qingdao authorities, it was only of the final drawings –

amendments and changes were not shown to them. Further, the presentations were for the

purpose of obtaining feedback from the authorities, not their approvals. Thereafter, Tay

and Ong would meet Ricky Goh to discuss what the Qingdao authorities required before

making further amendments. This was a continuing process until the time the defendants

launched the project. In answer to the Court’s query, Tay claimed that the Marina

hotel could be sold even before it was built. In any case, it came to his knowledge that

the defendants did launch sales of the Marina. To another question from the Court, Tay

said Ricky Goh had a <i>carte blanche</i> from the Qingdao authorities and did not need

their approval – he could build what he wanted, where he wanted and how he wanted

because he had such a good relationship (<i>guanxi</i>) with the authorities (N/E 162). As

for the change of site due to the presence of villages and a brick factory, this was due

to no fault of the plaintiffs – Tay had been instructed to design on the premise that

he was doing so on a flat piece of land; he was told that whatever obstructions that

existed would be removed which apparently turned out not to be the case. He could not/did

not follow-up on the plaintiffs’ designs as he was not introduced to any Chinese

architects. However the Chinese officials who were usually with Ricky Goh had seen and

liked the plaintiffs’ plans. I should point out that this portion of Tay’s

testimony was disputed by Ricky Goh when he took the witness stand; he said the plaintiffs

did not even prepare the master plan – it was the work of Shanghai Tongji University.

</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">(ii) the defendants’ case </p></i>
<p align="justify">44. Ricky Goh (DW2) was the defendants’ principal witness apart

from their expert witness Gan Eng Hoon (Gan). Ricky Goh’s cross-examination took more

than five (5) days as he disagreed with almost the entire testimony of Tay and Ong. I

shall consider his testimony with regards to the plaintiffs’ claim first and deal

with the defendants’ evidence (and the plaintiffs’) on the issue of the cheque

later.</p>
<p align="justify">45. On the question of the plaintiffs’ scope of works, Ricky Goh

disagreed with Ong’s (and Tay’s) testimony on the following salient points:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">a. that the project occupied not 2 but 10 sq. km. out of a total of 67

  sq. km; </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">b. that the plaintiffs’ scope of works went beyond drawings and

  concept plans; </p>
<p align="justify">c. that an agreement was reached in August 1993 or at any other time to

  pay the plaintiffs their fees based on 3% of total construction costs up to design

  development stage;</p>
<p align="justify">d. that the plaintiffs would be paid for all the plans and drawings

  they prepared and not only for approved concept plans;</p>
<p align="justify">e. that the plaintiffs’ fees should be calculated on an estimated

  gross floor area of 10 sq. km (2,905,026.96) multiplied by RMB 1,200 per sq.m.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">f. that Ong was never a prospective co-investor; </p>
<p align="justify">g. that the Marina was built let alone that units there were sold;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">h. that there was low cost housing as part of the project; </p>
<p align="justify">i. that plans for the Dongshan (and Xiamen) proposed developments

  spanned a few months instead of 2 years;</p>
<p align="justify">j. on the purportedly vast number of drawings the plaintiffs said they

  prepared for the project;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">k. that various sites had to be shifted for various reasons;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">l. that the plaintiffs had advised on the specifications for import of

  items; he had not even seen their list before this litigation. In any event the items were

  never and need not be, imported as they were available in China; </p>
<p align="justify">m. that Ong had told him the plaintiffs charged Dragon Land fees based

  on 3% of total construction costs;</p>
<p align="justify">n. that Ong became a director of Ricky Ong’s companies to lend

  those companies ‘credibility’. </p>

<p align="justify">46. Ricky Goh revealed that Ong produced many master and concept plans

for Dongshan (which covered 40 sq. km) and Xiamen (30 – 40 times more than for the

project) but these were all rejected by the Chinese authorities; hence the defendants did

not proceed with their proposed developments in those areas; even so the defendants built

52 villas in Dongshan. He also testified that after he had forwarded to the plaintiffs the

defendants’ letter dated 19 September 1995 marked for Tay’s attention, Ong had

telephoned him to inquire why he (Ricky Goh) had mentioned to Tay the defendants’

deposit of $200,000 which payment Ong apparently had not informed Tay. It had resulted in

a quarrel between Tay and Ong as the former did not agree to the defendants being charged

a lump sum fee of $600,000. Although Ricky Goh had officially told the plaintiffs to stop

work by the defendants’ letter dated 15 September 1995, they had ceased work much

earlier. </p>
<p align="justify">47. Ricky Goh explained why Ong had a change of heart on being an

investor in the project. Ong (together with other supposed investors) got ‘cold

feet’ after the April 1994 sales exhibition where 500 units were sold and only $2.5m

was collected by way of deposits – the sum was barely enough to cover the costs of

holding the exhibition and other incidental expenses. Ricky Goh had then called for his

fellow investors (10 or more) to pay up their share of capital as by then, he had paid a

deposit of RMB 4m towards the land cost (of RMB 12m) for the project; it was at that

juncture that Ong withdrew as an investor and requested that the plaintiffs be appointed

architects instead, albeit with a limited mandate. As an indication of the extent of

Ong’s commitment had he been a co-investor, Ricky Goh testified that up to the trial

stage, the defendants had invested RMB 300m-400m into the project which, based on an

exchange rate of S$1.00 to RMB 5.00 would amount to S$60m-80m. Just for the International

City alone, the defendants spent in excess of RMB 47m (see breakdown in D9).</p>
<p align="justify">48. In the midst of trial (on Sunday 12 September 1999), Ricky Goh flew

to Qingdao and took photographs (see exhibit D6) to rebut Tay’s assertion that the

defendants had sold units in the Marina --- D6 clearly showed that the Marina was never

built, because the local authorities rejected the defendants’ proposed plans on or

about 15 November 1996. Similarly no approval was given for Grandlink Square nor for the

recreational centre, war gaming range and golf club range. The photographs also rebutted

Tay’s claim that Ricky Goh asked for the heights of studio apartments to be

increased. To reinforce his testimony, Ricky Goh also produced approval letters and

construction permits (D3-D5) issued to the defendants by the Qingdao authorities for

general housing/studio apartments, shops, bungalows and semi-detached houses, as well as a

rejection letter (D2) for the Marina. He pointed out that Ong prepared drawings for the

Design Centre in 1993 <u>before</u> the plaintiffs were appointed architects for the

project; hence the plaintiffs were not entitled to payment in any event. </p>
<p align="justify">49. As against the plaintiffs’ estimated figures (which he

described as grossly inflated), Ricky Goh was able to provide the actual construction

costs for the International City, as construction had been completed in 1996. The total

GFA for the International City came to 113,740.40 sq. m which, multiplied by RMB 700 per

sq.m for cost of construction multiplied by 1% came to S$176,827.56. If the calculation

was based on the plaintiffs’ estimated GFA for the Marina and Grandlink Square but

multiplied by RMB 700 per sq.m, 1% would amount to S$414,810.32. Accordingly, the

plaintiffs were at best entitled to S$591,647.88 as their total fees ($176,827.56 +

$414,810.32). He also pointed out that the area covered by the plaintiffs’ drawings

was only about 5% of 10 sq. km. </p>
<p align="justify">50. Ricky Goh testified that although Ong was not paid for his work

done on the aborted Dongshan project, he (Ricky Goh) had paid for all the travelling

expenses incurred by Ong and his 4-5 staff every time they visited China and he provided

them with free accommodation at his Dongshan hotel. Similarly, the defendants paid for the

travelling expenses of Ong and Tay for the project. Although Ong said mock-ups were

prepared for presentation to the Dongshan authorities, he omitted to mention that it was

Ricky Goh who paid for the costs amounting to S$250,000 - S$300,000 as the mock-ups were

ordered from Singapore. These mock-ups were plastic and were considerably bigger that the

styrofoam model produced by the plaintiffs in Court (see exhibit P9); hence they were more

costly.</p>
<p align="justify">51. In the course of her testimony, Esther (PW3) had produced a

controversial letter dated 15 July 1996 (exhibit P8) written to the plaintiffs by the

defendants purportedly signed by Ricky Goh. Counsel for the defendants had taken the stand

that the plaintiffs had drafted the letter for the defendants’ signature as, the copy

initially produced in court did not have the defendants’ signature; this was denied

by Esther. However, after she produced the signed copy in P8, Ricky Goh (who could not

recall signing it but accepted he did) pointed out that the contents were no different

from those in the defendants’ letter dated 4 July 1996 (para 17 supra) which Ong had

acknowledged. The contents of P8 are as follows:- </p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">We confirmed that we have disagreed with the fees you are claiming for

  the above projects that your company has carried out for us in China. </p>
<p align="justify">As such we are not paying for the invoices that you have billed us

  dated October 1994.</p>
<p align="justify">We will only pay upon confirmation of the fees and works done on site.

  As such the bills submitted is [sic] withdrawn.</p>

  which S$200,0000 had been paid, the apportionment of the balance payment of S$400,000 will

<p align="justify">S$300,000 to be paid by this week and the remaining S$100,000 to be

  cleared when all outstanding information required by our manager Ms Carol Lee has been

  given.</p>
</blockquote></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Ricky Goh said he thought the words <i>all outstanding information </i>in

P8 referred to lay-out plans and designs he had asked for in his earlier letter dated 4

July 1996. He also pointed out (N/E-320/321) that a number of designs the defendants

adopted for the project (including those for the semi-detached houses and bungalows) were

taken from the defendants’ Singapore projects for which they had already paid the

plaintiffs their fees. Ricky Goh further asserted that the Qingdao authorities rejected

Ong’s bungalow designs (see 4-AB4/5) as looking like ‘military barracks’

(N/E 322).</p>
<p align="justify">52. Cross-examined, Ricky Ong denied either the plaintiffs or

Ong’s previous firm were paid architects’ fees based on 3% of construction costs

– fees were always agreed on a lump sum basis after bargaining and after the

plaintiffs had commenced work on a particular project. If it was a big project, the

plaintiffs’ fees were lower and vice versa if the development was only a few units.</p>
<p align="justify">53. As stated earlier (para 44), the defendants had Gan as an expert

witness. He (DW1) is the executive chairman of DP Architects Pte Ltd (DP Architects) and

has been a registered architect since 1967 both in Singapore as well as in Malaysia; he

had had over thirty (30) years of experience as an architect in both countries. Although

he was not registered as an architect elsewhere, Gan pointed out that he collaborated with

architects on projects in other countries including the Philippines, China, Hong Kong,

India and Indonesia. His firm’s impressive credentials included the design of Wisma

Atria and the massive Suntec City development for which DP Architects earned very

substantial architectural fees; the firm’s current local projects included The

Esplanade – Arts by the Bay, Nanyang Polytechnic and the Camden Medical Centre. </p>
<p align="justify">54. Gan testified that when he was briefed by Ricky Goh and Danny Goh

to be the defendants’ expert witness, he was handed the plaintiffs’ drawings and

plans for all sectors of the project (10-11 volumes), the specifications, the sales

documents, the manpower and expenditure for the project as well as relevant

correspondence. After he had considered all the documents, Gan arrived at a figure of

$560,000 as the total reasonable fees payable to the plaintiffs for the work they carried

out for the defendants on the project. He said in the context of Singapore and Malaysia,

the provision of concept plans would constitute about 15% of the total work which an

architect is required to do in a particular project. A breakdown for his figure of

$560,000 was set out in his letter dated 3 September 1999 to the defendants which was

exhibited in his affidavit (see GEO-3). Gan’s breakdown make provision for every

sector which the defendants intended to build but had not, including the hotel and even

the golf driving and war gaming ranges save for the Marina, since the plaintiffs’

proposal for its development was not approved by the provincial government. I should point

out that as against Tay’s claim of 142 months for time spent on the project, Gan came

up with an estimate of 3 months, based on the drawings the plaintiffs had produced.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The cheque</p>
<p align="justify">(i) the plaintiffs’ version </p></i>
<p align="justify">55. I turn next to the controversy surrounding the cheque. First, I

refer to Esther’s evidence. Although she had no knowledge about the dispute between

the plaintiffs and the defendants, Esther said she was aware that the defendants had not

been paying the plaintiffs’ bills for the project (even for disbursements of

$16,994), save for one payment of $200,000 in May 1994, despite many reminders. When Ong

gave her the cheque on 4 July 1996, he said that he had not read the defendants’

covering letter when the cheque was handed to him; he read it later and realised it did

not reflect the true understanding reached between himself and Danny Goh – that the

figure of $600,000 was to defray ongoing costs and expenses incurred by the plaintiffs up

to that date, for the project. Hence Ong sent a fax (see para 18 above) to Danny Goh the

following day to clarify the position regarding fees payable to the plaintiffs. On

Ong’s instructions, Esther telephoned Danny Goh after the plaintiffs’ said fax

to inquire whether the cheque could be presented for payment. She was told by Danny Goh to

hold onto the cheque as he was arranging to transfer funds to the defendants’ Bank of

China account to cover the amount; otherwise the cheque would be dishonoured. She was

further instructed to wait for Danny Goh’s confirmation before presenting the cheque

for payment. As she did not receive his confirmation thereafter, she contacted him a few

times to inquire and on those occasions he told her again not to bank-in the cheque –

in fact, he actively avoided her telephone calls. Consequently, the cheque was returned to

the defendants under cover of the plaintiffs’ letter dated 1 September 1997 (see para

20 above).</p>
<p align="justify">56. On his part, Ong denied he had agreed to withhold presenting the

cheque for payment – Danny Goh had promised immediate payment of the sum. Danny

Goh’s allegation that the plaintiffs withheld presenting the cheque for payment for

their own reasons was untrue. There was no reason for the plaintiffs to do that when they

had been demanding payment for such a long time. In his written testimony, Ong also

asserted that the defendants’ contention that the cheque was forwarded to the

plaintiffs as an advance payment was a blatant lie – he pointed out that the

defendants had not produced bank account statements to substantiate that contention.

Unfortunately for the plaintiffs, Ong’s challenge was taken up by the defendants as

can be seen from the next paragraph. </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">(ii) the defendants’ version</p></i>
<p align="justify">57. Danny Goh denied he had requested the plaintiffs to withhold

presenting the cheque for payment and that the defendants did not have sufficient funds to

cover the cheque. Taking up Ong’s challenge, he reinforced his denials by referring

to the defendants’ Bank of China statement for the month of July 1996 (see 15AB-276)

which clearly showed that the defendants had a credit balance of $301,030.98 in their Bank

of China account as at 6 July 1996. As the cheque could only be presented for payment on 5

July 1996 or later, there was no possibility it would have been dishonoured if it had been

cleared by the Bank of China on 6 July 1996.</p>
<p align="justify">58. Danny Goh testified he had discussed with Ong on the telephone the

plaintiffs’ fees for the project; this was on 4 July 1996 before the defendants’

letter forwarding the cheque. He had then informed Ong that by the defendants’

computations made on 9 May 1995, the plaintiffs’ fees approximated $591,637.88. Danny

Goh said he was willing to round-up the defendants’ figure to $600,000 provided the

plaintiffs furnished some drawings that had not been provided to the defendants despite

their request. In response, Ong proposed the defendants pay $300,000 plus another $100,000

upon completion of the drawings requested; Danny Goh agreed and told Ong to call at the

defendants’ office the following day to collect the cheque for $300,000. That was how

the defendants’ letter of 4 July 1996 came to be prepared by Danny Goh and signed by

Ricky Goh. On the following day (5 July 1996), Ong came to the defendants’ office

where he was handed the letter which he read and acknowledged at Danny Goh’s request.</p>
<p align="justify">59. Danny Goh testified that the defendants were surprised to receive

the plaintiffs’ letter dated 6 July 1996 which contradicted the understanding he had

reached with Ong on the plaintiffs’ fees. The defendants therefore wrote to the

plaintiffs on the same day (see 15AB-236) to record their disagreement with his statement

that <i>computation of the total fee will be subject to final calculation later</i>; they

did not hear further from the plaintiffs until the defendants’ receipt of the letter

from the plaintiffs’ legal adviser dated 1 September 1997, returning the cheque. As

Ong had reneged on the agreement he had reached with Danny Goh, Ricky Goh instructed the

Bank of China not to honour the cheque. According to Ricky Goh, another reason why the

amount of $300,000 was not maintained in the said account after 6 July 1996 was because

Ong had told him the plaintiffs did not want to bank-in the cheque.</p>
<p align="justify">60. Some time before 23 July 1996, Ong contacted Danny Goh to inquire

about the bills for the project. Danny Goh explained he was unable to pay in view of

Ong’s aforementioned letter dated 6 July 1996 but, if the plaintiffs did not dispute

the lump sum fee agreement, the defendants would pay; Ong indicated he would not dispute

the agreement. When Danny Goh asked for a letter from the plaintiffs to that effect, Ong

said he preferred that the defendants wrote to the plaintiffs in accordance with a draft

Ong would prepare. On 23 July 1996, Esther sent the defendants a draft but as it did not

reflect what Danny Goh and Ong had agreed, Danny Goh did not prepare the letter for the

defendants to sign. That draft however was the genesis of exhibit P8 which Ether denied

she had prepared and which Ricky Goh could not remember when and why he signed.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The issues</p></i>
<p align="justify">61. The issues for determination in this case are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) was there an initial agreement between Ong and Ricky Goh on

  architects’ fees payable to the plaintiffs and if so, what was agreed?;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) if there was an agreement, was it varied subsequently to a lump

  sum fee by Danny Goh and Ong?;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) if there was no fee agreed and or no variation thereof, what

  would be the plaintiffs’ entitlement to fees based on quantum meruit?</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
</blockquote>
<i>
<p align="justify">The findings </p></i>
<p align="justify">62. Ong had given a detailed account in his affidavit evidence-in-chief

of the scope of the works he/the plaintiffs undertook for the project. The impression

given was, the services he/Tay rendered went far beyond the ‘concept and master

plan’ parameters pleaded by the defendants in the Defence. It bears mentioning that

Ong and Tay are the only two (2) principals or registered architects in the

plaintiffs’ organisation who worked on the project. It was also confirmed in the

course of Ong’s cross-examination, that neither he nor Tay are qualified to or are

registered to, practise as architects in China and Qingdao in particular; neither were the

plaintiffs supposed to oversee construction of the project.</p>
<p align="justify">63. Ong could not also recall whether he had told Ricky Goh about his

past China experience or whether the defendants appointed the plaintiffs because of such

experience. Yet in his affidavit, he had deposed that it was through the plaintiffs’

assistance that Ricky Goh was able to lend credibility to the defendants’ proposals

for development in Qingdao. By the time he was cross-examined, Ong had downgraded (N/E

39B) the plaintiffs’ initial role to that of assisting the defendants as agents.

Although he was emphatic that he had told Ricky Goh ‘quite early’ about the

plaintiffs’ charges being 3% of construction costs (to which he received no

objections), Ong had no recollection when he did so and whether this was before or after

Qingdao had been selected as the site for the project. </p>
<p align="justify">64. Although he denied he had exaggerated the amount of work he had

done, Ong was unable to reconcile his claim that he made at least four (4) trips to China

between December 1993 and November 1994 (to look for potential sites) with the

plaintiffs’ pleaded case that they were first engaged by the defendants <u>in August

1993</u>. In his exhibit OCK-4, Ong had listed six (6) trips he made to China between 17

December 1993 and 27 July 1995 for which he charged the defendants $138,750. Ong was also

unable to reconcile his written testimony (para 19) that the plaintiffs would not charge

any fee for the exploratory work he conducted, with his claim that he did far more than

design the concept and master plans for the project. Under cross-examination (N/E 87), Ong

had also admitted that the plaintiffs are not entitled to $5,134,670.47 if their claim is

based on quantum meruit, but only to the sum of $1.5m when questioned on para 86 of his

affidavit. However, he did not elaborate on how he arrived at that figure nor did his own

counsel ask him in re-examination. </p>
<p align="justify">65. Despite his repeated denials, what clearly emerged from his

testimony is, that Ong was not an architect per se; he was also a businessman who wanted

to invest overseas and constantly looked for opportunities to do so, usually in tandem

with Ricky Goh. He left the running of the plaintiffs’ practice essentially to Tay.

That was why he accompanied Ricky Goh on numerous trips to Donghan, Xiamen and Qingdao and

many other cities well before the project was first mooted. I agree with Ricky Goh’s

testimony (N/E 278-9) that it is indeed strange that Ong, after categorically denying he

was a co-investor for the earlier Dongshan and Xiamen projects (albeit aborted) later

produced photographs, mock-ups and perspectives (P9 to P11) of his involvement with those

projects for which he rendered no fees. In his submissions, counsel for the plaintiffs had

stated that Ong’s purported involvement in Ricky Goh’s earlier projects were

irrelevant to the present dispute not to mention that it was not pleaded in the Defence; I

consider the evidence as relevant to Ong’s credibility. Together with my earlier

observations on his testimony, I find Ong to be a witness who did not impress me as

speaking the truth; modesty is also a virtue he does not seem to possess. He as well as

Tay, gave themselves/the plaintiffs far too much credit for their work on the project

which is yet to be completed and which success is yet to be determined.</p>
<p align="justify">66. Considerable time was spent by counsel for the plaintiffs in

cross-examining Ricky Goh on the 11 volumes of drawing produced in Court to support the

plaintiffs’ claim both on liability and quantum. Whilst I do not doubt that

architectural services were indeed provided by the plaintiffs (and a large number of the

proposals came from Ong), the services were considerably less than what Ong and Tay

projected in their written testimony. Having claimed a very substantial sum as the

plaintiffs’ fees, both of them then sought to justify that figure retrospectively, in

which process they greatly over-stated their roles, even at the April 1994 sales

exhibition. In this connection Ong had agreed under cross-examination (N/E 48) with

Gan’s view that it was wrong of him not to discuss with the defendants before sending

the plaintiffs’ staff to the sales exhibition and then rendering the defendants a

bill. It is a gross exaggeration to say the least, for Tay to claim that he and his team

spent time on the project which equated 11 years 8 months; the figure of 142 months was

also not supported by contemporaneous or any time-sheets. The drawings produced in Court

could not/did not prove the extent of work Ong and Tay claimed to have done let alone the

alleged repeated amendments and revisions. Neither do I accept that those plans comprised

only 80% of the plaintiffs’ work and went beyond the scope of concept and master

plans. Further, the plaintiffs’ plans covered at best 2 sq. km and not the entire

area allocated to the defendants for the International City. It bears noting that the

defendants (unlike the plaintiffs) had an office in Qingdao fully manned by 30-40 staff

which included planners, quantity surveyors and construction personnel. What were these

people being paid for if Tay and Ong were doing all the work that they claimed? Yet when

it suited their purpose otherwise, Tay and Ong professed they were unaware of what

transpired between the defendants and the Chinese authorities, including the issuance of

approvals and construction permits by the latter nor were they (according to Tay)

introduced by the defendants to the Chinese architects. </p>
<p align="justify">67. I had earlier adverted to the fact that neither Ong nor Tay are

registered architects in Qingdao. This factor is significant as it was the

plaintiffs’ case that payment for their services was based on SIA’s standard

conditions of contract; yet it was clear from Ong’s cross-examination (NE 41-42) that

the plaintiffs did not provide the services set out in Part 2 of the SIA standard contract

(headed Architects’ Services and Mode of Payment) save perhaps for the first basic

service of schematic design (for which payment was to be 15% of total fees). Strangely

enough, in their closing submissions, one of the grounds (see para 181) upon which the

plaintiffs criticised Gan’s opinion was the fact that he (Gan) had based it on the

work of architects in Singapore and on SIA’s standard conditions. The plaintiffs went

further in para 186 of their submissions to say that any importation of the SIA conditions

for the work done by the plaintiffs should be clearly rejected. I am unable to reconcile

this inconsistent stand – if the plaintiffs say, after their case has closed, that

the SIA contract does not apply, then there is no basis for the common contention of Ong

and Tay that they are entitled to be paid in accordance with the rates provided under the

SIA contract.</p>
<p align="justify">68. Not being registered as an architect in Qingdao or elsewhere in

China, Ong was in no position (as he claimed with regards to the Design Centre) to visit

the site during its construction (on no less than two (2) occasions), to render advice on

aspects of design. By the same token, it would not have been feasible for Ong to have

prepared plans with full details for construction let alone enlist professional engineers

to help with the structural requirements to expedite building approval. With respect, such

services would not have been of any use to the defendants given the differing conditions

between Qingdao and Singapore. I find it far-fetched that Ong could have helped to refine

construction details to reduce construction costs when he was not familiar with Chinese

construction requirements. As an example, I refer to Ricky Goh’s testimony (N/E 292)

that the plaintiffs did abortive work for the designs of the bungalows (of which only 6

designs were used) because they were unaware of the standard requirement in China that all

houses must be south facing. The defendants had to change the orientation of the

plaintiffs’ designs for studio apartments and general housing for the same reason.

Such evidence contradicted Tay’s testimony that Ricky Goh wanted a change in the

orientation of the bungalows so that they faced the rear instead, of each other which

(according to Tay) ‘<i>is the usual way’</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">69. Having looked at some of the designs before the Court, I am also

inclined to agree with the defendants (and their expert witness) that some were

repetitive, others had little variations and yet others were quite ordinary. Indeed, I

thought that some of Ong’s ideas were impractical if not hare-brained, including the

proposal to build a turf club – gambling being anathema to a communist regime, albeit

one which is gradually moving towards private enterprise and a laissez-faire economy.</p>
<p align="justify">70. Counsel for the plaintiffs had sought to show that Ricky Goh

originally intended to build the Marina and other sectors besides the International City

but, he deliberately chose not to do so in order to defeat the plaintiffs’ claim. I

reject this submission as it was not borne out by the evidence. The decision whether or

not to build did not lie with the defendants but with the Qingdao authorities. Once the

authorities had given the green light, Ricky Goh was committed and was in no position to

change his mind even if he wanted to. Conversely, the defendants could not proceed to

build if no approval was granted, as in the case of the Marina even though they had paid

for the site and had held a groundbreaking ceremony.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The decision </p>
<p align="justify">(i) was there an agreement on the fees?</p></i>
<p align="justify">71. On the evidence, I accept the defendants’ contention that

under the 1993 and 1994 agreements, payment of the plaintiffs’ fees was dependent

upon approval of their plans by the Qingdao authorities and the quantum would be agreed

after such approval – it would not make commercial sense otherwise. Ricky Goh had

testified that every meeting between Tay and or Ong with the Chinese authorities resulted

in amendments of drawings. If the defendants were to pay for each and every plan produced,

original as well as amended/revised, they exposed themselves to the possibility of paying

very substantial fees, even for changes required by the authorities which instructions did

not emanate from them. As a seasoned developer who had had previous dealing with Chinese

authorities as well as with Ong, Ricky Goh would not be so foolish as to take such a risk.</p>
<p align="justify">72. Counsel for the plaintiffs had suggested to Ricky Goh (N/E 385)

that the defendants’ initial payment of $200,000 in May 1994 was not a deposit but

part-payment for work already done by his clients. This is not a credible explanation

because if it was indeed a part-payment, it would have been reflected in subsequent bills

rendered by the plaintiffs (which it was not) and it would not have been such a convenient

round number. </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">(ii) was there a variation of the fee agreement?</p></i>
<p align="justify">73. With regards to the cheque, I prefer Danny Goh’s version of

how it came to be issued to the plaintiffs. I accept the defendants’ contention that

the 1993 (as well as 1994) agreement was varied by the 1996 agreement made orally on 4

July 1996 between Danny Goh and Ong whereby the plaintiffs would be paid a lump sum fee of

$600,000 for the project. I reject Ong’s denial in this regard and his contention

that he did not read its contents but only acknowledged the cheque when, the

defendants’ letter dated 5 July 1996 was handed to him. Indeed his own

acknowledgement on that letter contradicts his denial; why would he state:</p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">We will call a meeting to co-ordinate your request with Carol &amp;

  finalise the requirements.</p>
</blockquote></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">unless he had read the contents which contained that specific request

in the second last paragraph?</p>
<p align="justify">74. I find it equally incredible that although the defendants had

sufficient funds in their Bank of China account to cover the cheque, Danny Goh would (as

they alleged) request Ong and then Esther (repeatedly) not to present the cheque for

payment. Why would the defendants hand over the cheque at all in the first place if it was

not meant for immediate clearance? What is even more telling against the plaintiffs is the

omission by Ong to record such a request from the defendants when he wrote to them the day

<u>immediately after</u> he received the cheque or even later. It took the plaintiffs more

than a year (until 1 September 1997) to write to the defendants to document this alleged

request, by which time the cheque was already ‘stale’ and could no longer be

cleared by any bank. Ong decided not to bank-in the cheque and concocted the excuse that

it was because of Danny Goh’s request, in his attempt to wriggle out of the agreement

on the lump sum fee, after Tay voiced his disagreement.</p>
<p align="justify">75. It was apparent from Tay’s letter dated 15 September 1995 at

15AB-216 (as was pointed out in the defendants’ letter dated 19 September 1995 at

15AB-224-5) that he was unaware of the defendants’ initial payment of $200,000 in May

1994. What must and did happen was, that Ong and Tay had a quarrel when Tay was told about

the lump sum fee. The incident lends credence to Ricky Goh’s surmise that Ong did not

(fully) appraise Tay of all the commitments he had made to Ricky Goh on the

plaintiffs’ behalf. Accordingly, Tay’s ignorance of the 1996 agreement (until

after the fact) and his disagreement with the lump sum fee arrangement does not mean that

no such agreement was reached. </p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">(iii) what would be the plaintiffs’ entitlement to fees if based

on quantum meruit?</p></i>
<p align="justify">76. Even if I am wrong in my findings on the cheque as well as on what

the parties had agreed, I am satisfied that a reasonable fee for the plaintiffs’

architectural services based on quantum meruit would be $560,000, even if their scope of

works went beyond providing concept plans; I accept the assessment of the defendants’

expert witness Gan in this regard. Conversely, I reject the figure of $360,000 suggested

by the defendants in their final submissions, relying on the 1993 (unreported) decision in

<i>Chung Meng Soon &amp; Others v Lee Kai Investment Pte Ltd</i> (SLR on CD Rom [149 MD

3]), the factual matrix between that case and this dispute being very different.</p>
<p align="justify">77. In his closing arguments, counsel for the plaintiffs had submitted

that Gan’s assessment was flawed – he said Gan had no direct architectural

experience or actual knowledge of, working in China nor of the area and scale of the

project. Gan’s opinion was also flawed because he took into account irrelevant and

not relevant factors. An example of the second flaw was, that he failed to take into

account previous dealings and correspondence between the parties which information was

crucial as otherwise the underlying agreements, changes and amendments ordered by the

defendants and the Chinese authorities would be ignored. Gan was aware of but had chosen

not to ask for, all the file papers from August 1993 to September 1995 from either Ricky

Goh or Danny Goh. Having been briefed by the defendants or their counsel a few days before

trial commenced, Gan could not have considered all the evidence carefully and fully; it

was not possible to analyse lengthy architectural plans that spanned over two (2) years in

such a short space of time.</p>
<p align="justify">78. In my view, the plaintiffs have not succeeded in their attempts to

attack Gan’s credentials or, to discredit his assessment either on merits or on the

assumptions upon which the figure of $560,000 was arrived at; Gan did take into account

all relevant factors before arriving at his figure. The plaintiffs chose not to call any

expert witness to rebut Gan’s opinion or to give the Court a comparative yardstick;

neither did Ong comment on his testimony. Accordingly, I accept that Gan’s estimate

is a fair and reasonable fee for the plaintiffs based on quantum meruit. Although he was

called as the defendants’ witness, I do not agree with the plaintiffs’

contention that Gan was biased towards the defendants and could not be considered an

expert witness; I did not form that impression at all from his testimony.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The conclusion </p></i>
<p align="justify">79. Based on the evidence therefore, I am of the view that the

plaintiffs have failed to prove (on a balance of probabilities) that an agreement was

reached between Ong and Ricky Goh in August 1993, that the defendants would pay for the

plaintiffs’ services based on 3% of the construction costs of the project. Even if

there was this 1993 agreement, it was in any event superseded by the 1996 agreement

wherein it was agreed that the plaintiffs would be paid a lump sum of $600,000 on

condition that the defendants paid $300,000 immediately followed by another $100,000 after

the plaintiffs had furnished certain drawings the defendants had requested but which were

still outstanding.</p>
<p align="justify">80. Consequently, the plaintiffs’ claim for $5,134,670.47 is

dismissed. Although there was agreement on $600,000 as a lump sum fee, the plaintiffs are

only entitled to their fees based on quantum meruit for the reason that they failed to

comply with the condition (under the 1996 agreement) to provide the defendants with

outstanding drawings (for the International City and the Marina) in exchange for the

defendants’ immediate payment of $300,000. Therefore, the defendants are not bound by

the agreed fee. </p>
<p align="justify">81. Accordingly, I award the plaintiffs the sum of $560,000 based on

Gan’s assessment. As $200,000 has already been paid to the plaintiffs, the balance

outstanding is $360,000. As the defendants made no issue of the disbursements of $16,994

incurred by the plaintiffs for perspective renderings, the plaintiffs are also entitled to

that claim. In addition, the plaintiffs are awarded interest on the total sum of $376,994

from date of writ (12 November 1997) until judgment. I shall not finalise my order for

costs however, until I have heard further arguments from counsel. </p>
