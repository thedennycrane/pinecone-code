<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an <em>ex
                        parte</em> application for leave pursuant to O 53 r 1 of the
                    Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”) for
                    judicial review to quash Lee Seiu Kin J’s decision in District Court
                    Appeal No 24 of 2012 (“the Appeal”) which had commenced as
                    Magistrate’s Court Suit No 8131 of 2010 (“the
                Suit”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       I dismissed the application and now give my
                    reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Suit was a claim on a supply and
                    installation contract for gymnastics products supplied to Raffles Gymnastics
                    Academy (S) Pte Ltd (“the Respondent”). Marplan Private Limited
                    (“the Applicant”), was the plaintiff supplier at trial. One issue
                    in dispute was the contractual purchase price of the gymnastics products. There
                    were two sets of February invoices, reflecting different prices. The Applicant
                    claimed that there had been a manufacturer’s price increase reflected in
                    the set of February invoices which indicated a higher contractual price
                    (“the Higher February Invoices”). The Respondent claimed that
                    there had been no such price increase, but rather, that a 30% discount had been
                    agreed and applied to the contract price, and reflected in the second set of
                    February invoices.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The district judge held that the Higher February
                    Invoices evidenced the parties’ agreement on the purchase price. The
                    district judge ordered, <em>inter alia</em>, that the
                    Respondent pay the Applicant the balance purchase price of $45,656.85 in respect
                    of the main claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Respondent appealed and Lee J allowed the
                    appeal on the basis that the Applicant had failed to discharge his burden of
                    proof. In his decision dated 23 November 2012, Lee J found that evidence showing
                    a manufacturer’s price increase would have been in the Applicant’s
                    control, but the Applicant had chosen not to disclose such evidence. Lee J drew
                    an adverse inference from the Applicant’s non-disclosure of documents
                    evidencing the price increase and found that the Applicant had not discharged
                    its burden of proof in the Suit. Further, he found that the district
                    judge’s finding had been based on equivocal evidence. Lee J then reduced
                    the judgment sum by $26,366.38.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 14 January 2013, the Applicant applied to Lee
                    J for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal, but was refused. In its skeletal
                    arguments for leave, the Applicant submitted:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     That the Respondents had in their
                        possession, custody or power, evidence relevant to the case which they had
                        withheld or suppressed from both the appellate and trial
                    courts;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     Lee J erred
                        when he found that the district judge had based his decision on equivocal
                        evidence, as the district judge had given six reasons why he made the
                        finding that there had been a manufacturer’s price increase;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     An agreement
                        for a discount, if made, would have been in contravention of s 5(<em>a</em>) of the Prevention of Corruption Act and illegal,
                        or would have been void for uncertainty or lack of
                    consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 21 January 2013, the Applicant took out
                    Summons No 430 of 2013, seeking leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal against
                    Lee J’s decision allowing the Appeal <em>and</em> his
                    decision refusing leave to appeal. After it was pointed out to the Applicant by
                    Sr Asst Registrar Cornie Ng, during a pre-trial conference, that Lee J’s
                    decision refusing leave to appeal was final, it filed Originating Summons No 166
                    of 2013 (“the Application”) to quash Lee J’s decision. The
                    Application was filed and served on the Attorney-General pursuant to O 53 r 1(3)
                    of the Rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The judicial review claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Application asserts two grounds for judicial
                    review:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     Lee J erred in drawing an adverse
                        inference as the Applicant’s only reason for failing to adduce
                        evidence of the price increase was because it thought it was unnecessary and
                        the trial judge had dismissed the Respondent’s specific discovery
                        request for those documents. Accordingly, Lee J’s inference of fact
                        that there was no price increase was unreasonable; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     Lee J erred when he found that the
                        district judge had based his decision on equivocal evidence as the evidence
                        was only equivocal because the Respondents had suppressed evidence. This
                        second ground is the same as [6(a)] and [6(b)] above, which were grounds of
                        appeal canvassed before Lee J during the application for leave to
                        appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Applicant also argued that it had exhausted
                    all other available remedies as leave to appeal had been refused.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The test for granting leave to apply for a
                    quashing order was summarised by Philip Pillai J in <em>Lim Mey
                        Lee Susan v Singapore Medical Council</em> [2011] SGHC 131 (at [3]).
                    Leave is not granted unless the court is satisfied that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     The matter complained of is
                        susceptible to judicial review;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Applicant has sufficient interest in the matter;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        material before the court discloses an arguable or <em>prima
                            facie</em> case of reasonable suspicion in favour of granting the
                        public law remedies sought by the applicant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     There was no question that the Applicant had a
                    sufficient interest in the matter and it remained for me to assess whether the
                    matter complained of was susceptible to judicial review and whether the material
                    presented disclosed an arguable case of reasonable suspicion in favour of
                    judicial review.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the matter is susceptible to judicial review</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Susceptibility to judicial review of the decision-making
                body</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     I found that the decision of a High Court
                    judge acting in that capacity is not reviewable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The function of a Quashing Order is explained
                    in <em>Singapore Civil Procedure</em>, vol 1 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    2013) at para 53/1/3:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A Quashing Order is mainly used to control unlawful exercises of power
                            <em>by inferior courts, tribunals</em> and other
                        public bodies by quashing decisions which are reached in excess or abuse of
                        power. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     A broad overview of case law shows that where
                    there is a serious or grave breach of natural justice occurring in a
                    Magistrate’s (or inferior) court and which results in a criminal
                    conviction, both a right to appeal <em>and</em> in serious
                    cases, a right of judicial review may be granted. There is, however,
                    no record of judicial review ever being granted for a superior
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The notion that the supervisory jurisdiction
                    of the court only applies to inferior tribunals is also established in the
                    common law. Lord Diplock’s dicta in <em>Re Racal
                        Communications Ltd</em> [1981] AC 374 (at 384) which was quoted with
                    approval by the Court of Appeal in <em>Wong Hong Toy v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1987] SLR(R) 213 (at [51]), sums up the common law
                    position:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The High Court is not a court of limited jurisdiction and its
                        constitutional role includes the interpretation of written laws. ... There
                        is simply no room for error going to [the Judge’s] jurisdiction, nor,
                        as is conceded by counsel for the respondent, is there any room for judicial
                        review. <em>Judicial review is available as a remedy for
                            mistakes of law made by </em><b><em>inferior courts
                            and tribunals only. </em></b><em>Mistakes of law made
                            by judges of the High Court acting in their capacity as such can be
                            corrected only by means of appeal to an appellate court; and if, as in
                            the instant case, the statute provides that the judge’s decision
                            shall not be appealable, they cannot be corrected at all</em>.
                        [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     I should add that even with inferior courts,
                    judicial review is reserved only for the most extreme situations where it would
                    be “ludicrous” to deny parties the remedy of review, for example,
                    where a man was convicted without the court having heard his evidence: see
                        <em>The King v Wandsworth Justices, ex parte
                        Read</em> [1942] 1 KB 281. In Singapore, almost all such cases would
                    fall within the court’s powers of criminal revision in the Criminal
                    Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed). Moreover, <em>none</em> of the considerations set out at [14] above apply to the
                    present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Even if the common law position were in doubt
                    (which it is not), s 27(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322,
                    2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”) makes clear that the supervisory and
                    revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court is only available over subordinate
                    courts. It reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>27.</b>—(1)  In addition to the
                        powers conferred on the High Court by this Act or any other written law, the
                        High Court shall have general supervisory and revisionary jurisdiction over
                        all <em>subordinate courts</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     During the hearing before me, counsel for the
                    Applicant, Mr Glen Koh (“Mr Koh”), attempted to argue that s 27(4)
                    of the SCJA further extended this jurisdiction to cases involving appeals from
                    the Subordinate Courts to the High Court. Section 27 reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>27.</b>—(1) In addition to the powers
                        conferred on the High Court by this Act or any other written law, the High

                        subordinate courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    The High Court may in particular, but without
                            prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), if it appears
                            desirable in the interests of justice, either of its own motion or at
                            the instance of any party or person interested, at any stage in any
                            matter or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, in any subordinate
                            court, call for the record thereof, and may remove the matter or
                            proceeding into the High Court or may give to the subordinate court such
                            directions as to the further conduct of the matter or proceeding as
                            justice may require.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    Upon the High Court calling for any record
                            under subsection (2), all proceedings in the subordinate court
                            in the matter or proceeding in question shall be stayed pending further
                            order of the High Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)    The High Court shall, when exercising (or deciding

                            that matter was, or could reasonably have been, raised in that
                            appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Mr Koh’s argument was wholly
                    wrong-headed. Sub-section (1) clearly states that the High Court’s general
                    supervisory and revisionary jurisdiction shall be over <em>subordinate courts</em>. Sub-section (2) gives the High Court the
                    power to call for the record of any matter in a <em>subordinate
                        court</em> and/or transfer cases in the <em>subordinate
                        court</em> to the High Court. Both of these sub-sections deal
                        <em>specifically with the subordinate courts</em>.
                    Section 27(4) cannot be read disjunctively from ss 27(1) and 27(2). The need to
                    have regard to whether a matter was, or could reasonably have been, raised in an
                    appeal before the High Court <em>only applies</em> where a
                    High Court is exercising its supervisory and revisionary jurisdiction over a
                    subordinate court. All s 27(4) does is to introduce a further set of
                    considerations to judicial review of <em>subordinate court
                        decisions</em> which had been determined on appeal to the High
                    Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Section 27(4) is in line with the common law
                    understanding of the interaction between an appeal and a judicial review. The
                    position in relation to judicial review where a statutory right of appeal exists
                    is succinctly summarised in <em>De Smith’s Judicial
                        Review</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2007) at para 16-018:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Judicial review is essentially a mechanism to be used where there is
                        no statutory right of appeal. In almost all cases the Administrative Court
                        will regard a statutory appeal, whether to a court or a tribunal, as a
                        proper substitute for judicial review, though exceptional circumstances may
                        dictate otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     An applicant is expected to raise both a
                    challenge of legality <em>and</em> merits on appeal given
                    that if:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the error in law or procedural unfairness was cured in the appeal,
                        then the result of the appeal would render the issue as to the impact of the
                        error of law or procedural unfairness in the first trial academic ...</p>

                        ex parte Dowler</em> [1997] QB 911 (at 923). Section 27(4) helps to
                    strain out cases where an applicant is merely seeking to re-litigate an issue
                    which can, and ought, to have been raised on appeal to a superior court. It
                    follows the traditional view that the appropriate place for reviewing a decision
                    of a superior court is by way of appeal and not judicial review. It is <em>not</em> authority for the proposition that a superior court
                    is susceptible to judicial review.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The High Court is part of the Supreme Court,
                    the superior court of record; see s 3, SCJA. It exercises appellate civil and
                    criminal jurisdiction. As a superior court, its decisions are not susceptible to
                    judicial review. Sinnathuray J opined in <em>Abdul Wahab bin
                        Sulaiman v Commandant, Tanglin Detention Barracks</em>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Where courts are expressly declared by statute to be superior courts,
                        it is <em>beyond doubt</em> that the High Court has no
                        supervisory jurisdiction over them. <em>Their decisions

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Section 2 of the SCJA defines a “Judge

                    Court sitting as a judge of the Court of Appeal under section 29(3)”.
                    While the Court of Appeal has a different appellate jurisdiction, there appears
                    to be no distinction in the SCJA between the High Court and the Court of Appeal
                    in terms of its status as a superior court. The High Court and the Court of
                    Appeal are treated as a unitary Supreme (and superior) court where Judges of the
                    High Court may sit as a judge of the Court of Appeal under s 29(3) of the SCJA,
                    and Judges of Appeal may sit in the High Court under s 10(3) of the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Accepting the Applicant’s proposition
                    that a right of judicial review lies against a High Court decision (whether by
                    way of review by another High Court Judge or by the Court of Appeal) would be
                    tantamount to saying that the superior court of Singapore can exercise
                    supervisory jurisdiction over itself. This makes nonsense of the word
                    “supervisory”. In <em>Bright Impex v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1998] 2 SLR(R) 961 (“<em>Bright
                        Impex</em>”), it had been ordered by the district judge that
                    the goods the petitioner had acquired be forfeited under s 130(1)(<em>c</em>) of the Customs Act (Cap 70, 1995 Rev Ed). The
                    petitioner’s appeal was dismissed by the High Court. He then applied to
                    the High Court to exercise its powers of revision under s 266 of the Criminal
                    Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) to reverse the forfeiture order. Yong Pung
                    How CJ dismissed the application and held (at [13] and [14]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13    ... The general supervisory and revisionary
                            jurisdiction of the High Court as prescribed in s 27(1) of the Supreme

                            <em>limited to jurisdiction over the Subordinate

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14    … What the petitioner was seeking in effect
                            was for the High Court to exercise its power of revision <em>over a decision made by </em><b><em>its
                                own court</em></b>. From the definition of ‘subordinate
                            courts’ in the Supreme Court of Judicature Act and the wording of
                            s 266(1) of the CPC, <em>it is clear that the High Court

                            revision could have been dismissed on this basis alone.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Quoting <em>Bright
                        Impex</em> (at [14]) with approval in <em>Tee Kok Boon
                        v Public Prosecutor</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 398 (also in the context of
                    criminal revision), Tay Yong Kwang J further elaborated (at [15]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I agree entirely with the above statement which I apply to the factual
                        situation in the present application. Each High Court has co-ordinate
                        jurisdiction and one High Court cannot profess to exercise revisionary or
                        supervisory jurisdiction over another. Even the Court of Appeal does not
                        have powers of judicial review over the High Court. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Tay J had applied the same principle in the
                    context of setting aside summary judgment in <em>Poh Soon Kiat v
                        Hotel Ramada of Nevada (trading as Tropicana Resort &amp; Casino)</em>
                    [1999] 2 SLR(R) 756 (“<em>Poh Soon
                    Kiat</em>”). Tay J reasoned that if there were conflicting
                    positions taken by the High Court in different cases touching on the same issue,
                    parties would be able to use the guise of setting aside to resurrect cases and
                    persuade a court of coordinate jurisdiction to side with one High Court’s
                    position over another. Tay J found that this would go against the need for
                    orderly administration of justice and finality. He concluded (at [30]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">What I have said applies with even greater force to the contention that
                        the learned judicial commissioner might have made the wrong finding of fact
                        due to the paucity of evidence in the O 14 proceedings. No High Court sits
                        in an appellate, revisionary or supervisory jurisdiction over another High
                        Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     What the Applicant sought to do in the present
                    application is similar to what the applicant in <em>Poh Soon
                        Kiat</em> sought, <em>viz</em>, to challenge the
                    evidence on which the High Court Judge based his decision and to introduce
                    further evidence which had not been provided, although it could and should have
                    been, at trial. Tay J’s comments in <em>Poh Soon
                        Kiat</em> (at [25]) on the implication of allowing such applications
                    are apposite in this context:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Disgruntled unsuccessful litigants who have lost their appeals or lost
                        their right to appeal (or in decisions which are final and cannot be
                        appealed against) may be encouraged to lodge back-door appeals under the
                        guise of fresh proceedings to set aside regularly-obtained judgments on the
                        ground of illegality by pleading some substantive provision of law which
                        could and should have been raised as an issue in the earlier proceedings.
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Given that the Supreme Court cannot exercise
                    supervisory and revisionary jurisdiction over itself, nor a High Court review a
                    decision of a court of coordinate jurisdiction, I found that there was no scope
                    to judicially review Lee J’s decision. The Application could have been
                    dismissed on this basis alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Susceptibility to review of the subject matter</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     I further found that the substance of the
                    Application was wholly unsuited for judicial review.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The <em>raison
                        d’etre</em> of judicial review is different from that of an
                    appeal. While an appeal relates to the merits of the decision, judicial review
                    is an attack on the tribunal’s <em>manner</em> of
                    decision-making (including whether there has been an abuse of discretion or
                    breach of natural justice, irrationality, Wednesbury unreasonableness or bad
                    faith). Put another way, an appeal asks whether a decision is correct while
                    judicial review asks whether a decision is invalid. V K Rajah J opined in
                        <em>Wong Keng Leong Rayney v Law Society of
                        Singapore</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 934 (“<em>Rayney
                        Wong</em>”) (at [79]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… there is a clear distinction between the powers that a superior
                        court exercises in judicial reviews and appeals. While judicial reviews and
                        appeals are two avenues that an unsatisfied party in an inferior tribunal
                        may have recourse to, they are separate and distinct in so far as they are
                        designed to address two different <em>types</em> of wrongs that the tribunal may commit. Judicial
                        review is almost invariably limited to examining, <em>inter alia</em>, whether the tribunal has exceeded its
                        jurisdiction, whether there has been an abuse of discretion or a failure of
                        natural justice, and whether the tribunal has acted irrationally,
                        unreasonably or in bad faith. In other words, it hinges on the legality of
                        the decision. An appeal, on the other hand has a wider scope: an appellate
                        court may in limited circumstances evaluate the substantive merits of the
                        decision arrived at by the tribunal ... the reviewing court cannot
                        substitute its decision for that of the administrative body under review.
                        [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In other words, if the Application does not
                    concern the manner in which the decision was made or suggest that the decision
                    was made <em>ultra vires</em> the tribunal’s powers,
                    then it is not susceptible to judicial review.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The Application seeks an order “that
                    the [district judge’s] judgment in [the Suit] be affirmed in
                    whole”. This would require the court to substitute the district
                    judge’s decision for that of the appellate courts. This belongs in the
                    domain of an appeal and not of judicial review.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Moreover, the grounds which are raised have to
                    do with the substance of Lee J’s decision. The Applicant’s first
                    ground for judicial review was to question the substantive conclusions which Lee
                    J drew from the evidence before him. The Applicant’s second ground for
                    judicial review repeated the grounds of appeal raised before Lee J in the
                    application for leave. This claim was essentially that evidence had been
                    suppressed. This was not a complaint about Lee J’s decision or even about
                    his manner of decision-making, but was a complaint about the Respondent’s
                    conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The Applicant cannot use judicial review to
                    impugn the conduct of the Respondent. The Applicant was seeking to challenge the
                        <em>findings</em> that were made by Lee J, implicitly
                    inviting the reviewing court to perform the task of making fresh findings. In
                    other words, the Applicant was seeking to impeach Lee J’s decision because
                    it was incorrect, <em>not</em> because it was invalid.
                    Judicial review is a wholly inappropriate vehicle for this effort. As V K
                    Rajah J explained in <em>Rayney Wong</em> (at [79]),
                    “The reviewing court may declare that the task has been performed badly
                    in law but it cannot take the further step of actually performing the task
                    itself.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Accordingly, I found that the substance of the
                    Application was not susceptible to judicial review. For this reason as well,
                    leave should not be granted to allow the Application to proceed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether there was an arguable case of reasonable suspicion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In view of the foregoing, there was no need to
                    delve into the question whether there was an arguable or <em>prima facie</em> case of reasonable suspicion in favour of granting
                    the remedy sought. Suffice it to say that, in any event, I also found that there
                    was no arguable case of reasonable suspicion in relation to the <em>manner</em> of Lee J’s decision-making.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Abuse of process</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I should add that I found the Application to
                    be egregious and an abuse of process. The Applicant had two and a half bites of
                    the proverbial cherry. It brought its suit before the district judge and
                    was heard fully on the merits. The chance to appeal was open to both the
                    Applicant and the Respondent and heard before the High Court. The Applicant then
                    applied to Lee J and made submissions on why it should be allowed to appeal. Its
                    skeletal arguments, including supporting documents for the hearing on leave to
                    appeal, ran into 185 pages. It was given the opportunity to canvass arguments
                    before leave was refused. This was wholly unlike a situation where there was no
                    opportunity to appeal and where judicial review may be the <em>only means</em> of supervising an inferior court or tribunal. The
                    fact that the Applicant lost for the first time before the High Court did not
                    alter the fact that it had had numerous opportunities to make its case known
                        <em>and</em> to produce evidence which could properly
                    dispose of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Under s 34(2)(<em>a</em>)
                    read with s 34(2B) of the SCJA, a refusal to give leave to appeal is final. This
                    was a streamlined process intended to strain out hopeless appeals. The concern
                    that this streamlining process was unduly restrictive had already been raised
                    and addressed during the Parliamentary debates for the amendment of the SCJA in
                    2010. <em>The Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Reports</em> (18 October 2010) vol 87 at cols 1388–1389 on the
                    Second Reading of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Bill,
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The next concern that Ms Lim raises is the fact that now the High Court
                        Judge becomes the final gatekeeper for all leave applications.  First
                        of all, I think it is important to put this amendment in its proper
                        perspective and to bear in mind that the requirement to apply for leave to
                        appeal usually applies only to the second tier of appeals, that is, the
                        Court of Appeal.  As I mentioned earlier, the majority of interlocutory
                        applications are fixed before an Assistant Registrar and, as Mr Hri
                        Kumar has reminded us, would enjoy one tier of appeal to the High Court
                        Judge.  Similarly, in a substantive case, cases which are commenced in
                        the High Court can be appealed to the Court of Appeal as of right. 
                        Those that require leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal are those which
                        commenced in the Subordinate Courts and, for these cases, they would already
                        have enjoyed a one-tier of appeal to the High Court either as of right, if
                        the amount is more than $50,000; or with leave of, first, the court hearing
                        a case, say, of $40,000, whether it is Magistrates’ or District Court;
                        and if leave is turned down, a second bite of the cherry – asking
                        the High Court for leave.  I would suggest that – even
                        though Ms  Lim does speak strongly about it – the
                        impact of the amendment may not be such a big one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Parliament’s intention is very clear:
                    the High Court Judge, as the first tier of appeal, is to be the final gatekeeper
                    for leave applications of a particular type. The Applicant’s case falls
                    within this band of cases, and Lee J’s decision in the Appeal was
                    final.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The Application was, in essence, a
                    “back-door appeal”. I have already noted Tay J’s comments in
                        <em>Poh Soon Kiat</em> on the need for finality and
                    preventing such back-door appeals (see [28] above). The <em>dicta</em> of the High Court of Australia in <em>Burrell v The Queen</em> (2008) 82 ALJR 1221 (at [15]) is also useful
                    in explaining the importance of maintaining finality:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... “A central and pervading tenet of the judicial system is that
                        controversies, once resolved, are not to be reopened except in a few,
                        narrowly defined, circumstances.” That tenet finds reflection in
                        rules concerning the bringing of an action to set aside a final judgment on
                        the ground that it was procured by fraud and in doctrines of res judicata
                        and issue estoppel. The principal qualification … is provided by the
                        appellate system. But in courts other than the court of final resort, the
                        tenet also finds reflection in the restrictions upon reopening of final
                        orders after they have been formally recorded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I also noted that this application was a
                    back-door means of introducing further evidence. The Applicant had filed a new
                    affidavit on 21 January 2013 furnishing evidence of the manufacturer’s
                    price increase. There is already a provision under the SCJA to ask for further
                    arguments and evidence to be admitted. This would also have to go through Lee J
                    as the High Court Judge who decided the Appeal. In either case, bringing by
                    judicial review what should have been brought by way of appeal or an application
                    for further arguments under s 28A of the SCJA is an abuse of process. If the
                    motivation is to circumvent the discretion of the High Court Judge hearing the
                    case, then this is also a clear circumvention of the purpose of the
                SCJA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     I found that the Application was entirely
                    hopeless and an abuse of process. I accordingly dismissed the Application and
                    awarded costs of $500 as sought by the Attorney-General.</p>
