<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The
accused, Purushothaman A/L Subramaniam, was charged with the importation
of diamorphine into Singapore as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You, Purushothaman A/L Subramaniam,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">are charged that you, on the 26th day of
March 2012 at or about 7.15 pm, at Bike Arrival Hall, Woodlands
Checkpoint, Singapore, in motorcycle JLR 1838, did import a controlled
drug specified in Class A of The First Schedule of the Misuse of
Drugs Act, (CAP. 185), to wit, three (3) packets of granular substances
believed to be Diamorphine, weighing approximately 1389.39 grams
without authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder
and you have thereby committed an offence under section 7 and punishable
under section 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (CAP. 185).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As the amount of diamorphine imported by the accused exceeds
the statutory limit of 15g as prescribed under the Second Schedule
of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Act”), this
offence is punishable with death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The
accused claims trial to the charge. His defence is that he did not know
what was inside the black bundle that he was asked to carry into Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Prosecution’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The
Prosecution adduced evidence that the accused is a 21-year-old male
Malaysian who was staying in Johor Bahru.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> At the time of his arrest, he was
a “vegetable lorry stacker”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">At Woodlands Checkpoint Counter
43</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On
26 March 2012, at about 7.13pm,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> the accused rode his Malaysian-registered
motorcycle bearing registration number JLR 1838 into Singapore via
Motorcycle Arrival Booth 47, Woodlands Checkpoint.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> He
produced his passport to PW11, Corporal Muhammad Shafiq bin Mohamed,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> the
Primary Screening Officer with the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority
(“ICA”). PW11 then screened the accused’s particulars using the
ICA computer. He was alerted by a notification to stop the accused
and refer him to an enforcement agency.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       PW11
then told the accused to switch off his motorcycle engine and to
hand over his motorcycle key. At the same time, the ICA Quick Response Team
was activated.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The accused, together with his passport
and motorcycle key, was handed over to PW12, Corporal Lim Lian Chuan
of the ICA Quick Response Team, who soon arrived at the scene.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">At the ICA Arrival Car Secondary
Team Office</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The
accused was asked by PW12 to push his motorcycle to the ICA Arrival
Car Secondary Team Office. He parked his motorcycle at motorcycle
lot A39, one of the parking lots located outside the office.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> In the
meantime, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) at
the Woodlands Checkpoint were alerted and the accused was handed
over to them for investigation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The search</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The
accused was told by one of the CNB officers to push his motorcycle
to the Police K9 (dog unit) garage.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> A physical search was conducted
on the motorcycle. PW16, Corporal Vengedesh Raj Nainar s/o Nagarajan,
recovered a black bundle from the motorcycle.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Thereafter, the accused was immediately
placed under arrest. When PW17, Staff Sergeant Chia Eu Foong,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> made a small cut on the black bundle
in the accused’s presence, a brownish granular substance was seen.
A physical examination and a K9 search (using sniffer dog) of the
accused revealed nothing on him. The backscatter scan performed
on the motorcycle also revealed no other incriminating evidence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Accused’s first statement on
the discovery of the six bundles in the motorcycle seat</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In
the CNB office at Woodlands Checkpoint, PW14, Staff Sergeant Marlina
Binte Djumadi, asked the accused questions about the black bundle found
on his motorcycle.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> PW16 acted as the interpreter
as the accused chose to answer the questions in Tamil. The exchange

<p class="Judg-1">The Prosecution admitted this statement as well as his other
statements given to the investigation officer as the accused confirmed
that they were voluntarily taken from him without any inducement,
threat or promise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Analysis of the six bundles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       There
were three packets of the brownish granular substance found inside
the black bundle. These were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”)
for analysis. They were labelled “A1A1”, “A1B1” and “A1C1” respectively.
The HSA analysis revealed the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     A1A1:
The gross weight of the granular/powdery substance was 460.2g and
it contained no less than 24.97g of diamorphine at a confidence
level of 99.9999%.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     A1B1:
The gross weight of the granular/powdery substance was 459.0g and
it contained no less than 25.25g of diamorphine at a confidence
level of 99.9999%.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     A1C1:
The gross weight of the granular/powdery substance was 456.0g and
it contained no less than 25.19g of diamorphine at a confidence
level of 99.9999%.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The presumption of possession
and knowledge of the drug under s 18 of the Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The
Prosecution relies on the statutory presumptions under ss 18(1)(<em>a</em>) and 18(2) of the Act.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> Under s 18(1)(<em>a</em>), the accused is presumed to have been
in possession of the diamorphine found in the motorcycle while under
s 18(2), he is further presumed to have known of the nature of the
diamorphine. This, combined with the fact that the accused physically
brought the diamorphine hidden in the motorcycle into Singapore,
establishes the offence of importation of a controlled drug with which
he was charged.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The accused’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The
accused seeks to rebut both the presumptions of possession and knowledge
under ss 18(1)(<em>a</em>) and 18(2) of the
Act respectively.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> He alleged
that he did not know that the black bundle concealed in his motorcycle
contained diamorphine. His story is that a person called “Prabha”
placed drugs in his motorcycle without his knowledge. Therefore, he
is not wilfully blind.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> Prabha was later identified to
be one Prabagaran a/l Srivijayan. He was arrested based on a telephone
number given to the police by the accused.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The accused’s background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The
accused comes from a family of six. He has a mother, three elder sisters
and an elder brother. His father is deceased. The accused has been the
family’s sole breadwinner since the age of 12, initially working
in a job involving marriage decoration in Perak.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> He
first started working in Singapore at a warehouse situated at Jalan
Penjuru in January 2011, doing packing. He was paid about $600 a
month, out of which he would send RM500 back to his family. However,
he ceased working as a packer around February or March 2011 as it
was hard work and he felt that he was not being paid sufficiently.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Subsequently,
the accused found a job loading and unloading goods from lorries
in Johor Bahru. For this, he was paid between RM50 to RM60 per day.
He would send back between RM300 to RM400 per month to his family
in Perak.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> From December 2011 to
January 2012, he worked as a vegetable packer in Johor Bahru and
was paid RM800 per month. He would send back RM500 to his family
in Perak.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The meeting between the accused
and Prabha</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Around
February 2012, the accused’s mother needed a heart surgery. He did
not have money to finance the operation. It was around this time that
the accused went out for drinks with his colleague and met Prabha
for the first time at a Chinese coffeeshop in Johor Bahru.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> Prabha
had been drinking with three other friends at that time and the
accused joined them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> However,
the accused did not drink with them as he was sad because he did
not have the money to pay for his mother’s operation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> Prabha then asked the accused
what was wrong and persisted in knowing what was troubling the accused.
Eventually, the accused told Prabha that he needed money for his
mother’s operation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> When they
left, Prabha comforted the accused by telling him “The god will
save your mother”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The RM10,000 loan</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Two
days later, the accused met Prabha in a Hindu temple. Prabha enquired
whether the accused had obtained the money that he needed. The accused
said that he had not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Prabha
then offered to help the accused and they exchanged contact details.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> Prabha told the accused that
he would let him know in two days’ time whether any help was forthcoming.
However, the accused called him two days later instead. Prabha informed
the accused that he could lend him the money but the accused would
have to help him in return for the loan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> Prabha wanted
the accused to bring “stuff” into Singapore for him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> However, Prabha was evasive
when the accused asked him about what “stuff” was to be brought
into Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> The
accused did not agree immediately and only agreed after a few meetings
with Prabha. The reason why the accused agreed to help Prabha was
because the accused felt indebted to Prabha for the loan which financed
his mother’s operation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     According
to the accused, he agreed to help Prabha only once.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> However, after the first time
the accused did the job, he disclosed to Prabha that his mother
needed RM500 a month for her post-operation medical expenses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> Prabha then offered to pay the
accused RM500 per job if he was willing to do the same job subsequently.
The accused agreed as “there was no other way to save [his] mother.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The modus operandi for the importation
of the “stuff” into Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The
accused’s account of the modus operandi was as follows. First, the accused
would pass the motorcycle to Prabha in Johor Bahru. Prabha would ride
away with the motorcycle for about one to two hours before returning to
the accused’s place. The accused would then be informed to take
back the motorcycle, no questions asked.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> When he asked Prabha
about what he was transporting, Prabha would refuse to tell him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> He would then ride his motorcycle
into Singapore, clear immigration within 30 minutes, and head towards
Woodlands MRT station,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> where the accused would call Prabha.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     After
receiving the accused’s call, Prabha would get a person to meet the
accused. About an hour later, the person would either arrive in
a car or a taxi. He would then ride away with the accused’s motorcycle
before returning it in about half an hour. Prabha would then give
a call to the accused, to inform him about the whereabouts of the
motorcycle. The motorcycle key would be left in the accused’s motorcycle
basket. The accused would then ride the motorcycle back to Johor
Bahru<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> and be paid RM500. The accused
would send all the money back to his family in Perak because his
mother needed about RM600 a month for her medical expenses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The accused’s lack of knowledge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The
above went on for about a month until the accused was stopped by
the police officers at Woodlands Checkpoint on 26 March 2012. It
was then that he became worried as the officers discovered a black
bundle in his motorcycle which he thought could be drugs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> He
suspected that Prabha might have used the screwdriver under his
motorcycle seat to unscrew the plastic cover and placed the drugs
inside a compartment of the motorcycle.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The
accused also testified that he did not suspect anything amiss about
the RM500 he received each time he sent “stuff” into Singapore or
the RM10,000 loan that Prabha extended to him. This was because
he was very concerned about his mother’s surgery.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> Also,
he would check his motorcycle each time after Prabha returned it
to him and before he rode it into Singapore. He never noticed anything
unusual, although he suspected that Prabha might have concealed
cigarettes in his motorcycle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Lastly,
the accused denied ownership of the motorcycle when he was administered
the Notice of Warning under s 23 of the CPC<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> but
later explained that it was a lie that he had made up as he was
scared of being arrested.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> He did not call any witnesses
in his defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issue: Whether the accused
knew of the drugs in his motorcycle</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It
is undisputed that the accused was arrested on 26 March 2012 and the
black bundle was found concealed in the accused’s motorcycle. He
was caught red-handed. The accused also agree that all his statements
given in the course of the investigations were voluntarily given
without any inducement, threat or promise from the recording officers
or any other persons. The <em>actus </em><em>reus</em> of the offence is undisputed. What
is disputed is the <em>mens rea</em> element
of the offence. This is where the accused denies knowledge of the
diamorphine hidden in his motorcycle.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Presumption of possession and
knowledge of diamorphine hidden in the accused’s motorcycle</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The
Prosecution relies on the presumption of possession and knowledge
under s 18(2) of the Act to show the presence of <em>mens
rea</em>, <em>ie</em>, that the accused
was assumed to know that diamorphine was hidden in his motorcycle.
Section 18(2) is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Any
person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in
his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed
to have known the nature of that drug.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In
order for the accused to rebut this presumption, he has to show
on a balance of probabilities that he did not know the nature of
the controlled drug referred to in the charge: <em>Nagaenthran </em><em>a/l K Dharmalingam v Public Prosecutor</em> [2011]
4 SLR 1156 (“<em>Nagaenthran</em>”) at [23].
This requires the court to evaluate the evidence to ascertain whether
there was wilful blindness on the part of the accused. Thus, I shall
first deal with the law on wilful blindness.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law on wilful blindness</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In <em>Tan Kiam Peng v Public Prosecutor</em> [2008]
1 SLR(R) 1 (“<em>Tan Kiam Peng</em>”), the
court held that wilful blindness is equivalent to actual knowledge
at law (at [104]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… This is entirely understandable as well
as logical and practical simply because the court cannot read a
person’s mind (see <em>per</em> Yong CJ in <em>Koo Pui Fong</em>, <em>supra</em>,
as well as <em>per</em> Lord Esher MR in <em>Brunton</em> at [109] below). As we have just
mentioned, a clear admission is going to be extremely rare. The proof
of an actual situation of actual knowledge is, in the circumstances, going
to be equally rare. This is <em>a fortiori</em> the
case in so far as offences under the Act are concerned. Accused
persons are hardly likely to admit to possessing actual knowledge
and can (indeed, will) easily disavow such knowledge even if it
existed, given the surreptitious nature inherent in drug offences
as well as the draconian penalties that are imposed on conviction.
In any event, as we have already noted, <em>wilful
blindness has, in any event, always been treated, in law, as actual
knowledge</em>. … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Wilful blindness is also a fact-sensitive enquiry. It should
be premised on a strong factual basis and has to meet a high threshold: <em>Khor Soon Lee v Public Prosecutor</em> [2011]
3 SLR 201 at [20].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">What are the suspicious circumstances
that give rise to a duty to inquire?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The
finding of wilful blindness must be based on a factual finding that gives
rise to a suspicion that a certain state of affairs exists. It has
been described as “an evidential matter to be taken into account
when deciding if the necessary knowledge existed”: Chan Wing Cheong,
“Culpability in the Misuse of Drugs Act: Wilful Blindness, the Reasonable
Person and a Duty to Check” (2013) 25 SAcLJ 110 (“Culpability in
the Misuse of Drugs Act”) at p 116.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     A
person is wilfully blind when the circumstances are such as to warrant
his suspicion and give rise to a duty by him to make further enquiries.
In <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em> at [125] and [127],
it was stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [<em>S</em>]<em>uspicion is</em> legally sufficient to ground
a finding of wilful blindness provided the relevant factual matrix
warrants such a finding <em>and</em> the
accused deliberately decides to turn a blind eye. … However, the
caveat is that a <em>low level</em> of suspicion
premised on a factual matrix that would <em>not</em> lead
a person to make further inquiries would be insufficient to ground
a finding of wilful blindness … [T]hat level of suspicion <em>must then lead to a refusal to investigate further</em> …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [W]ilful blindness is a combination of
suspicion <em>coupled with</em> a <em>deliberate</em> decision not to make further
inquiries, whereas the recklessness that has been referred to by
Prof Williams refers to recklessness in terms of the accused’s conduct
in the context of circumstances <em>which would
not otherwise have aroused suspicion</em> on the part of the
accused. We think that it is important to reiterate this point because
it is possible, on another interpretation, to argue that the decision
by the accused not to make further inquiries when faced with suspicious
circumstances may be characterised as reckless conduct. We do <em>not</em> agree with such an argument and characterisation.
Such conduct is wilful blindness that entails a <em>deliberate</em> decision
not to make further inquiries when faced with suspicious circumstances.
…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     However,
not all facts will give rise to suspicion which necessitates a duty
to inquire on the part of the accused. It is important to bear in
mind that wilful blindness is distinct from recklessness. An accused
is <em>only</em> wilfully blind if there
is suspicion coupled with a deliberate decision not to make further
inquiries. This is opposed to a situation where the accused was merely
reckless and faced with circumstances which would not otherwise arouse
suspicion on the part of the accused: <em>Tan Kiam
Peng</em> at [127].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In
Glanville Williams, <em>Criminal Law</em> (Stevens
&amp; Sons: 2nd Ed, 1961) at p 159, the learned author comments
that in relation to wilful blindness, the accused’s calculated steps
must be so as to “cheat the administration of justice”. Prof Chan
Wing Cheong (“Prof Chan”) in his article Culpability in the Misuse
of Drugs Act at p 117 adds that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The requirement of a “deliberate” decision
not to make further inquiries shows that it is those who choose
to avoid knowledge in order to escape punishment that are brought
within the concept of wilful blindness. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Therefore,
in order to ascertain whether the accused is wilfully blind, it
is critical to inquire whether the accused by his conduct had chosen
not to make enquiry to deliberately avoid knowledge and elude punishment.
In the words of Yong Pung How CJ in <em>Chiaw Wai
Onn v Public Prosecutor</em> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 233 at [45]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[W]here the facts obviously point to one
result, and the accused must have appreciated it but shuts his eyes
to the truth, then together with the other evidence adduced, this
can form a very compelling part of the evidence to infer the requisite
guilty knowledge. Thus, if a man says to himself, <em>“Despite all
that I have seen and heard, I refuse to accept what my brain tells
me is obvious”, it is an absurdity to say that he does not have
the relevant knowledge simply because he chooses to practise Nelsonian
blindness and delude himself.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Is the accused’s wilful blindness
assessed on an objective or subjective standard?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     What
must a person be taken to know before a duty to inquire will arise?
The reasonable person in the circumstances “would have suspicions and
would have made enquiries or take other steps to allay his suspicions. There
must be suspicion and intention; carelessness or thoughtlessness
will not suffice”: <em>Public Prosecutor v Azman
bin Mohamed Sanwan</em> [2010] SGHC 196 at [147].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In <em>Public Prosecutor v Sng Chun Heng and another</em> [2011]
3 SLR 437 at [75], the court held that the assessment of wilful
blindness has to be on the basis of a person who has “average intelligence
and honesty”. However, the level of knowledge which the accused
had is also relevant and is subjective as the Court of Appeal held
in <em>Nagaenthran</em> at [30]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [Wilful blindness] is a subjective concept,
in that the extent of knowledge in question is the knowledge of
the accused and not that which might be postulated of a hypothetical
person in the position of the accused (although this last-mentioned
point may not be an irrelevant consideration) (<em>ibid</em>).
…</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was there wilful blindness by
the accused for the presence of the diamorphine hidden in his motorcycle?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Do
the circumstances in this case lead to the conclusion that the accused
was wilfully blinded to the presence of the diamorphine hidden in his
motorcycle?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The factors that pointed towards
the accused’s wilful blindness</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(I)   The modus operandi
was highly suspicious to even the accused and that pointed to his
wilful blindness</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The
accused was granted a loan of RM10,000 by Prabha for his mother’s
heart operation. In return, the accused had to bring things for Prabha
to Singapore. For each successful delivery the accused was paid RM500.
The delivery was done in highly suspicious circumstances as described
by the accused in his statement to the IO:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Each time before I enter into Singapore,
I will pass my motorcycle to ‘Prabha’ and he will put the things
inside. He will ride away on it and I will wait for about 1 to 2
hours for him at my place in Johor Bahru. He will call me to take
back the motorcycle when he is done. I will then ride the motorcycle and
go to Singapore. It takes me about 30 minutes to reach Woodlands Checkpoint.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I will then clear immigration and proceed
to ride towards Woodlands MRT. When I reach Woodlands MRT, I will
call ‘Prabha’ and then he will get someone to meet me. Each time
the person will either drive a car or come in a taxi. Normally I
will wait for about an hour before the person arrives. A Malay person
will come to meet me but not always the same person. The person
will then ride my motorcycle away before returning in about half
an hour. If he came in a car he will park it and then ride off.
Sometimes it is at a car park, sometimes it is at the vicinity of
Woodlands MRT. When the Malay person returns me my motorcycle, ‘Prohba’
will call me to tell me where the motorcycle is. The keys will be
left in the basket of my motorcycle for me. I will then ride off
and go back to Johor Bahru. When I wait for my motorcycle, I will
go shop around the Woodlands area.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     This
happened in the same manner on the day the accused was arrested
where the accused stated in his statement that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On 26 March 2012, ‘Probha’ called me on
my handphone at about 4pm and told me he wanted to talk to me. He
will drive a car to my house in Johor Bahru to meet me. He took
my motorcycle keys and tell me that he was borrowing my motorcycle
for a while. That happened at about 5pm when he arrived. He came
back after about an hour later. I then took over the keys after
6pm. I then enter Singapore after 7pm and was then stopped by the checkpoint
officers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The
accused himself admitted to being suspicious about the above modus
operandi. He alleged that he had asked Prabha repeatedly about what
he was transporting. He said under cross-examination that “[h]e (Prabha)
told me not to ask this question. ‘Just help [him].’”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> He also admitted to being suspicious
and searched his motorcycle each time the motorcycle was returned
to him for him to make the delivery in Singapore although he ultimately
found nothing suspicious.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Besides
the accused’s own suspicions being aroused, any reasonable person
in the accused’s shoes would have found the whole arrangement very
suspicious. The accused did not deny that the manner in which he
was asked to make delivery of things to Singapore subsequently caused
him to be suspicious of Prabha.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> This caused the accused
to try to find out from Prabha, every time he was asked to make
the delivery, the nature of the thing that he was transporting,
although to no avail. In the circumstances, he must have known that
Prabha was being evasive and had something to hide. Why else would
Prabha not want to tell him what “stuff” he was bringing into Singapore
and refuse to tell him what it was despite his persistence? In my
view, a reasonable person in the accused’s shoes would have found
the arrangement very suspicious.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Next,
I find it hard to believe that the accused checked his motorcycle each
time Prabha returned it to him to bring the “stuff” into Singapore. When
I inspected the motorcycle, I found that there were not many hidden places
on the motorcycle in which the “stuff” could be concealed. It would also
not take too much time to search for these places. Yet even though
the accused did more than 20 runs for Prabha and even after he checked
his motorcycle before each run was performed, he found nothing.
I find this difficult to believe. If the accused really searched
his motorcycle, he would have easily discovered the “stuff” that
Prabha had asked him to deliver, especially since he believed that
Prabha had asked him to smuggle cigarettes. It is incredible that
he could not find the “stuff” on all those runs when he knew that
Prabha had asked him to do the deliveries and paid him RM500 for
each delivery. As such, I reject the accused’s evidence that he checked
his motorcycle each time before he made the trip.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(II)   Only one of the
screws for the plastic cover, Exhibit C, was used so as to facilitate
easy retrieval of the drugs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The
accused said he failed to discover the drugs because he did not remove
the plastic cover under the basket as he said in his testimony that
he did not know how to remove it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     I
find that difficult to accept. The motorcycle is a small one and
the accused had owned it for more than a year. Thus, it is reasonable
to expect him to know every visible compartment on the motorcycle,
which is not many to begin with. The drugs were found hidden in
a compartment near the motorcycle engine under a black plastic cover,
Exhibit C. This could be easily removed as it was only secured with
a screw. It is usually secured with three screws which can be easily
removed with a screwdriver that was kept in the compartment under
the motorcycle seat. However, the evidence showed that on the day
of the accused’s arrest at the Woodlands Checkpoint, the two arms
of the plastic cover were not secured with screws. The plastic cover
was only secured by the centre screw. It appears that this was deliberate
to facilitate the removal of the cover and the retrieval of the drugs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I
further note that photographs PH14 and PH15 show the locations for
securing the two long arms of the plastic cover below the seat of
the motorcycle. One of the locations was circled by the accused
in photograph PH14. The other screw point is located opposite to
that. This is in the foreground of the photograph. However, one
of the long arms of the plastic cover could not be screwed to the
motorcycle as the anchorage point had broken off. Therefore, although
there are three places to screw Exhibit C to the motorcycle, there
were only two screw anchorage points that were useable. The third
anchorage point at one of the long arms of the plastic cover was
damaged. Therefore, I find that the Exhibit C was secured in this way
so as to facilitate the easy retrieval of the drugs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(III)   The arrangement
of the metal structure that supported the basket of the motorcycle
was set up for easy removal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Under
normal circumstances, the motorcycle basket would be secured by
three screws. The two sides of the basket would be secured to the motorcycle
with a screw each. The bottom of the basket would be supported at
the centre by a metal structure which shared the same screw point
as Exhibit C. However, I noticed that the metal support of the basket
was not secured to the motorcycle. Instead, the screw hole of the
metal support had a screw and nut, giving the impression that it
was screwed to Exhibit C to the motorcycle. The arrangement seems
to facilitate easy access to the engine compartment underneath Exhibit
C, making it easy for one to retrieve the package hidden within
by enabling easy removal of Exhibit C. At the same time, it would
give the impression that Exhibit C and the basket were secured together.
This would ensure that no suspicion would arise at the customs checkpoint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The
Defence submitted that it is unbelievable that an alleged drug trafficker
riding a motorcycle from Johor Bahru into Singapore with drugs hidden
in the engine compartment of the motorcycle would cross the Causeway
without securing the cover which concealed the drugs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> On that
basis, he urged the court to take the Prosecution’s evidence with
a “pinch of salt”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> I disagree with the Defence. In
my view, it is entirely logical from the accused’s perspective to
ride the motorcycle into Singapore with Exhibit C secured firmly
with a screw so as to facilitate its easy removal to retrieve the
drugs hidden therein. If all anchorage points were securely screwed,
it would be troublesome to remove Exhibit C especially this was done
on a regular basis for Prabha.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(IV)   The accused’s DNA
present on Exhibit B2 pointed towards his wilful blindness</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Fourth,
the accused made strenuous attempts to distance himself from Exhibit
C. This is obvious as the diamorphine was found hidden under it.
He submits that he did not know how to remove Exhibit C.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I
reject his submission. It was puzzling how the accused would not have
known how to remove Exhibit C while at the same time testifying
that he knew how to remove the basket above it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> His submission also goes against
the direct evidence present: his DNA was found on Exhibit B2, a screw
which was used to secure one of the two long arms of the plastic cover.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> His
explanation as to why his DNA was found on Exhibit B2 was inadequate;
he merely said: “I don’t know”. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Why
was the accused’s DNA found on Exhibit B2? The accused must have
come into contact with it or his DNA would not have been present. This
screw was found together with the screwdriver in the same compartment
under the motorcycle seat. It had been used to secure one of the
two arms of the plastic cover that hid the drugs. From this, I infer
that the accused was not telling the truth. He had said he did not
know how to remove Exhibit C. However, if he could remove this screw,
Exhibit B2, which was used to secure the plastic cover, why he did
not check the engine compartment, unless he knew that the black
bundle of diamorphine was hidden there? In my opinion, therefore,
this pointed towards the accused’s wilful blindness.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The factors that failed to rebut
the presumption of wilful blindness</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(I)   The Defence’s submission
regarding the two screws allegedly unaccounted for was irrelevant
and did not rebut the presumptions of possession and knowledge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     First,
the Defence submits that there were two screws besides Exhibits B2
and B3, which were unaccounted for and it was questionable what
had happened to the two screws which were meant to secure the left
and right side of the basket.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> His submission is that the Prosecution’s
evidence was inconsistent because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_a"></a>(a)     PW17,
in his examination-in-chief, had stated that not all the screws
were intact and two of them were not attached to the motorcycle.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> Under
cross-examination, PW17 also agreed that he had not seen any screw
attached to Exhibit C.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_b"></a>(b)     PW17’s
testimony contradicted the evidence of PW24, Lee Tien Shiong Herman,
which indicated that one of the exhibits was described as “A screw
attached to exhibit C”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Therefore, in the circumstances, Exhibit B3 could not have
any probative value with respect to the accused’s knowledge of the
hidden drugs in his motorcycle.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Those
facts are immaterial to my findings given that the Defence’s case
does not dispute that the <em>actus </em><em>reus</em> has been made out. In the Prosecution’s
submissions, the circumstances surrounding the handling of the exhibits
were clear: Exhibits B1, B2 and B3 were seized by PW19, Staff Sergeant
Low Kok Wee Wilson, on the instructions of the investigating officer,
PW24.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> That was corroborated by PW19
and 24’s statements. The Defence did not raise any objections to
those statements.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> In
my view, the issue about the screws is not relevant as the <em>actus </em><em>reus</em> is
not disputed: the accused was caught red-handed with the diamorphine.
Therefore, this submission is unmeritorious and fails to rebut the
presumption of knowledge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(II)   The lack of DNA
profiling on two other screws did not rebut the presumptions of
possession and knowledge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Second,
the Defence submits that besides Exhibits B2 and B3, the Prosecution
had chosen not to send two other screws for DNA analysis “for reasons
best known to them”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> Since the Prosecution
had chosen not to send those other screws for DNA profiling to establish
Prabha’s involvement, it would go some way to corroborating the
accused’s version of the story that it was Prabha who had hidden
the drugs in the motorcycle without his knowledge.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> If
DNA profiling had been done on those two other screws, the results
might have been in favour of the Defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The
submission is speculative. The burden of proof is on the Defence to
rebut the presumption of knowledge. The Defence’s submission was
built on nothing more than mere speculation that the results of
any DNA profiling test done would be favourable to the accused.
That, however, cannot be the basis on which he can rebut the presumption
of knowledge. Even if this speculation was true, it merely confirmed
the accused’s story that he was a courier for Prabha. It does not
exonerate the accused from the offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(III)   The accused’s suspicions
that he was transporting cigarettes failed to rebut the presumptions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The
accused stated in his testimony in court that he had suspected that
what he was transporting were cigarettes. This was because of the empty
cigarette cartons that he had seen in Prabha’s car.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> I
am of the view that the accused’s defence was unreliable and an
afterthought.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   The accused had every
opportunity to disclose his suspicions of transporting cigarettes
during the investigation stage</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The
accused did not disclose in any of his statements to the CNB that he
suspected that he was smuggling cigarettes for Prabha.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> When asked why
he did not inform the Investigation Officer (“IO”) of his suspicions,
he said that the IO did not ask him and if he had been asked, he
would have told him.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> I am not
convinced by the accused’s explanation as he was confronted with
the drugs found in his motorcycle and yet he neither informed the
IO nor the CNB officers that he suspected it to be cigarettes and
not drugs. When the charge was read to him in his cautioned statement,
he also did not disclose his suspicions but instead lied to the CNB
officer:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not know how it came to be in my motorcycle.
It is my elder brother who uses the motorcycle. Only today I brought
the motorcycle into Singapore. That is all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The
accused in his statement to the IO also said:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When the officers opened the black bundle
and I was able to see what was inside, I became very scared. I knew
I had done the wrong job. I did not know what it was but I thought
that it could have been drugs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The
accused later told the court about his suspicions that the drugs were
cigarettes when he was being cross-examined. The reason for his disclosure
was because he had the opportunity to do so then. If it was opportunity
that he was looking for, the sessions with the IO were excellent opportunities
for the accused to inform the IO about his suspicion that the “stuff”
that he was delivering for Prabha might be cigarettes. However, despite
those opportunities, the accused only said that he suspected the “stuff”
to be drugs. In the circumstances, I reject the accused’s defence
that he was suspicious that what he was transporting were cigarettes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)   The accused’s evidence
regarding his state of mind was hard to believe</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Second,
with respect to his state of mind, the accused was asked in cross-examination
whether it occurred to him that he must have been bringing in very
expensive goods since Prabha had loaned him RM10,000 and given him
RM500 for each delivery. His reply was: “It did not occur [to] me
because of my mother’s operation”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     I
find the above hard to believe and have grave doubts about whether his
suspicions that he was transporting cigarettes were genuine. When asked
about how it was possible to squeeze cigarette cartons into the
small compartment, the accused replied that he did “not have the
ability to think”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> While the
accused’s concern for his mother’s health condition and medical
expenses is understandable, how could he suspect that he was smuggling
cigarettes for Prabha when he was paid RM500 for each trip? The
quantity of cigarettes would have to be very large in order to justify
the trip and that consideration must have featured in the accused’s
mind at some point in time. That he was wilfully blind was clear
when he told the IO that he was suspicious of Prabha one week before
his arrest.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span> The accused’s statement
is reproduced as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A week before my arrest, I started to get
suspicious that ‘Prabha’ was paying me RM500 for each trip into
Singapore to deliver stuff. I got suspicious because he was sending
me over to Singapore in the morning. I was also suspicious that
‘Prabha’ was taking my motorcycle and then returning it an hour
later and the same thing happening here in Singapore by the Malay person.
However, because of my mother’s illness, I did not take it seriously.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     For
these reasons, I find that the facts irresistibly point towards
the accused’s wilful blindness and the presumption of knowledge
has not been rebutted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Similar fact evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In
the course of the accused’s cross-examination, the Prosecution enquired
about his previous deliveries for Prabha which were referred to
in his examination-in-chief. The Defence objected to the line of
questioning on the basis that it was similar fact evidence and therefore
prejudicial to the accused. I overruled the objection and my reasons
are as follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The
purpose for which the evidence is sought to be admitted is important.
The Court of Appeal in <em>Tan Meng Jee v Public
Prosecutor</em> [1996] 2 SLR(R) 178 explained at [37]–[42]
when similar facts evidence can be used and held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">37    It
is important to establish the purpose for which the evidence was relied
upon in order that we can discern its relevance under the Evidence
Act and, therefore, its admissibility. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">38    The Evidence Act, as envisaged by <em>Stephen</em>, admits such evidence under ss
14 and 15. Section 14 states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Facts showing the existence of any state
of mind, such as intention, knowledge, good faith, negligence, rashness,
ill-will or good-will towards any particular person, or showing
the existence of any state of body or bodily feeling, are relevant
when the existence of any such state of mind or body or bodily feeling
is in issue or relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">39    And
s 15 says:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">When there is a question whether an act
was accidental or intentional or done with a particular knowledge
or intention, the fact that such act formed part of a series of
similar occurrences, in each of which the person doing the act was
concerned, is relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">40    It
will be noted that these sections identify a number of issues to
which similar fact evidence is relevant. Since, in this case, the
similar fact evidence has been used to support a finding as to the
mental state of the appellant when he was engaged in the physical
act of transporting, they are potentially relevant under these two
sections. Whether it is possible for the law to accommodate the
use of evidence going to the proof of a matter not identified in
ss 14 and 15 is not in issue in the present case and we do not think
it advisable to pronounce on that matter more than is necessary
at the present time. What is in issue is whether the principles
pertaining to similar fact evidence allow the use of the said evidence
on the facts before us.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">41    The underlying rationale for the rule
excluding similar fact evidence is that to allow it in every instance
is to risk the conviction of an accused not on the evidence relating
to the facts but because of past behaviour or disposition towards
crime. Such evidence without doubt has a prejudicial effect against the
accused. <em>However, at times, similar facts can
be so probative of guilt that to ignore it via the imposition of
a blanket prohibition would unduly impair the interests of justice</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Similar
fact evidence was admitted in <em>Ng Beng Siang
and Others v Public Prosecutor</em> [2003] SGCA 17 (“<em>Ng Beng Siang</em>”) where the probative value
of admitting the evidence outweighed its prejudicial value against
the accused. The Court of Appeal held at [40]–[42] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">41    In
our judgment, it was clear that the previous incident had more probative
value than its prejudicial effect for two reasons. First, the defence
of Ng to the present charge was that he did not know the bundles
contained drugs. Thus evidence on the previous occasion where Ng
did a similar errand for Ken, and the unusual manner in which the
things were to be delivered, went to show that Ng could not be ignorant
of what he was conveying for Ken. Second, Ng recognised Rosdi and
Roseley because he had seen them on his first trip. This went to
establish that Rosdi and Roseley were the two persons to whom Ng
was to pass the haversack. The similar fact evidence was clearly
connected with the issues before the court. We would also add that
in the course of the trial, the judge had made it clear that he
would not take into account the potentially prejudicial effect of
this similar fact evidence as suggesting that Ng had the propensity
to commit the offence of drug trafficking.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">42    As regards the evidence relating to
the five packages found in the red plastic bag in the boot of Ng’s
car, it seemed clear to us that this evidence was adduced as a matter
of completeness. Ng stuffed twenty bundles into the haversack and
the remaining five into the red plastic bag and put them into the
boot. That was the complete story as to what happened when Ng returned to
the car after buying the haversack. More importantly, in the course
of the trial the judge expressly said that aside from the limited
purpose of providing the court with a complete account of the facts,
the evidence on the five bundles would be disregarded by him in
considering the charges preferred against the three appellants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The
facts here are similar to <em>Ng Beng Siang</em> as
the Prosecution did not adduce evidence to show that the accused
had a propensity to commit the offence as charged but to ascertain
whether the accused in this case had the necessary <em>mens
rea</em> to import diamorphine into Singapore on 26 March 2012.
This was because the accused’s defence was that he was not wilfully blind
since he checked his motorcycle every single time he performed a
job for Prabha but found nothing. The accused also claimed that
he thought that he was bringing cigarettes into Singapore. This
was on the basis of cigarette cartons found in Prabha’s car. I allowed
the Prosecution to cross-examine the accused on facts and events
that might appear to be similar fact evidence. However, I focused
strictly on what the evidence was adduced for, <em>ie</em>,
whether the accused was wilfully blind and thus had the <em>mens rea</em> to import diamorphine into Singapore
on 26 March 2012 at Woodlands Checkpoint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     I
wish to make it very clear that when I evaluated the evidence against the
accused, I did not use it to show that the accused had also delivered drugs
for Prabha on previous occasions, which would be deeply prejudicial to
him. In any case, there is no evidence to prove those allegations.
I also did not use the evidence of past deliveries or past conduct
to conclude that the accused had the propensity to import drugs
into Singapore on 26 March 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Has the accused rebutted the
presumptions under ss 18 and 21 of the Misuse of Drugs Act?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     From
the above reasons, I find that the presumption under s 18 has not
been rebutted by the accused. Section 21 of the Act reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If any controlled drug is found in any
vehicle, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to
be in the possession of the owner of the vehicle and of the person
in charge of the vehicle for the time being.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Here,
the accused admitted to ownership of the motorcycle and did not
deny that a black bundle was found hidden in his motorcycle.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span> The presumption
of possession then gives rise to the presumption that the accused
knew of the nature of the drug under s 18(2) of the Act. The presumption
in s 18(2) imputes knowledge of the nature of the drug onto the
accused when the drug is in his possession. The cumulative effect
of the two presumptions in s 18(2) and s 21 is the establishment
of the requisite <em>mens rea</em> for the
offence of importation of a controlled drug.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     On
the evidence as explained above, I find that the accused has failed to
rebut the presumption under s 18(2) and s 21 of the Act. I find
that the accused was a drug mule for Prabha and was paid RM500 each
time the delivery was successfully completed. His failure to check,
despite these suspicious circumstances, amounts to wilful blindness
which equates to actual knowledge. His defence that he thought he
was being asked to smuggle in cigarettes cannot stand as it is based
on his denial of knowledge that the black bundle contained diamorphine.
His bare denial is insufficient to rebut the presumption of possession
and knowledge of the diamorphine on a balance of probabilities.
Accordingly, the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the Act
has not been rebutted on a balance of probabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     For
the above reasons, I find that the Prosecution has proven its case against
the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I find the accused
guilty and convict the accused for the offence of importation of 75.41g
of diamorphine into Singapore under s 7 of the Act.</p>
