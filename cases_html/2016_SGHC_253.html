This offence can be committed in a wide range of situations for a wide range of purposes. A passenger who lies to the traffic police that he was the driver of the car to protect an intoxicated friend who was driving, a father who lies to a school principal about his home address to get his child into primary school, or a public servant who lies to his boss at work to conceal certain errors he made, may all be found guilty of an offence under s 182 of the Penal Code (“s 182”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Thus, to define the interest that the offence was intended to protect is difficult. The interests at stake vary across the wide range of different possible situations. Nevertheless, it may generally be said that at the heart of the offence lies the <span class="font-italic">harm</span> that would be caused from lying to a <span class="font-italic">public servant</span> (as opposed to any other ordinary person) because of the <span class="font-italic">unique</span> <span class="font-italic">powers and duties</span> that a public servant generally has – as the provision specifies, the offender must <span class="font-italic">intend</span> or <span class="font-italic">know</span> that his false information will likely cause the public servant to misuse his lawful powers or act in breach of his duties as a public servant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 This appeal concerns an ex-school principal who pleaded guilty to an offence under s 182 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code 1985”) for falsely telling his Cluster Superintendent that he was <span class="font-italic">not</span> having an extra-marital affair with a school vendor. The district judge (“the DJ”) meted out a sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment, and the appellant appeals against his sentence on the basis that the DJ erred in fact and law, and that the sentence is manifestly excessive. This appeal gives us the opportunity to provide some guidance on the correct approach to sentencing s 182 offences, which hopefully will help lower courts in dealing with the myriad of factual situations that come before them, and enable a greater degree of consistency in sentencing. We appointed a young amicus curiae, Mr Benny Tan Zhi Peng (“the amicus”), to address us on the appropriate sentencing guidelines for offences under s 182 of the Penal Code. We were greatly assisted by his written brief and would like to record our gratitude. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Mr Koh Yong Chiah (“the Appellant”) is a 61-year-old male Singapore citizen who was a principal at four different schools from 1995 to 2012 and a Cluster Superintendent for three months in 1999, where he supervised school principals.

This should be discussed first so that it can be applied to the facts. The <span class="font-italic">second issue</span> is whether the sentence in the present case is manifestly excessive. Specifically, consideration must be given as to whether the <span class="font-italic">custodial threshold</span> is crossed, and if so, whether the <span class="font-italic">duration</span> of four weeks’ imprisonment is manifestly excessive. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sentencing guidelines for s 182 of the Penal Code </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 It is imperative to first consider the statutory provision. Section 182 of the Penal Code 1985, which is the provision the Appellant was charged under because his offence was committed in 2005, states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Whoever gives to any public servant any information orally or in writing which he knows or believes to be false, intending thereby to cause, or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby cause, such public servant to use the lawful power of such public servant to the injury or annoyance of any person, or to do or omit anything which such public servant ought not to do or omit if the true state of facts respecting which such information is given were known by him, shall be punished with <span class="font-italic">imprisonment for a term which may extend to 6 months, or with fine which may extend to $1,000, or with both</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 This was amended in 2008, and the <span class="font-italic">present</span> s 182 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2012 Rev Ed) states:   </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Whoever gives to any public servant any information which he knows or believes to be false, intending thereby to cause, or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby cause, such public servant to use the lawful power of such public servant to the injury or annoyance of any person, or to do or omit anything which such public servant ought not to do or omit if the true state of facts respecting which such information is given were known by him, shall be punished with <span class="font-italic">imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine which may extend to $5,000, or with both</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The main effect of the 2008 amendment was to increase the maximum sentence for a s 182 offence from <span class="font-italic">six months’ imprisonment and a $1,000 fine</span>, to <span class="font-italic">one year imprisonment and a $5,000 fine</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The amendment was intended to afford the courts more flexibility to impose higher sentences when the facts justified it, rather than to signal that Parliament viewed the offence with increased severity. In the 2007 Parliamentary debates on the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill, which contained the abovementioned change to the maximum sentence for s 182 offences as well as the penalties for other offences, Member of Parliament Mr Lim Biow Chuan said as follows (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</span> (23 October 2007) vol 83 at col 2418):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">... I would like to seek the Minister’s affirmation that by amending the range of penalties prescribed, the intention of Parliament is not for the judges to automatically increase the punishment nor should the courts interpret the setting of a higher limit to mean that the crime has become more serious...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [I]n this current set of amendments which are not specific to any particular offence, the intention of Parliament surely must be simply to allow the courts to have greater sentencing options to mete out appropriate sentences. Heavier penalties should thus be imposed by the courts only where there are aggravating factors and there should not be a rise in the punishment across the board for all offences simply because of this amendment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In response, Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs, Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee, agreed with Mr Lim’s observation (at col 2439):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Mr Lim Biow Chuan asks whether what we have done will lead automatically to fines or punishments going up. I do not think so. He has mentioned, for example, the benchmarks, the sentencing guidelines, that the courts have. I think the guidelines will continue. It does not mean that automatically when the maximum punishment is raised, the punishment will go up. Because every punishment must depend on the facts of the case. …</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sentencing precedents</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Before considering specific sentencing guidelines for s 182 offences, it is helpful to first identify the main ways in which s 182 offences have been committed in Singapore. A review of the sentencing precedents would allow an appreciation of the different circumstances in which the offence would normally arise, as well as the factors which have played a role in sentencing.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 First, a significant number of s 182 cases concern persons who falsely report innocent persons to the police. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Rajeshwary</span><span class="font-italic"> d/o Batumalai v Public Prosecutor</span> [2014] SGDC 153, the offender falsely made a police report alleging that her stepfather had stolen her jewellery when in fact, she had agreed to allow her stepfather to pawn her jewellery.

She recanted her false statement only <span class="font-italic">four and a half months </span><span class="font-italic">later</span>. The district judge sentenced her to twelve weeks’ imprisonment.

He did so because he felt he had been cheated by the victims, who promised him contracts for his renovation business if he paid them $10,000. After he paid them $4,000, no contracts materialised. Further, the victims continued pestering him for the remaining $6,000. The offender stated in mitigation that he had been put under extreme pressure to pay and did not realise that he could be prosecuted for making a false police report. Further, he was only prosecuted after three years. The district judge found that the mitigating factors were sufficient to spare the offender a prison sentence and ordered the <span class="font-italic font-underline">then</span><span class="font-italic font-underline"> maximum fine of $1,000</span>.

The police had to expend additional resources to determine the offender’s true identity, locate him and then charge him for these offences.

She pleaded guilty to an offence under s 182 and on appeal, was <span class="font-italic font-underline">fined $1,000</span> by the High Court but did not receive a custodial term (see <span class="font-italic">Sentencing Practice</span> at p 1102).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 From the above, it appears that offenders who provide false information to shield <span class="font-italic">another person</span> from investigation or prosecution have not necessarily been treated less severely than offenders who provide false information to shield <span class="font-italic">themselves</span>. Nevertheless, on some occasions, offenders who committed the offence to protect another person have been treated more lightly by the courts if no other aggravating factors are present (see for <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Ee Chong Kiat Tommy </span>and <span class="font-italic">Kuah </span><span class="font-italic">Geok Bee</span>, which were cited in <span class="font-italic">Yang </span><span class="font-italic">Suan Piau Steven v Public Prosecutor</span> [2013] 1 SLR 809 at [23] as being “exceptions to the norm” due to their unique circumstances). It would appear that in some circumstances, the absence of personal gain could play a role in reducing the seriousness of the offence.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Fourth, are cases where a person gave false information to public servants to subvert a public institution’s screening process. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">PP v Loo Way Yew </span>(PS 2278/97) (“<span class="font-italic">Loo Way </span><span class="font-italic">Yew</span>”), the offender gave false information on six occasions in his blood donor registration form about whether he had had sex with a prostitute in the past 12 months and whether he had lived in or visited other countries. He pleaded guilty to three charges under s 182 and gave his consent for three other similar charges to be taken into consideration. His blood was tested positive for HIV and had been transfused to two patients who contracted HIV. The offender was not aware of his condition at all material times. He was sentenced to <span class="font-italic font-underline">six months’ imprisonment</span> for each charge, with two of the sentences ordered to run consecutively. He therefore faced a total of 12 months’ imprisonment and there was no appeal against this decision (see <span class="font-italic">Sentencing Practice</span> at p 1097). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In<span class="font-italic"> CLB and another v Public Prosecutor</span> [1993] 1 SLR(R) 52 (“<span class="font-italic">CLB</span>”),<span class="font-italic"> </span>the appellants were blood donors who made false declarations on the blood donor registration form about their sexual history.  Their blood was later tested positive for HIV, though neither of them knew they had the disease. They each pleaded guilty to a single charge under s 182 for giving false information to a public servant, the Medical Director of the Singapore Blood Transfusion Service, in their respective donor registration forms. The High Court found that a two-month sentence would have been appropriate given (i) the importance of encouraging blood donors not to treat the questionnaire in the donor registration form lightly, and (ii) the danger inherent in the particular falsehoods given. However, bearing in mind the mitigating factors in this case (<span class="font-italic">CLB</span> at [4] and [8]), including the fact that a voluntary donation of one’s blood is a commendably noble and civic-conscious act, no harm was caused, the appellants did not act with malice, not knowing that they themselves were infected, the appellants pleaded guilty at the first opportunity, and personal gain did not operate as an active incentive to lie, the High Court sentenced the appellants to <span class="font-italic font-underline">one months’ imprisonment</span> (see <span class="font-italic">CLB</span> at [10]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In <span class="font-italic">PP v West Jack Gilbert</span> [2004] SGDC 310 (“<span class="font-italic">West Jack Gilbert</span>”), the offender made false statements to the Ministry of Education in his application forms for “Registration as a Teacher” in order to obtain an employment pass to work as a teacher. He declared that he had not been convicted in a court of law in any country when he had in fact been convicted for drug offences, rape, criminal intimidation and carrying concealed weapons in the United States of America. He was sentenced to <span class="font-italic font-underline">one months’ imprisonment</span> for each of the two s 182 offences. The offender’s appeal against sentence was withdrawn. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) In <span class="font-italic">Wong Yi </span><span class="font-italic">Hao Henry v Public Prosecutor</span> [2015] SGHC 232 (“<span class="font-italic">Wong Yi </span><span class="font-italic">Hao Henry</span>”), the offender gave false information about his residential address in his application to register his daughter for primary school admission. The High Court held that “in the absence of any material indicating that offences of this nature had been or are becoming more prevalent, and with no additional aggravating features present”, there was insufficient basis to impose a custodial sentence and the sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment should be reduced to a $5,000 fine (at [6] and [7]). No opposition was raised by the Public Prosecutor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Many of the above cases clearly trigger the public interest and are examples of possible situations in which the provision of false information to a public servant has the potential to cause serious harm to a large group of people. Of course, the gravity of the offence still can vary greatly within this category of cases (comparing, for <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the seriousness of lying about one’s criminal record in an application to be a teacher against providing false information for primary school admissions). Further, the comparison between <span class="font-italic">CLB</span> and <span class="font-italic">Loo Way Yew </span>demonstrate that the materialisation of actual harm can make a significant difference to the sentence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Fifth are cases where a person who gave false information to public servants to facilitate fraud on a third party to gain some personal benefit. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Tew Yee Jeng</span> [2016] SGDC 28, the offender (a Malaysian) conspired on multiple occasions with different groups of people to stage road traffic accidents in Singapore for the purpose of making fraudulent insurance claims. He managed to cause several accidents involving heavy vehicles, and submitted insurance claims thereafter. On one occasion, the offender induced one Helen to make a police report stating that a genuine accident had happened and that she was the driver of the vehicle when it was actually the offender behind the wheel. Helen was also asked to omit to mention the offender’s involvement in the accident. Helen then made a fraudulent insurance claim. The offender was charged with several counts of conspiracy to cheat, dangerous driving, and one count of abetting another person to furnish false information under section 182 read with section 109 of the Penal Code. In relation to the s 182 offence, the district judge found that “the “false report has to be viewed in the context of the overall motor insurance fraud that was being perpetrated by the Accused and his accomplices. In this light, the false report took on a completely different complexion and fell into a very aggravated form of a section 182 offence” (at [32]). In particular, the district judge took into account the fact that (i) the offender played a central role in the offences, (ii) he entered Singapore with the sole purpose of committing these offences, and (iii) innocent road users had been exposed to great risk of personal injury and property damage (at [21]). A <span class="font-italic font-underline">four-</span><span class="font-italic font-underline">month imprisonment term</span> was therefore meted out for the s 182 offence. This was upheld on appeal.

He falsely reported to the police that the money was stolen to cover up his misappropriation of the funds. He faced two charges under s 182, and further charges for criminal breach of trust. In determining the sentence, the judge took into account the fact that (i) the offender was the mastermind of the whole scheme (at [84]), (ii) the offences committed were serious in nature (at [86]), (iii) his scheme involved removing the money beyond the boundaries of the country (at [86]), (iv) the offender was one of the very few senior security personnel in the firm entrusted with performing escort duties and yet he misappropriated the very money which he had been charged to protect (at [86]), and (v) the offence struck at the heart of the security industry here and adversely affected the reputation of Singapore as a safe country to do business, thus engaging the public interest (at [87]). He was sentenced to <span class="font-italic font-underline">two months’ imprisonment</span> for each of the two charges he faced under s 182 (to run concurrently). The sentence was upheld on appeal.

The offender’s motivation for making the false report was to defraud his insurers and get an insurance pay-out. The district judge found that the case was “devoid of any aggravating factor” as the offender was not evading prosecution, shielding someone from prosecution, or making a false allegation of a crime to exact revenge or injure reputation (at [9]).  The judge thus found that a <span class="font-italic font-underline">fine of $4,000</span> would serve the ends of justice (at [9]). The Prosecution withdrew its appeal against sentence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The above cases also demonstrate the wide range of fraudulent schemes a s 182 offence can be part of, ranging from more complex insurance fraud schemes involving foreign syndicates, to the making of a false police report about where one’s motorcycle was stolen in the hope of satisfying the terms for an insurance pay-out. The sentences imposed thus differed accordingly. However, it seems to us that the sentence imposed in <span class="font-italic">Alvin Chan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>may have been too lenient, bearing in mind the fact that the fraud did not relate to an insignificant sum and there is a public interest in protecting the insurance industry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Sixth are cases where a public servant gave false information to another public servant about matters relating to the offender’s employment. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Low </span><span class="font-italic">Vins</span> [2015] SGDC 6, a police officer falsely told his superior that he had visited two drug offenders’ homes and that they were not in, resulting in the drug offenders being deprived of the option of being sent to Drug Rehabilitation Centre even though they had dutifully reported for bail. Instead, they were considered as offenders who had absconded and were duly prosecuted and charged in court. The offender was convicted under two charges under s 182 and received <span class="font-italic font-underline">three months’ imprisonment</span> per charge, to run concurrently.

Some of Super Bike Centre Pte Ltd’s (“Super Bike”) motorcycles were about to be auctioned off by the LTA to recover outstanding road tax arrears. The offender represented to the officers at the Road Tax Arrears department that his supervisor had authorised the removal of Super Bike’s motorcycles from auction, and then represented to his supervisor that the road tax arrears had been paid even though they had not. The offender was convicted after trial of one charge under s 182. The district judge found that the following factors aggravated the offence: (i) the offence was deliberate, (ii) the offender abused his position as an investigation officer and trusted colleague, and (iii) he was in fact a law enforcement officer whose duty was to uphold the law rather than to subvert it in the way that he did (at para [104]).

He was in charge of purchasing a batch of foldable bicycles for NParks. He tipped off one Lawrence Lim about the upcoming tender for the supply of bicycles and gave him an indication of the price NParks was willing to pay. It transpired that Lawrence Lim was the sole bidder and he was awarded the tender. In an internal investigation about NParks’ purchase of a batch of foldable bicycles, which the offender was in charge of, the offender denied knowing Lawrence Lim. The offender also instigated Lawrence Lim to deny knowing him to the authorities who questioned him. He faced two charges under s 182, but was not charged with corruption. In sentencing the offender, the judge took into account the fact that (i) the price NParks paid for the bicycles was not excessive (at [98]), (ii) there was no predicate offence (at [104]), (iii) the offender recanted his false statement after two days (at [105]) and (iv) no reliance was placed on the offender’s false statement (at [123]).

These cases often engage a unique type of public interest related to the integrity of the Public Service and the performance of public duties not seen in other cases. Slightly different considerations are therefore at play in sentencing.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 From the above review, it can be seen that s 182 would encompass a wide range of misconduct in different circumstances. While certain fact patterns stand out, and while the sentences imposed in cases bearing similar fact patterns may be rationalised, it is doubtful if a <span class="font-italic">single</span> sentencing framework would ever be adequate to cater to the full range of different factual scenarios. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Submissions on the appropriate sentencing guidelines </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 We first consider the Prosecution’s and the amicus’ submissions on the appropriate sentencing guidelines for s 182 offences.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Prosecution</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The Prosecution puts forward two broad guiding principles for determining whether the custodial threshold has been crossed:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether any serious consequences arose from the breach of applicable regulations or whether the conduct was so wholly innocent that one can disregard it as an incidental transgression; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether the investigation relates to conduct which would, if undetected or unpunished, so undermine the standing of the public service that the punishment must be a custodial sentence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The Prosecution also identifies four further factors which are relevant to offenders who are themselves public servants:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the offender was a high ranking or influential official, or a junior official; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether the consequences of the falsehood involved a significant aggregate amount;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether the falsehood was perpetuated over an extended period of time, or was repudiated/recanted soon after the falsehood was uttered; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) whether the falsehood was said to cover-up a deliberate breach of conduct rules, or to cover-up a careless lapse on the part of the public servant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In our view, while the Prosecution’s proposed guiding principles identify relevant factors that the courts should take into account in sentencing offenders under s 182, they are not adequate as guidelines for <span class="font-italic">all types</span> of s 182 offences. For example, in the case of an offender who lies to the police to cover for his friend who would have been prosecuted for drink driving, there would be no breach of “applicable regulations” to speak of ([36(a)] above), nor would there be any “breach of conduct rules” to cover-up ([37(d)] above).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 We agree with the amicus’ approach of sentencing offenders based on the degree of culpability and harm involved. Further, in our view, the amicus’ proposed sentencing guidelines helpfully and comprehensively identify the type of concerns that have featured in the sentencing precedents and that should shape the sentences for offences committed under s 182. However, given (a) the narrow sentencing range available to the courts under s 182, (b) the wide variety of factual circumstances in which the offence may be committed and (c) the importance of maintaining simplicity and flexibility in the sentencing guidelines laid down, we have some reservations about categorising the appropriate sentence for this offence into four groups based on <span class="font-italic">significant</span> culpability and harm. We shall explain.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Our view on the appropriate sentencing guidelines</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In <span class="font-italic">CLB</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [9], the High Court observed that “s 182 covers an extensive array of misinformation of greatly varying degrees of iniquity”. This diversity is evident from our above survey of the types of conduct falling within s 182. Indeed, in <span class="font-italic">Lim Bernard</span><span class="font-italic"> CA</span>, the Court of Appeal observed that a wide array of factors was germane to sentencing for a s 182 offence (at [22]), and that it was difficult to lay down sentencing benchmarks in the abstract without the particular facts of the case (at [23]). While this observation may be true of sentencing in general, in our view, the wide variety of misconduct that is caught under s 182 makes it <span class="font-italic">exceptionally</span> difficult to identify a single set of principal factors which can form the basis of a sentencing framework. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47   In <span class="font-italic">Poh</span><span class="font-italic"> Boon Kiat v Public Prosecutor</span> [2014] 4 SLR 892 for example, the court managed to identify “principal factual elements” applicable across <span class="font-italic">all</span> the vice-related offences under consideration, and found it possible to define three levels of culpability and two categories of harm based on those principal facts (at [74]–[78]). Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Vasentha</span><span class="font-italic"> d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor </span>[2015] 5 SLR 122, the court was able to build its sentencing framework for the offence of trafficking in diamorphine on the quantity of drugs involved in the trafficking charge as this would inevitably have a strong bearing on the sentence to be imposed (at [19] and [23]). From these examples, it is clear that a prerequisite to establishing a detailed sentencing framework for a particular offence is the possibility of identifying a set of principal fact(s) that significantly impact the gravity of the offence <span class="font-italic">across the board</span>.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In our judgment, it is difficult to categorise s 182 offences based on a set of “principal factual elements”. The way in which the offence may be committed, the offender’s motivation and the outcome of a s 182 offence can take a wide variety of shapes and forms. <span class="font-italic">In particular</span>, we find it difficult to define in the abstract a uniform set of factors that allows us to categorise an <span class="font-italic">offender’s</span><span class="font-italic"> degree of culpability</span> for s 182 offences and in turn the appropriate punishment. For example, the significance of the fact that a lie was repeatedly told, or that the offender may have had an intention to reap personal benefit, must be assessed <span class="font-italic">in context</span> before the extent to which these factors aggravate the offence can be assessed. As we put to the parties in the course of the hearing, a public servant may have repeatedly lied to his superiors about not being the one who did not turn off the printer or the lights in the office. This is however unlikely to be treated by the courts as a serious criminal offence. We would add that the factors which the amicus identified as indicating “significant culpability” do not seem to be well suited to s 182 of the Penal Code. The amicus adapted those factors from the United Kingdom sentencing guidelines for the offence of fraud by failing to disclose information,

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> Amicus’ brief at para 37.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> which is quite different from an offence of giving false information to a public servant. Also, as seen from the amicus’ own illustrative table, the contemplated circumstances under which “significant culpability” may be found have rarely presented themselves in the s 182 offences we have seen in Singapore. Their utility as part of a sentencing framework is thus limited. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In the circumstances, given the broad nature of the s 182 offence, we are of the view that we can do no more than to give some broad guidance as to the type of cases that would generally attract a <span class="font-italic">custodial </span><span class="font-italic">sentence</span> as a <span class="font-italic">starting point</span>. Thereafter, we identify a non-exhaustive set of factors which we think can affect the degree of culpability and harm of a s 182 offence. These factors can then be used to determine if the starting point should be departed from and/or what the appropriate quantum of fine or imprisonment term should be.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Custodial threshold</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In our view, whether the custodial threshold is crossed should essentially be determined based on the <span class="font-italic">degree of harm</span> caused or likely to be caused by the s 182 offence. As the High Court in <span class="font-italic">CLB</span> observed at [9], “the [sentencing] norm must be varied according to the circumstances of each case, in particular, <span class="font-italic">the mischief that might be caused by the false information</span>” [emphasis added]. Specifically, if <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">appreciable harm</span> may be caused by the s 182 offence, the courts should, as a starting point, impose a custodial term. The range of harm that may ensue includes personal injury (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, by causing another to contract HIV), loss of liberty (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, by causing another to be unjustifiably arrested), financial loss (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, by lying to facilitate the misappropriation of property or to commit insurance fraud) or harm arising from the wastage of public investigative resources.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Several qualifications should also be added:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the harm must be <span class="font-italic">causally connected</span> to the provision of false information. In other words, the only relevant harm is the harm that was caused by the provision of false information. For example, an offender who lies about being the driver of the car to shield his friend from a drink driving charge merely makes it more difficult for the investigative authorities to bring the true perpetrator to justice and may cause the wastage of investigative resources – which is a different form of harm in itself. The false information, however, did not cause the drink driving offence to be committed.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the harm in question must be <span class="font-italic">more than</span> <span class="font-italic">de </span><span class="font-italic">minimis</span>. It is important to keep in mind that a custodial term is only justified if the offence is of sufficient gravity. Parliament has increased the range of possible fines to give the courts more flexibility to impose higher fines instead of a custodial term. For example, unless otherwise proved, misleading investigative authorities for a few hours or even a day or two may not on the facts have the potential to bring about sufficient harm such as to justify a custodial term as the starting point. The <span class="font-italic">Lim</span><span class="font-italic"> Bernard DC</span> case is an illustration of this. The fact that the offender lied about his relationship with Lawrence Lim before recanting two days later cannot be said to have caused more than <span class="font-italic">de </span><span class="font-italic">minimis</span> harm to the investigative process or public resources. By contrast, in <span class="font-italic">Liu </span><span class="font-italic">Linyan</span> for example, although the false statement was recanted after a day, it caused the victim of the false allegation to be unjustifiably held in police custody for 19 hours (see [22(c)] above). This is clearly appreciable harm. Also, in <span class="font-italic">CLB</span>, lying on a blood donor form had the potential to cause significant harm even if no harm actually eventuated (in that no third person was infected with HIV); the serious potential consequences were sufficient to justify a custodial sentence as a starting point. In this kind of situation, public interest and general deterrence must be accorded paramount consideration.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, harm in this context refers to both <span class="font-italic">actual</span> and <span class="font-italic">potential</span> harm. The fact that harm did not actually eventuate because the lie was detected fast enough or the offender was simply lucky should not detract from the justifiability of a custodial sentence if the potential for harm to be caused was real and significant. For example, in cases such as <span class="font-italic">Kumaran</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see [30(b)] above), even if the money was eventually recovered and returned to the victim after the offender was apprehended, the offence nevertheless still had the strong potential to cause the victim financial loss by facilitating the commission of the predicate offence and this harm should contribute to pushing the case across the custodial threshold. By contrast, and for the sake of argument, if the sum misappropriated had been merely a few dollars, this may be considered no more than <span class="font-italic">de </span><span class="font-italic">minimis</span> harm.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, it would usually, if not always, be relevant to assess the potential harm caused by the offence with reference to the <span class="font-italic">duration</span> that the falsehood was maintained. It can be fairly said that generally, if the falsehood was recanted quickly, appreciable harm is unlikely to be caused.     </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Finally, it is acknowledged that “appreciable harm” is not a test capable of being applied with scientific precision. There will be many cases on the borderline, especially when the court is required to assess the potential consequences which <span class="font-italic">could have</span> ensued from the provision of false information, but did not on the facts. Nevertheless, it should be borne in mind that the sentencing court must still ultimately exercise its discretion on the facts of each case. The laying down of guidelines is merely intended to achieve a measure of consistency in sentencing and to provide a starting point for the courts. It is not meant to restrict the court’s discretion in sentencing, something which we recognise is much needed especially in the context of s 182 offences.       </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 We would add that in our view, there is good basis to rely <span class="font-italic">essentially</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>on the<span class="font-italic"> degree of</span><span class="font-italic"> harm</span> to define the custodial threshold as a <span class="font-italic">starting point</span>. Section 182 of the Penal Code ultimately seeks to protect the public against the <span class="font-italic">potential harm</span> that may result from a public officer misusing his/her powers, or failing to perform his/her duties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 This approach is generally consistent with the sentencing precedents. In <span class="font-italic">Wong Yi </span><span class="font-italic">Hao Henry</span> for example, a fine was justified because no appreciable harm was caused by the offender lying to the primary school about his residential address (see [28(d)] above). But we must emphasise that should an offence of such a nature become more prevalent, the public interest may well dictate otherwise. Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Lim Bernard DC</span>, a fine was justified because the offender’s attempt to cover up his relationship with Lawrence Lim did not have the potential to cause appreciable harm given that his superiors did not take his word at face value and continued investigating into possible improprieties (see [32(c)] above). This would have made further improprieties in the procurement process unlikely even if the offender had not recanted his false statement. Moreover, that case involved a one-off purchase. Also, in cases where an offender provides false information to shield another from investigation (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, in <span class="font-italic">Ee Chong Kiat Tommy </span>or <span class="font-italic">Kuah </span><span class="font-italic">Geok Bee </span>– see [26(e)] and [26(f)] above), where this does not cause a significant wastage of investigative resources nor does it hurt any third party, the starting point of a custodial sentence may not be appropriate. However, we must reiterate that we are merely laying down a starting point. In <span class="font-italic">some</span> cases where harm is <span class="font-italic">de </span><span class="font-italic">minimis</span> but culpability is high, (for <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, where aggravating factors such as the offender’s irresponsibility (see for <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, in <span class="font-italic">Sivaprakash</span> at [26(a)] above), persistence in maintaining the lie (see for <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, in <span class="font-italic">Yeo Fang Yi</span> at [26(b)] above) or evidence of pre-meditation (see for <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Poh</span><span class="font-italic"> Chee Hwee </span>at [26(c)]  above) exist), a custodial sentence <span class="font-italic">could</span> very well be justified on the facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Conversely, cases in which the offender makes a police report alleging a crime against an innocent party have generally resulted in custodial terms given the risk of arrest and embarrassment those false allegations create (see [22] above). Also, cases in which the false information has caused a significant wastage of public resources have also resulted in a custodial term (see for <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Moscardon</span> at [24(a)] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 We should point out that in the case of <span class="font-italic">Alvin Chan </span>(see [30(c)] above), while the offender was sentenced to a $4,000 fine on the facts, we are of the view that the <span class="font-italic">starting point</span> should have been a custodial sentence given that the attempted insurance fraud had the potential to cause significant financial losses to the insurer. Other mitigating factors may justify reducing the sentence to a fine instead – but that would have to depend on the specific facts of the case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Other relevant sentencing factors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The above test of appreciable harm merely provides the sentencing court with a <span class="font-italic">starting point</span>.

</div> – in fact, this case is less serious than <span class="font-italic">CLB</span>, <span class="font-italic">Charan</span><span class="font-italic"> Singh</span> and <span class="font-italic">West Jack Gilbert</span>, all of which are cases where a four weeks’ imprisonment term was meted out. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Relevance of the procurement improprieties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The most important question that arises on the facts of this case is whether the prior and subsequent procurement improprieties the Appellant perpetrated from 2005 to 2012 is a relevant sentencing factor. Before us, counsel for the Appellant, Mr Eric Tin (“Mr Tin”), submitted that the procurement improprieties were simply not on the Appellant’s mind during the interview. Instead, he was overwhelmed by the embarrassment of being confronted with his extra-marital affair. The procurement improprieties are therefore not connected to the present offence and given that the Appellant is not being punished for those procurement improprieties but for the provision of false information about his affair with Ivy, the court should not take into account the procurement improprieties in sentencing the Appellant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In this regard, it is essential to carefully scrutinise the section of the statement of facts describing the interview:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">18. During the interview, Ms Chia directly questioned the accused on whether he had an affair with Ivy – a service provider to JJC. The accused falsely stated to Ms Chia, a public servant, that he was not having an affair with Ivy, which information he knew to be false. He was adamant in his denial. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">19.  During the interview, as the accused denied being sexually involved with Ivy, <span class="font-italic">Ms</span><span class="font-italic"> Chia reminded the accused about the importance of maintaining the integrity of the procurement process, and advised the accused against any personal involvement with Ivy, whose company was bidding for contracts and providing services to the accused’s school. </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The accused acknowledged that he understood </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Ms Chia’s advice</span>. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60  From the statement of facts, it is evident that (a) Ms Chia did direct the Appellant’s mind to the issue of possible procurement improprieties, and (b) the Appellant acknowledged that he understood Ms Chia’s advice. In this context, it is unbelievable that the issue of procurement improprieties was not on the Appellant’s mind <span class="font-italic">at all</span>. Even if the Appellant did not realise, at the time he denied the extramarital affair, that the interview pertained to procurement issues, he must have realised what was at stake <span class="font-italic">after</span> Ms Chia reminded him about the importance of maintaining the integrity of the procurement process. At that point, it was open to him to retract his denial. Even if he was too embarrassed to do so, the least he could have done, if he truly felt embarrassment and remorse, was to remove himself from the position of conflict of interest thereafter. Instead, the Appellant continued signing off on contracts awarded to Ivy’s Companies. The Appellant’s provision of false information to Ms Chia <span class="font-italic">enabled</span> him to cover up his improper involvement in approving contracts to Ivy’s Companies, and perpetrate the procurement improprieties for the next seven years, tainting the award of more than $3m worth of government contracts.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In the circumstances, we are of the view that the Appellant’s continued involvement in the award of government contracts to Ivy’s Companies is clearly a relevant sentencing factor that should be taken into account and which aggravates the offence. It does not matter that the Appellant’s intention may not have been to cover up the procurement improprieties or to help Ivy obtain more contracts in future. There is a clear causal connection between the provision of false information and the continuation of the procurement improprieties. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Custodial threshold</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 As mentioned, to determine whether the case justifies a custodial term, at least as a starting point, the court has to ask whether the offence caused, or had the potential to cause, appreciable harm. In this case, there is no finding of actual corruption or misuse of public funds. Nevertheless, in our view, appreciable harm was clearly caused by the offence. By concealing his affair with Ivy, a school vendor, and passively maintaining the falsehood, the Appellant was allowed to undermine the integrity of the procurement process and confidence in the Public Service,

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> especially since the conflict of interest went undetected for a long period of time. It is also significant that a large number of contracts of significant value were infected by this impropriety (regardless of whether Ivy could have obtained the contracts without the Appellant on the final approving board).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 This case is clearly distinguishable from <span class="font-italic">Lim Bernard DC</span>, which the defence relied heavily upon. In <span class="font-italic">Lim Bernard DC</span>, the provision of false information only impeded internal investigations for about two days, after which, the lie was recanted. The offending conduct in that case was done in order to <span class="font-italic">cover</span><span class="font-italic"> up</span> a <span class="font-italic">prior</span> impropriety; it did not facilitate or allow the commission of <span class="font-italic">further</span> improprieties. Harm to person or property, or to the public service, did not <span class="font-italic">continue</span> to be caused by the false provision of information. In this case, the provision of false information <span class="font-italic">enabled</span> the procurement improprieties to <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">continue</span> for the next <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">seven years</span>, and for more than <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">$3m </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">worth of government contracts </span>to be tainted by this. The harm in this case is therefore clearly much greater.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In our judgment, the custodial threshold in this case is undoubtedly crossed. As a starting point, a custodial sentence should be imposed. It only remains to be determined whether the other relevant sentencing factors justify (a) a departure from this starting point, or (b) lowering the term of imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Other relevant factors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In our view, the fact that the Appellant did not repeat the lie which is the subject of the charge is not significantly mitigating. Given his senior position in the public service, he was clearly trusted by Ms Chia and MOE. The fact that he was allowed to continue sitting on the QAP approving contracts to Ivy’s Companies demonstrates that the MOE assumed throughout that he was telling the truth (without him having to repeat the lie). We find it particularly aggravating that despite having been warned by Ms Chia, and claiming to have been embarrassed by the situation, he nevertheless allowed the procurement improprieties to continue for such a long time. Indeed, in a case like the present, so long as the false statement was not retracted, that effectively amounted to a continuous assertion of the falsehood by the Appellant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66  Also, we did not think the DJ erred in treating the absence of a corruption charge as a neutral factor. While she may have given a view as to why the Appellant was not charged with corruption, she nevertheless treated that as a neutral factor and we do likewise in reviewing the Appellant’s sentence. As we made clear at [62] above, we sentence the Appellant on the basis that there is no finding of actual corruption or misuse of public funds. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 As to the Appellant’s motive for lying, we are content to accept Mr Tin’s submission that the Appellant’s motive was not to cover up the previous procurement improprieties, or to enable the perpetration of further procurement improprieties for Ivy’s benefit. However, even if he was, <span class="font-italic">momentarily</span>, motivated primarily by embarrassment, his subsequent brazen conduct was clearly inconsistent with any continued embarrassment or remorse. And as stated at [65], so long as he did not retract his false statement, he was in effect continuously asserting the falsehood.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In Singapore, the integrity of the public service and its freedom from corruption are matters which are highly prized. Public perception and trust in the government and in its integrity is of the highest importance. The Appellant’s actions significantly threatened this, bearing in mind the length of time his affair went undiscovered, as well as the value of contracts that were improperly approved by the Appellant (given the conflict of interest). The Appellant knowingly concealed his affair with Ivy and continued to improperly approve government contracts to Ivy’s Companies. Such conduct impinges on the public interest and must be deterred. This is especially since the effect of the Appellant’s lie was enhanced by the trust reposed in him as a senior public servant by the MOE. No further investigation was carried out – he was taken at his word and allowed to continue awarding contracts to Ivy’s Companies undiscovered. These are significantly aggravating factors. Seen in this light, we are of the view that his contributions to the public service and evidence of his good character – the very things he abused in committing the offence – are not of substantial mitigating value.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 All things considered, therefore, we do not think that the four weeks’ imprisonment term is manifestly excessive.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Mr Tin has raised three precedents which we will briefly deal with. <span class="font-italic">CLB</span> concerned the making a false declaration on a blood donor form (see [28(a)] above), and <span class="font-italic">West Jack Gilbert</span> involved an offender providing false information about his past criminal record on an application to MOE to be a teacher (see [28(c)] above). In both these cases, the offender was sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment and Mr Tin’s submission is that the present case is less serious. In our view, these fact patterns are too dissimilar to the present to be a meaningful basis for evaluating the appropriateness of the present sentence. In <span class="font-italic">CLB</span>, the interest protected was the public health system and the well-being of patients who receive blood. In <span class="font-italic">West Jack Gilbert</span>, what was primarily at stake was the well-being of the students that the offender was allowed to interact with. In this case, we are concerned with the integrity of the Public Service and the procurement process. These are incommensurables and it is impossible to say which interest is more important and worthy of greater protection. We therefore see no basis for Mr Tin’s submission that the offences in <span class="font-italic">CLB</span> and <span class="font-italic">West Jack Gilbert </span>are more egregious. Given the wide diversity of s 182 offences, it is only meaningful for the sentencing courts to compare sentencing precedents which bear at least <span class="font-italic">some</span> factual resemblance to the case before it.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 <span class="font-italic">Charan Singh</span> bears slightly more resemblance to the present case as it also involves a public servant abusing his position in the provision of false information (see [32(b)] above). However, we note that the improprieties in <span class="font-italic">Charan</span><span class="font-italic"> Singh</span> were quickly detected (unlike the seven years it took in this case) and did not involve sums as large as those involved in the present case. Therefore, there is no basis to say that the offence in <span class="font-italic">Charan</span><span class="font-italic"> Singh</span> was more serious than the present. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Public servant offenders</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Finally, we should address the relevance of the fact that the offender guilty of a s 182 offence may himself be a public servant. In our view, this is not <span class="font-italic">always</span> an aggravating factor. Insofar as the offender’s status as a public servant may accentuate the harm caused by his actions, or may increase his culpability for the offence because he may have abused his position in the public service in telling the lie, these will certainly be relevant sentencing factors that aggravate the offence. However, where the false information was provided in a context that is completely unrelated to his work, the fact that the offender is a public servant is unlikely to be an aggravating factor.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Mohdnizam bin Othman</span> [2007] SGDC 41, the offender, a police officer, falsely reported to the police that his ex-wife had forged his signature in an application for a card, triggering investigations into cheating and forgery against her. In fact, he had authorized her to sign the application form on his behalf. He only falsely reported his ex-wife to the police after their marital relationship broke down. The court found that the fact the offender was a police officer holding the rank of sergeant was an aggravating factor as his duty was to uphold the law, not to abuse it (at [52]), and sentenced the offender to three months’ imprisonment. The sentence was upheld on appeal.

</div> We have serious doubts as to the correctness of this proposition. The motive and circumstances in which the offence was committed clearly had nothing to do with the offender’s job. It was done against his ex-wife following the break-down of his personal relationship.  The fact that the offender also happened to be a sergeant with the police force should not have been treated as an aggravating factor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The present case is different.
