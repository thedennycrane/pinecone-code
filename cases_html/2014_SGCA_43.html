        Sundaresh Menon CJ (delivering the grounds of decision of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal arises from an application to strike
                    out a claim for damages for constructive dismissal and, alternatively, breach of
                    the implied term of mutual trust and confidence in a contract of employment. The
                    key issue in this appeal concerns the extent of damages that can theoretically
                    be claimed in such circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The appellant in this case is Mr Wee Kim
                    San Lawrence Bernard (“the Appellant”). From 9 October 2006
                    until the end of August 2012, the Appellant was employed by the respondent,
                    Robinson &amp; Company (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“the Company”), a
                    retailer which operates the “Robinsons” brand of department stores
                    in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Appellant resigned from the Company on
                    24 August 2012. It is not disputed that the Company paid the Appellant four
                    months’ salary in lieu of notice and the appropriate amount in cash for
                    his unconsumed annual leave. This was despite the fact that the
                    Appellant’s contract of employment provided for payment of only two
                    months’ salary in lieu of notice. The relevant provision in the contract
                    was as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">4.   
            <b>NOTICE OF
                            TERMINATION</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">After confirmation, written notice of termination from either party
                            will be two (2) calendar months or two (2) calendar months’ salary
                            in lieu of such notice without assigning any reasons whatsoever.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 6 December 2012, the Appellant commenced
                    Suit No 1036 of 2012 (“the Suit”) against the Company seeking
                    damages for constructive dismissal. He claimed that he had been forced to resign
                    as a result of persecution and unreasonable bias that had been directed towards
                    him by the Company or its officers. In the alternative, the Appellant claimed
                    that the Company had breached the implied term of mutual trust and confidence in
                    his contract of employment with the Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 18 June 2013, the Company filed Summons
                    No 3064 of 2013 (“SUM 3064/2013”) with a supporting
                    affidavit to strike out the Suit. On 15 July 2013, the Appellant filed an
                    affidavit to oppose the Company’s striking-out application. In response,
                    the Company filed Summons No 3969 of 2013 to expunge two paragraphs of the
                    Appellant’s affidavit. The summonses were heard on 6 August 2013 by
                    an assistant registrar (“the AR”), who granted both
                    applications.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Thereafter, on 20 August 2013, the
                    Appellant filed Registrar’s Appeal No 286 of 2013
                    (“RA 286/2013”) against the AR’s decision to strike out
                    his claim and Registrar’s Appeal No 287 of 2013 against the
                    AR’s decision to strike out the two paragraphs of his affidavit. The two
                    appeals were heard together on 9 September 2013 by a High Court judge
                    (“the Judge”), who dismissed both appeals. The Judge’s
                    grounds of decision are reported in <em>Wee Kim San Lawrence
                        Bernard v Robinson &amp; Co (Singapore) Pte Ltd</em> [2014] 1 SLR
                    1382 (“the GD”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Appellant appealed to this court against the
                    decision of the Judge. Although the Appellant’s notice of appeal stated
                    that the appeal was against the whole of the decision given by the Judge on
                    9 September 2013, it was subsequently clarified that the appeal was only in
                    respect of the Judge’s decision in RA 286/2013 upholding the
                    AR’s decision to strike out the Appellant’s claim. We shall
                    therefore deal with only SUM 3064/2013 and RA 286/2013 in these
                    grounds of decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 29 May 2014, after hearing submissions
                    from counsel, we dismissed the appeal and gave brief grounds. We now give the
                    detailed reasons for our decision. Before that, however, it is essential that we
                    briefly outline and explain the arguments made by the parties at various stages
                    of these proceedings, which in turn shaped the issues that arose for our
                    determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The arguments and the proceedings below</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Suit</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       As stated above, the Suit was commenced by the
                    Appellant against the Company for damages for constructive dismissal and,
                    alternatively, breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence in his
                    contract of employment with the Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Pertinently, in relation to the alternative
                    claim for breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence, the writ of
                    summons filed by the Appellant stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    Further or in the
                            alternative, the [Appellant’s] claim against the [Company] is for
                            breach of [the] implied term of mutual trust and confidence in the
                            [Appellant’s] employment agreement with the
                        [Company].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<u>PARTICULARS OF CONSTRUCTIVE
                            DISMISSAL</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    There is an implied term of mutual trust and
                                confidence in relation to the [Appellant’s] employment
                                agreement with the [Company], which the [Company] profess to uphold
                                in their Fair Employment Practices’ tagline “We are
                                proud to be an equal opportunity employer”.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    It is further clear, in the treatment of the
                                [Appellant], that the [Company] had acted unfairly in the [<em>sic</em>] breach of the implied term of mutual
                                trust and confidence, and had, therefore, repudiated the
                                [Appellant’s] contract of employment and effected a
                                constructive dismissal[.]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The striking-out application</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Before the AR</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Company applied in SUM 3064/2013 to
                    strike out the Appellant’s claim in the Suit pursuant to O 18
                    r 19 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“the Rules”) on the ground that it was frivolous, vexatious and
                    an abuse of process. The Company submitted that the Appellant’s claim was
                    legally unsustainable because even if the Appellant had been constructively
                    dismissed (which it denied), he would not have been entitled to anything more
                    than two months’ salary as stated in his employment contract. As it was,
                    he had already received more than this amount. Moreover, the Company argued, the
                    Appellant’s claim was an abuse of process as it had been commenced for the
                    collateral purpose of exerting pressure on the Company to pay him additional
                    sums.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Appellant’s argument in response was
                    that his cause of action in constructive dismissal was legally and factually
                    sustainable. Relying on the decision of the House of Lords in <em>Malik v Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA</em> [1998] AC
                    20 (“<em>Malik</em>”), among other case
                    authorities, the Appellant argued that he could mount a claim against the
                    Company for continuing financial loss beyond the contractual notice period
                    stated in his employment contract if the Company had breached the implied term
                    of mutual trust and confidence, resulting in a loss of future employment
                    prospects.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The AR granted the Company’s
                    striking-out application, noting that the Appellant had not pleaded any special
                    damages for his alleged inability to secure employment following his alleged
                    constructive dismissal by the Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Before the Judge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In the Appellant’s appeal against the
                    AR’s decision in SUM 3064/2013 (<em>ie</em>,
                    RA 286/2013), the parties’ arguments and their respective positions
                    remained largely unchanged. In particular, the Company reiterated its position
                    that although it did not agree that the Appellant had been constructively
                    dismissed, for the purposes of its striking-out application, it would proceed on
                    the assumption that that was indeed the case. On that basis, the Company
                    submitted that since the Appellant had already been paid more than his
                    contractual entitlement of two months’ salary in lieu of notice, he was
                    not entitled to any further payments. The Company further submitted that
                        <em>Malik</em> was of no relevance since that case
                    related not to a cause of action founded on constructive dismissal, but to a
                    separate cause of action for damages constituted by a loss of future employment
                    prospects.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Judge dismissed RA 286/2013, holding
                    that the Appellant’s claim was “doomed to fail” (see the GD
                    at [30]) because even if he had been constructively dismissed, he would only
                    have been entitled to two months’ salary in lieu of notice as stated in
                    his employment contract, and he had already received more than that. The Judge
                    also stated that <em>Malik</em> did not assist the
                    Appellant since his statement of claim did not disclose any particulars relevant
                    to establishing a breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence;
                    neither had the Appellant particularised his claim for “stigma”
                    losses or damages flowing from the alleged breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The arguments before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In his written submissions, the Appellant
                    raised three main arguments as to why the Suit should not be struck out:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     first, there was an arguable case
                        that he was entitled to damages exceeding the amount of salary payable for
                        his contractual notice period if such damages flowed from the breach of the
                        implied term of mutual trust and confidence in his contract of employment
                        with the Company;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     second, he was entitled to seek declaratory relief as to whether
                        there had been a breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence
                        that entitled him to resign; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     third, there was a conflict of evidence as to the nature
                        and purpose of the Company’s payment of four months’ salary to
                        him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Appellant’s position, especially
                    with regard to his first argument stated above, was clarified in oral
                    submissions by his counsel on appeal, Mr Paul Tan
                    (“Mr Tan”). Mr Tan clarified that the Appellant’s
                    claim was neither for loss of future employment prospects as in <em>Malik</em>, nor for other types of continuing or
                    post-termination financial losses arising from his dismissal. Instead, the
                    Appellant was only claiming damages in respect of the alleged financial loss
                    arising from the premature termination of his employment with the Company.
                    Mr Tan submitted that the Appellant’s claim for damages beyond the
                    amount of salary payable for his contractual notice period was legally
                    sustainable because damages flowing from a breach of the implied term of mutual
                    trust and confidence in a contract of employment had to be assessed in
                    accordance with normal contractual principles. According to Mr Tan, this
                    would be so even if, as in this case, the only consequence of the breach was
                    that it brought the contract of employment to a premature end. In effect,
                    Mr Tan was advocating the proposition (in relation to contracts of
                    employment) that a breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence was
                    so different in nature from any other type of breach that the damages in respect
                    of the former type of breach stood to be assessed differently even if it
                    resulted in the identical consequence as the latter type of breach, namely, the
                    premature termination of the employment relationship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     According to Mr Tan, where the premature
                    termination of an employment relationship was brought about by the breach of a
                    term other than the implied term of mutual trust and confidence, damages would
                    fall to be assessed by reference to the orthodox rule, that is to say, by
                    reference to the salary payable in respect of the period of notice which had to
                    be given in order to lawfully effect the termination. However, Mr Tan
                    contended, where the premature termination was the consequence of a breach of
                    the implied term of mutual trust and confidence, the employee’s loss
                    should be measured by reference to what he would have earned had that breach not
                    occurred. The Appellant’s position was that there was no evidence that his
                    employment with the Company would have been terminated if the implied term of
                    mutual trust and confidence had not been breached by the Company. Therefore, he
                    should, in principle, be entitled to claim damages assessed on the basis that he
                    would have remained in the employment of the Company indefinitely, subject to
                    the usual limiting principles of mitigation, remoteness and so on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     As against this, the Company maintained that
                    the Appellant’s claim was legally unsustainable because he had already
                    received more than his contractual entitlement of two months’ salary in
                    lieu of notice, which was the normal measure of damages for constructive
                    dismissal. The Company’s position was that any breach of the implied term
                    of mutual trust and confidence, as pleaded in the present case, was relevant
                    only to the issue of repudiation of the employment contract (<em>ie</em>, constructive dismissal), and that could not give rise to an
                    entirely separate basis for assessing damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues in this appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The issues that arose for our determination
                    were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether, assuming that the Appellant
                        had been constructively dismissed as a consequence of the Company’s
                        breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence, his claim for
                        damages beyond the amount of salary payable for the contractual notice
                        period stated in his employment contract was legally sustainable. We refer
                        to this as “the Measure of Damages Issue”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the Appellant’s claim
                        should not be struck out because he was entitled to a declaration that the
                        Company had breached the implied term of mutual trust and confidence. We
                        refer to this as “the Declaratory Relief
                    Issue”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether the Appellant’s claim should not be struck out because there
                        was a conflict of evidence as to the nature and purpose of the
                        Company’s payment of four months’ salary to him. We refer to
                        this as “the Settlement Agreement Issue”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Measure of Damages Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Measure of Damages Issue, which concerns
                    the legal sustainability of the Appellant’s claim for damages beyond the
                    amount of salary payable for his contractual notice period, formed the main
                    plank of the Appellant’s case. An action would be legally unsustainable if
                    it is clear as a matter of law that even if the party concerned were to succeed
                    eventually in proving all the facts that he has to prove in order to establish
                    his case, he would not be entitled to the remedy sought: see <em>The “Bunga Melati 5”</em> [2012] 4 SLR 546 at
                    [39]. This is one of the tests applied to determine whether a party’s
                    claim is plainly or obviously unsustainable such that it should be struck out
                    under O 18 r 19(1)(<em>b</em>) of the
                    Rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In our judgment, the Appellant’s claim
                    for damages beyond the amount of salary payable for his contractual notice
                    period was legally unsustainable. Mr Tan’s contention that breaches
                    of different types of terms which result in identical consequences can
                    nonetheless give rise to different measures of damages seems suspect to begin
                    with. Damages are compensatory in nature, and where the consequences of breaches
                    of different types of terms are the same, there is no obvious reason to
                    recompense the plaintiff differently based on the particular type of term that
                    has been breached. It is true that a breach of an applicable notice period will
                    generally only have one type of consequence, and that, in contrast, a breach of
                    the implied term of mutual trust and confidence can have one or more of a
                    variety of consequences. A breach of this implied term could give rise, as it
                    allegedly did here, to the premature termination of the employment contract.
                    But, it could also give rise to an altogether separate category of injury or
                    loss such as emotional distress or impairment of future employment prospects.
                    The Appellant’s claim was expressly stated by Mr Tan to be only for
                    damages for financial loss arising from the premature termination of his
                    employment with the Company. The claim was not for post-termination losses such
                    as the loss of future employment prospects, or for other types of injury such as
                    mental or emotional distress.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The concept of constructive dismissal and the
                    implied term of mutual trust and confidence in an employment contract are
                    distinct but closely related. “Constructive dismissal” refers to
                    the situation where the employer’s repudiatory breach entitles the
                    employee to treat himself as discharged from the employment contract; although
                    it is the employee himself who terminates the contract, he is considered as
                    having been “constructively” dismissed by the employer. It is as
                    though the employer had effectively terminated the contract by manifesting an
                    intention no longer to be bound by the contract, which position is then accepted
                    by the employee. The concept was explained thus by Lord Denning MR in
                    the English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Western Excavating
                        (ECC) Ltd v Sharp</em> [1978] QB 761 at 769:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the employer is guilty of conduct which is a significant breach going
                        to the root of the contract of employment, or which shows that the employer
                        no longer intends to be bound by one or more of the essential terms of the
                        contract, then the employee is entitled to treat himself as discharged from
                        any further performance. If he does so, then he terminates the contract by
                        reason of the employer’s conduct. He is constructively dismissed. The
                        employee is entitled in those circumstances to leave at the instant without
                        giving any notice at all or, alternatively, he may give notice and say he is
                        leaving at the end of the notice. But the conduct must in either case be
                        sufficiently serious to entitle him to leave at once.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The implied term of mutual trust and
                    confidence in employment contracts developed as a means of bringing employee
                    dismissal cases within the scope of the doctrine of constructive dismissal and,
                    therefore, within the reach of the unfair dismissal legislation in England: see
                        <em>Eastwood and another v Magnox Electric plc</em>
                    [2005] 1 AC 503 (“<em>Eastwood</em>”) at
                    [4]–[5]. The developed formulation of the implied term of mutual trust and
                    confidence, as far as the employer is concerned, is that the employer shall not,
                    without reasonable and proper cause, conduct itself in a manner calculated and
                    likely to destroy or seriously damage the relationship of mutual trust and
                    confidence between employer and employee: see <em>Malik</em> at 45 (<em>per</em> Lord Steyn).
                    A breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence by the employer
                    would constitute a breach of a fundamental term of the contract of employment,
                    and an employee who accepts this breach as a repudiation of the contract would
                    be treated as though he has been “constructively” dismissed by the
                    employer: see <em>Eastwood</em> at [6]. But, a breach of
                    this implied term can also give rise to other consequences, as we shall
                    demonstrate below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Where the breach of the implied term of mutual
                    trust and confidence results in constructive dismissal, as it allegedly did
                    here, it will give rise to a claim for what Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead
                    termed “premature termination losses” (see <em>Malik</em> at 36E), <em>ie</em>, losses that are
                    causally connected to the premature termination of the employment contract. In
                    such a situation, as a matter of principle, the damages awarded to the employee
                    should be the same as the damages which would have been awarded if the employee
                    had been actually (rather than constructively) dismissed unlawfully. The normal
                    measure of damages in cases of wrongful dismissal is the amount which the
                    employee would have received under the employment contract had the employer
                    lawfully terminated the contract by giving the required notice or paying salary
                    in lieu of notice, subject to mitigation: see <em>Alexander
                        Proudfoot Productivity Services Co S’pore Pte Ltd v Sim Hua Ngee Alvin
                        and another appeal</em> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 933 (“<em>Proudfoot</em>”) at [13] and <em>Teh
                        Guek Ngor Engelin née Tan and others v Chia Ee Lin Evelyn and
                        another</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 22 at [20]. This rule flows from the
                    established principle that the breach in issue having occurred, damages are to
                    be assessed on the basis of the defendant’s “least onerous
                    obligation”. What this means in this context is that the employee is
                    entitled to be put in the position he would have been in if the employment
                    contract had been brought to an end lawfully. Where the defendant has the option
                    of performing a contract in several ways, damages for his breach of contract
                    must be assessed on the assumption that he will perform the contract in the way
                    that is most beneficial to himself, and not in the way that is most beneficial
                    to the claimant: see Harvey McGregor QC, <em>McGregor on
                        Damages</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 18th Ed, 2009) at
                    para 8-093 and <em>Cockburn v Alexander</em> (1848)
                    6 CB 791 at 814. Therefore, in a case of wrongful dismissal (including
                    constructive dismissal), damages should be assessed on the basis that the
                    employer would have exercised any power it might have had to bring the
                    employment contract to an end at the earliest date at which it could lawfully do
                    so: see <em>Gunton v Richmond-Upon-Thames London Borough
                        Council</em> [1981] Ch 448 at 469.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Where a claim is brought for loss occasioned
                    by premature termination of an employment contract, none of the foregoing
                    analysis is displaced just because the claim is mounted on the back of an
                    alleged breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence. While the
                    cases have recognised that a breach of this implied term is capable of giving
                    rise to financial losses of a <em>different</em> nature
                    which are to be assessed on a separate footing from that established in the
                        <em>Proudfoot</em> line of authorities, this is so only
                    where the consequence of the breach is something <em>other
                        than</em> the premature termination of the employment contract. The
                    leading example of this would be the “continuing financial losses”
                    sustained and claimed as damages where the breach has affected an
                    employee’s future employment prospects. This was recognised as a
                    recoverable head of loss by the House of Lords in <em>Malik</em>, subject to proof of causation and the limiting principles
                    of remoteness and mitigation: see <em>Malik</em> at 37 and
                    48. In <em>Malik</em>, it was held that the employees
                    concerned could prove in the employer’s liquidation for
                    “stigma” damages reflecting the damage to their future employment
                    prospects caused by the corrupt manner in which the employer’s business
                    had been run in breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence.
                    Another example would be financial loss flowing from psychiatric or other
                    illness brought about by the employer’s breach of this implied term: see
                        <em>Eastwood</em> at [29].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Losses of such a nature that flow from a
                    breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence are conceptually
                    distinct from those resulting from the premature termination of an employment
                    contract, and are therefore recoverable in principle and liable to be assessed
                    in an appropriate manner. The limits that apply to the assessment of damages for
                    wrongful dismissal have nothing to do with the assessment of those types of
                    damages claims. The decision of the Hong Kong Court of Appeal in <em>Semana Bachicha v Poon Shiu Man</em> [2000] 2 HKLRD 833
                        (“<em>Bachicha</em>”) is instructive in
                    this respect. That case concerned a domestic helper who was subjected to an
                    oppressive work regime and, consequently, forced to leave her employment after
                    six months. It was held that the domestic helper was entitled to damages for
                    wrongful dismissal on the usual measure, <em>as well
                        as</em> damages for any additional pecuniary loss caused by the
                    employer’s breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence which
                    was not too remote: see <em>Bachicha</em> at 850E. The
                    court in <em>Bachicha</em> stated that a given set of facts
                    might constitute both a breach of the implied term requiring reasonable notice
                    to be given to lawfully terminate the employment contract, as well as a breach
                    of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence, thereby giving rise to
                    simultaneous but separate entitlements to damages (at 848J–849A):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my view, it follows from the foregoing analysis that a given set of
                        facts may constitute both kinds of breaches giving rise simultaneously to
                        separate entitlements to damages, each independently computed, but subject
                        obviously to the avoidance of any double recovery. The employer’s
                        wrongful conduct might constitute a wrongful dismissal (particularly in the
                        form of a constructive dismissal) and at the same time, a breach of the
                        trust and confidence implied term, the latter causing continuing financial
                        loss not confined by the usual wrongful dismissal measure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The distinction between the damages
                    recoverable for wrongful dismissal and the damages recoverable for an
                    independent breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence stems from
                    the different types of consequences that may flow from such a breach. In some
                    cases, as here, the only consequence of the breach of the implied term is that
                    it brings about the premature termination of the employment contract. In such
                    cases, the measure of damages laid down in the <em>Proudfoot</em> line of cases would apply. In other instances, the
                    breach might have other consequences. In <em>Malik</em>,
                    for instance, the court recognised “stigma” damages as a
                    recoverable head of loss flowing from the breach of an implied but independently
                    actionable term (see <em>Johnson v Unisys Ltd</em> [2003]
                    1 AC 518 (“<em>Johnson</em>”) at [44]
                        <em>per</em> Lord Hoffmann and at [77] <em>per</em> Lord Millett; see also <em>Arul
                        Chandran v Gartshore and others</em> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 436 at
                    [23]). As the Hong Kong Court of Appeal noted in <em>Bachicha</em> at 847, <em>Malik</em> showed
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… where the breach does not relate merely to unlawfulness in the
                        termination but involves a breach of <em>some other
                            obligation</em> causing the employee loss going beyond the
                        “premature termination losses” that usually flow from a
                        wrongful dismissal, damages may properly be recovered in respect of
                            <em>such different or further losses</em>, provided
                        they are causally attributable to the breach and not too remote. [emphasis

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The same is true of the Australian cases
                    relied on by the Appellant. These were similarly instances where the courts were
                    concerned with consequences <em>other than</em> premature
                    termination arising from a breach of the implied term of mutual trust and
                    confidence in an employment contract. For instance, in the New South Wales Court
                    of Appeal case of <em>Shaw v State of New South Wales</em>
                    (2012) 219 IR 87; [2012] NSWCA 102 (“<em>Shaw</em>”), the plaintiff mounted a claim for damages for
                    loss of future earnings and earning capacity arising from a separate and
                    distinct breach of this implied term: see <em>Shaw</em> at
                    [108]–[116].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In the decision of the Federal Court of
                    Australia in <em>Commonwealth Bank of Australia v
                        Barker</em> (2013) 214 FCR 450 (“<em>Barker</em>”), the employer concerned was found to have
                    breached the implied term of mutual trust and confidence in failing to take
                    positive steps to consult the employee about alternative positions and give him
                    the opportunity to apply for such positions before terminating his employment:
                    see <em>Barker</em> at [131]–[132]. <em>Barker</em> was not concerned with the employee’s
                    dismissal, since what was at issue was the employer’s failure to take
                    steps to secure a suitable alternative position for the employee, which was
                    separate from and anterior to the termination of his employment: see <em>Barker</em> at [15]. We note in passing that in <em>Barker</em>, there was a strong dissent by Jessup J
                    suggesting that the implied term of mutual trust and confidence should not form
                    part of Australia’s law of contracts of employment; the decision in
                        <em>Barker</em> is presently on appeal before the High
                    Court of Australia for this issue to be decided.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Reference was also made before us to the
                    decision of the Singapore High Court in <em>Wong Leong Wei Edward
                        and another v Acclaim Insurance Brokers Pte Ltd and another suit</em>
                    [2010] SGHC 352 (“<em>Acclaim
                    Insurance</em>”), where, on the authority of <em>Malik</em>, it was said (at [52]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [I]n principle, if it can be shown that the defendant had
                        wrongfully dismissed [the first plaintiff] in a manner that was dishonest or
                        illegitimate which amounted to a breach of the implied term of trust and
                        confidence, and as a direct result of that wrongful dismissal it can be
                        proven that [the first plaintiff] suffered a real and provable financial
                        loss, in my view, [the first plaintiff] would be entitled to claim against
                        the defendant for such loss beyond the contractual notice period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In our judgment, <em>Acclaim
                        Insurance</em> does not stand for the proposition that an employee
                    whose <em>only</em> complaint is that he has been
                    wrongfully dismissed may nonetheless claim damages beyond his salary for the
                    contractual notice period. The claim by the employee in <em>Acclaim Insurance</em> was for damages arising from the handicap
                    which he allegedly suffered in the labour market following his wrongful
                    dismissal. The “financial loss” mentioned in the above passage
                    from <em>Acclaim Insurance</em> was directed at the loss of
                    employment prospects arising from a breach of the implied term of mutual trust
                    and confidence (as in <em>Malik</em>), and not at the
                    premature termination losses arising from the wrongful dismissal itself: see
                        <em>Acclaim Insurance</em> at [48].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     It should further be noted that decisions such
                    as <em>Malik</em> and <em>Bachicha</em>, which, in our judgment, stand for the narrower
                    proposition that a breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence can
                    give rise to other heads of damage where consequences other than premature
                    termination of the employment contract have flowed, may now have to be read even
                    more restrictively in the light of the decision of the House of Lords in
                        <em>Johnson</em> and subsequent cases. <em>Johnson</em> held that the implied term of mutual trust and
                    confidence did not apply in wrongful dismissal cases, such that a claim for
                    “stigma” damages could not be made where the basis of the action
                    was wrongful dismissal. This limitation, which has come to be known as
                    “the ‘<em>Johnson</em>
                    exclusion’”, has been subsequently reaffirmed in English law: see
                        <em>Eastwood</em> and <em>Edwards v
                        Chesterfield Royal Hospital NHS Trust</em> [2012] 2 All ER 278.
                    In <em>Eastwood</em>, Lord Nicholls described the
                    boundary lines of the “<em>Johnson</em>
                    exclusion” thus (at [31]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In cases of constructive dismissal a distinction will have to be drawn
                        between loss following from antecedent breaches of the trust and confidence
                        term and loss flowing from the employee’s acceptance of these breaches
                        as a repudiation of the contract. The loss flowing from the impugned conduct
                        taking place before actual or constructive dismissal lies outside the
                            <em>Johnson</em> exclusion area, the loss flowing
                        from the dismissal itself is within that area.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Thus, under English law, claims for damages based on breaches
                        of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence can only be brought if
                        the cause of action in question accrued before and existed independently of
                        the cause of action for wrongful dismissal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     No authoritative view has been expressed on
                    the applicability of the “<em>Johnson</em>
                    exclusion” in Singapore: see <em>Cheah Peng Hock v Luzhou
                        Bio-Chem Technology Ltd</em> [2013] 2 SLR 577 and <em>Chan Miu Yin v Phillip Morris Singapore Pte Ltd</em> [2011]
                    SGHC 161. The main rationale underlying the decision in <em>Johnson</em> was that to allow an employee to recover damages for
                    loss arising from the manner of his dismissal would be inconsistent with the
                    English statutory scheme for compensation for unfair dismissal. For the purposes
                    of the present appeal, it is unnecessary for us to express a final view on this
                    issue. Regardless of whether or not the “<em>Johnson</em> exclusion” applies in the Singapore context, it
                    is clear that where wrongful dismissal is the only consequence of a breach of
                    the implied term of mutual trust and confidence and no other independent
                    consequence flows from such a breach, the only damages recoverable by the
                    employee will be damages for premature termination losses flowing from the
                    employer’s failure to give proper notice or pay salary in lieu of
                    notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In our judgment, the cases relied on by the
                    Appellant did not stand for the broad (and, in our view, incorrect) proposition
                    that was urged upon us – namely, that the normal measure of damages for
                    wrongful dismissal as stated in the <em>Proudfoot</em> line
                    of cases (see [25] above) would not apply to a case of constructive dismissal
                    whenever this arose from a breach of the implied term of mutual trust and
                    confidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In the present case, it was accepted that the
                    Appellant’s claim was only for financial loss arising from the premature
                    termination of his employment with the Company. As such, there was no reason to
                    apply anything other than the normal measure of damages for wrongful dismissal.
                    The writ of summons filed by the Appellant alleged that the Company had
                    repudiated the contract of employment and effected a constructive dismissal by
                    breaching the implied term of mutual trust and confidence (see [10] above). The
                    Appellant’s pleadings asserted neither an independent breach of the
                    implied term of mutual trust and confidence nor any “continuing financial
                    losses” going beyond the premature termination losses that usually flow
                    from a wrongful dismissal. There was no question of “continuing financial
                    losses” such as those resulting from an impairment of future employment
                    prospects, or separate and distinct injuries such as illness or mental or
                    emotional distress. In truth, the Appellant’s claim was simply one for
                    constructive dismissal, for which compensation for the loss suffered would, in
                    this case, be confined to two months’ salary in lieu of notice as
                    stipulated in the Appellant’s employment contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     There were also difficulties with
                    Mr Tan’s suggestion that the Appellant’s loss should be
                    assessed on the basis that his employment with the Company would have continued
                    indefinitely in the absence of evidence that the Company would have exercised
                    its right to terminate the employment contract at the earliest opportunity. The
                    very essence of a claim for constructive dismissal is that the employer is in
                    repudiatory breach of the employment contract and no longer intends to be bound
                    by it. It is implicit in the nature of such a claim that had the employee not
                    resigned, the employer would have terminated the employment contract at the
                    earliest date at which it could lawfully do so. This, in the end, is another way
                    of making the point that we are driven ultimately to hold the defendant employer
                    to his least onerous obligation (see [25] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Moreover, if the parties have agreed that the
                    employer has a right to terminate the employment contract upon notice or payment
                    of salary in lieu of notice, it would be inconsistent with that contractual
                    right to say that the employer nevertheless has to pay an employee who has been
                    wrongfully dismissed damages that extend beyond the amount of salary payable for
                    the contractual notice period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In addition, as we pointed out during the
                    hearing of the present appeal, it is a well-established principle that there
                    cannot be specific performance of a contract of employment under the common law:
                    see <em>Francis v Municipal Councillors of Kuala
                        Lumpur</em> [1962] 1 WLR 1411 at 1417–1418, <em>Lim Tow Peng and another v Singapore Bus Services Ltd</em>
                    [1974–1976] SLR(R) 673 at [17] and [20], as well as <em>Arokiasamy Joseph Clement Louis v Singapore Airlines Ltd</em> [2002]
                    2 SLR(R) 924 at [50]. To accept the proposition that damages for
                    constructive dismissal in the present circumstances should be assessed on the
                    basis that the employment relationship would have continued indefinitely would
                    seem to be incompatible with the principle that there is no right to specific
                    performance of an employment contract, or, to put it another way, no right to
                    require an employer to continue the employment relationship indefinitely. Yet,
                    this must be the implicit premise underlying the contention that the employee is
                    entitled to have his damages assessed on the basis that his employment would
                    have continued indefinitely.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Finally, we note that the Appellant’s
                    contention –
                    <em>viz</em>, that he was entitled to claim damages
                    assessed on the basis that he would have remained in the employment of the
                    Company – was contradicted by his own pleadings. Paragraph 8(f) of
                    the writ of summons filed by the Appellant stated that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There were attempts to make the [Appellant] leave the [Company] early, and
                        there were also threats made to the [Appellant] that if the [Appellant]
                        refused to accept salary in lieu of notice until 30 November 2012, the
                        [Company] would serve the [Appellant] a termination letter, and the
                        [Appellant] would only be paid two months’ salary in lieu of
                        notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>This statement clearly recognised that if the Appellant had
                        refused to resign or accept the Company’s termination offer, the
                        Company would have exercised its contractual right to terminate his
                        employment by paying him two months’ salary in lieu of
                    notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     For all these reasons, we were not with the
                    Appellant on the Measure of Damages Issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Declaratory Relief Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     We now turn to the Declaratory Relief Issue.
                    In our judgment, the Appellant’s position on this issue was likewise
                    without merit. The Appellant’s contention was that whatever else might be
                    said, he was entitled to a declaration that the Company had breached the implied
                    term of mutual trust and confidence in his employment contract. There were
                    several difficulties with this argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     At the outset, as the Appellant himself
                    conceded, he did not in his pleadings seek declaratory relief. The argument on
                    declaratory relief was raised for the first time in this appeal. That is a
                    considerable obstacle in and of itself. But, even if the Appellant were to be
                    allowed to seek declaratory relief and this matter were to be tried, the
                    question that must inevitably arise is: to what end? This brings us to the
                    question of whether there remains a “real controversy” between the
                    parties. That there must be a “real controversy” for the court to
                    resolve is one of the basic requirements to establish standing to seek
                    declaratory relief: see <em>Karaha Bodas Co LLC v Pertamina
                        Energy Trading Ltd</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 112 at [14] and <em>Tan Eng Hong v Attorney-General</em> [2012] 4 SLR 476 at
                    [72]. The declaration that the Appellant sought in this case would have no
                    consequence at all since, given our holding above in relation to the Measure of
                    Damages Issue, the Appellant had no legally sustainable basis to claim anything
                    more than what he had already received. The Appellant’s interest was to be
                    compensated, and on the view we have taken, he had already been compensated.
                    There was, therefore, no “real controversy” left to warrant
                    pursuing any form of declaratory relief.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Aside from this, it is evident, for the
                    reasons set out at [45] below, that the parties had agreed on payment in lieu of
                    notice as the means of settling the dispute between them. Having entered into
                    such an agreement and having accepted the payment made by the Company as a
                    consequence, it was impermissible for the Appellant to then seek to pursue a
                    theoretical claim for a declaration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Settlement Agreement Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     With regard to the final issue, which is the
                    Settlement Agreement Issue, the Appellant’s argument that his claim should
                    not be struck out since there was a conflict of evidence as to the nature and
                    purpose of the Company’s payment of four months’ salary to him was
                    just as untenable as his position on the other issues. The Appellant’s
                    writ of summons itself stated that “[i]t was only after protracted
                    negotiations that the [Company] finally agreed to pay the [Appellant] salary in
                    lieu of notice until 31 December 2012”, suggesting that the payment
                    of four months’ salary was in consideration of the termination of the
                    Appellant’s employment and part of a settlement agreement negotiated
                    between the parties. Moreover, the Appellant did not dispute that this payment
                    of four months’ salary was in respect of the amount he would have
                    collected for the period for which he would, pursuant to an alleged agreement
                    with the Company, stay on with the Company after tendering his resignation,
                        <em>ie</em>, the period from 24 August 2012 (the
                    date of his resignation) to 31 December 2012 (the date on which it was
                    agreed the Appellant would leave the Company). He could not subsequently assert
                    that the Company remained liable for two months’ salary in lieu of notice
                    based on the notice period stated in his contract of employment; that loss has
                    already been more than compensated for by the Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     For all these reasons, we dismissed the
                    appeal. As for costs, we awarded costs to the Company fixed at $20,000 inclusive
                    of all disbursements. The usual consequential orders will apply. We also
                    clarified during the hearing that the amount of costs that we awarded was
                    inclusive of the Company’s costs in Summons No 5520 of 2013, which we
                    ordered on 26 November 2013 to be the Company’s costs in the cause
                    for this appeal.</p>
