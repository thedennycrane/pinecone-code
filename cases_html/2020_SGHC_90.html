The applicant, Mr Ahmad Kasim bin Adam (“Mr Ahmad”) brought OS 881 on behalf of the estate of his father, Mr Adam bin Haji Anwar (“Mr Adam”).

The declaration was published in the Government Gazette Extraordinary on 27 November 1987 (“the 1987 Gazette”).

They did not wish to challenge the government’s right to the premises, nor did they send the MP Letter “as a legal case to stake a claim on the right of the land”. That said, they were upset at not being given any notice of the Acquisition all these years. They also “concede[d]” that they were not in a capacity to challenge the vacation order and will eventually leave the House and let “the bulldozer to run it down”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) However, Mr Ahmad and his family asked for some gratuity payment or another house, for the effort they had put in all those decades in maintaining the Land at their own expense.

The CA did not find it necessary to resolve that issue because even if Mr Ahmad were to succeed in proving a breach of natural justice, he had no remedy before the court. In gist, the CA stated as follows.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There was no legal basis to award monetary compensation to Mr Adam’s estate as it was not prayed for in OS 397. Moreover, the LAA 1987 does not give the court jurisdiction to issue compensation at first instance. It is the Collector who makes an award after an inquiry, which is appealable to the Appeals Board and thereafter to the CA on a question of law.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Compensation was not a suitable form of relief for a lack of notice or breach of natural justice in the making of the 1988 Award.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The 1988 Award cannot be set aside by declaratory relief and an order for a fresh hearing by the Collector, as s 53 of the LAA 1987 imposes an absolute bar for declarations to set aside the Collector’s award.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Any compensation which Mr Adam may be entitled to would have been paid (if at all) as an award made by the Collector. The appropriate procedure for challenging the Collector’s exercise of his powers is by judicial review, and the appropriate remedy for the alleged breaches would be to quash the 1988 Award and mandate the Collector to conduct a fresh inquiry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Finally the CA opined on the principles for assessing compensation in that case. If a breach of natural justice was established, Mr Ahmad’s remedy was to be placed in a position as if Mr Adam’s estate had received an award of compensation in 1988, with the time value of the award being accounted for through an appropriate adjustment or award of interest.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Events after CA 4 of 2017</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Following the CA Judgment, AGC wrote to Mr Ahmad’s lawyers on 29 April 2019, highlighting that SLA had offered compensation of up to $53,029 on an “open” basis, and although Mr Ahmad had claimed sums of $4.33m to $11.015m, SLA’s offer remained opened for acceptance.

</div> No notice was provided to Mr Adam or Mr Ahmad, although the government knew and treated Mr Adam as the owner of the House and the Plot, and any reasonable attempt to mark out and measure the Land (which is required by s 7 of the LAA 1987) and which ought to include a physical inspection of the Land would have revealed the existence of the House. Mr Adam and Mr Ahmad had suffered great prejudice as the Collector had failed to give them notice and they were not able to appear before the Collector to make submissions on the basis for assessment of compensation for the Acquisition or to make any claim on the 1988 Award. This resulted in a loss of opportunity to find and purchase a suitable replacement residence. Whatever amounts that SLA had offered to them even by AGC’s letter of 29 April 2019 (see [28] above) would be insufficient for Mr Ahmad to buy a replacement residential property today.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Third, the Collector failed to take into account the following considerations in arriving at the quantum of the 1988 Award, namely, the existence of the House at the point of the Acquisition and the consequence of the Acquisition in that Mr Adam and his family would be compelled to change residence and incur reasonable expenses for that change.

</div>
</div> Regardless of whether the Time Limit started to run from November 1987 (the 1987 Gazette date) or 12 September 1988, the fact remained that Mr Ahmad was clearly out of time by more than 30 years. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The issue then is whether the delay is “accounted for to the satisfaction of the Judge to whom the application for leave is made”. In this regard, the onus is on the applicant, Mr Ahmad, to <span class="font-italic">account for the delay</span> (<span class="font-italic">Teng Fuh</span><span class="font-italic"> Holdings</span> at [18]) and to persuade the court that he has a satisfactory <span class="font-italic">explanation</span><span class="font-italic"> or reason</span> for the delay (<span class="font-italic">Pe</span><span class="font-italic">r Ah Seng</span> at [51] and [54]). It was incumbent on Mr Ahmad to set out these reasons in the statement in support of the Leave Application pursuant to O 53 r 1(2) (“the O 53 Statement”), or at least, in his affidavits filed in support of the Leave Application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I find that Mr Ahmad had failed to account for or explain the delay, let alone to my satisfaction. Even if Mr Ahmad claimed to have known about the Acquisition only around March 2009 (as it is not disputed that no notice to acquire the Land was served personally on Mr Adam or him), he had not explained why he took <span class="font-italic">ten</span><span class="font-italic"> years</span> (from March 2009) before filing OS 881. Even if I were to accept that, by filing OS 397 to set aside the 1988 Award, he is considered to have taken steps in this regard – this was not even a reason that he has given to explain the delay (of <span class="font-italic">six years</span> from March 2009 to April 2015 when he filed OS 397). Indeed, regardless of whether the delay was some 30 years, ten years or six years, Mr Ahmad <span class="font-italic">did not give</span><span class="font-italic"> any reason or explanation whatsoever</span>, as to why he did not file the Leave Application earlier.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Whilst Mr Ahmad had filed the O 53 Statement and two affidavits in support, he did not identify or explain the grounds or facts he was relying on to account or explain the delay in filing the Leave Application and to ask for an extension of time. Indeed, after Mr Ahmad filed the first supporting affidavit on 10 July 2019, AGC wrote to his lawyers on 16 July 2019 to ask if he would be amending the O 53 Statement or filing further affidavits to state the grounds and facts he was relying on for an extension of time. When AGC did not receive a response, it wrote to Mr Ahmad’s lawyers again on 25 July 2019 with the same request. AGC also informed Mr Ahmad that it was an abuse of process for him to pray for an extension of time in the Leave Application whilst refusing to state the supporting grounds and facts, and stated that at the next pre-trial conference (“PTC”) on 29 July 2019, it would submit that OS 881 was defective and amounted to an abuse of process of the court.

</div> However, that was not a case which pertained to an application for leave under O 53 r 1 of the ROC which expressly provides that the delay must be accounted for to the Judge’s satisfaction.

Even if the court is minded to infer reasons from the chronology of events as set out in Mr Ahmad’s O 53 Statement and affidavits, there are too many ambiguities to make a reasonable inference. For instance, was Mr Ahmad asserting that he was all throughout genuinely attempting to resolve the matter with SLA, and if so, what was the evidence to back up his assertion? Was he claiming that he had been advised by his lawyers to attempt a certain course of action before taking out the Leave Application and that he had followed his lawyers’ advice? Was it that he had no means to take out the Leave Application sooner? Was it that SLA and/or AGC had given him the impression that he should hold his hands on the matter whilst they considered (or reconsidered) his compensation claim? Or was Mr Ahmad saying that, by commencing OS 397 in 2015, he thought he had complied with the proper procedure for the Leave Application? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 It was not apparent from the mere laying out of the chronology of events, how the delay occasioned by filing the Leave Application only in 2019 had been satisfactorily accounted for.

SLA reiterated on numerous occasions thereafter that Mr Ahmad or Mr Adam was not entitled to remain on the Land and even offered a TOL as early as 2013 (see [16] above). In <span class="font-italic">Pe</span><span class="font-italic">r Ah Seng </span>([39] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the CA held that the appellants had satisfactorily accounted for the delay. The appellants there were engaged in a long-drawn process with HDB to persuade HDB to reconsider its decision to compulsorily acquire the flat in question, and HDB was also clarifying and eliciting more information from the appellants, which demonstrated that it was willing to reconsider its decision (see [56]–[58]). On the contrary, in the present case SLA had made its stand clear on the Acquisition, and Mr Ahmad himself stated that he would not challenge the Acquisition (see further [53] below). There was no evidence that SLA or anyone had ever suggested to or informed Mr Ahmad or Mr Adam that it was prepared to reconsider or reverse the Acquisition. SLA had also made it clear that its offers with respect to the <span class="font-italic">ex gratia</span> payment and TOL were always on a without prejudice basis. When Mr Ahmad’s lawyers informed SLA in July 2014 that there was a breach of natural justice, SLA made clear the government’s position that there was no such breach (see [19] above). Even when the TOLs were granted to Mr Ahmad from 2014 to 2016, SLA made clear that it was on the basis that he accepted the Land (including the House) was State Land owned by the government. The upshot is that Mr Ahmad knew of SLA’s consistent stand on the Land all throughout and as early as July 2012.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Indeed, Mr Ahmad had, after discovering the Acquisition, on various occasions stated that <span class="font-italic">he would not challenge the Acquisition</span>. In the MP Letter of 2010, he stated that he was not challenging the government’s right to the Land and would eventually leave the House. In his affidavits filed in 2015 for OS 397, Mr Ahmad “made it clear” that he was “not challenging the government’s right to the acquisition already made even without [his] prior knowledge at all”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Mr Ahmad claimed that the 1987 Gazette was issued in bad faith and amounted to the use of power for an improper purpose. This is because the Land was acquired for “general development”, but no such development took place until at least 2016. I find that Mr Ahmad had not met the threshold standard on the evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In <span class="font-italic">Teng Fuh Holdings</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([38] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), the appellant’s land was acquired in 1983 for “general redevelopment” but was not redeveloped for the following 22 years. The court found (at [36]–[40]) that no explanation was offered by the HDB, who could have explained the specific purpose the land was intended for at the time of the acquisition and whether there were any subsequent changes to its plan. Consequently, the court held (at [42]) that had the application not been made out of time, leave would likely have been granted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In the present case, Ms Tan had explained that in August 1973, the Muslim cemetery on the Land was closed for further burials, and this was notified by an order published in a Subsidiary Legislation Supplement. Thus, the Land could neither be used for further burials nor developed for other uses as it was then zoned for cemetery use only. Ms Tan explained that in November 1987, the Land was compulsorily acquired pursuant to the government’s policy to acquire private cemeteries for development in order to optimise land use in Singapore, and exhibited a <span class="font-italic">Straits Times</span> report dated 4 October 1987 published by the Prime Minister’s Office (“PMO”) in support. In that report, PMO also explained that “clans, associations and religious institutions that own the cemeteries would find it extremely difficult, on their own, to exhume the graves and provide alternative facilities for burial or cremation” and that “huge development charges have to be paid before development can proceed as the lands are mostly zoned for cemetery use only”. A similar report was also published in <span class="font-italic">Berita Minggu</span> (a Malay language newspaper) on 4 October 1987.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Ms Tan further explained that at the time of the Acquisition, the Land was suitable for private low-density housing, but development on the Land could not take place immediately for various reasons. With cemetery land, time is needed to find new burial sites and to plan for exhumation and re-development. These are sensitive issues that had to be carefully considered and managed. Then, in January 1994, the Ministry of Environment introduced a requirement for new residential properties to have at least a 50-metre nuisance buffer setback from industrial sites as part of its Code of Practice on Pollution Control. As the Land was located near industrial sites, it was affected by this new requirement which made it very difficult to develop the Land for residential use. In the Master Plan 1998, the Land was re-zoned to “Reserve Site” as the use of the Land was under study. In the Master Plan 2003, part of the Land was re-zoned from “Reserve Site” to “Park” to serve the residents in the area. After the exhumation of the graves were completed in 2009, the park was developed and completed in 2010 – this was also evidenced by various photographs showing the park. The remaining part of the Land zoned “Reserve Site” was re-zoned to “Residential” in the Master Plan 2014 to reflect the new land use intention, and options were being considered to amalgamate it with nearby industrial sites when the industrial uses on those sites were phased out.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The court in <span class="font-italic">Teng Fuh Holdings</span> ([38] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) (at [39]) stated that in deciding whether the burden of proving bad faith was discharged, mere suspicion was not enough, and the court must consider all the evidence before it, including any explanation from the respondent. Considering the evidence and explanation by Ms Tan, I am not satisfied that there was bad faith on the government’s part in the Acquisition or that the power to compulsorily acquire the Land was used for an improper purpose. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 SLA has explained why it could not develop the Land much earlier, and supported this with contemporaneous materials. Given that the Land was originally cemetery land and there clearly were sensitivities involved, the government would have considered the matter carefully before proceeding to compulsorily acquire the Land for development purposes. That there were sensitivities that had to be carefully managed was evidenced by the <span class="font-italic">Straits Times</span> and <span class="font-italic">Berita </span><span class="font-italic">Minggu</span> reports at the material time. SLA had given a credible explanation as to why it took some time for the graves to be completely exhumed, given that new burial sites had to be located. It is also not disputed that the Ministry of Environment introduced a new requirement for a buffer setback for new residential developments, which thus made it more difficult to develop the Land at the material time. In any event, it was not as if the Land was left completely undeveloped thereafter. Some 2,500 sqm (or about ¼ of the total area) of the Land, then re-zoned “Park”, was developed into a park shortly after the exhumation of the graves was completed. All this while, SLA or the government would not have known of Mr Ahmad’s complaints regarding Mr Adam’s occupation of the Land, given that he first wrote the MP Letter in February 2010, and <span class="font-italic">did not challenge the Acquisition</span>. Therefore, it could not be suggested that SLA deliberately took their time, or took steps in the development of the Land to “cover up” any alleged impropriety in relation to the Acquisition.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The provisions of the LAA 1987 and notice requirement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Next, Mr Ahmad claimed that the Acquisition was <span class="font-italic">ultra vires</span> s 8 of the LAA 1987 and conducted in bad faith or without proper care. The Acquisition was also procedurally improper. Mr Ahmad asserted that no notice was provided to Mr Adam or himself although the government knew and treated Mr Adam as the owner of the House and Plot, and if a reasonable attempt to mark out the Land (pursuant to s 7 of the LAA 1987) had been done, it would have revealed the existence of the House. Mr Ahmad also claimed that he had suffered great prejudice as a result of the Collector’s failure to provide notice (see [32] above) and that such failure was a breach of natural justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 There are two specific rules which encapsulate the rules of natural justice: (a) the rule against bias; and (b) the fair hearing rule (see <span class="font-italic">Yong Vui Kong v Attorney-General</span> [2011] 2 SLR 1189 at [88]. Mr Ahmad’s contention refers to the latter, <span class="font-italic">ie,</span> that he and Mr Adam did not have the opportunity to appear at the Collector’s inquiry to make submissions on their entitlement to compensation.

</div> That being the case (and there being no evidence on the contrary), I find that there was no duty on the Collector to cause the Land to be marked out and another plan made of it under s 7 of the LAA 1987. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The manner in which s 7 of the LAA 1987 is worded supports the interpretation that the Collector’s duty to mark the land <span class="font-italic">and</span> to make a plan of it is engaged only “if no plan exists”.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The reference to s 3 (in s 7 of the LAA 1987) clarified that the land need not be marked and measured again if this had been done under s 3. Nevertheless, the Collector’s duty under s 7 to make a plan was contingent on whether a plan already exists. Although Mr Koh submitted that it behoves the Collector to ensure that the cadastral plan, which was undated, was accurate and up to date,

</div> s 7 did not prescribe nor limit when the plan for a land (the subject of an intended acquisition) should have been made. Hence, in my view, there is no need for the Collector to mark the said land again under s 7 of the LAA 1987 if a plan of the land had existed even before the land was to be compulsorily acquired, the land remained the same land, and the land use remained unchanged from what was stated in the plan. Here, there was already a cadastral plan of the Land which showed the Land to be cemetery land. There was also no change in the land boundaries and its use at the time of the intended Acquisition from the cadastral plan.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) It should be noted that whilst s 7 referred to s 3 of the LAA 1987, s 3 merely conferred powers on the Controller or authorised officers to do certain things in relation to a land which is likely to be compulsorily acquired. Section 3 did not impose a duty on the Controller to mark the boundaries of a land. The title of the said section and the nature of the acts that may be done under it (<span class="font-italic">eg, </span>digging the soil and cutting down crops) made it clear that s 3 conferred powers rather than imposed duties.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) I am cognisant that the CA Judgment (at [75]) had stated that the Collector had a duty under s 7 of the LAA 1987 to mark out and measure the land to be acquired. However, there was no evidence that the CA then had the benefit of arguments on the interpretation of s 7 of the LAA 1987 and had been aware that a cadastral plan had been prepared in relation to the Land prior to the Acquisition.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Even if the Collector had a duty to mark out the Land under s 7 of the LAA 1987 and to include the House in its marking (as “land” is defined in s 2 to include things attached to the earth or permanently fastened to anything attached to the earth), there was no evidence that he had acted in bad faith in failing to prepare another plan under s 7. The cadastral plan showed the Land to be cemetery land and there had been no change in the land use at the time of the intended Acquisition. The purpose of preparing a plan under s 7 of the LAA 1987, where no plan existed, was to enable the posting of the notice under s 8(1) and the service of notices under s 8(2). The question as to whether Mr Adam was a person known or believed to be interested in the Land under s 8 of the LAA 1987 and whether the requirements in ss 8(1) and 8(2) had been complied with, will be dealt with next. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Section 8(1) LAA 1987 notice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I deal first with s 8(1) of the LAA 1987, which required the Collector to cause the requisite notice to be posted “at convenient places on or near the land” to be acquired. I find that the Collector had fulfilled this requirement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The 22 January 1988 Notice was posted on the Land by Mr Halim, though it is unknown precisely where on the Land it was posted (see [4] above). That the notice was posted on the Land is supported by a copy of the same on which there is a stamp bearing Mr Halim’s name as the one who posted the notice and on which was written “Posted on site”. The Collector had also in 1988 itself attested on affidavit in OS 600 of 1988 (see [5] above) that the Notice was posted on the Land. Mr Koh submitted that there was no evidence that the 22 January 1988 Notice was actually posted on the Land since there was no affidavit evidence from Mr Halim. Mr Ahmad also attested that he did not believe the Notice was posted on the Land because he and his family were residing at the House at the material time and were unaware of the existence of the Notice, and that they “continued to reside in the House undisturbed and oblivious to the Government’s purported acquisition of the Land”.

This would not necessarily have been the case. It must be remembered that at that time, Mr Adam did not have legal title to the Plot and also had not made a claim for adverse possession. Moreover, as Ms Tan attested, the statutory compensation for cemetery land then was rather low, assessed at about $0.15 per square foot, which would have amounted to $655 for the Plot.

He also marked out in his affidavit, the location of the Structure on the plan showing Palm Drive and the Land, which Ms Tan confirmed corresponded to the location of the House on the Land (see [7]–[8] above).

I find that Mr Adam was a person interested in the Land, even if he was not determined to be the owner of the House or Plot, at the material time. The CA in the CA Judgment (at [47]) had found that Mr Adam occupied the House from as early as 1955 until 1997 when he passed away.

Mr Adam never registered any interest in the Land. He could have done so, but chose not to. Mr Adam also did not at the material time make a claim of adverse possession on any part of the Land. The CA in the CA Judgment (at [75]) found that Mr Adam took no steps to perfect his title and that was “the most likely explanation why the Collector did not know or believe that he was a person interested in part of the Land and why no notice of the [A]cquisition was addressed to Mr Adam personally.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Next, the payment of property tax did not necessarily make the paying party (Mr Adam) the legal or beneficial owner of the property, as the definition of “owner” under s 2 of the Property Tax Act includes persons who may not be the legal or beneficial owner of the property (<span class="font-italic">Re Lot 114-69 Mukin XXII, Singapore </span>[2003] 1 SLR(R) 773 at [80]; <span class="font-italic">Alge</span><span class="font-italic">mene Bank Nederland NV v Tan Chin Tiong and another</span> [1985–1986] SLR(R) 1154 at [22]).

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The Collector was neither involved in this process nor in the collection of property tax, utility bills, or the installation of the sanitary and drainage system for the House and there was no evidence that the Collector knew that these payments were made. Whilst some other body/department of the government may have known of Mr Adam’s existence on the Land, this did not mean that the Collector would also possess such knowledge and thus have known that Mr Adam was a person interested in the Land. In my view, the Collector was entitled to rely on the Registry, which traced the title of the Land to the paper owners.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Even though the Collector did not know or believe Mr Adam to be interested in the Land, I consider whether he had a duty to serve the notice of intended acquisition on Mr Adam on the basis that he was nevertheless an occupier of the Land. In my view, the answer is no. The LAA 1987 did not impose this obligation – s 8(2) applied only to a person whom the Collector knows or believes to be interested in the land. This is to be contrasted with the predecessor legislation, namely s 8(3) of the Singapore Land Acquisition Ordinance (Cap 248, 1955 Rev Ed) (“SLAO”), which states that the Collector must serve notice “on the occupier, if any, of such land and on all such persons known or believed to be interested therein”. In interpreting s 9(3) of the Indian Land Acquisition Act (which is in <span class="font-italic">pari materia</span> with s 8(3) of the SLAO), the Bombay High Court in <span class="font-italic">Laxmanrao Kristrao Jahagirdar v The Provincial Government of Bombay </span>(1950) 52 BomLR 316 stated thus:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[T]he Legislature has made a clear distinction between occupiers of the land and persons who are interested in the land. As far as occupiers are concerned, the Collector must serve a notice upon the occupier. As far as persons interested are concerned, the obligation is cast upon him only if he knows of such persons or believes that there are such persons. With regard to the first class the obligation is absolute; with regard to the second class the obligation is not absolute but is relative and it only arises provided the Collector has knowledge or belief with regard to the existence of the second class of persons. Therefore it is clear that a person who has not been served with a notice under Section 9(3) and who is interested in the land to be acquired can only have a grievance provided he satisfies the Court that the Collector wilfully or fraudulently or perversely omitted to serve the notice contemplated by Section 9(3).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 When the Singapore Land Acquisition Act 1966 (“LAA 1966”) was passed, the requirement to serve specific notice “on the occupier, if any, of such land” was removed. Hence, from that point, there was no longer a requirement to serve a notice on a person who was an “occupier” of a land (unless he is a person whom the Collector knows or believes to be interested in the land). As the Collector did not know or have reason to believe that Mr Adam was a person interested in the Land at the material time, there was no requirement for him to serve Mr Adam with the requisite notice even though Mr Adam may have been an occupier of the House on the Land. Also, there was no evidence that the Collector, in omitting to serve the notice, had done so wilfully or fraudulently, or had acted in bad faith.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I should add that Mr Koh sought to argue that in 1964 when the Land Acquisition (Amendment No. 2) Ordinance Bill (Bill 28/1964) (“Bill 28/1964”) was introduced to remove the requirement to serve notice on an “occupier” of the land under s 8, the Explanatory Statement stated that whilst s 8 would be repealed and re-enacted, “there will not be any change in the effect of [this provision]” (“the Relevant Phrase”). Mr Koh argued that this meant that an occupier of the land (such as Mr Adam) would nevertheless have to be served a notice of acquisition consistent with the purport in the SLAO. However, Mr Koh admitted that Bill 28/1964 was allowed to lapse after the respondent’s counsel, Mr Khoo, pointed it out.

</div> It was eventually replaced with the Land Acquisition Bill (Bill 19/1966) (“Bill 19/1966”) that was then passed as the LAA 1966 (see [80]<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>above). Notably in Bill 19/1966, the Relevant Phrase was not included in the Explanatory Statement. Hence, Mr Koh’s argument fails. If at all, the omission of the Relevant Phrase from the Explanatory Statement of Bill 19/1966 (which led to the LAA 1966) would suggest otherwise – that Parliament had intended to change the position in the SLAO to no longer require a notice of acquisition to be served on a person who is an “occupier”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Remedies prayed for</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In short, I am not satisfied that the material before me disclosed an arguable or <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of reasonable suspicion in favour of granting the remedies sought. There was no evidence that the 1987 Gazette was issued in bad faith or amounted to the use of power for an improper purpose. There was no duty on the Collector to mark out the Land and have another plan made of it under s 7 of the LAA 1987. The Collector had also fulfilled s 8(1) of the LAA 1987 and did not have to serve a notice on Mr Adam under s 8(2) as the Collector did not know or have reason to believe that Mr Adam was an interested person at the material time. Neither was there evidence that the Collector had acted in bad faith in omitting to serve Mr Adam a s 8(2) notice. In any event, Mr Ahmad had failed to account for the delay in the Leave Application, and hence failed to cross the threshold requirement under O 53 r 1(6) of the ROC. However, for completeness, I will go on to deal with the remedies prayed for by Mr Ahmad, essentially: (a) to quash the Acquisition; and (b) to quash the 1988 Award and to mandate the Collector to conduct a fresh inquiry into the appropriate compensation to be paid to Mr Ahmad.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Quashing of the Acquisition</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In any event, I would not have granted an order to quash the Acquisition. Mr Khoo submitted that the purpose of a notice of acquisition under s 8 of the LAA 1987 is to invite claims for compensation to be made to the Collector, and not to invite objections to the compulsory acquisition. In support, Mr Khoo cited Lord Wilberforce’s <span class="font-italic">dictum</span> in <span class="font-italic">Robinson &amp; Co Ltd v Collector of Land Revenue </span>[1979–1980] SLR(R) 483 at [11] (which was accepted by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Lim Kim Som v Sheriffa Taibah bte Abdul Rahman </span>[1994] 1 SLR(R) 233 at [44]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Once the machinery for acquisition has started to operate, which it has under s 5, then, subject to the power to withdraw, the owner of the land, who, it is important to observe, has no right to object to the acquisition, has an interest only in compensation … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Even if Mr Khoo is correct as to the purpose of s 8 of the LAA 1987, this did not mean that the Collector’s actions (or omissions) are not susceptible to review or that an acquisition of land can never be considered as invalid (see <span class="font-italic">Teng Fuh Holdings</span> ([38] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [29]). In the present case, the Acquisition was for the stated purpose of redeveloping the Land (see [60]–[61] above). Quashing the Acquisition pertaining to the Plot alone would not be an appropriate remedy, considering the very long time lapse from the Acquisition to the Leave Application which resulted in developments to the Land. Further, Mr Ahmad’s main gripe was not that the government had no right to acquire the Land (and he had consistently maintained even at CA 4/2017 that he would not challenge the Acquisition), but rather, that the compensation afforded to him was inadequate (see [32] and [53] above). If a quashing order is made in relation to the Plot and the Plot is returned to Mr Adam’s estate, his estate would also obtain an unjustifiable windfall, as the value of the Plot would have appreciated considerably since the Acquisition. The government had exhumed the Land and incurred expenses on the exhumation and re-burial, and on development of the surrounding areas. The Land (other than the part re-zoned as “Park”) had also been re-zoned as “Residential” and hence increased in value (see [61] above). Such windfall should not accrue to Mr Adam’s estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In that regard, at the Second Reading of Bill 19/1966 (on 22 June 1966), Mr E W Barker (“Mr Barker”) (then Minister for Law and National Development) stressed that the principle underlining the compensation provision is that “Firstly, no landowner should benefit from development which has taken place at public expense and, secondly, that the price paid on acquisition of land of public purposes should not be higher than what the land would have been worth had the Government not carried out development generally in that area”. As the High Court stated in <span class="font-italic">Teng Fuh Holdings Pte Ltd v Collector of Land Revenue </span>[2006] 3 SLR(R) 507 at [61], the prevention of economic windfalls is one of the key policies underlying the LAA 1987.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Quashing the 1988 Award and mandating the Collector to conduct a fresh inquiry</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Alternatively, Mr Ahmad sought to quash the 1988 Award and to mandate that the Collector conduct a fresh inquiry in respect of the appropriate compensation to be paid on the basis of the LAA 1987 and taking into consideration the government’s <span class="font-italic">ex gratia</span> Top-Up payment policy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In CA 4/2017, the CA opined (at [92]–[93]) that in assessing an appropriate award for Mr Ahmad, the starting point is s 33 of the LAA 1987 with the applicable statutory date of assessment as at 30 November 1973 for the market value and the time value of the award accounted for through an appropriate adjustment or award of interest. The CA also opined (at [94]) that the existing use of the Land was “cemetery” use for the purposes of s 33(5)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the LAA 1987. It should also be noted that s 33(5)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the LAA 1987 stipulated that where acquired land is used as a burial ground, “no account shall be taken of any potential value of the land for any other more intensive use”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 On 15 August 2019, AGC wrote to Mr Ahmad to state that SLA and the government confirmed that: (a) the 1988 Award would apply only to the paper owners of the Land and no part of it would be apportioned to Mr Adam’s estate; and (b) “a new Collector … will be appointed to inquire into [Mr Adam]’s estate’s claim for compensation in respect of the House… and to make a Supplementary Award in accordance with [the LAA 1987] and the [CA Judgment]”.

As a preliminary point, it is doubtful if the 1988 Award can be partially quashed in relation to the Plot alone (as per Mr Ahmad’s application), given that the Collector had at the material time made the 1988 Award as a whole for the Land. It is also unclear if the process under the LAA allows the Collector to make an additional assessment for a supplementary award for the same land for a different claimant. In <span class="font-italic">Novelty Dept Store Pte Ltd v Collector of Land Revenue </span>[2016] 2 SLR 766 at [43]–[44], the CA opined, in relation to the issuing of a supplementary award under the land acquisition regime, that whilst such practice was not expressly legislated for, there was no reason to doubt the legal status of such awards, and the regularity of such award would not be called into question so long as it did not prejudice the right of any person interested. In the same vein, I would add that the LAA does not prevent the Collector from making a supplementary award on the same land even if it is for a different claimant. If the matter went to the Collector for assessment, any award made by him to Mr Adam’s estate would not be called into question as there would be no prejudice suffered by any interested person. The respondents have confirmed that it would permit such an assessment to take place. Mr Khoo also submitted that Mr Ahmad could appeal to the Appeals Board constituted under the LAA, as Mr Adam would be a “person interested” under the LAA. The Appeals Board may grant an extension of time to proceed with the appeal for reasonable cause if there has been no unreasonable delay.

</div> If Mr Ahmad is not satisfied with the Collector’s award, the LAA provides for an avenue of appeal to the Land Appeals Board, and to the CA on a question of law. Mr Koh submitted that mandating the Collector to conduct a fresh inquiry would result in immense time and costs savings, as parties would otherwise have to go through a Collector’s assessment, a potential appeal to the Appeals Board, and then to the CA and/or commence judicial review.

</div> However, it is unclear how the process proposed by Mr Koh would differ from the process offered by the respondents to Mr Ahmad. Furthermore, the court does not mandate to any public body “how and in what manner they are to perform their duty” (<span class="font-italic">Borissik </span>at [21]). The court cannot, at this stage, direct how the Collector is to perform the assessment, although no doubt the Collector would be cognisant of the CA Judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Likewise an application for an order to mandate the Collector to calculate the compensation to include an <span class="font-italic">ex gratia</span> Top-Up (in addition to any compensation to be assessed on the Plot) is misconceived. Even if the court were to grant an order to quash the 1988 Award pertaining to the Plot and order the Collector to conduct a fresh inquiry on the appropriate compensation, the court should not interfere with the Collector’s manner of assessing the quantum of compensation nor dictate the factors that he is to take into account. Mr Koh accepted this and agreed that whilst the amount of compensation on land compulsorily acquired is to be determined by the Collector, any determination of an <span class="font-italic">ex gratia</span> Top-Up is to be determined by the government and is not within the Collector’s purview.

</div> Indeed, s 33 of the LAA 1987 (and the present LAA) stipulates the matters that the Collector is to consider when assessing the amount of compensation “and no others” – this has been held to mean that all relevant heads of compensation under s 33 are exhaustively codified (<span class="font-italic">Ng Boo Tan v Collector of Land Revenue</span> [2002] 2 SLR(R) 633 at [54]–[55], reiterated in the CA Judgment at [93]). Further, there is no legal entitlement to an <span class="font-italic">ex gratia</span> payment and the court does not usurp the administrative function of determining an individual’s substantive entitlement to such compensation (<span class="font-italic">Seah Hong Say (trading as Seah Heng Construction Co) v Housing and Development Board </span>[1992] 3 SLR(R) 497 (“<span class="font-italic">Seah Hong Say</span>”) at [7]–[8]). Hence, that function of determining any <span class="font-italic">ex gratia</span> Top-Up should <span class="font-italic">first</span> be left to the relevant body; although “the potential recipient of such payment might have a right to expect that the decision as to his award should be properly made, and may enforce that right by the process of judicial review” (<span class="font-italic">Seah Hong Say</span> at [7]). As such, it would be inappropriate for this court to exercise any supervisory powers over a decision-making process (pertaining to the <span class="font-italic">ex gratia</span> Top-Up) which has <span class="font-italic">not</span> taken place.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Mr Koh referred to statements made by Mr Barker in a Budget Statement on 17 March 1983 and in the Second Reading of the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill 1987 (Bill 25 of 1987) on 12 January 1988 to support his argument that the Collector should take into account the <span class="font-italic">ex gratia</span> Top-Up payment policy in respect of land acquisition.

</div> In summary, Mr Barker made statements to the effect that where a person’s residential property was compulsorily acquired under the LAA 1987, the government decided to top up the compensation made under the Act, by an <span class="font-italic">ex gratia</span> payment, to enable the person to find a suitable alternative accommodation. Mr Ahmad’s reliance on Mr Barker’s statements is misplaced, as they were made in the context of the government’s compulsory acquisition of <span class="font-italic">r</span><span class="font-italic">esidential</span> land, and not cemetery land which was what the Land and Plot were zoned for and used as at the time of the Acquisition.
