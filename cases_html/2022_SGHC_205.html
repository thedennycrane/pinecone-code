</div> Writers Studio eventually ceded to Mr Chin’s multiple requests to contact his students privately on 13 November 2019, on the condition that Ms Oh was to be included in group chats. It was in that context that he had agreed to transfer his 4599 Number to Writers Studio for it to be used as a company number. In that way, Mr Chin could protect his own personal interests (by mitigating the risk of being backstabbed or having words put in his mouth) and Writers Studio could include that company number on their brochures promoting Innova Studio and/or Writers Studio.

Ms Oh instructed the typist not to send Mr Chin the materials that he had requested as the documents belonged to Writer’s Studio and was confidential information under the NDA.

</div> While this may have led to the disagreement as to whether Mr Chin had resigned or had his employment terminated by Writers Studio, as mentioned at [21], nothing turns on this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In summary, on 16 September 2020, Mr Chin had:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) informed his students that he had not been paid his remuneration;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) encouraged his students to inform their parents that Writers Studio had not paid him his remuneration;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) ended his 3.00pm class early;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) cancelled his 5.00pm and 7.00pm classes on short notice; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) declared to the students that he was resigning.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In this judgment, I refer to these acts as his “Conduct”.

However, before I can proceed to determine the exact nature of this engagement, I note that Mr Chin has pleaded the presence of an <span class="font-italic">implied contract </span>between the parties. There are two points of concern arising from this. The first is that the fact that the contract is not put into writing does not automatically militate against the existence of an express contract. The second is that the pleadings confusingly flit between references to implied contracts and implied contractual duties and terms, which are distinct concepts. The former is concerned with making out the existence of a contractual relationship; the latter is concerned with making out the terms of an existing contract. In light of the looseness with which the descriptor “implied” has been used in Mr Chin’s pleadings, I think it appropriate to briefly allude to the legal principles governing the concept of an implied contract.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The applicable legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In the law of contract, contracts can be implied from a course of conduct; dealings between the parties; from their correspondence or from all other circumstances.

Ms Oh’s initial email constituted the terms of engagement offered by Writers Studio, while Mr Chin’s reply constituted an acceptance to some of those terms (by expressly indicating “agree”) and a counteroffer to others (by proposing slightly different terms). Even though no reply to Mr Chin’s counteroffers were immediately forthcoming, I take that Ms Oh accepted Mr Chin’s counteroffers for two reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 First, Ms Oh replied to that same email thread on 18 September 2020 that those<span class="font-italic"> </span>were the “contractual terms [they] agreed on by email”.

Even though Writers Studio appreciates that the “implied duties typically apply to employment contracts”, they are “necessary for the business efficacy of the contract for service” between parties. In particular, if Mr Chin was “allowed to flout” Writers Studio’s professional standards, it would suffer “damage, and the quality of the teaching services provided by [Mr Chin] would be poor and unacceptable”.

Such duties are implied terms in law in employment<span class="font-italic"> </span>contracts (<span class="font-italic">Man Financial (S) Pte Ltd (formerly known as E D &amp; F Man International (S) Pte Ltd v Wong Bark Chu</span><span class="font-italic">an David</span> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 663 (“<span class="font-italic">Man Financial</span>”) at [193]). As such, the applicable legal principles for an implied term <span class="font-italic">in fact </span>are relevant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and another and another appeal </span>[2013] 4 SLR 193 (“<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span>”) set out a three-step test for implying a term in fact (at [101]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Step 1. Ascertain how the gap in the contract arises. Implication will be considered only if the court discerns that the gap arose because the parties did not contemplate the gap (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, there is a “true” gap).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Step 2. Determine whether it is necessary in the business or commercial sense to imply a term in order to give the contract efficacy.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Step 3. Consider whether the specific term to be implied is one to which the parties, having regard to the need for business efficacy, would have responded “Oh, of course!” had the proposed term been put to them at time of the contract. If it is not possible to find such a clear response, then, the gap persists and the consequences of that gap ensue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In <span class="font-italic">Sem</span><span class="font-italic">bcorp</span>, the Court of Appeal explained that “not all gaps in a contract are “true” gaps in the sense that they can be remedied by the implication of a term” and in that respect, there are at least three ways in which a gap could arise (at [94]):</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) The parties did not contemplate the issue at all and so left a gap.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) The parties contemplated the issue but chose not to provide a term for it because they mistakenly thought that the express terms of the contract had adequately addressed it.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) The parties contemplated the issue but chose not to provide any term for it because they could not agree on a solution.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">However, it is only<span class="font-italic"> </span>in scenario (a) where it would be “appropriate for the court to even consider if it will imply a term into the parties’ contract” (at [95]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Bearing the foregoing principles in mind, I turn to consider whether the alleged duties of fidelity, obedience and good faith may be implied in fact in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Analysis and findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I begin with two preliminary observations on Writers Studio’s pleaded case. From the outset, I find Writers Studio’s submissions to be somewhat disingenuous. In particular, Writers Studio gives the impression that it had pleaded<span class="font-italic"> </span>that a duty of “obedience” meant the duty to “comply” with <span class="font-italic">Writers Studio’s</span> <span class="font-italic">professional standards</span> <span class="font-italic">and client contact protocol</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see [73] above). That is a deviation from its pleaded case that a duty of “obedience” meant compliance with “the schedule of classes set out” and to teach such classes (see [39] above). This demonstrates to me that Writers Studio is not even clear of its own case and shifted the goal posts as part of its own litigation strategy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 My second observation is that Writers Studio <span class="font-italic">does not even plead the contract into which such alleged terms are to be implied in fact</span>. The three-step test summarised above assumes and <span class="font-italic">necessarily </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">hinges on </span><span class="font-italic">the existence of some subsisting contract between the parties </span>before the first step can even be considered. Without the proper identification of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">any </span><span class="font-italic">contract</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(such as an <span class="font-italic">oral </span>contract)<span class="font-italic"> </span>between the parties, the three-step test is simply inapplicable. In my judgment, this is fatal, and sufficient to dispose of Writers Studio’s claim for breach of such implied terms.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 For completeness, I consider whether the duties of obedience, fidelity and good faith are implied terms in the parties’ Agreement. In my judgment, this issue must be answered in the negative. Based on the parties’ contemporaneous correspondence, I accept that there is a “true” gap in relation to the alleged duties. Nevertheless, I am not persuaded by Writers Studio’s argument that the alleged duties to be implied pass the business efficacy test. Writers Studio’s argument that such duty must be implied to prevent Writers Studio from suffering damage and to ensure the “quality” of teaching services were acceptable to it is <span class="font-italic">not </span>the test to determine business efficacy. I am also of the view that the alleged duties to be implied flatly fail the officious bystander test. These alleged implied terms are not entirely clear. Consequently, I am of the view that had such <span class="font-italic">unclear </span>terms been put to parties at the time of contracting, the response would not have been an emphatic “Oh, of course!”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Even if such duties were implied in fact, the facts upon which Writers Studio seeks to substantiate its claim for breach of the same (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Conduct and Inappropriate Behaviour) are insufficient to make out its case. I elaborate on this at [115] below. As for the breach by failing to comply with Writers Studio’s client contact protocol, Writers Studio made its submissions in relation to the NDA, which I consider at Issue 4 below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: whether Mr Chin caused loss to Writers Studio by breaching a duty of care</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Apart from its claim in contract, Writers Studio also claims against Mr Chin in the tort of negligence. The specific acts complained of are Mr Chin’s alleged Conduct and Inappropriate Behaviour – which also found Writers Studio’s claim for punitive<span class="font-italic"> </span>damages against Mr Chin. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Where Singapore is concerned, the <span class="font-italic">locus classicus </span>remains the Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 100 (“<span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span>”). In the present case, applying the <span class="font-italic">Spandeck </span>framework, I was satisfied that there was legal proximity between the parties which justified the imposition of a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>duty of care. Further, there were no policy reasons which militated against the imposition of a duty of care. I explain. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span>, the Court of Appeal set out a two-stage test to determine whether a defendant owes a plaintiff a duty of care. The two-stage test is preceded by the threshold requirement of factual foreseeability which is concerned with the “requirement of reasonable foreseeability from a <span class="font-italic">factual</span> perspective” [emphasis in original] (<span class="font-italic">Spandeck </span>at [75]–[76] citing <span class="font-italic">Sunny Metal &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming Eric (practising under the name and style of W P Architects </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 853 at [55], <span class="font-italic">AYW v AYX </span>[2016] 1 SLR 1183 (“<span class="font-italic">AYW</span>”) at [51]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The threshold question of factual or reasonable foreseeability, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether the defendant ought to have known that the claimant would suffer from the defendant’s carelessness, is a requirement which would be fulfilled in almost all cases as the two parties are likely to be in some degree of physical relationship (<span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span> at [75]–[76]). In the present case, I was satisfied that this threshold requirement of factual foreseeability was crossed. I therefore move on to consider the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spandeck </span>framework. Here, the key question is whether there is sufficient legal<span class="font-italic"> </span>proximity between the plaintiff and the defendant. The focus of the inquiry at this stage is the <span class="font-italic">closeness </span>of the <span class="font-italic">relationship </span>between the parties which includes physical, circumstantial and causal proximity, supported by the twin criteria of voluntary assumption of responsibility and reliance (<span class="font-italic">Spandeck </span>at [77] and [81];<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Go Dante Yap v Bank Austria Creditanstalt AG </span>[2011] 4 SLR 559 (“<span class="font-italic">Go Dante Yap</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [19]–[20], <span class="font-italic">Animal</span><span class="font-italic"> Concerns Research &amp; Education Society v Tan Boon Kwee </span>[2011] 2 SLR 146 (“<span class="font-italic">Animal Concerns</span>”) at [29]–[74]),</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In the present case, Writers Studio submits that Mr Chin “should be found to owe a duty of care” to them since it had “entrusted” the “young and impressionable” students to Mr Chin

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Plaintiff’s Opening Statement at para 11. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I make one observation about the manner in which Writers Studio has presented this argument in its written submissions. While it is perfectly fine to state the elements of the <span class="font-italic">Spandeck </span>framework, more attention should be paid to the facts of the cases adduced in support of one’s argument that the court should find that a duty of care is owed in the present case. The <span class="font-italic">Spandeck </span>framework is not a magic spell, the mere invocation of which, without more, will automatically compel the court to find that a duty of care is owed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 That much is clear from <span class="font-italic">Spandeck </span>itself. In that case, the Government of Singapore (the “Government”) had awarded the appellant a contract to redevelop a medical facility at an army camp. Pursuant to the contract, the respondent was appointed as the superintending officer of the project and was responsible for certifying interim payments in respect of the appellant’s work done. While the contract precluded the appellant from claiming against the Government damages for the failure or delay of the respondent in certification, the contract did provide that the appellant had the right to claim the amounts which were under-certified and interest thereon by commencing arbitration proceedings against the Government. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Because of this, the appellant chose not to continue with the revision of the summary of tender and the cost breakdown for the contract, and subsequently novated the contract to another contractor, suffering losses in the process. The appellant claimed against the respondent, arguing that the respondent owed it a duty of care. The Court of Appeal was satisfied that no duty of care was owed because the requirement of legal proximity was not met (<span class="font-italic">Spandeck </span>at [108]). In arriving at this conclusion, the Court of Appeal took the view that the salient facts in <span class="font-italic">Pacific Associates Inc v Baxter </span>[1990] 1 QB 993 (“<span class="font-italic">Pacific Associates</span>”) were materially the same as the facts before it (<span class="font-italic">Spandeck </span>at [97] – [98]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[97] Adopting an incremental approach with respect to the requirement of proximity, we found the salient facts in <span class="font-italic">Pacific</span> <span class="font-italic">Associates</span> to be materially the same as those in the present case. The claimant in <span class="font-italic">Pacific Associates</span> was a contractor engaged in dredging work under the supervision of the defendant engineer who was retained by the employer. The claimant’s contract with the employer contained clauses providing that the engineer would not be personally liable for acts under the contract and providing for the arbitration of disputes between the contractor and the employer. The contractor claimed that the geological information in the tender document issued by the engineer had under-estimated the amount of hard materials to be dredged and that the engineer had acted negligently in rejecting the contractor’s claims for extra payment for removal of unforeseen hard materials. The contractor recovered some of its alleged losses from the employer following an arbitration settlement and then sought to recover the balance through a negligence action against the employer.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[98] The Court of Appeal held (at 1032) that it would not be reasonable to impose a <span class="font-italic">Hedley Byrne</span><span class="font-italic"> … </span>duty on the engineer because it “would cut across and be inconsistent with the structure of relationships created by the contracts, into which the parties had entered”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 To unpack this a little, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Spandeck </span>arrived at its decision in the following manner: in <span class="font-italic">Pacific Associates</span>, the court there made a finding that there was no legal proximity based on certain material facts. The same material facts were also present in <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span>, and so this justified a finding that there was no legal proximity and thus no <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>duty of care owed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Here, the facts are slightly different from that in <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span> – in that case, the appellant and respondent had no direct contractual relationship, whereas in the present case, Writers Studio had engaged Mr Chin as an independent contractor under an employment for service (above at [67]). The more appropriate decision for comparison, in my view, would be the decision in <span class="font-italic">Go Dante Yap</span>. In that case, the appellant had opened two accounts with the respondent bank. Both accounts were handled by one Ms Ching, who was employed by the respondent. In opening the accounts, the appellant executed three sets of contractual documents which, amongst other things, gave the appellant the final say in deciding what securities to purchase or sell. Ms Ching entered into 16 investments on the appellant’s behalf, and met the appellant on a monthly basis to review the performance of the investments and their projected returns. The investments were subsequently liquidated, but the appellant suffered significant losses on three of the investments as a result of the Asian Financial Crisis. The appellant sued the respondent, alleging, amongst other things, that the respondent owed him a duty of care to advise him on his investments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The Court of Appeal found, when it heard the appeal, that there was clearly legal proximity between the parties: <span class="font-italic">Go Dante Yap </span>at [31]. As the court reasoned (at [34]–[35]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[34] As we alluded at [20] above, the implied contractual duty of skill and care owed by the Respondent to the Appellant under the Account-opening Documents was sufficient to create the necessary proximity required by a duty of care in tort. Indeed, it was difficult to imagine a clearer example of “an assumption by one party of a responsibility to take care to avoid or prevent injury, loss or damage” to another party (see [31] above) than a contractual duty to exercise care and skill, and it was plain that Lord Goff had just such a possibility in mind in <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Merrett</span> (at 180 (see [33] above) and 187), a conclusion which was also reached by Lord Devlin with specific reference to banks and their customers in <span class="font-italic">Hedley Byrne</span> (see [32] above).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[35] However, even leaving aside the contractual framework established by the Account-opening Documents, by analogy with Lord Goff’s reasoning, there was unmistakeably an assumption of responsibility in the relevant sense by the Respondent towards the Appellant. The Respondent accepted the Appellant as someone whose money and assets were under its control, and on whose behalf it could and was expected to expend considerable sums in order to acquire various investments. It could hardly be denied that the Respondent, in offering private banking and wealth-management facilities, held itself out as possessing special skill or expertise (a concept that was to be understood broadly (see <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Merrett</span> at 180)) to manage investments and transact in emerging market securities, or to search for and recommend such investments (which Ms Ching in fact did (see [100] of the Judgment)). The Appellant, as Ms Ching well knew, placed implicit reliance upon that expertise, in that he gave her (and therefore the Respondent) authority to bind him to purchases of the Bakrie bonds and the Rossiyskiy notes, as well as other securities. Given that Ms Ching was so placed that the Appellant could reasonably rely upon her judgment, skill or her ability to make careful inquiry, and given also that she was actively giving information or advice to the Appellant (in the form of recommending suitable investments to him and, by her own evidence, advising him of the pros and cons of those investments), who, as she should have known, would place reliance on her judgment, skill and ability to take care (see Lord Morris’s statement of principle at [32] above), it was difficult to resist the conclusion that, in line with <span class="font-italic">Hedley Byrne</span> and <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Merrett</span>, there was sufficient proximity between the parties to give rise to a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> duty of care in the tort of negligence on the part of the Respondent. The point was reinforced in <span class="font-italic">Jackson &amp; Powell</span> ([24] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), where it was stated at para 15-032 (albeit without any authority being cited) that “[a] financial practitioner will <span class="font-italic">generally</span> owe a duty of care in tort to his client quite apart from any contract that exists between them” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 In my view, <span class="font-italic">Go Dante Yap</span> can be sufficiently analogised to the present case. In <span class="font-italic">Go Dante Yap</span>, the court ruled (at [24], citing <span class="font-italic">Lister v Romford Ice and Cold Storage Co Ltd </span>[1957] AC 555 (“<span class="font-italic">Lister</span>”) at 572–573) that “in contracts under which a skilled or professional person agrees to render certain services to his client in return for a specified or reasonable fee, there is at common law an implied term in law that he will exercise reasonable skill and care in rendering those services”. The court further noted that “it is trite law that a bank in carrying out the instructions of its customer is under an implied contractual duty to exercise skill and care”. This implied contractual duty to exercise skill and care therefore meant that, as the court reasoned (at [34]), there was an assumption of responsibility by the respondent to take care to avoid or prevent injury, loss or damage to the appellant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In the present case, I would take the view that there was an implied term in the contract that Mr Chin would exercise reasonable skill and care in rendering services to Writers Studio. In <span class="font-italic">Lister</span>, the court reasoned (at 572–573) that it was an implied term of the contract that the appellant would perform his duties with the proper care because: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The proposition of law stated by Willes J in <span class="font-italic">Harmer v Cornelius </span>has never been questioned: “When a skilled labourer,” he said, “artizan, or artist is employed, there is on his part an “implied warranty that he is of skill reasonably competent to “the task he undertakes, —<span class="font-italic">Spondes peritiam artis</span>. Thus, if an “apothecary, a watch-maker, or an attorney be employed for “reward, they each impliedly undertake to possess and exercise “reasonable skill in their several arts. … An express promise “or express representation in the particular case is not necessary.” <span class="font-italic">I see no ground for excluding from, and every ground for including in, this category a servant who is employed to drive a lorry which, driven without care, may become an engine of destruction and involve his master in very grave liability.</span> Nor can I see any valid reason for saying that a distinction is to be made between possessing skill and exercising it. No such distinction is made in the cited case: on the contrary, “possess” and “exercise” are there conjoined. <span class="font-italic">Of what advantage to the employer is his servant’s undertaking that he possesses skill unless he undertakes also to use it?</span> I have spoken of using skill rather than using care, for “skill” is the word used in the cited case, but this embraces care. For even in so-called unskilled operations an exercise of care is necessary to the proper performance of duty. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 It was therefore apparent to me, from the passage above, that the court in <span class="font-italic">Lister</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>had found that there was an implied contractual term of a skilled person to exercise reasonable skill and care in the context of an employer-employee relationship. Where employees are concerned, it is trite law that there is an implied term “in the employer’s favour that the employee will serve the employer with good faith and fidelity, and that he or she (the employee) will also use reasonable skill and care in the performance of his or her duties pursuant to the employment contract: <span class="font-italic">Man Financial </span>at [193]. In the present case, while I have found that Writers Studio had engaged Mr Chin <span class="font-italic">qua </span>independent contractor, I am of the view that such a term should also be implied in law where independent contractors are concerned. Terms implied by law reflect considerations of fairness and policy (<span class="font-italic">Chua Choon Cheng and ors v Allgreen Properties Ltd and </span><span class="font-italic">another appeal </span>[2009] 3 SLR(R) 724 at [68]). To hold that there is no such term of reasonable skill and care implied in law where the tutor is hired <span class="font-italic">qua </span>independent contractor would be to draw a fine and unsustainable distinction. In my view, where a tutor is hired by a tuition centre to teach young children, there must be an implied term of reasonable skill and care in the contract between the tutor and the tuition centre regardless of the nature of the tutor’s engagement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 I would also observe that the role in which Mr Chin was engaged by Writers Studio was akin to that of a professional providing services to a client such that a term of reasonable skill and care should be implied. While structured as a business arrangement (see [67] above), the reality was that Mr Chin was hired as a tutor who specialised in teaching English, Mathematics and Science, to teach classes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In any event, even if I was wrong, and there was no implied contractual term at law to exercise reasonable skill and care on the part of Mr Chin, I am of the view that he had voluntarily assumed responsibility on his part, and that Writers Studio had placed reliance on his expertise. In <span class="font-italic">Go Dante </span><span class="font-italic">Yap</span>, the respondent bank had held itself out as possessing special skill or expertise to manage investments and transact in emerging market securities, or to search for and recommend such investments. The respondent had, in accepting the appellant as someone whose money and assets were under its control and on whose behalf it could and was expected to expend considerable sums in order to acquire various investments, voluntarily assumed responsibility. Further, the appellant had placed implicit reliance upon that expertise by giving the respondent the authority to enter into investments on his behalf. It was on this basis which the Court of Appeal concluded that there was “sufficient proximity between the parties to give rise to a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>duty of care”: <span class="font-italic">Go Dante Yap </span>at [35]. The facts in that case allowed the Court of Appeal to find that there was both an implied contractual term to exercise reasonable skill and care, as well as legal proximity between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In the present case, I would similarly hold that Mr Chin had voluntarily assumed responsibility in the relevant sense by accepting the appointment from Writers Studio to teach its students. Similarly, Writers Studio had placed reliance on Mr Chin’s expertise – they had placed their students under his tutelage and let him run his classes as he saw fit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 For the reasons above, I therefore find that there was sufficient legal proximity to found a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>duty of care in the present case. I turn now to consider the second stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spandeck </span>test. Here, the court considers whether any policy considerations which are applicable to the factual matrix negate that <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>duty of care, and must be careful to differentiate “such considerations from the requirement of proximity in the first stage” of the Spandeck framework: <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span> at [83] and [85]. The rationale for this, as explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">See Toh Siew Kee v Ho Ah Lam Ferrocement (Pte) Ltd and others</span> [2013] 3 SLR 284 at [89]–[90], was that the <span class="font-italic">raison d’être</span> of the tort of negligence is to render interpersonal justice – cogent policy considerations must therefore be adduced to “displace the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>” position that interpersonal wrongs should be remedied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In essence, what this means is that while the law of tort deals with interpersonal wrongs, in certain situations, policy reasons may militate against the imposition of a duty of care, and that these interpersonal wrongs be dealt with by other means. For example, the availability of alternative statutory remedies and processes is a policy reason militating against the imposition of a duty of care (<span class="font-italic">The Law of Torts in Singapore </span>at [05.077]–[05.078]). The reason for this is that the plaintiff can seek relief for interpersonal wrongs through statutory remedies and processes. Another example of a policy reason militating against the imposition of a duty of care would be the existence of a contractual relationship. In <span class="font-italic">Spandeck </span>(at [111]–[113]), the court ruled that even if there was proximity between the parties, the policy reason weighing against imposing a duty of care was the existence of a contract which clearly defined the rights between parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 In the present case, while there was a contractual relationship between Writers Studio and Mr Chin, I did not think that this negated the imposition of the <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>duty of care. The situation here was quite different from that in <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span>. The court in that case took the view that “a duty of care should not be superimposed on a contractual framework” (<span class="font-italic">Spandeck </span>at [114]). The reason for this, however, was because the appellant had freely entered into the contract which provided that claims against the Government had to be brought in arbitration. The court therefore held that because parties sought to regulate their relationship via contract which stipulated that in the event of under-certification, that would be dealt with through arbitration, there should not be imposed on the respondent a duty which the appellant had chosen not to make a contractual one: <span class="font-italic">Spandeck </span>at [96], [101] and [114].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In the present case, while Mr Chin was engaged by Writers Studio pursuant to a contract, it is evident that parties had not clearly sought to define the boundaries of their contractual relationship. The contract was silent as to what was expected of Mr Chin when it came to the delivery of his lessons and his conduct as a tutor. For this reason, I find that the existence of a contractual relationship between the parties did not negate the imposition of a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>duty of care. Unlike <span class="font-italic">Spandeck</span>, where parties had clearly regulated and defined the boundaries of their contractual relationship to exclude the imposition of a tortious duty of care (see <span class="font-italic">Animal Concerns </span>at [71]), parties here had not done so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 I would further hold that there were also policy reasons leaning in favour of the imposition of a duty of care (<span class="font-italic">Animal Concerns </span>at [86]). It is important that tutors engaged to teach young children are not only held accountable to the students whom they teach, but also the tuition agencies who have hired them to conduct the classes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 For the reasons above, I find that Mr Chin owed Writers Studio a duty of care.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Breach of a Duty Owed</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 While I have found that Mr Chin owed a duty of care to Writers Studio, I do not find that Mr Chin had breached that duty of care owed. The standard of care is the objective standard of a reasonable person using ordinary care and skill. As stated in <span class="font-italic">Blyth v The Company of Proprietors of The Birmingham Waterworks</span> (1856) 11 Exch 781 at 784:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Negligence is the omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do; or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The reasonable person’s conduct, in turn, depends on certain factors which are relevant to the particular circumstances of the particular case such as the likelihood and risks of harm, the extent of harm, costs of avoiding harm, and the industry standards and common practice (<span class="font-italic">Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2668 v Rott George Hugo</span> [2013] 3 SLR 787 at [27].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The parties’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Writers Studio argued that Mr Chin breached such a duty of care by virtue of his Conduct on 16 September 2021 and by his Inappropriate Behaviour. This, in turn, caused them to suffer financial losses because students withdrew, and they were drawn into a criminal investigation arising out of Mr Chin’s Inappropriate Behaviour. As a consequence, Writers Studio’s reputation and standing as a tuition centre suffered.

I consider each of the alleged complaints in turn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In relation to Mr Chin’s alleged Inappropriate Behaviour (see [34] above), Writers Studio seeks to rely on what his former students were recorded to have said.

In my judgment, such evidence is a classic form of hearsay evidence which is inadmissible unless one of the limbs under s 32 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) can be invoked. For example, in <span class="font-italic">Gimpex Ltd v Unity Holdings Business Ltd and others and another appeal </span>[2015] 2 SLR 686 (‘<span class="font-italic">Gimpex</span>’), the Court of Appeal held (at [84]) that a report, the admissibility of which was disputed, was hearsay evidence. The defendants in that case sought to have the report admitted on the basis that one Nonot, who was allegedly the maker of the report, had testified at trial (<span class="font-italic">Gimpex </span>at [80]). The court, however, took the view that the report was hearsay evidence as it was factually unclear whether Nonot had signed the report. Moreover, even if Nonot was the maker of the report, he had not been personally involved in the entire process of sampling, testing and loading the coal. He hence could not testify as to whether the statements in the report about the quality of the coal were true as he had no first-hand knowledge of the facts (<span class="font-italic">Gimpex </span>at [83]–[84]). In a similar vein, Mr Ting here was, by his own admission, not the one who conducted the recording and did not know if any prior discussions had not been captured by the recording.

</div> The matter was resolved by Mr Chin’s Undertaking. However, Writers Studio now argues that Mr Chin had breached the Undertaking by his continued teaching of [B] (see [33] above). In that regard, if [B] is a “7th student outside of the scope of the [U]ndertaking”, then Mr Chin should have informed Senior Judge Andrew Ang.

As against Mr Chin’s position that he had requested for the header to be removed for formatting issues (and not the logo), Writers Studio submits that Mr Chin “did not clarify” that or “correct” Writers Studio when the issue was raised.

Writers Studio, however, has not drawn a distinction between either in their written submissions, despite having claimed damages for Mr Chin’s breach of the NDA and/or the duty of confidentiality. Given the differences between the breach of an NDA, and the breach of the duty of confidentiality, it is important that such a distinction be drawn. For one, an action for the breach of an NDA is rooted in contract – here, the terms of the NDA must be interpreted to determine whether there has been a breach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 The duty of confidentiality, however, is an equitable obligation. The traditional approach to an action for breach of confidence, laid down in <span class="font-italic">Coco v AN Clark (Engineers) Ltd </span>[1969] RPC 41 (“<span class="font-italic">Coco</span>”) (see also <span class="font-italic">X Pte Ltd v CDE </span>[1992] 2 SLR(R) 575) requires that the plaintiff establish the following elements:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) That the information in question has the necessary quality of confidence about it.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The information must have been imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) There must be an unauthorised use of the information, and in appropriate cases, this use must be to the detriment of the party who originally communicated it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 This obligation of confidence may arise by way of a contractual relationship – this usually occurs in cases such as the present one where there was a contract between the plaintiff and the defendant which contained express or implied terms which prohibit the defendant from using or disclosing the confidential information (see <span class="font-italic">Total English Learning Global Pte Ltd and another v Kids Counsel Pte Ltd and another suit </span>[2014] SGHC 258 at [82]; <span class="font-italic">I</span><span class="font-italic">nvenpro (M) Sdn Bhd v JCS Automation Pte Ltd and another </span>[2014] 2 SLR 1045 at [155]–[158]). It is this obligation of confidence which is the “<span class="font-italic">raison d’etre </span>of the law of confidence – the defendant must honour, or be made to honour, this obligation of confidence”: Ng-Loy Wee Loon, <span class="font-italic">Law of Intellectual Property of Singapore </span>at [40.1.1] – [40.1.4] (“<span class="font-italic">Law of Intellectual Property of Singapore</span>”). In this regard, it is perhaps useful to canvass the fresh developments as to how the Singapore courts have exercised their equitable jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 The first decision of interest is that in <span class="font-italic">LVM Law Chambers LLC v Wan Hoe Keet</span><span class="font-italic"> and another and another matter </span>[2020] 1 SLR 1083 (“<span class="font-italic">LVM Law Chambers</span>”). There, the respondents had applied for an injunction to restrain the appellant law firm from acting in suit no 806 of 2018 (“Suit 806”), which was a proceeding commenced against them for their alleged roles in a Ponzi scheme. Prior to the commencement of Suit 806, the appellant had acted for the plaintiff in suit no 315 of 2016 (“Suit 315”), which involved similar proceedings brought against the respondent. Suit 315 was resolved on the first day of trial – the settlement agreement, which the appellant was not expressly made party to, contained a confidentiality clause. The respondents contended that the appellant owed them an obligation of confidentiality by virtue of having participated in the settlement negotiations in Suit 315, and that there was a real risk that it would misuse or disclose confidential information if the injunction was not granted. At first instance, the injunction was granted, and the appellant law firm appealed against that decision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The primary issue on appeal concerned the applicable legal principles in deciding whether a lawyer or law firm should be restrained from acting for a plaintiff against the same counterparty in a previous set of proceedings resolved by means of a settlement or mediation (<span class="font-italic">LVM Law Chambers </span>at [12(a)]). In this regard, the Court of Appeal noted (<span class="font-italic">LVM Law Chambers </span>at [13]–[15]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[13] It is clear that if <span class="font-italic">the lawyer</span> has <span class="font-italic">contractually agreed</span> to be bound by a duty of confidentiality, then that agreement will operate accordingly and whether or not he can act for a subsequent party against the same counterparty in a previous set of proceedings will depend on the precise scope of the duty embodied in the contract itself. However, this was <span class="font-italic">not</span> the situation in this appeal as the Appellant never entered into such an agreement, although one did exist between the <span class="font-italic">parties</span> to the previous proceedings (see [5] above). Indeed, this particular point <span class="font-italic">distinguishes</span> this case from that of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Carter Holt Harvey Forests Ltd v Sunnex Logging Ltd</span> [2001] 3 NZLR 343 (“Carter Holt”), where the lawyers in question had signed confidentiality agreements in their personal capacity prior to taking part in the mediation. We also note that in this last-mentioned case, the confidentiality agreements which the lawyers signed were “sufficiently wide to encompass everything which occurred as part of the mediation process” (see <span class="font-italic">Carter Holt</span> at [23]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14 However, even if (as is the situation in this appeal) the lawyer concerned has not entered into a contractual agreement of confidentiality, that is not necessarily an end to the matter. In <span class="font-italic">limited</span> circumstances, an <span class="font-italic">equitable duty of confidence may</span> be imposed by the court, such that it may be inappropriate for the lawyer (or law firm) concerned to act for a party against the same counterparty in a previous set of proceedings. What, then, might these circumstances be?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15 In our view, a good starting point would be the test for breach of confidence laid down by Megarry J in the seminal English High Court decision in <span class="font-italic">Coco v AN Clark (Engineers) Ltd</span> [1969] RPC 41 (which has been cited and applied by the Singapore courts (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">ANB v ANC</span> <span class="font-italic">and another and another matter</span> [2015] 5 SLR 522 at [17])) – albeit <span class="font-italic">modified</span> slightly having regard to the nature of the precise issue before this court and the relevant case law which will be considered briefly below.

Put simply, the counterparty in the previous set of proceedings must establish that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) the information concerned must have the necessary quality of confidence about it;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) that information must have been received by the lawyer (or law firm) concerned in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">there is a real and sensible possibility of the information being misused</span><span class="font-italic">.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Just three days later, the Court of Appeal handed down the judgment in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span>, where the court observed that the equity-based action for breach of confidence protected two interests:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Wrongful gain interest: where the defendant has made unauthorised use or disclosure of confidential information and thereby gained a benefit; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Wrongful loss interest: where the plaintiff is seeking protection for the confidentiality of the information <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, which is loss suffered so long as a defendant’s conscience has been impacted in the breach of the obligation of confidentiality.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 The court in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin </span>further laid down, what has been termed the “modified approach” (<span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span> at [61]). Under the “modified approach”, if the relevant information had the necessary quality of confidence about it and if it was imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence, an action for the breach of confidence would be presumed. This presumption could be rebutted if the defendant could adduce proof that his/her conscience was not affected in the circumstances in which the plaintiff’s wrongful loss interest had been harmed or undermined.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 If there was any doubt as to the scope of the decision in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span>, and the extent to which it had changed the law on breach of confidence, that was subsequently clarified by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lim Oon Kuin </span><span class="font-italic">and others v Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP and another appeal </span>[2022] SGCA 29. There, the Court of Appeal stated that the decision in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin </span>did not set out to turn the law on breach of confidence on its head by replacing the traditional <span class="font-italic">Coco </span>approach in its entirety (<span class="font-italic">Lim Oon Kuin </span>at [39]). The <span class="font-italic">I-Admin </span>approach was intended to specifically fill the lacuna in the law in so far as the legitimate objective of protecting the wrongful loss interest was concerned. Here, a legal burden was imposed on the defendant to show that his/her conscience was not affected – an evidential burden would be simply insufficient to protect the plaintiff’s interest in the confidential information.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 The court in <span class="font-italic">Lim Oon Kuin </span>further cited, with approval (at [41]), the following passages from the <span class="font-italic">Law of Intellectual Property </span>(at [41.3.10]–[41.3.11]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is also likely that the Court of Appeal intended to further limit the application of the ‘modified approach’ to cases involving unauthorised acquisition of the confidential information, that is, the ‘taker’ cases. This conjecture is based on the fact that the court placed a fair amount of emphasis on the defendants’ acquisition (via [<span class="font-italic">the former employees</span>]) of the confidential information without the plaintiff’s knowledge, and more generally, how technology had made it much easier for a person to access and download confidential information without consent.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There is another reason for this conjecture. Three days before the issuance of the judgment in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span>, the Court of Appeal issued a judgment in <span class="font-italic">LVM Law Chambers LLC v Wan Hoe Keet</span>, where breach of confidence was raised as a cause of action. The defendant in this case was not a ‘taker’ of confidential information. The defendant was a lawyer who had acted for a party in a dispute against the plaintiffs arising out of a Ponzi scheme. After negotiations conducted by the parties’ solicitors, this dispute was eventually settled. When the defendant was engaged to act for another party <span class="font-italic">ABC</span> in a suit against the plaintiffs in relation to the same Ponzi scheme, the plaintiffs sought an injunction to prevent the defendant from acting for <span class="font-italic">ABC</span> in this second suit. The plaintiffs claimed that there was confidential information arising out of the circumstances surrounding the settlement of the first dispute, and that the defendant being privy to this confidential information was bound by an equitable obligation of confidence. On the third element (misuse of the confidential information), the Court of Appeal held that this element would be satisfied if there was a ‘serious and reasonable possibility’ of misuse of the confidential information by the defendant. Significantly, the appellate court placed the burden of proving the existence of such possibility of misuse squarely on the <span class="font-italic">plaintiffs</span>. In this case, the plaintiffs failed to discharge this burden and, accordingly, the Court of Appeal refused to grant the injunction sought by the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Therefore, if one looks at the decision in <span class="font-italic">Lim Oon Kuin</span>, and the court’s discussion of its previous decisions, it would appear that there are <span class="font-italic">at least</span> two broad approaches to the law of confidence in Singapore. Here, the “modified approach” would apply to what Prof Ng-Loy terms “taker” cases – these are cases where the defendant has acquired the plaintiff’s confidential information without their knowledge. In such cases, it was the “wrongful loss” interest that would be at stake. Because the traditional approach to the law of confidence imposed a requirement of unauthorised use and detriment, the wrongful gain interest had been overemphasised at the expense of the wrongful loss interest: <span class="font-italic">I-Admin </span>at [58]. This necessitated the “modified approach” and the shifting of the legal burden onto the defendant to prove that their conscience was unaffected – this serves to protect the plaintiff’s right to preserve the confidentiality of its information, which was the substance of the wrongful loss interest: <span class="font-italic">Lim Oon Kuin </span>at [38].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 The traditional approach in <span class="font-italic">Coco</span>, however, would continue to apply in cases where the “wrongful gain” interest was at stake: <span class="font-italic">Lim Oon Kuin </span>at [39] and [41]. Here, the Writers Studio would bear the burden of proof in showing that there had been an unauthorised use of the information, to Writers Studio’s detriment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Writers Studio, however, did not appear to be aware of the development in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin </span>despite the fact that the present claim was commenced after the Court of Appeal had handed down its decision in that case. This was evident from the manner in which Writers Studio had framed their pleadings which were based on the requirements set forth in <span class="font-italic">Coco</span>. Subsequent amendments made to the statement of claim in September 2021 also did not affect Writers Studio’s pleadings on the confidentiality point insofar as the equitable obligation of confidence was concerned. Writers Studio, therefore, appeared to have proceeded on the basis that the law was as it stood prior to <span class="font-italic">I</span><span class="font-italic">-Admin</span> (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the traditional approach under <span class="font-italic">Coco</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 This, to my mind, means that it is now not open to Writers Studio to rely on the “modified approach” in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin </span>and assert that Mr Chin bears the legal burden of proof of showing that his confidence was not affected. While there may have been some uncertainty as to whether the burden imposed on Mr Chin in the “modified approach” was an evidential or legal one (see Saw Cheng Lim, Chan Zheng Wen Samuel and Chai Wen Min, “Revisiting the Law of Confidence in Singapore and a Proposal for a New Tort of Misuse of Private Information” (2020) 32 Singapore Academy of Law Journal 891 at [22]), it was always open to Writers Studio to have pleaded the point. After all, pleadings are meant to give the other party notice of one’s case. Writers Studio, having not pleaded whether it was the wrongful loss or wrongful gain interest that was at stake, must now let the chips lie where they have fallen. I would add that in future cases, now that <span class="font-italic">Lim Oon Kuin </span>has provided clarity on the “modified approach” in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin</span>, counsel should take care to plead with specificity, whether they are proceeding on the basis of the “wrongful loss” or “wrongful gain” interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 In any event, I would further hold that the wrongful loss interest was not engaged in the present case. That interest is only engaged in cases where the defendant has ‘taken’ the confidential information – for instance, in <span class="font-italic">I-Admin </span>itself, the appellant’s source code was copied by the first and second respondents, who were former employees which later left to set up their own rival company (the third respondent). The present case is quite different. Unlike the situation in <span class="font-italic">I-</span><span class="font-italic">Admin</span>, where the respondent had acquired the confidential information without the appellant’s knowledge or consent, whatever confidential information Mr Chin possessed was passed to him by Writers Studio.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 I therefore proceed on the basis that it was the wrongful gain interest that was at stake in the present case, and the traditional formulation in <span class="font-italic">Coco </span>applied. As I explain below, the Writers Studio’s claims for breach of the NDA and the duty of confidentiality fail because they have been unable to prove their case on a balance of probabilities.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Confidential Information</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 As regards Mr Chin’s private contacting of Writers Studio’s Clients, I make one preliminary observation. Writers Studio seems to be itself unclear as to the condition upon which Mr Chin could do so. For example, the contemporaneous evidence upon which Writers Studio relies shows that Ms Oh acceded to Mr Chin’s request on the condition that the “liaising is uniform and done in a group with me”. Ms Oh also explained that group chats are “safer” and expressed her concern of legal suits against Writers Studio.

</div>
</div> Ms Oh’s testimony as to what Ms Phu had informed her was Mr Chin’s intention (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, removal of Writers Studio’s or Innova Studio’s logo) is insufficient to found Writers Studio’s claim against Mr Chin in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 The second – and insurmountable – difficulty is that Writers Studio fails to establish any <span class="font-italic">loss </span><span class="font-italic">and/or detriment suffered</span>. Taking Writers Studio’s position at its highest and <span class="font-italic">even if it could prove that Mr Chin asked Ms Phu to remove its </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">logo</span>, it is unclear to me how such a request<span class="font-italic"> </span>could have caused Writers Studio to suffer loss and/or detriment. Even though this is a bifurcated trial and Writers Studio need not tender evidence on the <span class="font-italic">quantum </span>of losses suffered, it must – for the purposes of <span class="font-italic">liability</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>– nevertheless demonstrate that it <span class="font-italic">did suffer loss</span><span class="font-italic"> or detriment</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 I am thus not persuaded that Writers Studio proved its case on a balance of probabilities in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 The present dispute should have been fairly straightforward. But the manner in which parties pleaded their cases and framed their submissions resulted in this case being both longer and more complicated than it should have been. The haphazard manner in which parties pleaded their cases obfuscated the true issues at the core<span class="font-italic"> </span>of Writers Studio’s claim against Mr Chin. It was only at the trial that counsel for Writers Studio indicated that it would like this Court to make a finding as to whether Mr Chin was an employee of Writers Studio so as to assist with the CPF Board investigations (even though this was not strictly necessary to determine Writers Studio’s claim against Mr Chin). Time was also wasted at the trial when counsel spent time pursuing lines of inquiry that were immaterial to the determination of the present dispute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 Having regard to the parties’ arguments and the evidence before me, I dismiss Writers Studio’s claim against Mr Chin for the reasons above. I shall hear the parties on costs.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Lee Seiu Kin<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Koh Weijin, Leon and Elsie Lim Yan (N S Kang) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Hsu Sheng Wei Keith and Nico Lee Yin Hao (Emerald Law LLC) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
