The 2nd Defendant (Neo Aik Siong) and the Plaintiff (Neo Aik Soo) are, respectively, the eldest and second eldest of the twelve siblings in their family.  Both are septuagenarians.  The 1st Defendant (Neo Geek Kuan) is the fourth eldest sibling in the family.  The dispute in this case centred on the beneficial ownership of a shophouse at 34 / 34A / 34B Keong Saik Road (“the Property”).  It was not disputed that the Property had been registered in the 1st Defendant’s name since its purchase in June 1991.  It was also common ground that the 1st Defendant was only the legal owner and that she did not have beneficial ownership of the Property.  The Plaintiff’s case was that he was the beneficial owner of the Property and that the 1st Defendant held it on trust for him, whereas the Defendants alleged that it was the 2nd Defendant who was the beneficial owner of the Property and that the 1st Defendant held it on trust for him.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 At the end of the trial, I found in favour of the Plaintiff.

He had asked the 1st Defendant to hold it in her name, on trust for him, because at the point of purchasing the Property, he was working as a broker engaged in “high value trades for high net worth individuals” and had concerns about shielding his assets from creditors in the event any of these trades “went badly” and exposed him to personal liability.

Firstly, the Plaintiff rejected entirely the existence of any “Neo family monies” or “Neo family assets”; he was adamant that he had paid for the purchase of the Property with his own funds from OCBC Account 1.  The transfer of $400,000 from OCBC Account 2 to OCBC Account 1 on 12 January was a transfer which he had effected and which did not represent any repayment of loan by the 2nd Defendant.  He could not recall exactly what he had used the $400,000 for but was sure that it had been “100 per cent… for own use, nothing to do with [the 2nd Defendant]”.

</div>  When he presented the second draft to Ong, however, he was shocked to discover that around July / August 2015, the 2nd Defendant had already gone behind his back to arrange for the 1st Defendant to extend Ong’s lease for another two years from 1 August 2015 to 31 July 2017, and at a rental amount of $10,000 per month.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The Plaintiff confronted the 1st Defendant about this lease extension.  She claimed that she had simply signed whatever the 2nd Defendant put before her.  The Plaintiff confronted the 2nd Defendant – who insisted it was a favourable deal, despite the Plaintiff’s view that the rent was too low.

</div>  As their conversation went nowhere, the Plaintiff decided to drop the matter.  However, as he did not want to risk the 2nd Defendant giving Ong further, unauthorised extensions of the lease, he decided to revoke the 2nd Defendant’s authority to act in matters concerning the Property.  To that end, on 2 August 2016, the Plaintiff wrote a letter for the 1st Defendant to sign and to send to Ong.

One such HDB flat (at Block 21 St George’s Road #20-172) was purchased for one of the younger Neo sisters, Poo Chu; and this was paid for by the parents and by Poo Chu’s CPF funds.  The other such flat (at Block 23 Eunos Crescent #06-3019) was purchased in the 2nd Defendant’s name on 9 July 1979.  The 2nd Defendant claimed that the purchase price was paid using “money from [his] own pocket, permitted CPF withdrawals from [his] CPF account and a housing loan from the HDB”.

It was also not disputed that when 20 Lorong K was sold for a sum of $2,120,470 in December 1983, part of the sale proceeds - $1,000,000 - went towards paying off the mortgage loans taken out by the Plaintiff.  In his AEIC, the 2nd Defendant claimed that “(s)trictly speaking”, he and the other Neo siblings “should not have allowed [the Plaintiff’s] Mortgages to be redeemed using funds from the said sale proceeds as these funds also belonged to the Neo Family… However, being family members, [they] did not quibble over such matters then”.

Given that it was agreed the money for the purchase of the Property came from OCBC Account 1, it followed that the key questions to be answered were these:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Were the monies in OCBC Account 1 the Plaintiff’s monies as he claimed, or were these monies “Neo Family monies” as the 2nd Defendant claimed?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If the monies in OCBC Account 1 were “Neo Family monies”, was the 2nd Defendant given a loan of these monies as he claimed, with which he paid the purchase price of the Property?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In addition to the issue of payment of the purchase price, it was also relevant to consider whether there was other, objective evidence pointing to one or the other party’s beneficial ownership of the Property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Having considered the evidence adduced, I was satisfied that the monies in OCBC Account 1 were the Plaintiff’s monies and not “Neo Family monies”; and that it was the Plaintiff who had paid for the Property using his own monies from OCBC Account 1.  I was also satisfied that there was no such thing as “Neo Family monies” or, for that matter, “Neo Family Assets”.  There was no loan of “Neo Family monies” made from OCBC Account 1 to the 2nd Defendant; and the 2nd Defendant did not pay for the Property.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I set out below my reasons for these findings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">On whether the monies in OCBC Account 1 were the Plaintiff’s monies or “Neo Family monies”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 At the outset, I noted that the Defendants argued in their closing submissions that “(n)othing turns on whether the monies in OCBC Account 1 belong to the Neo Family or [the Plaintiff] or some other party.  If [the 1st Defendant] could demonstrate that the monies from OCBC Account 1 which was used to fund the purchase of the Property was eventually repaid via the Transfer on 12 Jan 1994 (from OCBC Account 2), then his claim that he was the beneficial owner is made out”.

Firstly, to postulate that the 2nd Defendant needed only to demonstrate that the monies from OCBC Account 1 which were used to pay for the Property were “repaid” via the $400,000 transfer from OCBC Account 2 on 12 January 1994 was really to put the cart before the horse.  The issue of “repayment” could only arise if one rejected the Plaintiff’s case that he had paid for the Property with his own monies from OCBC Account 1 – and accepted instead that the 2nd Defendant had taken a loan from that account.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Secondly, the argument ignored the case which the Defendants themselves had presented at trial, which was that the monies from OCBC Account 1 were “Neo Family monies” and not the Plaintiff’s monies.  Indeed, under cross-examination, the 2nd Defendant firmly and repeatedly stated that the loan he took from OCBC Account 1 to purchase the Property was <span class="font-italic">not</span> a loan from the Plaintiff, because the Plaintiff “didn’t have that amount of money”

The 1st Defendant said she believed some of the shares in question were registered in her name, but no evidence was produced of any such shares; and as for which other siblings might have had shares registered in their names, she admitted she did not know.

</div>  I found their combined testimonies credible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Having considered the evidence before me, I rejected the Defendants’ story about 20 Lorong K having been purchased with the three sources of “Neo Family monies” as described in their AEICs.  I found instead that 20 Lorong K was purchased with the Plaintiff’s own monies and that this property belonged to him – not to “the Neo Family” as the Defendants claimed.  From this, it followed that the proceeds from any sale of 20 Lorong K belonged to the Plaintiff.  This would explain why the Plaintiff was able to take out two mortgages on 20 Lorong K totalling $1 million.

</div>  When 20 Lorong K was subsequently sold for $2,120,470, a sizeable portion of the sale proceeds were applied towards redeeming the two mortgages.  It was not disputed that none of the other Neo siblings raised any objections.  The 1st Defendant sought to downplay the absence of objections to the Plaintiff’s actions as a matter of “family members” not waiting to “quibble over such matters”.

</div>  This explanation struck me as being quite unbelievable, considering that the mortgage loans which were redeemed came to nearly half of the sale price of 20 Lorong K.  In my view, rather than it being a case of the other siblings choosing not to “quibble”, this was a case of their having no say in the mortgages or in the subsequent redemption of the mortgages because 20 Lorong K belonged to the Plaintiff; and he could deal with it – and with any proceeds from its sale - as he saw fit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 I should highlight that even leaving aside the issue of the sources of funding for the purchase of 20 Lorong K, it was plain that on the Defendants’ own case, there would not have been any balance amount left from the proceeds of its sale in December 1983 which could have been deposited in OCBC Account 1.  First of all, it should be noted that neither Defendant was able to point to any documentary record of such balance amount having been deposited in OCBC Account 1.  As noted earlier, the 1st Defendant also conceded during cross-examination that she had no personal knowledge of any such deposit having been made.

Tellingly, he was unable to put forward any documentary or other objective evidence of any such “internal transfers of money”; and when pressed further in cross-examination, he attempted yet again to prevaricate and backpedal.  I reproduce below the relevant extract from the trial transcript,

Counsel’s point is that would mean nothing was left from the balance of sale proceeds from 20 Lorong K, meaning nothing was left from the sale proceeds of 20 Lorong K with which to purchase the Keong Saik property.  That’s counsel’s point.  He said he disagreed.

I accepted the Plaintiff’s evidence that the monies in OCBC Account 1 were his monies and not “Neo Family monies”.  I accepted that the payments made from OCBC Account 1 on 21 March 1991 ($37,000) and on 20 June 1991 ($331,438-13) were payments made from the Plaintiff’s own monies for the purchase of the Property.  For the avoidance of doubt, I should add that I also accepted the Plaintiff’s evidence that the last small sum of $1,497-50 – which was paid via cashier’s order to the vendors’ solicitors on the same date as the payment of the $331,438-13 (20 June 1991) – was also made using the Plaintiff’s own monies.

In the first place, as pointed out in the Plaintiff’s closing submissions,

</div> insofar as the Defendants appeared to be claiming that certain properties and other assets were owned by an entity known as “the Neo Family”, such a claim was legally unsustainable: there is no concept in Singapore law of “family ownership” of a property.

</div> was misplaced.  The expression “family compact” as employed in that case clearly referred to the trial judge’s finding that there was an intention on the part of the Chia family members to secure the home at 37 Jalan Kechubong for the parents and the family members who lived there; and that it was this intention which actuated a series of transfers of ownership interests in the Jalan Kechubong property (at [28] and [33]).  The trial judge’s finding was one of fact which the Court of Appeal agreed with on appeal (at [34]).  Nothing in the judgement could be construed as establishing a legal concept of “family ownership” of assets in the manner advocated by the Defendants in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Alternatively, if the Defendants were claiming that each Neo sibling was a beneficial owner of various properties and assets such as 20 Lorong K, 61 Lorong K, the company Medway Investments and the properties registered in Medway Investments’ name, then there was simply no objective evidence to support such a claim.  According to the narrative advanced by the Defendants, 20 Lorong K was the first property acquired as a “Neo Family’s Asset”, and it was from this initial property acquisition that the New Family then built up a portfolio of assets.  However, as I explained in the preceding paragraphs, my findings – after a review of the evidence – were that 20 Lorong K was purchased with the Plaintiff’s monies and belonged to the Plaintiff.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 I also found the claim that Medway Investments was incorporated as the vehicle for “the Neo Family’s” investments frankly incredible.  It was not disputed that the majority shareholders of the company - with a total of 75% shareholding – were the Plaintiff’s wife Lai Wah and the Plaintiff himself.  Lai Wah is not a member of “the Neo Family”.  As for the Plaintiff, the Defendants have sought throughout these proceedings to paint him as a selfish, covetous individual with a well-known “tendency to use his siblings for his own objectives and purposes”.

Asked to describe how much the “Neo Family monies” would have amounted to as at 1991, the 2nd Defendant said at first that he “did not really calculate the sum”, and then asserted in the next breath that it was “a substantial amount” of “around $300,000 to $500,000”.

However, he also claimed that the $30,000 difference between the “loan” of $370,000 and the “repayment” of $400,000 represented interest unilaterally charged by the Plaintiff at the point of repayment.

</div>  Since he claimed that the “loan” was made from “Neo Family monies”, it was astonishing that the <span class="font-italic">Plaintiff</span> should have been in a position to demand interest from him amounting to a five-figure figure– and apparently without providing any calculations to explain how the figure was derived.

</div>  The upshot, therefore, was that there was simply no coherent explanation as to why he should have suddenly decided to “repay” the “loan” on 12 January 1994.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 In the circumstances, I agreed with the Plaintiff’s submission – that the Defendants’ claims about the “repayment” on 12 January 1994 was simply a piece of reverse-engineering on their part.  As the Plaintiff pointed out, the Defendants’ pleadings originally made no mention of a “loan”.  It was only after the disclosure of the Plaintiff’s documentary evidence – in the course of the summary judgement application - of his payment of the purchase price from OCBC Account 1 that the Defendants came up with the story of a “loan” of “Neo Family monies” from OCBC Account 1.  Since there was no evidence of a “repayment” of $370,000 made by the 2nd Defendant to OCBC Account 1, the transfer of $400,000 from OCBC Account 2 to OCBC Account 1 on 12 January 1994 was plainly the closest thing he could latch on to as the purported “repayment” – hence the odd mismatch between the “loan” figure and the “repayment” amount, and the absence of any cogent reasons for making “repayment” in January 1994.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 For the above reasons, I rejected the Defendants’ contention that the $400,000 transfer from OCBC Account 2 to OCBC Account 1 on 12 January 1994 represented the 2nd Defendant’s repayment of the “loan” taken from OCBC Account 1 in 1991.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The formation of a purchase price resulting trust </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 There was no dispute between the parties on the legal principles applicable, as the Defendants acknowledged that both sides were relying on a purchase price resulting trust.

The chief issue in contention all along was who had paid for the Property – and thus, who was entitled to a purchase price resulting trust in respect of the Property.  For the reasons set out in in these grounds, I was satisfied that the Plaintiff had paid for the Property with his own monies in 1991.  I rejected the 2nd Defendant’s contention that it was he who had paid for the Property - whether with a “loan” from “Neo Family monies” in OCBC Account 1 as he claimed in his AEIC and through much of his testimony, or with monies from Medway Investment’s account as he belatedly alleged in cross-examination.  I was satisfied that it was the Plaintiff who was fully the beneficial owner of the Property by virtue of a purchase price resulting trust.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Other objective evidence pointing to the Plaintiff’s beneficial ownership of the Property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 I also found that in addition to the evidence of payment of the purchase price, there was other, objective evidence pointing to the Plaintiff’s beneficial ownership of the Property.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Payment of property tax</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Firstly, insofar as property tax on the Property was concerned, while the Plaintiff and the 2nd Defendant each claimed to have paid the property tax prior to 1996, neither produced any documentary records or other evidence of such payment.  From 1996 onwards, however, it was not disputed that the property was paid via GIRO deduction from OCBC Account 2.  Having found that OCBC Account 2 was controlled by the Plaintiff and that the funds in it were his, I was satisfied that the GIRO payments of the property tax from 1996 onwards were made by the Plaintiff.  I accepted the Plaintiff’s evidence as to the deposits made by him into OCBC Account 2 to meet the deductions for property tax.

</div> about the handwritten annotations on those copies of the bank statements exhibited in court, I did not find anything sinister about these annotations.  Certainly I did not accept the Defendants’ allegation that they showed the Plaintiff to be “tampering” with the evidence.  In brief, the Defendants claimed that copies of some of the bank statements exhibited in court carried handwritten annotations indicating the payment of property tax by the Plaintiff, whereas these annotations were missing from the originals of the bank statements.  The Plaintiff explained, however, that although he had initially erased all markings from the copies of the bank statements submitted to court, he had subsequently decided to add to these copies handwritten words such as “Neo Aik Soo pay property tax” in big bold letters to remind himself what the entries were about, and also because his eyesight was not good.

</div>  The Plaintiff also testified that in submitting the copies of the bank statements to court, he had erased markings in which he had previously recorded shortfalls in the rent collected by the 2nd Defendant on his behalf: as the Plaintiff pointed out, if he had wanted to present a self-serving version of the statements, it would have been to his advantage – and to the 2nd Defendant’s disadvantage - to retain such markings.

The evidence showed that it was the Plaintiff and not the 2nd Defendant who reimbursed the 1st Defendant for the income tax she paid on rental income from the Property.  It was not disputed that the total amount reimbursed came to $50,000.  This was made up of two payments: $20,000 paid to the 1st Defendant by the Plaintiff sometime around 2013,

</div>  In fact, he claimed that it was the 1st Defendant who had asked him for reimbursement – which totally contradicted her evidence that she had never sought reimbursement from him.  When this contradiction was pointed out to him, he replied that the 1st Defendant must have mistakenly thought that OCBC Account 2 “was a joint account between [the Plaintiff] and [him]”.  This appeared to me to be an incongruous <span class="font-italic">non-sequitur</span> of a response, since it did not explain why the 1st Defendant might have been mistaken about whether she did ask him for reimbursement.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The rest of the 2nd Defendant’s evidence about his reimbursement of the 1st Defendant’s income tax payments was just as absurd.

</div>  Given that the 1st Defendant’s total income tax liability apparently came up to the mid- five figures, there seemed to me to be no sensible reason why she would have asked the 2nd Defendant to reimburse her a mere $2,000 to $3,000 – especially when (on the 2nd Defendant’s own admission), she would already have been retired by then and   presumably no longer earning an income.

It was also not disputed that he has never been reimbursed by the 2nd Defendant for the payment.  In my view, it was unbelievable that the Plaintiff would have willingly paid the 1st Defendant from his own funds in reimbursement of her income tax liability if he were not the beneficial owner of the Property – especially since the Defendants have repeatedly described him as a “stingy” and “calculative” individual. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 In the circumstances, I was satisfied that both Defendants were aware that the reason why the 1st Defendant had sought reimbursement of income tax from the Plaintiff – and the reason why the Plaintiff reimbursed her to the tune of $50,000 – was because <span class="font-italic">he</span> was the beneficial owner of the Property.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The 31 July 2016 letter</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Thirdly, the Defendants’ conduct vis-à-vis the letter of 31 July 2016 was also illuminating.

The letter also provided for the increase in the monthly rental amount and stipulated that all future rental was to be paid into an OCBC account which was actually the Plaintiff’s personal account (held jointly with his son).

In cross-examination, the 1st Defendant admitted that she had in fact been able to read and understand the letter prior to signing it: that was how she had understood that the 2nd Defendant would be “unhappy” about those portions of the letter which provided for him to cease acting as her legal representative and which gave the Plaintiff “full power of attorney” instead.

This seemed a most far-fetched explanation.

First he said that it was “not necessary” for him to do anything about the letter because the 1st Defendant had already told him it did not reflect her true intention.  This was not mentioned in his AEIC.  It also conflicted with the 1st Defendant’s evidence that she did not tell the 2nd Defendant about the letter after signing it.  Next, the 2nd Defendant claimed that he had also spoken to the tenant Mr Ong, that “even the tenant knew that…this letter was not a true reflection of [the 1st Defendant’s] intentions”, and that the tenant already knew anyway that he (the 2nd Defendant) was the “actual owner” of the Property.  Again, this was not mentioned in his AEIC; nor was Mr Ong called to give evidence of such a conversation.  Finally, and most bizarrely, the 2nd Defendant said he had discussed with the 1st Defendant and understood that the letter was “invalid”, but that he had not written to the Plaintiff to point out its invalidity because:

</div>  Her own admission that she was capable of such a feisty response gave the lie to the Defendants’ submission that she had been “conditioned to be intimidated” by the Plaintiff through “his pattern of physical (threatened or executed) and non-physical threats”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Most damning of all was the testimony of the two lawyers, Mr Lim and Mr Ng.  Both were clear and firm in testifying that they had explained to the 1st Defendant the contents of the documents to be signed, that she had acknowledged her understanding, that she had appeared to be acting independently and carefully, and that nothing about the signing of these documents of her demeanour raised any red flags or suggested she might have been under duress.

</div>  In fact, it was Mr Lim’s evidence that the 1st Defendant participated freely in the discussion about the documents to be signed – contrary to the 1st Defendant’s assertion that she had felt compelled to keep quiet.  Whilst the 1st Defendant claimed that she had merely commented on her payment of income tax without asking the Plaintiff for reimbursement, Mr Lim recalled clearly that it was the 1st Defendant who brought up the fact that she had been paying income tax on the rental from the Property and who asked the Plaintiff to reimburse her $30,000.

</div>  Mr Lim also observed that the Plaintiff had appeared surprised at this request but had agreed to it.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 Mr Lim also recalled that in response to his query, the 1st Defendant had confirmed that the Plaintiff was to receive the proceeds of sale of the Property – but that before signing the Power of Attorney, she had “interjected” that the Plaintiff should compensate her for all the years she had taken care of the Property.

</div>
</div>  This was how Mr Lim came to be instructed to prepare the Deed of Immunity.  Again, this contrasted with the 1st Defendant’s evidence that she had never asked for any such protection.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Mr Lim was not shaken in cross-examination on his recollection of the above matters.  He also had no reason to lie about any of these things.  His evidence thus showed that the 1st Defendant was a willing participant in the discussions on 10 December 2016; that far from being cowed and silent, she was well able to stand up for her own rights and to make demands of the Plaintiff; and that her story at trial about being forced to sign the documents under duress was a pack of lies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 I also accepted Mr Lim’s evidence that he did not meet with the 1st Defendant on the day she collected the original Power of Attorney from his office, nor did she speak to him personally to tell him she had been forced to sign the documents.  Again, there was no reason for him to lie about this.  Indeed, as an experienced lawyer of several decades’ standing, it would have been quite astonishing if – in the face of such allegations – Mr Lim simply made no response (which was what the 1st Defendant claimed).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 In summary, therefore, I was satisfied that the 1st Defendant participated voluntarily in the signing of the Statutory Declaration and the Power of Attorney on 10 December 2016; that she knew very well what these documents were about and what the consequences of signing them were; and that she later sought – falsely - to disavow these documents only because she had allied herself by then with the 2nd Defendant in his scheme to lay claim to the Property.  In my view, the Statutory Declaration in particular represented the unambiguous acknowledgement by the 1st Defendant of the Plaintiff’s beneficial ownership of the Property, a fact further supported by her voluntary and concurrent execution of the Power of Attorney.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 In the interests of completeness, I should note that while there was a belated attempt on the 1st Defendant’s part to suggest that the Deed of Immunity was also executed under duress,

</div>
</div> I dismissed this suggestion as being wholly incredible.  Not only was such an allegation never pleaded in the Defence and Counterclaim, there was no reason at all why the Plaintiff should have forced or coerced the 1st Defendant to sign a document which was obviously in her interests and against his.  That the 1st Defendant could come up with such a ridiculous suggestion in cross-examination simply demonstrated that she had no regard for the truth.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Miscellaneous points</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 I make four final points.  Firstly, while the 2nd Defendant tried to place weight on the fact that he was the one who had signed the sale and purchase agreement for the Property, I did not consider this fact to be particularly helpful.  I certainly did not see this as being probative of beneficial ownership of the Property.  This was because on the 2nd Defendant’s own evidence, the Plaintiff had for many years entrusted him with most of the negotiations and administrative matters relating to the sale and purchase of various properties.  Thus, for example, on the 2nd Defendant’s own evidence, in respect of 83 Tras Street, it was he who had attended the public auction and bid successfully for this property; and it was also he who had engaged and dealt with the main contractors for A&amp;A works to this property and obtained the Certificate of Statutory Completion.

</div>
</div>  His signing of the sale and purchase agreement for the Keong Saik Property was therefore consistent with the manner in which he had assisted the Plaintiff in the latter’s property acquisitions over the years.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 For the above reasons, I also gave no weight to the opinion expressed by the architect Mr Lim HL that he thought it “odd” that the Plaintiff should not have dealt with him directly on the A&amp;A works for the Property if the Plaintiff had been its true owner.  As for Mr Lim HL’s evidence about the 2nd Defendant claiming that he was the owner, I also did not find this evidence of any real substantive value.  After all, the Plaintiff too had produced witnesses to say that he had made contemporaneous statements about his ownership of the Property.

</div>  Such statements in themselves had to be assessed against the documentary evidence and other objective evidence available; and as I have explained, the documentary and other objective evidence in this case plainly supported the Plaintiff’s case that he was the beneficial owner.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 Thirdly, the Defendants contended that it was not believable that the Plaintiff should have asked the 1st Defendant to hold the Property on trust for him when he could have put it in the name of his wife, or registered it under either Medway Realty or Medway Investments.  However, I did not think anything much turned on the availability of other persons or entities to hold the Property.  I saw no reason to doubt the Plaintiff’s explanations

</div>: he feared that assets registered in his wife’s name would still be seized upon by creditors if they came after him; it did not cross his mind to use Medway Realty or Medway Investments as he was thinking of getting someone who could help him look after what was “a unique red-light house”; and anyway his wife would have had wanted a property in a red-light district registered under her name or under a company associated with her.  Such concerns did not apply to the 1st Defendant; and since she was his younger sister, he trusted her.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 Finally, I noted with regret that a not inconsiderable portion of the Defendants’ evidence at trial and their closing submissions was devoted to attacks on the Plaintiff’s character.  For example, Neo Poh Gek was called as a defence witness even though it was apparent from her AEIC and her testimony in cross-examination that she knew nothing about the beneficial ownership of the Property:
