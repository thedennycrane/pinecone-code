<font color="#000080" size="4">Judgment</font>

</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u>

                   

<em>Cur Adv Vult</em></strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1.    The plaintiff is a private company incorporated in

Singapore and is a subsidiary of Progress Software Corporation, a NASDAQ listed company in

the United States Of America. This is an application brought by the plaintiff in respect

of the Central Provident Fund ("CPF") payments of four of its employees. Under

their employment contracts, the remuneration of these employees is structured as having

two component parts described in the affidavit of Christopher Yeo, the plaintiff's

managing director, as a fixed component (comprising about 60% of the total remuneration)

and a variable component (comprising the balance 40%). The fixed component was expressed

as an annual package and contributions to the CPF were paid on a monthly basis. The

variable component was determined monthly but paid at various intervals. At this point it

will be useful to mention that remuneration for the purposes of calculating contributions

under the Central Provident Fund Act, Ch 36 fall into two broad categories. First, there

is the "ordinary wages", and secondly, there is "additional wages".

These are defined in  5 (d) and (e) of the First Schedule to the Act as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"(d) "additional wages" means any wages other than

  ordinary wages;</p>
<p align="justify">(e) "ordinary wages for the month" means the amount of

  remuneration due or granted wholly or exclusively in respect of employment during that

  month and payable before the due date for the payment of contribution for that

  month."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">All CPF contributions must be paid "not later than 14 days after

the end of the month in respect of which the contributions are payable" as required

under reg 2 of the CPF Regulations (1987).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.    The employees concerned in this case were paid a

fixed monthly salary in respect of which no dispute arises. They were also paid

commissions depending on whether they met the sales target set for them by the company.

The plaintiff says that the commissions do not depend on collections but on invoices

generated by the employee. Therefore, it takes the view that any commission due is easily

computable at the end of each month and should therefore form part of the ordinary wages

of the employee. If that is right, then the total contributions to the CPF, including the

variable component (the commissions), is subject to the maximum of 36% from the employee

(up to a maximum of $2,160) and 20% (up to a maximum of $1,200) from the employer - these

amounts are those payable at the material time. The figures and percentages may vary from

time to time. On the other hand, if the variable component is regarded as "additional

wages", which, in the opinion of the Board, it is, then additional contributions are

required to be made from the "additional wages". The additional contributions

are not subject to the maximum prescribed for contributions from the "ordinary

wages".</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.    According to Christopher Yeo, as at 1 July 1996

the Board accepted that the variable component is part of "ordinary wages". On 4

August 2000 the plaintiff's records from 1997 to 2000 were called for as part of the

Board's "periodic checks". The plaintiff's then Finance Manager was summoned to

produce various documents and answer queries by the Board. Eventually, the Board wrote by

letter dated 15 November 2000 to the plaintiff stating that the "commission payments

should be treated as "Ordinary Wages". However, on 22 January 2001, the Board

wrote to the plaintiff stating that the plaintiff had not made correct contributions to

the CPF for their employees for the period between October 1998 and July 2000 and

re-assessed the commission payments to be "additional wages". A sum of $13,728

was demanded by the Board as additional payment. This amount was subsequently revised to

$12,048 after an exchange of correspondence between the board and the plaintiff's

solicitors. The plaintiff disputes the view taken by the Board and so it paid the amount

under protest. It also paid certain sums being interest for late payment (also under

protest). These payments were demanded and paid in respect of a single employee (Anne

Seow). On 28 June 2001 the Board demanded payment of additional sums for similar reason in

respect of three more employees of the plaintiff. A sum of $98,530 was demanded and paid

under protest. On 15 October 2001 the Board revised the amount to $100,221 and the

plaintiff paid the balance of $1,691, again under protest. Fearing that the Board may

reject the payment and commence criminal prosecution the plaintiff made this application

on 19 October 2001. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.    The application was made by way of an Originating

Summons in which the plaintiff seeks a determination by this court as to whether the

variable component of the four employee's remuneration ought to be classified as

"ordinary wages" and not "additional wages", and at the same time,

prayed for a declaration that the plaintiff and its four employees are entitled to a

refund of the payment made under protest. The Board applied through its solicitors to

strike out this Originating Summons on the ground that it was misconceived because the

application ought to be made as an O 53 proceedings. The application to strike out was

dismissed by the Deputy Registrar and the Board appealed. The appeal before a

judge-in-chambers was dismissed on 15 April 2002. The Board declined to appeal further but

its counsel Mr. Pereira maintained that the procedure is wrong and took it as a

preliminary objection before me at the hearing of the Originating Summons. Mr. Dylan for

the plaintiff, not surprisingly, responded by claiming that this objection is <i>res

judicata </i>and that the issue had been raised an disposed. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.    Counsel for the Board, Mr. Pereira, made a strong

submission on the Or. 53 point as follows. The Board was established as a statutory body

under the CPF Act. The different rates of contributions as well as the different types of

wages are prescribed in the First Schedule which may be amended from time to time by the

Minister. The contributions are paid into a fund administered by the Board. The fund and

contributions to it are administered by the Board; and in this regard, any objection or

challenge to the Board's decisions relating to the administration of the fund or the

contributions must be made to the Board. In the event that the person objecting is still

dissatisfied with the Board's decision, he may appeal where statutory provision is made

for appeals. In this case, there is no provision for appeal under the CPF Act. Hence, in

his view, a dissatisfied person is left with only one alternative, namely, to apply under

O 53 for leave to issue an order for certiorari to quash the decision of the Board, or a

mandamus order to compel the Board to perform a specific act (such as reimbursing money

paid). By s 58(d) and (e) of the Act, non compliance with the regulations or rules under

the Act, or the failure to make payment, is an offence under the Act. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.    Mr. Pereira submitted that the functions of the

Board are determined by the Minister under the power conferred upon him by the Act and as

such the court will not ordinarily interfere with those functions, and will, in any case,

do so only by way of judicial review. Hence, the proper procedure is to commence an O 53

proceeding. The courts, he submitted, do not oversee the administrative functions of a

public body in any other way. An action of this nature in respect of a private

organization would be directed at the organization's servant or agent and the liability of

the organization is vicarious in nature. In the case of a public body, the act of any

agent of the public body is an act of the public body directly, and, in the words of the

Court of Appeal in <i>Seah Hong Say (trading as Seah Heng Construction Co) v Housing

Development Board</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=6651&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1993] 1 SLR 222</a>, 225, "… in so doing [the court] reviews

not the substantive decision in any case, but the decision-making process". The

specific nature of the claim in <i>Seah's</i> case is entirely different, but the basic

principle is no different. In this case, the Board had made a determination as to the

payment of CPF contributions in respect of the salaries of four of the plaintiff's

employees. Mr. Pereira takes the view that the conduct of the Board in this case was

"quasi-judicial" in character. This term has been defined in <i>Judicial Review

of Administrative Action</i>, 5<sup>th</sup> ed, de Smith, Woolf &amp; Jowell, page 1008

as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"In administrative law this term may have any one of three

  meanings. It may describe a function that is partly judicial and partly administrative -

  e.g. the making of a compulsory purchase order (a discretionary or administrative act)

  preceded by the holding of a judicial-type local inquiry and the consideration of

  objections. It may, alternatively, describe the "judicial" element in a

  composite function; holding an inquiry and considering objections in respect of a

  compulsory purchase order are thus 'quasi-judicial' acts. Or it may describe the nature of

  a discretionary act itself where the actor's discretion is not fettered."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Counsel takes the view that even if this court were to decide that the

demand for payment was wrong and issues a declaration as prayed for by the plaintiff, the

court cannot overrule the action of the Minister under a private proceeding.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7.    Mr. Dylan, counsel for the plaintiff, referred me

to <i>Chin Hong Oon Ronny v Tanah Merah Country Club</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=63471&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2002] 3 SLR 226</a> for the

proposition that the Originating Summons is an acceptable mode of proceedings because in

that case, the objection that it was not was overruled by the court. I have absolutely no

disagreement with the court’s ultimate decision on the merits of that case, but I am

not certain that the O 53 point made there is relevant in the present case. That was a

private law dispute between a private individual and his club, and presumably contractual

rules apply. In that case, the issue hinged on the correctness of the club’s decision

in suspending the club’s privileges to the plaintiff. Although the court there held

that it was not an O 53 case, it nevertheless applied administrative law principles, see

page 238:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"I turn next to the plaintiff’s complaint that there had been

  non-compliance with the rules of natural justice. The position at law is, the function of

  the court in relation to the proceedings of clubs is a supervisory one and confined to the

  examination of the decision-making process, i.e. whether the rules of natural justice had

  been observed and whether the decision was honestly reached. Its function is <i>not</i> to

  review the evidence and the correctness of the decision itself (see the Court of

  Appeal’s decision in <i>Singapore Amateur Athletics Association v Haron bin Mundir </i>[1994]   1 SLR 47)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8.    The present case has reached me in the unusual

circumstances that I have set out above. Although I can see some merits in the submission

of Mr. Pereira, counsel for the Board, that this ought to be an O 53 proceedings, the fact

of the matter is that Mr. Pereira had not exhausted his avenue of appeal (to the Court of

Appeal) and the issue having been ventilated before another High Court judge, must be

considered <i>res judicata</i>. I do not think that I am now at liberty to say that this

application ought to be dismissed on the ground that it came to me by the wrong path, and

so it will not be necessary for me to address the question whether this ought to be

commenced by way of an Or. 53 proceeding.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9.    Mr. Pereira then raised his second objection,

namely that this application is an appeal through the backdoor when the Act makes no

provision for an appeal to the courts. It has long been recognised that a right of appeal

is a statutory right. See <i>Healey v Minister of Health</i> [1955] 1 QB 221, 232. The

present proceedings were instituted because the plaintiff disputes the Board's decision

that certain commissions paid by the plaintiff to its employees were "additional

wages". It is accepted that the basis for the dispute lies in the different

interpretation of the same words in the CPF Act. The question is, whether the commencement

of these proceedings constitutes an appeal? A plaintiff is entitled to assert its right by

disputing an alleged legal obligation. In such cases the court shall be the arbiter as to

whether there is or is not such an obligation. In this regard, I do not agree that this

application is in fact an appeal by the "back-door". Drawing a line between such

cases and cases in which a party is in fact making an attempt to launch an appeal where no

such right exists, is a fine one; but in this case I would lean in favour of holding that

the application for a determination as to whether the Board had acted within the legal

limits is not an appeal.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10.    I shall now express my view as to whether the

variable commissions in this case come under the definition of "additional

wages" or "ordinary wages", that is, on the merits of this case. Mr.

Pereira's argument for the Board runs as follows. The definition in the First Schedule

(reproduced above) says that additional wages "means any wages other than ordinary

wages". "Ordinary wages", in turn, is defined to mean remuneration due and

payable before the due date for the payment of contribution for that month".

Regulation 2(1) spells out that the time for such payment shall not be later than 14 days

from the end of the month. Hence, Mr. Pereira argued, the variable commission, though

computable at the end of each month but not payable within the 14 days period, must be

"additional wages". </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11.    Mr. Dylan for the plaintiff replied. It will be

useful to first note the relevant term of the employment contract which provided as

follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"Our sales manager has an annual compensation plan of S$150,000 of

  which 55% is paid as retainer and the remaining 45% is paid based on the value of his

  sales performance as follow</p>
<p align="justify">(a)    Fixed base-salary = S$82,500 per annum. Which is

  equivalent to S$6,875 per month. We understand that this is to be treated as ORDINARY

  WAGES, hence, the total CPF contribution from both employer &amp; employee would be capped

  at the ceiling payment of S$2,400 (40% x S$6,000)</p>
<p align="justify">(b)    Variable target income = S$67,500 (which is 45% @

  S$150K)</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The variable portion is given in the form of commission payment and is

    payable on a monthly basis. The percentage payment is based on the value of total billing

    for the month, hence, if the total billing (sales) for the month is S$200,000, the sales

    manager will earn a total commission of S$5,750."</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">However, it was not disputed that the commissions though calculable

monthly, were not paid as computed but adjusted according to the actual payments received

by the plaintiff from its customers. Mr. Dylan disagrees with the Board's view that such

payments were in fact apportioned retrospectively. It may be noted in passing, that one of

the plaintiff's employees, Mr. Wong Jak, deposed that they do not know how much commission

they (the employees) were entitled to at the end of each month. They were informed only

after they receive the plaintiff's "Compensation Plan Financial" statement.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12.    The issue before me was whether the variable

component of the plaintiff's salary package for its employees should be considered

"additional wages" or "ordinary wages". Ordinary wages are

remuneration that are due or granted wholly or exclusively in respect of employment during

that month and <i>payable before the due date for the payment of contributions for that

month</i>. In the context of the CPF Act, I do not see the emphasized words as meaning

payable at any other time. The word payable means what it must mean in ordinary usage in

the context of the above passage. Confusion may arise when the word "payable" in

the context of the Act begins to assume an ambiguous meaning which it must do if I accept

Mr. Dylan’s submission – that "payable" includes deferred payments. I

am, therefore, inclined towards the Board's view. I am also inclined to concur with the

decision in <i>Trevor Griffiths v Oceanroutes (SEA) Pte Ltd</i> S.952 of 1995 (unreported)

in which the definition of "additional wages" in <i>CCH/SNEF Singapore

Employers' Handbook</i> was accepted. In that handbook, "additional wages" is

understood to mean "any wages other than ordinary wages. For example, annual bonus,

incentive payments and other payments made at intervals of more than one month."</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13.    Finally, I should comment on Mr. Dylan’s

submission that the variable commission was "payable" within the meaning of

"ordinary wages" because the deferment clause in the employment contracts in

question is a "condition defeasant/subsequent since the duty/liability to pay the

variable commission component has already arisen when the sales revenue has been billed,

but this duty/liability is deferred or discharged when the plaintiff exercises [its]

rights under the deferment clause". He argued that since the plaintiff had not

exercised its discretion to defer payment, the variable commission component remains

"payable" monthly. But, I think that this is precisely what takes it outside the

definition of "ordinary wages". The term "payable" in the Act must

signify that payment due <i>will</i> be paid within that period.</p>
<p xmlns="">14.    For the above reasons, I dismiss the plaintiff's applications

under this Originating Summons with costs to be taxed if not agreed. </p>
