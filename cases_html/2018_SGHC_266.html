The charge states that in a motor trailer bearing license plate number JJQ 4179 (“the Trailer”) at 2.20pm on 4 December 2015, at Woodlands Checkpoint, Singapore, Shah imported three packets of granular powdery substance, which was analysed and found to contain not less than 54.69 grams of diamorphine.

On that day, Boss called Shah and informed him that he would be giving Shah’s mobile phone number to another person. An unknown Indian male (“the first unknown Indian male”) then called Shah and agreed to meet Shah at a place in Malaysia called “Pandan R&amp;R”. Shah drove the Trailer to “Pandan R&amp;R” and met the first unknown Indian male there. The first unknown Indian male was driving a white Perodua Viva car. At the location, the first unknown Indian male opened the Trailer’s passenger door and threw a red plastic bag towards Shah. He then closed the door and left. After this, Shah drove the Trailer containing the red plastic bag into Singapore.

After much persuasion, Shah agreed to do so and drove the Trailer to a bus stop near Giant Hypermart in Tampoi, Malaysia (“the Giant bus stop”). Boss told Shah to wait for two persons there. At the Giant bus stop, another unknown Indian male (“the second unknown Indian male”) riding a red and black motorcycle approached the Trailer. The second unknown Indian male opened the Trailer’s passenger door and placed a red plastic bag (“A1”) inside a compartment under the passenger seat before leaving.

Shah stated that after he had cleared the Woodlands Checkpoint that day, he travelled to Woodlands Avenue 6 to unload certain pre-cast concrete slabs that he was also delivering to a construction site. He was then told by Boss to wait outside the construction site. Throughout this period, Boss called him repeatedly to ask for his location. Shah “felt really uncomfortable” because he thought there was “something fishy about the red plastic bag that [he was] holding”. He then “quickly put the red plastic bag under a tree nearby” before standing about a metre away from the red plastic bag. Eventually, about 40 minutes later, a Malay male showed up. Shah picked up the bag and handed it over to the Malay male.

</div> According to the Defence, Shah did not know that A1 contained diamorphine because he did not check A1.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Therefore, the key issue in the present case is whether Shah had knowledge that he was importing the diamorphine contained within the A1 packets into Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Having considered all the available evidence, I find that Shah was wilfully blind to the fact that he was importing diamorphine into Singapore and this amounts to actual knowledge that the said drugs were diamorphine.

However, if he does in fact turn a blind eye, that could, on the facts, be taken to be wilful blindness on his part. If so, this would be tantamount to actual knowledge in law…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">125 The second central principle is that <span class="font-italic">suspicion</span> is legally sufficient to ground a finding of wilful blindness provided the relevant factual matrix warrants such a finding <span class="font-italic">and</span> the accused deliberately decides to turn a blind eye. <span class="font-italic">However</span>, that suspicion must, as Lord Scott perceptively points out in <span class="font-italic">Manifest Shipping</span> (see at [113] above), “be firmly grounded and targeted on specific facts”. Mere “untargeted or speculative suspicion” is insufficient … a <span class="font-italic">low </span>level of suspicion premised on a factual matrix that would <span class="font-italic">not</span> lead a person to make further inquiries would be insufficient to ground a finding of wilful blindness where the person concerned did not in fact make further inquiries. What is of vital significance, in our view, is the substance of the matter which (in turn) depends heavily on the <span class="font-italic">precise </span><span class="font-italic">facts</span> before the court. It is equally important to note that in order for wilful blindness to be established, the appropriate level of suspicion (as just discussed) is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition, inasmuch as that level of suspicion <span class="font-italic">must then lead to a refusal to investigate further</span>, thus resulting in “blind eye knowledge” …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">126 That having been said, the requirement of <span class="font-italic">suspicion </span>is nevertheless a vital (and, indeed, threshold) one. So, for example, if the accused makes merely token inquiries because he suspects that making more substantive inquiries might lead him to the truth which he does not want to know, that is wilful blindness. If the factual matrix was such that the accused ought to have been suspicious, the court must then consider the accused’s reasons for not making further inquiries. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">127 We would venture to state a third central principle. … it is clear that wilful blindness, being (as we have seen) the equivalent of actual knowledge, is distinct from recklessness which, theoretically at least, falls short of actual knowledge. Indeed, wilful blindness necessarily entails an element of <span class="font-italic">deliberate</span> action inasmuch as to the extent that the person concerned has <span class="font-italic">a clear suspicion </span>that something is amiss but then embarks on a deliberate decision not to make further inquiries in order to avoid confirming what the actual situation is, such a decision is necessarily a <span class="font-italic">deliberate</span> one. …wilful blindness is a combination of suspicion <span class="font-italic">coupled with a deliberate </span>decision<span class="font-italic"> </span>not to make further inquiries, whereas the recklessness that has been referred to by Prof Williams refers to recklessness in terms of the accused’s conduct in the context of circumstances <span class="font-italic">which would not otherwise have aroused suspicion </span>on the part of the accused. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 <span class="font-italic">Tan Kiam Peng</span> thus makes clear that wilful blindness is made out when suspicion which exceeds a particular threshold is combined with a deliberate decision not to make further inquiries in order to avoid the truth which one does not wish to know. The appropriate level of suspicion is an issue which turns on the precise facts of each case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ta</span><span class="font-italic">n Kiam Peng</span> also stated at [130] that if an accused already knows that he is carrying controlled drugs and he chooses to take an enormous risk by proceeding without establishing the true nature of the drugs, this would constitute wilful blindness. It is not disputed that Shah knew that A1 contained controlled drugs (see [11] above), and the only point of contention is that he did not have knowledge of the specific drug he was carrying because he did not check A1. This fact alone puts Shah’s conduct squarely within the definition of wilful blindness as set out in <span class="font-italic">Tan</span><span class="font-italic"> Kiam Peng</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 An examination of the precise factual matrix of the present case fortifies this conclusion. The overall circumstances of the first and second delivery were highly suspicions. Shah’s conduct in the face of these circumstances was a deliberate decision to turn a blind eye to the glaringly suspicious nature of the enterprise and amounted to wilful blindness. I highlight four points that demonstrate this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 First, Boss offered Shah a large amount of money to make an ostensibly innocuous delivery of “books and chocolates”. Shah testified that as a trailer driver, he would earn RM120 per trip for every delivery of goods made for his company.

</div> The sum of RM1000 per delivery that Boss offered to Shah was more than eight times the usual amount that Shah would earn per trip as a trailer driver for his company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Second, Boss himself was a highly suspicious character. Shah testified that he had only met Boss when Boss called him one week before his arrest. Shah also did not know how Boss got hold of his number, and Boss repeatedly called Shah many times in an attempt to convince him to do a delivery. Disturbingly for Shah, Boss knew intricate details about Shah’s family circumstances, despite being completely unknown to Shah at the time.

</div> This initial rejection indicates that Shah was well aware, even at this early stage, that the circumstances surrounding the deliveries were suspicious.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Third, the manner in which the first delivery was conducted, had, by Shah’s own admission, raised significant suspicions and made him feel uncomfortable on its legality  (see [13] and [16] above). To put the matter into perspective, this was plainly not a normal delivery job. It involved unknown items given to Shah by unknown persons. Shah was not told who the items were to be delivered to, but was only told to wait at specific locations for unknown persons to show up to collect the goods. Throughout the entire period, Shah was repeatedly hounded by Boss, who kept asking Shah for his location.

</div> Shah was so perturbed by nature of the first delivery that he put the red plastic bag under a tree and waited a distance away from the plastic bag.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Fourth, the second delivery was clearly of a similarly clandestine nature as the first delivery. It was the same suspicious character requesting for Shah’s assistance in a similar delivery. Worse still, Shah managed to confirm his suspicions that the second delivery was illegal, by checking B1 and realising it was cannabis. At this point, it was plainly obvious to Shah that Boss’s assurances that the goods were merely “books and chocolates” was an outright lie and that A1 was exceedingly likely to contain controlled drugs as well. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Despite all this, Shah chose not check the contents of A1, even though he had the opportunity to do so (see [16] above). He continued to bring both A1 and B1 into Singapore. Shah’s refusal to check A1 under these circumstances, which would have driven any reasonable person to examine the contents of A1 before bringing them into Singapore, entailed a deliberate decision by Shah to turn a blind eye to the situation.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 For all the reasons given above, I find that Shah was wilfully blind to the fact that A1 contained diamorphine and hence he possessed the requisite level of knowledge for the charge to be made out. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In any case, I find that the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA applies and the Defence has failed to rebut the presumption. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 As a preliminary, I note that the Defence makes the argument that the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA does not apply because “knowledge” is required for possession within meaning of s 18(2), and because Shah “did not get to see the contents of the parcels that were handed to him”, there was no “knowledge”.

The first is the accused’s knowledge that he was in control or possession of an object. The second is the accused’s knowledge that the object in question was a controlled drug or contained controlled drugs. The former is a critical part of proving the element of possession (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Ng Pen Tine and Another </span>[2009] SGHC 230 at [103]), whereas the latter is only relevant to the knowledge of the nature of the drug (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, part of the second element in the present charge). To raise a reasonable doubt on the former, the Defence could, for example, raise evidence which suggests that the object was slipped into the accused’s bag without his knowledge (see, in the context of rebutting the presumption of possession under s 18(1) of the MDA, <span class="font-italic">Obeng</span><span class="font-italic"> Comfort v Public Prosecutor</span> [2017] 1 SLR 633 (“<span class="font-italic">Obeng</span>”) at [35]). However, in the present case, the Defence’s contention is simply that Shah did not know what type of drug was inside A1. This does not pertain to the knowledge that Shah was in control or possession of A1 and its contents, but rather as to whether he knew of the nature of what was inside A1.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 If knowledge that the object in question was a controlled drug was required as part of the element of possession, it would render s 18(2) entirely otiose. Section 18(2) of the MDA entitles the court to presume that the accused had knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug. If possession for the purposes of s 18(2) requires proof of knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug, then the provision would require proof of the very fact that it allows the court to presume. It is well established that generally, parliament does not legislate in vain and the court should therefore give significance to every word in an enactment (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General</span> [2017] 2 SLR 850 at [38]). Hence, I do not think that the Defence’s arguments on this point can be sustained.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In any event, I note that within the Statement of Agreed Facts, it is stated that:

I shall explain why this is so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Gobi a/l </span><span class="font-italic">Avedian</span> [2018] SGCA 72 (“<span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>”), the Court of Appeal reiterated some key principles in relation to rebutting the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA at [32] to [35]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">32 The starting point is what this Court said in <span class="font-italic">Obeng</span> about the effect of s 18(2). The presumption in s 18(2) operates to vest an accused person with knowledge of the nature of the drug which he is in possession of and to rebut this, <span class="font-italic">he must give an account of what he thought it was</span>. Since the respondent was in possession of the drugs found in the motorcycle, the law presumes that he knew the said drugs were diamorphine.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">33 Similarly, as this Court said in <span class="font-italic">Obeng</span>, an accused person would not be able to rebut the presumption as to knowledge by merely claiming that he did not know the proper name of the drug that he was asked to carry. The law also does not require him to know the scientific or the chemical name of the drug or the effects that the drug could bring about. <span class="font-italic">Since he knew that he was carrying illegal drugs and wished to show that he did not know they were </span><span class="font-italic">diamorphine, then it was incumbent on him to tell the Court what he thought or believed the drugs were</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">35 In order to rebut the presumption in s 18(2), which vests the respondent with the knowledge that the drugs imported were diamorphine<span class="font-italic">, it is not enough for the respondent, who knew that he was transporting illegal drugs, to state merely that he did not know what sort of drugs they were or that he </span><span class="font-italic">had never heard of diamorphine or heroin</span>. <span class="font-italic">If he did not know what </span><span class="font-italic">diamorphine was, he could not possibly claim that the drugs he was carrying were not diamorphine.</span> Similarly, he would not be able to say whether diamorphine was a dangerous drug or not (according to his definition of dangerous drugs). The presumption in s 18(2) is placed in the MDA precisely to address the difficulty of proving an accused person’s subjective state of knowledge with regard to any specific type of drug. It also takes care of the case of a trafficker or an importer of drugs who simply does not bother or does not want to know what drugs or even what goods he is going to carry. Allowing the respondent in these circumstances to rebut the presumption of knowledge by merely stating that he did not know what drugs he was carrying save that they were not dangerous drugs and therefore could not be diamorphine would, as we mentioned in <span class="font-italic">Obeng</span> (at [39]), make the presumption of knowledge all bark and no bite. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In <span class="font-italic">Gobi </span>the Prosecution was appealing an acquittal on a charge relating to the importation of diamorphine. The accused’s defence was that he believed the drugs he had brought in were “chocolate drugs” that were illegal but not “serious drugs”, and they would have occasioned only a fine or a light sentence if he was caught carrying them (see <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> at [31]). Applying the abovementioned principles to the facts, the Court of Appeal thus held that the accused failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge. This was because he did not bother to find out exactly what he was tasked to carry across state boundaries into Singapore, despite knowing that they were illegal drugs. He did not know the name of the drugs that he was to carry and he therefore could not possibly verify whether the drugs were dangerous or serious drugs which could lead to the death penalty or long term imprisonment (see <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> at [36] to [37]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Based on the principles laid out by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> as set out above, the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2) of the MDA vests the accused with the knowledge that he knew the nature of the specific controlled drug he was charged for importing. Where an accused admits that he knows that he had imported illegal drugs, but wishes to rebut the presumption of knowledge, he must prove on the balance of probabilities that he did not have knowledge that the nature of the illegal drugs in his possession was the specific type of controlled drug as stated in the charge. This means that the accused must prove that he believed that the drug he imported was not that specific controlled drug for which he was charged.  In order to do this, the accused must state exactly what he believed he was carrying and provide reasons for his belief. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>, the accused’s case was that he did not believe that the illegal drugs he had imported were dangerous drugs, which the accused defined as types of drugs which would entail a heavy sentence if he was caught carrying them. Because his definition of what he believed the drug contained excluded the drug for which he was caught (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it excluded diamorphine because that was a drug that would entail a heavy sentence if he was caught carrying them), the Court of Appeal thus had to consider the veracity of this alleged belief.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In the present case, Shah, unlike the accused in <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>, has not even alleged that he believed the drugs in A1 to be drugs other than diamorphine. The Defence’s position is that “Shah honestly did not know that the contents were heroin though he only knew what cannabis (ganja) looked like”.

</div> The Defence also states that Shah did “admit in cross-examination that after he saw the contents of [B1], he did think that [A1] may also contain cannabis or ganja”.

</div>
</div> Hence, Shah’s case is that although he knew A1 contained controlled drugs and  he speculated that it might have been cannabis, he did not in fact know what type of controlled drug was actually inside A1. However, this does necessarily mean that Shah knew that the drug inside A1 was <span class="font-italic">not</span> diamorphine because the definition of a controlled drug is wide enough to include diamorphine. His knowledge that A1 contains a controlled drug therefore extends to knowing that A1 could perhaps also contain diamorphine. In other words, Shah was fully cognizant of the fact that he could not exclude the possibility that A1 might in fact contain diamorphine and not cannabis. If so, the presumption of his knowledge of the actual nature of the drug in A1 is not rebutted. It would be a different matter if Shah’s case is that he honestly believed that A1 contained cannabis and not diamorphine, because if it is proved on a balance of probabilities that he in fact believed that A1 contained <span class="font-italic">only</span> cannabis and nothing else, this necessarily implies that he believed that A1 did not in fact contain diamorphine. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 On this basis alone, I find that Shah has failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA, because his case taken at its highest does not disclose a belief sufficient to rebut the presumption. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In any event, leaving aside the abovementioned difficulties with Shah’s case, I am of the view that Shah has not rebutted the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA because based on a consideration of the circumstances and facts listed above at [26]–[32], there is insufficient evidence to prove on the balance of probabilities that Shah did not have knowledge that the controlled drug in his possession was diamorphine.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Therefore, I find that Shah possessed actual knowledge that he was importing diamorphine. I also find that the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA applies and Shah has failed to rebut the presumption. As the first element of the charge is not in dispute and the second element of the charge has been proven, I find that the Prosecution has proved its case against Shah beyond a reasonable doubt, and I convict Shah accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I shall hear submissions on sentence from the parties.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chan Seng Onn  <br/>Judge  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Andrew Tan and Michelle Lu (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Public Prosecutor;<br/>Amolat Singh (Amolat &amp; Partners) and Lau Kah Hee (Derrick Wong &amp; Lim BC LLP) for the accused.<br/></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
