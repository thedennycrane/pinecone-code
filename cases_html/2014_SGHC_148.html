<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Three applications</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       By the three applications before me, the
                    plaintiffs seek to set aside an award issued in favour of the defendants by a
                    three-member tribunal in an arbitration administered by the Singapore
                    International Arbitration Centre. I shall refer to the award as a single award,
                    although in truth it comprises a partial award issued on 9 May 2012 as amended
                    by a further partial award issued on 15 June 2012 and as further amended by a
                    memorandum of corrections issued on 5 July 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       To maintain the confidentiality attached to the
                    arbitration, the plaintiffs in each application applied for and secured, without
                    objection from the defendants, an order under s 22 of the International
                    Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the IAA”) that the
                    proceedings in each application be heard otherwise than in open court and that
                    the court’s electronic file in each application be sealed to prevent
                    public inspection. To maintain that confidentiality, I have used pseudonyms in
                    this judgment to refer to the parties and to any names by which they or their
                    arbitration may be identified. I have also converted all sums denominated in
                    local currency into the approximate equivalent in US dollars at a representative
                    exchange rate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The arbitration arises from the liquidation of a
                    company I shall call the Corporation. The Corporation was the largest regional
                    producer of a product I shall call Mithril. It carried on business in a country
                    I shall call Moria, with its principal production facility in a city I shall
                    call Erebor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In the course of the Corporation’s
                    liquidation, all of the following parties entered into an Asset Purchase
                    Agreement (“the APA”): (a) the liquidator, (b) the
                    Corporation’s secured creditors, (c) the Corporation’s shareholders
                    and (d) the defendants. Under the APA, the defendants agreed to purchase certain
                    assets from the Corporation. Some of these assets were encumbered with security
                    interests in favour of the Corporation’s creditors. In exchange for these
                    secured creditors’ agreement to the sale, and as part of the consideration
                    for the assets they purchased, the defendants agreed to issue two notes for the
                    benefit of the secured creditors. The terms of the notes were set out in an
                    agreement between the defendants and the secured creditors known as the Omnibus
                    Agreement (“the OMNA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       At the time the parties entered into the APA,
                    the Corporation owed a large amount of unpaid tax to the municipal authorities
                    of Erebor. One of the conditions precedent to the closing of the transactions
                    under the APA was the approval by the municipal authorities of a deferred
                    payment scheme for this unpaid tax. This condition precedent was eventually
                    satisfied when the liquidator delivered to the defendants what the parties
                    referred to as a “tax amnesty agreement” (or “the
                    TAA”). The TAA was liable to be revoked if any taxes in relation to the
                    Corporation’s assets, including the assets which the defendants purchased
                    under the APA, were not paid on time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The transactions under the APA closed in 2004.
                    Very soon thereafter, the defendants, the liquidator and the secured creditors
                    of the Corporation became embroiled in disputes with the municipal authorities
                    over the taxes that had to be paid in relation the Corporation’s assets,
                    including assets which the defendants had purchased under the APA. The TAA was
                    eventually revoked in 2006 because of the failure to pay certain taxes on
                    time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In 2008, the defendants commenced arbitration
                    against a number of entities. In its final incarnation, the defendants’
                    case in the arbitration was that the liquidator, the secured creditors and the
                    shareholders of the Corporation were in breach of the APA because they had
                    failed to deliver to the defendants clean title to the assets which the
                    defendants had purchased under the APA. The defendants alleged that title was
                    not clean because the assets were subject to a tax lien. The defendants also
                    claimed that the liquidator, the secured creditors and the shareholders were
                    jointly and severally liable to indemnify the defendants for the failure of the
                    secured creditors, in breach of their obligations under the APA, to settle
                    certain property claims (“the Lost Land Claims”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The tribunal agreed with the defendants. It
                    awarded the defendants US$80m as damages for a lost opportunity to earn profits
                    and an indemnity of about US$23.7m in respect of the Lost Land Claims. It also
                    declared that the defendants were entitled to suspend performance of their
                    payment obligations under the two notes (see [4] above) without consequence for
                    so long as the plaintiffs remained in breach of their obligation to deliver
                    clean title to the assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Dissatisfied with the award, the plaintiffs now
                    apply to set it aside on two grounds:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     That they were unable to present
                        their case in the arbitration within the meaning of Art 34(2)(a)(ii) of the
                        UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration 1985 (“the
                        Model Law”) and/or that their rights were prejudiced by a breach of
                        the rules of natural justice in connection with the making of the award
                        within the meaning of s 24(b) of the IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     That the award deals with disputes not
                        contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to the
                        arbitration and/or contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the
                        submission to the arbitration, contrary to Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model
                        Law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The plaintiff in Originating Summons No. [L]
                    is the Corporation’s liquidator. The liquidator is represented by a team
                    from WongPartnership LLP led by Mr Alvin Yeo SC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The plaintiffs in Originating Summons No. [M]
                    are 11 out of 24 secured creditors of the Corporation. For convenience, I shall
                    refer to these 11 parties collectively as “the secured creditors”.
                    They are represented by a team from Drew &amp; Napier LLC led by Mr Davinder
                    Singh SC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The first to third plaintiffs in Originating
                    Summons No. [N] are three investment funds which purchased on the secondary
                    market the notes issued by the defendants (see [4] above) from some of the
                    original 24 secured creditors of the Corporation. I shall refer to these three
                    parties collectively as “the Funds”. The fourth plaintiff in this
                    originating summons is the sub-custodian and agent for the Funds. These
                    plaintiffs are represented by a team from Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP led by Mr
                    Philip Jeyaretnam SC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The two defendants in all three applications
                    are special purpose vehicles incorporated under the laws of Moria. They are
                    subsidiaries of a company I shall call Galaxy, incorporated under the laws of
                    the Isle of Man. The defendants are represented by a team from Rajah &amp; Tann
                    LLP led by Mr Andre Yeap SC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties’ cases in a nutshell and my decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     A number of the plaintiffs’ complaints
                    about the award are common to all of the plaintiffs. The remaining complaints
                    are specific to a particular set of plaintiffs. It suffices for now to list the
                    plaintiffs’ seven principal complaints about the tribunal’s decision
                    without attributing specific complaints to specific plaintiffs:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     The tribunal failed to consider the
                        liquidator's submissions, arguments and evidence in support of his case that
                        the obligation to deliver clean title to the assets under the APA was
                        qualified to the extent of the TAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     The tribunal failed to consider the secured
                        creditors’ and the liquidator’s submissions, arguments and
                        evidence in support of their separate cases that it was the defendants
                        – and not the liquidator – who were responsible for the TAA
                        being revoked.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)     The tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction by determining that the defendants
                        suffered damage in the form of a loss of an opportunity to earn profits as a
                        result of the plaintiffs’ breaches of the APA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_d"></a>(d)     As an alternative to (c), the secured
                        creditors and the liquidator were unable to present their separate cases on
                        whether the defendants had suffered damage in the form of a loss of an
                        opportunity to earn profits as a result of the plaintiffs’ breaches of
                        the APA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_e"></a>(e)     The
                        tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction by suspending the defendants’
                        payment obligations under the two notes.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_f"></a>(f)     The tribunal failed to consider the secured
                        creditors' submissions, arguments and evidence in support of their case in
                        relation to the Lost Land Claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_g"></a>(g)     The tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction when it held that
                        the Funds – who were merely purchasers of the notes in the secondary
                        market – were liable to the defendants for breaches of the APA;
                        further and in the alternative, the tribunal did not give the Funds an
                        opportunity to present their case as to why they were not, as mere assignees
                        of the notes, liable under the APA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The defendants’ response, in short, is
                    to deny that any of the grounds for setting aside the award have been
                    established. They argue that the tribunal considered and rejected the
                    plaintiffs’ separate cases on these main issues, leaving no basis on which
                    to set aside the award. The defendants also maintain that the tribunal did have
                    the jurisdiction to determine all of the issues which it did. Further, the
                    defendants contend that the Funds submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of
                    the tribunal voluntarily and without qualification, and therefore cannot be
                    heard to complain about the result.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Having considered the parties’ written
                    and oral submissions and the material that the parties have placed before me, I
                    allow all three applications and set aside the award in its entirety. I now set
                    out my reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     As I have alluded to above, at the heart of
                    the parties’ dispute is the question of how the existence of unpaid taxes
                    over the Corporation’s property sold to the defendants under the APA
                    affected the parties’ rights and obligations under the APA and,
                    separately, under the notes. Before I deal with that issue, however, it is
                    useful to flesh out the facts in a little more detail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Corporation goes into liquidation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In 1999, the Corporation filed a petition with
                    the Securities Commission of Moria (“the Commission”) seeking to
                    suspend payments on its liabilities. At that time, the Corporation operated a
                    plant in Erebor and owned assets in the city of Erebor as well as elsewhere in
                    Moria. Only the Corporation’s plant and assets in Erebor are relevant for
                    present purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Corporation then owed approximately
                    US$337m to its secured creditors. This debt was secured over certain of the
                    Corporation’s assets by a mortgage trust indenture executed in 1990. The
                    mortgaged assets included the Corporation’s Mithril plant in Erebor as
                    well as the movable equipment and some (but not all) of the real properties
                    which were used directly for the plant’s operations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In 2000, the Commission declared the
                    Corporation insolvent and placed it in liquidation, in one of the largest
                    liquidations in the history of Moria. Eventually, the liquidator took office and
                    the Corporation’s assets were transferred to him to hold as trustee. In
                    2001, the liquidator submitted a liquidation plan to the Commission. This plan
                    was subsequently approved in 2003. Under the plan, the liquidator grouped the
                    Corporation’s assets into two categories:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     “The Plant Assets”
                        comprising the Corporation’s assets. These are the assets which the
                        defendants eventually acquired under the APA; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     “The Retained Assets”
                        comprising all of the Corporation’s remaining
                assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Plant Assets were further grouped into two
                    sub-categories:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Mithril plant, machinery,
                        equipment and other items (“the Plant Non-Land Assets”);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     Four
                        parcels of land on which these assets were situated (“the Plant Land
                        Assets”). These four parcels of land were allocated “ten tax
                        declaration numbers”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Under the liquidation plan, the secured
                    creditors of the Corporation were to give up their rights under the existing
                    mortgage trust indenture in exchange for a new mortgage indenture. The new
                    indenture was to create security over the same property as the existing
                    indenture but would include two additional parcels of land. In exchange for the
                    new indenture, however, the secured creditors of the Corporation had to accept a
                    discount on their debt and had to waive their right to make claims against the
                    Retained Assets for any shortfall between the undiscounted amount of their debt
                    and the amount they received under the liquidation plan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The liquidation plan was designed to allow the
                    liquidator to pay off two different sets of creditors. The Plant Assets
                        (<em>ie</em>, the first group of the
                    Corporation’s assets) would be sold as an integral facility to a
                    prospective buyer so that the buyer could resume operations as soon as possible
                    after acquisition. The hope was that a sale in this manner would enable the
                    Plant Assets to fetch a better price in total than if its individual parts were
                    sold separately. The sale proceeds from the Plant Assets would then be applied
                    against the discounted debt due to the Corporation’s secured creditors.
                    The Retained Assets would be sold separately, with the proceeds applied against
                    the unsecured debts of the Corporation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Galaxy agrees to purchase the Plant Assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The liquidation plan was eventually approved
                    and the liquidator called a tender for the Plant Assets. Galaxy won the tender
                    in 2003. The liquidator, the secured creditors and the shareholders reached a
                    basic agreement with Galaxy on the terms of the sale of the Plant Assets. The
                    parties were keen to give Galaxy possession of the Plant Assets quickly so that
                    it could begin rehabilitating the plant and resume production as soon as
                    possible. The parties therefore entered into a memorandum of agreement
                    (“the MOA”) on 29 January 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The MOA was intended only to record the basic
                    terms and conditions of the parties’ agreement. The parties planned to
                    enter into a more comprehensive agreement later which was “to be
                    negotiated, executed, and implemented in good faith by the Parties in respect of
                    the … sale and purchase of the … [the Plant Assets], upon
                    substantially the same terms and conditions agreed upon by the Parties [in the
                    MOA]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Memorandum of Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Under s 2.2 of the MOA, Galaxy agreed to
                    acquire the Plant Assets with clean title except as provided in s 4.2(h).
                    Under s 4.2(h), the liquidator represented that the Plant Assets were
                    encumbered by, <em>inter alia</em>, “claims of
                    … the [Lorien]/[Celeborn] group, and the unpaid realty tax due on [the
                    Plant Assets], which may affect clean title over some or all of [the Plant
                    Assets]”. I refer to the separate claims of the Lorien/Celeborn group as
                    “the Lorien Claim” and “the Celeborn
                Claim”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Under s 3.2(a) of the MOA, the parties
                    agreed that the consideration for the Plant Assets would be approximately
                    US$300m. That consideration was to take the form of (i) an initial down-payment
                    of an equivalent of US$22m and (ii) the issuance of the two notes for the
                    equivalent of the remaining US$278m, payable by equal instalments over eight
                    years. Under s 3.2(b) of the MOA, the parties agreed that the initial
                    down-payment for the Plant Assets was to be paid to the liquidator who would
                    then pay the secured creditors and shareholders in accordance with an agreement
                    to be executed amongst them. It appears that the terms and conditions of the
                    notes were not yet finalised when the parties executed the MOA, as no <em>pro forma</em> notes were annexed to it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Under s 5.3(c) of the MOA, the liquidator
                    agreed that “[d]uring the effectivity of [the MOA]” (<em>ie</em>, so long as the MOA remained in place), the
                    liquidator would “apply for the waiver by all appropriate Governmental
                    Authority of all tax liabilities of [the Corporation] affecting any or all of
                    [the Plant Assets], including but not limited to the liability for income and/or
                    real estate taxes”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Section 9 of the MOA sets out the dispute
                    resolution provisions. It reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">DISPUTE RESOLUTION</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.1 Amicable Settlement</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Any dispute or controversy of any kind whatsoever arising between or among

                        connection with this [MOA] and also in all matters concerning the provisions
                        of this [MOA] and the performance of the obligations provided herein, shall

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The legislative body of Erebor passes the Tax Ordinance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     When the Corporation filed for insolvency with
                    the Commission in 1999, it owed substantial sums of taxes on its real property,
                    on its plant and on its machinery to the municipal authorities in Erebor.
                    Further taxes continued to accrue during the liquidation: <em>ie</em>, while the liquidation plan was formulated and approved and
                    thereafter. Thus, the Corporation owed real property taxes to Erebor in respect
                    of (i) the Plant Assets that were the subject of the MOA and (ii) the Retained
                    Assets which would remain with the liquidator. In addition, the failure of the
                    Corporation to pay these real property taxes on time meant that a large amount
                    of interest and penalties also continued to accrue on the unpaid
                taxes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     From the terms and conditions of the MOA
                    described above, it is clear that all of the parties were aware of these tax
                    liabilities. In fact, a few days after the parties signed the MOA, Galaxy asked
                    the liquidator to apply to Erebor to waive the unpaid taxes affecting the Plant
                    Assets or (although this was not strictly an obligation of the liquidator under
                    the MOA) to settle all such unpaid taxes if a waiver could not be
                    obtained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     AKP is a secured creditor of the Corporation
                    and is the first plaintiff in Originating Summons No. [M]. On 13 July 2004, AKP
                    wrote, on behalf of all secured creditors including itself, to the municipal
                    legislative body in Erebor (“the SP”). AKP emphasised to the SP,
                    among other things, the need to provide “a conducive and peaceful
                    investment environment” in order to facilitate the “successful
                    rehabilitation and operation” of [the Corporation’s Mithril plant]
                    which was a crucial pillar of the Erebor economy. AKP therefore asked the SP to
                    grant “a condonation and/or waiver … of the unpaid business and
                    property taxes affecting [the Plant Assets]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     On 28 July 2004, the liquidator followed up on
                    AKP’s request. Galaxy’s in-house counsel agreed to prepare a draft
                    resolution waiving the Corporation’s unpaid realty taxes. The liquidator
                    hoped that the SP would pass that draft into law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The draft resolution did not have the desired
                    effect on the SP. In fact, it had quite the opposite effect. On 3 August 2004,
                    the SP passed a resolution requiring Erebor’s city treasurer to levy
                    execution on all of the Corporation’s properties for unpaid taxes. The SP
                    drew the conclusion that the liquidator would have sufficient funds in hand to
                    pay the outstanding real property taxes in full as a result of the sale of the
                    Plant Assets to Galaxy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     On 7 September 2004, the SP had a change of
                    heart. It now passed the Tax Ordinance. The Tax Ordinance enabled Erebor until
                    31 December 2004 to grant tax relief to taxpayers who were in arrears (such as
                    the Corporation) by waiving accrued interest and penalties on their unpaid real
                    property taxes. Securing that waiver required the principal amount of all unpaid
                    taxes to be paid on 1 December 2004 or at any later time permitted by the city
                    treasurer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Any taxpayer who obtained tax relief under the
                    Tax Ordinance had to comply with the strict requirements of s 6 of the Tax
                    Ordinance and keep current on all tax falling due during the period of relief.
                    Section 6 provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">SECTION 6. Any taxpayer who incurs further delinquency in the payment of
                        their current real property taxes while still paying its real property tax
                        obligations due up to 2004 or its approved extended period, and failure to
                        comply with the terms and conditions on the granting of extension to pay
                        their basic real property tax delinquency shall lose the benefit of this
                        relief under [the Tax Ordinance], and all penalties and interests waived
                        and/or subject of this amnesty would be restored and become immediately due
                        and demandable from said delinquent taxpayers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In other words, the taxpayer had to keep up to date with both
                        (i) its current taxes (which were not subject to any tax relief) as well as
                        (ii) its past tax obligations (<em>ie</em>, the unpaid
                        taxes which were the subject of the tax relief). Any failure to make timely
                        payment of either category of taxes would mean that the taxpayer would lose
                        the benefit of the relief granted under the Tax
                Ordinance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Asset Purchase Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     On 10 September 2004, three days after the SP
                    passed the Tax Ordinance, the defendants (<em>ie</em>,
                    subsidiaries of Galaxy), the liquidator, the secured creditors and the
                    shareholders formalised the sale and purchase of the Plant Assets under the MOA
                    by entering into the APA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Section 2.1 of the APA reads:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this APA, [the defendants]
                        agree to purchase from [the liquidator], [the secured creditors] and [the

                        provision of Morian law] …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Under s 3 of the APA, the defendants
                    agreed to pay the purchase price for the Plant Assets to the secured creditors
                    and the liquidator by:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"></a>(a)     making a US$22m down-payment to the
                        liquidator; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_b"></a>(b)     issuing two zero coupon notes in the aggregate principal amount of US$278m
                        to the secured creditors and to the shareholders. The principal under the
                        notes was payable over a period of eight years. The terms and conditions of
                        these notes were set out in the OMNA (a draft of which was annexed to the
                        APA).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In order to secure its payment obligations,
                    the defendants agreed under s 4 of the APA:(i) to issue stand-by letters of
                    credit (“SLCs”) and (ii) to execute the new mortgage trust
                    indenture (described above at [22]) in favour of the secured
                creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The security interest created by the new
                    indenture expressly envisaged that the defendants could seek new secured
                    financing to be secured over the same assets <em>pari
                        passu</em>. Thus, under s 4.2(b) of the APA, the defendants were
                    entitled to use the Plant Assets, encumbered under the new indenture, as
                    security for new loans or credit facilities up to US$86m. In addition, that
                    limit of US$86m could be increased by the amount of any payment or prepayment of
                    the purchase price. New lenders would be issued mortgage participation
                    certificates under which their right to repayment would be secured <em>pari passu</em> by the new indenture. In other words, the
                    parties envisaged that the defendants would need additional secured financing to
                    rehabilitate the plant and permitted them to obtain that financing subject to
                    the new lenders standing on the same footing as all other secured creditors in
                    their security rights over the Plant Assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     At the time of closing, there were several
                    outstanding claims against the Plant Assets. The parties agreed under the APA
                    that the secured creditors should be responsible for settling two of these
                    claims, <em>ie</em>, the Lost Land Claims mentioned in
                    passing above at [7]. This claim will be discussed in greater detail at [213] to
                    [242] below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Under s 7.2 of the APA, the liquidator
                    made certain representations and warranties to the other parties to the APA
                    about the status of the Plant Assets. The relevant parts of s 7.2 read as

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(j) [The defendants] will have no liability whatsoever for or in

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The parties agreed that the warranties and
                    representations above were true and correct as at the date of signing and were
                    deemed to be repeated on the date of closing. I should point out that the above
                    warranties and representations were given against the background of the Tax
                    Ordinance. This is clear from s 7.2(j) of the APA where the liquidator
                    represented that the taxes owing on the Plant Assets for the period prior to
                    closing “will be duly discharged.” Although it is phrased as a
                    representation, the liquidator promised by that provision to discharge these
                    taxes following on or prior to the closing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The dispute resolution provisions of the APA
                    are central to one of the issues in the applications. I will consider them in
                    greater detail at [243] to [265] below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The liquidator obtains the Tax Amnesty Agreement </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Several conditions precedent set out in
                    s 5.3(b) of the APA had to be satisfied before the defendants came under an
                    obligation to execute the necessary documents to bring about the closing of the
                    transaction. I will go on to discuss some of the relevant conditions precedent
                    later. For the time being I shall focus on s 5.3(b)(iii)(4), which
                    reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(iii) [The liquidator] shall have delivered to [the defendants], in form
                        and substance reasonably satisfactory to [the defendants] and their counsel,
                        the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4) A copy of the agreement duly signed by the appropriate Governmental
                        Authority approving a deferred payment scheme for the unpaid realty taxes
                        affecting [the Plant Assets].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I ought now to explain the significance of
                    this condition precedent. As mentioned above, the parties signed the APA on 10
                    September 2004. That was three days after the Tax Ordinance was passed. Closing
                    under the APA was originally scheduled to take place on 8 October 2004. However,
                    the parties were unable to close on that day because this condition precedent
                    had not yet been satisfied. The parties therefore agreed to delay the closing
                    until 15 October 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     On 1 October 2004, the liquidator wrote to
                    Erebor’s city mayor to seek relief under the Tax Ordinance from having to
                    pay interest and penalties on the Corporation’s unpaid taxes. The
                    liquidator asked further that the Corporation be allowed to pay its remaining
                    basic real property tax liability by instalments, beyond 1 December
                2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     On 11 October 2004, the defendants wrote to
                    the liquidator, chasing him to obtain “from [the city mayor] a formal
                    letter of settlement, giving effect to [the Tax Ordinance] passed by his
                    council”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     On 13 October 2004, the city treasurer and the
                    city mayor sent the liquidator a crucial letter. This is the letter which the
                    parties have called the TAA (first referred to at [5] above). At that time, the
                    Corporation owed unpaid taxes amounting to about US$4m on all of its properties
                    in Erebor. The TAA granted the Corporation relief from the payment of interest
                    and penalties for these unpaid taxes and permitted the Corporation to settle
                    them in eight equal instalments of an equivalent of US$500,000. Each instalment
                    was to be paid every December between 2004 and 2012 (save for 2005). The TAA
                    therefore covered tax arrears over both the Plant Assets and the Retained
                    Assets. The TAA permitted the Corporation to pay its taxes by instalments rather
                    than requiring a lump sum payment in total discharge. Thus, Erebor did not waive
                    the principal amount of tax liability but simply deferred the payment of unpaid
                    tax to permit the agreed instalment plan and without imposing any penalties or
                    interest as a result of the deferred payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The TAA also made it clear that there would be
                    serious consequences if the annual instalments of tax were not paid. As
                    mentioned above, under s 6 of the Tax Ordinance, all deferred tax would
                    become immediately due and demandable together with all penalties and interest
                    that had been previously waived if the taxpayer failed to pay its current
                    liability for any tax or failed to pay an instalment due against its deferred
                    past tax liabilities. Put another way the TAA would be revoked should the
                    current taxes or past taxes on both the Plant Assets and the Retained Assets not
                    be paid on time. Two consequences followed from the revocation of the
                    TAA:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_a"></a>(a)     the instalment payments on all
                        previous unpaid taxes would all become due and payable at once;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_b"></a>(b)     the amount of
                        all tax payable on all the Corporation’s properties (that is, the
                        Plant Assets and the Retained Assets) would balloon to include all the
                        interest and penalties previously waived.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     It is not disputed that the liquidator’s
                    delivery of the TAA to the defendants satisfied the condition precedent in
                    s 5.3(b)(iii)(4) of the APA (see [46] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The close of the transaction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The closing took place as rescheduled on 15
                    October 2004. At closing, the parties executed and delivered several documents
                    which have significance for the parties’ dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The parties execute the Omnibus Agreement and the defendants issue
                the notes</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     First, the defendants and the secured
                    creditors (but not the liquidator) entered into the OMNA which sets out the
                    terms and conditions upon which the secured creditors agreed to accept the
                    notes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     I make the following observations about the
                    OMNA:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_a"></a>(a)     The OMNA provided a mechanism for
                        the defendants to “set off from time to time any claims it may have
                        against any [secured creditor of the Corporation]” against the amount
                        that each secured creditor was due under the notes: s 4.01(a) of the
                        OMNA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_b"></a>(b)     Pursuant
                        to s 6.01(e) of the OMNA, the defendants undertook that so long as the
                        notes remained outstanding, it would duly pay all tax levied on its
                        properties:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">

                            prior to the date on which penalties attach thereto, and also pay and
                            discharge when due all lawful claims which, if unpaid, might become a
                            lien or charge upon any of the its [<em>sic</em>]

                            cover unpaid realty taxes and business taxes and/or fees already
                            existing prior to the purchase by [the defendants] of [the Plant Assets]
                            and which taxes continue to be the liability of [the Corporation] and/or
                            [the liquidator] in accordance with the terms of the [APA].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_c"></a>(c)     The OMNA provided
                        at s 9.04 that the secured creditors were entitled to assign all or any
                        portion of their rights and obligations under the OMNA or under any other
                        “Relevant Document”. That term was defined to include the
                        notes, the SLCs, the new mortgage indenture and other documents required or
                        otherwise contemplated to be executed pursuant to the
                    OMNA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_d"></a>(d)     The OMNA
                        contained a distinct dispute-resolution mechanism from the one in the APA. I
                        shall describe this further at [248].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The defendants issued the two notes on the
                    same day, 15 October 2004. They are described as the Tranche A note and the
                    Tranche B note.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Other documents executed or delivered at closing</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Second, the liquidator, the secured creditors
                    and the shareholders agreed formally to amend a Purchase Price Sharing Agreement
                    (“the PPSA”) which they had previously executed on 10 September
                    2004. The PPSA regulated the manner in which the interested stakeholders would
                    share in the payments made by the defendants and was one of the conditions
                    precedent required by the defendants before closing could take place. Under the
                    amendment to the PPSA, the parties agreed that the liquidator could use part of
                    the defendants’ initial down-payment of about US$22m to pay the first of
                    the eight instalments due to Erebor under the TAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Third, by a letter dated 15 October 2004, the
                    secured creditors agreed to guarantee the instalment payments under the
                    TAA:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[s]ubject to the prompt receipt of payment on the Tranche A and Tranche B

                        which has been accepted by the Mayor of the City of [Erebor] in his letter
                        dated 13 October 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The liquidator maintains that he gave this
                    letter to the defendants in order to satisfy his obligation under the condition
                    precedent to closing in s 5.3(b)(iii)(6) of the APA. Indeed, the liquidator
                    maintains that this was the only document the defendants asked for to satisfy
                    that condition precedent. Section 5.3(b)(iii)(6) reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(iii) [The liquidator] shall have delivered to [the defendants], in form
                        and substance reasonably satisfactory to [the defendants] and their counsel,
                        the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(6) Such other documents as [the defendants] may reasonably require from
                        [the liquidator] prior to Closing Date to give [the defendants] full, good,
                        legal, valid, and valuable title to [the Plant Assets] and to enable [the
                        defendants] to become registered owners thereof free from and clear of all
                        claims, Liens, and encumbrances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Fourth, the liquidator’s legal counsel
                    issued a legal opinion for the benefit of the defendants which stated its
                    opinion that “[a]t Closing, full legal and valid ownership of, and to,
                    [the Plant Assets] shall be transferred and conveyed to [the defendants], free
                    from and clear of all claims, liens and encumbrances, except as previously
                    disclosed”. This legal opinion addressed the condition precedent at
                    s 5.3(b)(iii)(8) of the APA which required:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[a] legal opinion issued by the legal counsel of [the liquidator]
                        satisfactory to [the defendants] and the legal counsel of [the defendants]

                        Assets] shall be transferred and conveyed to [the defendants] free from and
                        clear of all claims, Liens and encumbrances whatsoever ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Disputes over the unpaid realty taxes after closing</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Three different categories of taxes were due
                    to Erebor which are relevant for present purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The first category of taxes I shall refer to
                    as the “Pre-Closing Taxes”. These taxes consisted of the arrears
                    of the taxes accrued from 1999 to 15 October 2004, the closing date, over all of
                    the Corporation’s <em>real property</em>. The
                    Pre-Closing Taxes therefore related to all of the Corporation’s real
                    property, whether that real property was comprised in the Plant Assets or in the
                    Retained Assets. The Pre-Closing Taxes remained the responsibility of the
                    liquidator despite closing pursuant to his warranty and representation in
                    s 7.2(j) of the APA that “all such liabilities will be duly
                    discharged by [the liquidator]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The second category of taxes I shall refer to
                    as the “Post-Closing Plant Asset Taxes”. These taxes comprised
                    amongst other things, (i) ten tax declaration numbers over the four parcels of
                    land which formed the Plant Land Assets; and (ii) real property taxes over Plant
                    Non-Land Assets. I observe at this point that even though the Plant Land Assets
                    were transferred to the defendants at closing, title could not immediately be
                    registered in the defendants’ name. The Plant Land Assets thus remained
                    registered in the Corporation’s name even after closing. As far as
                    Erebor’s municipal authorities were concerned, therefore, the Corporation
                    remained the registered owner and therefore the taxpayer responsible for the
                    Post-Closing Plant Asset Taxes. Further, unlike the Pre-Closing Taxes, the APA
                    was silent as to who was liable for the Post-Closing Plant Asset
                Taxes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The third category of taxes I shall refer to
                    as the “Post-Closing Retained Assets Taxes”. These taxes were
                    payable on the Retained Assets (<em>ie</em>, all of the
                    Corporation’s assets which were not sold to the defendants) which remained
                    in the name of and administered by the liquidator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In early 2005, the liquidator and the secured
                    creditors became embroiled in disputes with Erebor over the taxes that were
                    payable in respect of the Plant Assets and the Retained Assets as well as the
                    defendants’ application for various tax exemptions. I will touch on this
                    in greater detail later in this judgment. For now, it suffices to note that
                    there were two main disputes:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_a"></a>(a)     The first related to the first
                        instalment of the Pre-Closing Taxes (the first category of relevant taxes)
                        which had been paid by the secured creditors of the Corporation on behalf of
                        the liquidator in December 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_65-p2_b"></a>(b)     The second related to the payment of the Post-Closing
                        Plant Assets Taxes (the second category of relevant
                    taxes).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>As a result of these disputes, Erebor
                        eventually revoked the TAA, with disastrous consequences for the
                        parties’ transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In 2005 and 2006, the defendants, the
                    liquidator and the secured creditors entered into negotiations with Erebor
                    concerning the outstanding taxes over the Plant Assets. Those efforts were
                    unsuccessful. In November 2006, Erebor declared that it intended to conduct a
                    public auction of the Plant Assets in order to satisfy the tax arrears. The
                    liquidator made an urgent application to the Commission and secured an order on
                    30 November 2006 enjoining the city treasurer from proceeding with the auction.
                    As a result, the auction was forestalled.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     On 14 October 2008, the city treasurer applied
                    to the Commission for permission to conduct a forced sale of the Plant Assets.
                    By an order dated 17 November 2008 made pursuant to an application by the
                    liquidator, the Commission denied the city treasurer’s
                application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Funds purchase the notes on the secondary market</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     While all this was going on, through a number
                    of transactions between 2005 and 2008, the Funds purchased in the secondary
                    market the right to receive payments under the notes. They currently hold
                    22.2254% of the Tranche A note and 17.7804% of the Tranche B note.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events leading up to the commencement of arbitration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The defendants paid the first two instalments
                    under the terms of the notes in 2006 and 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> However, shortly before it was
                    due to pay the third instalment under the notes on 15 October 2008, it filed an
                    application before a Morian court on 9 October 2008 seeking an injunction
                    restraining AKP (the first plaintiff in Originating Summons No [M] and the
                    facility agent of the notes for the secured creditors) from:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_a"></a>(a)     issuing a certification that the
                        payment due under the APA and OMNA has not been received;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_b"></a>(b)     declaring the defendants to be in
                        default under the APA and OMNA; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_c"></a>(c)     encashing one of the SLCs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>AKP opposed the defendants’ application for an injunction. On
                        10 October 2008, the Morian court dismissed the defendants’
                        application. On the same day, the defendants commenced the
                        arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Procedural skirmishes leading to a temporary injunction </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The parties then engaged in two years of
                    procedural skirmishes in the Singapore courts which culminated in the defendants
                    securing an interim injunction which (i) restrained the secured creditors from
                    declaring the defendants to be in default under the APA, the notes and the OMNA,
                    (ii) restrained the secured creditors from declaring the purchase price or the
                    unpaid principal under the notes to be due and payable and (iii) suspended the
                    defendants’ payment obligations under the notes and its obligation to
                    provide further security by way of further SLCs. The Singapore Court of Appeal
                    also directed that any future applications to vary or discharge the interim
                    injunction be heard by the tribunal rather than by the courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     On 7 July 2010, the tribunal upheld the
                    interim injunction but made it clear that AKP (as the facility agent for the
                    secured creditors) was free to contend during the substantive hearing that the
                    tribunal did not have the jurisdiction to impose a permanent injunction to
                    equivalent effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The arbitration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In the arbitration, the defendants’
                    position on the substantive dispute was that the liquidator and the secured
                    creditors’ failure to pay the Pre-Closing Taxes (<em>ie</em>, the first category of taxes) rendered the Plant Assets
                    subject to a statutory lien in favour of Erebor. As a result, the defendants
                    claimed that the liquidator and the secured creditors had breached their
                    obligations under the APA to deliver the Plant Assets with clean title and had
                    also breached a number of related representations and warranties given in the
                    APA (some of these provision have already been canvassed above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The defendants also claimed that the
                    liquidator:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_a"></a>(a)     failed to specify to the city
                        treasurer that the first instalment payment under the TAA was to be applied
                        to the unpaid taxes in relation to the Plant Assets (<em>ie</em>, the assets that were transferred to the defendants) and
                        not to the Retained Assets; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_73-p2_b"></a>(b)     failed to comply with the TAA by failing to pay the
                        Post-Closing Retained Assets Taxes (the third category of taxes; see [64]
                        above), which led to the revocation of the TAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     As a result, the defendants claimed that the
                    Plant Assets remained encumbered and that the relevant authorities refused to
                    issue the requisite tax clearances to the defendants. This in turn meant that
                    title to the Plant Assets was not clean. The lack of clean title, according to
                    the defendants, meant that it was unable to obtain loans from banks to finance
                    the modernisation and rehabilitation works which the Plant Assets needed,
                    ultimately causing the defendants to lose substantial profits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Separately, the defendants also claimed that
                    the secured creditors had, in breach of the APA, failed to settle two civil
                    claims in respect of a plot of land which formed part of the Plant <em>Land</em> Assets (the Lost Land Claims referred to at [7]
                    above). The defendants sought to be indemnified against the consequences of this
                    breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     As a result of all of this, the defendants
                    claimed in the arbitration the following relief:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_a"></a>(a)     A declaration that the liquidator,
                        the secured creditors and shareholders were in breach of the APA in that
                        they had failed to pay accrued taxes on the Plant Assets or failed to
                        deliver them free of encumbrances.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_b"></a>(b)     An order that the defendants’ obligations to pay
                        any instalments falling due under the APA, the notes, and to provide any
                        further SLC or any SLC of increased value, be suspended, deferred and/or
                        postponed until the liquidator and the secured creditors deliver the Plant
                        Assets with clean title.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_c"></a>(c)     An order that the liquidator and the secured creditors be
                        restrained and/or enjoined from declaring the defendants in default for
                        non-payment of “the next instalment of the Purchase Price falling due
                        on and the provision of the New SLC on 15 October
                    2008”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_d"></a>(d)     Damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The tribunal’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     The tribunal found in favour of the defendants
                    in its award. In summary, it held that: (i) the liquidator and the secured
                    creditors had a joint and several obligation to transfer the Plant Assets to the
                    defendants free from any encumbrances, which included tax liens; (ii) the tax
                    lien which encumbered the Plant Assets meant that the liquidator was in breach
                    of its warranty and representation under the APA to deliver clean title to the
                    Plant Assets on closing or soon after closing; (iii) the secured creditors were
                    jointly and severally liable with the liquidator for this breach of the APA;
                    (iv) the secured creditors were in breach of their obligation to settle the Lost
                    Land Claims and accordingly were obliged to indemnify the defendants against it;
                    and (v) the tribunal had the jurisdiction to suspend the defendants’
                    obligations under the APA to make payment and provide further security and
                    therefore to enjoin the secured creditors from declaring the defendants in
                    default of those obligations (which are in fact found under the notes and the
                    OMNA).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     As a result, the tribunal granted the
                    defendants relief which includes the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_78-p2_a"></a>(a)     It awarded the defendants US$80m in
                        damages representing compensation for an opportunity to earn profits which
                        it lost as a result of the liquidator’s failure to transfer clean
                        title to the Plant Assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_78-p2_b"></a>(b)     It awarded the defendants the equivalent of about
                        US$23.7m by way of an indemnity in respect of the Lost Land
                    Claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_78-p2_c"></a>(c)     It granted
                        the relief sought by the defendants at [76(b)] and [76(c)] above in respect
                        of its payment and security obligations under the notes and the
                    OMNA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(1) The liquidator and the secured creditors were jointly and
                severally obliged under the APA to sell the Plant Assets to the defendants</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     I pause at this point briefly to consider the
                    tribunal’s reasons for awarding the defendants US$80m in
                damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     After reviewing the provisions of the APA and
                    the mechanics of the sale which it contemplated, the tribunal concluded that the
                    liquidator and the secured creditors were jointly and severally obliged under
                    the APA to sell the Plant Assets to the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(2) The liquidator was in breach of the warranty and representation
                to deliver clean title to the Plant Assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The tribunal concluded that the liquidator had
                    an obligation to transfer clean title to the Plant Assets and that this
                    obligation was not qualified in any way by the TAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     In particular, the tribunal rejected the
                    possibility that the TAA qualified the obligation of the liquidator and of the
                    secured creditors under the TAA to deliver clean title to the Plant Assets
                    because what the defendants required commercially was unencumbered title to the
                    Plant Assets which it could use as security for future borrowing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     In the tribunal’s view, the surest (and
                    possibly the only) way in which the liquidator and the secured creditors could
                    have obtained title capable of being transferred to the defendants free from
                    encumbrances (that is, clean title) was by paying all taxes due as at 31
                    December 2004 using the initial down-payment. They had failed to do this because
                    of the way in which they had agreed under the PPSA to deal with the
                    down-payment. The tribunal held that whatever the parties to the PPSA had agreed
                    under that agreement was none of the defendants’ concern since it was not
                    a party to it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(3) The defendants lost the opportunity to earn increased
                profits</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     After finding that the liquidator had breached
                    his obligations under the APA and that the liquidator and the secured creditors
                    were jointly and severally liable for this breach, the tribunal then turned to
                    deal with the issue of damages. It took the view that although the
                    defendants’ claim was advanced as a claim for profits actually lost, the
                    claim was “better considered as a claim for the loss of an opportunity to
                    make increased profits”. The tribunal therefore considered the
                    defendants’ damages claim on that basis. The tribunal then split on the
                    quantum of the ultimate damage suffered by the defendants. The majority held
                    that it was a loss of an opportunity to earn profits of US$140m. The minority
                    concluded that it was the loss of an opportunity to earn profits of US$95.616m.
                    The tribunal attached a probability of 55% to this opportunity. The majority
                    therefore used its figure to assess the compensation for this lost opportunity
                    as 55% of US$140m, or US$80m.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiffs’ complaints</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The liquidator’s case in his application
                    is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_a"></a>(a)     The tribunal breached the rules of
                        natural justice or the liquidator was unable to present his case on the
                        following matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_85-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       whether the
                            liquidator’s obligation under ss 2.1 and 7.2 of the APA was
                            qualified by the TAA;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_85-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       whether the defendants were responsible for the
                            payment of the Post-Closing Taxes in 2005 and caused the TAA to be
                            revoked; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_85-p2_a-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       whether the defendants suffered damage
                            characterised as the loss of an opportunity to earn
                        profits.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_b"></a>(b)     The issue of the loss of an opportunity to earn profits was never submitted
                        to the tribunal for determination and the tribunal had thus exceeded the
                        scope of its jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>As a result,
                        the liquidator contends that the tribunal’s award should be set aside
                        in its entirety. In the alternative, the liquidator contends that the
                        tribunal’s award of damages in the sum of US$80m should be set
                        aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The secured creditors advance a case in their
                    application which is similar to that advanced by the liquidator at [85(a)(ii)],
                    [85(a)(iii)] and [85(b)] above:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_86-p2_a"></a>(a)     The tribunal breached the rules of
                        natural justice by not giving the secured creditors a fair hearing on the
                        issue of whether the defendants were responsible for the TAA being
                        revoked.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_86-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        tribunal awarded damages for the loss of an opportunity to earn profits in
                        circumstances where the defendants had never submitted any such claim to
                        arbitration and where the tribunal failed to afford the secured creditors
                        the opportunity to address the tribunal on this point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The secured creditors argue that the award should be set aside
                        in its entirety on these grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     In addition, the secured creditors argue the
                    award should be set aside in its entirety on the basis that the tribunal did not
                    give the secured creditors a fair hearing on the Lost Land Claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Further, the secured creditors advance an
                    additional point which is unique to their position: they argue that the tribunal
                    acted in excess of its jurisdiction by assuming jurisdiction in relation to
                    matters under, and in granting relief under and in respect of, the OMNA and the
                    notes. These matters fell outside the ambit of the parties’ arbitration
                    agreement under the APA. As a result, the parts of the award which restrain the
                    secured creditors from calling an event of default under the notes should be set
                    aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     The Funds in their application adopt these
                    arguments of the secured creditors and of the liquidator. In addition, they
                    argue that even though they voluntarily applied to be joined as a party to the
                    arbitration, the defendants never sought to claim that the Funds, as assignees
                    of rights under the notes and/or the OMNA in the secondary market, were liable
                    under the <em>APA</em>. By determining that the Funds are
                    jointly and severally liable along with the secured creditor to the defendants
                    under the <em>APA</em>, the tribunal dealt with an issue or
                    dispute that was not contemplated by the submission to arbitration and/or the
                    tribunal breached the rules of natural justice by making its determination
                    against the Funds without first giving them an opportunity to be heard or to
                    present their case on why they should not be liable. Accordingly, the award
                    should be set aside on against the Funds on the basis of an excess of
                    jurisdiction or on natural justice grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues to be decided</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The argument above can be distilled into a
                    total of seven issues for determination. The following five issues were common
                    to all three applications:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_a"></a>(a)     Did the tribunal fail to consider
                        the liquidator’s arguments, evidence and submissions on whether the
                        ss 2.1 and 7.1 of the APA were qualified by the TAA (“Issue
                        1”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_b"></a>(b)     Did
                        the tribunal fail to consider the liquidator’s and the secured
                        creditors’ arguments, evidence and submissions on the issue of whether
                        the defendants were responsible for the revocation of the TAA (“Issue
                        2”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_c"></a>(c)     Did
                        the tribunal, in awarding damages to the defendants for their loss of an
                        opportunity to earn profits, exceed its powers by dealing with a matter that
                        had not been submitted to it (“Issue 3”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_d"></a>(d)     In the alternative to Issue 3, did the
                        tribunal, in awarding damages to the defendants for its loss of an
                        opportunity to earn profits fail to give the liquidator and secured
                        creditors an opportunity to address the tribunal on that question
                        (“Issue 4”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_e"></a>(e)     Did the tribunal fail to consider the secured
                        creditors’ arguments, evidence and submissions in relation to the Lost
                        Land Claim (“Issue 5”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The secured creditors’ and the
                    Funds’ applications raise a separate issue which is common to them, that
                    is, did the tribunal act in excess of its jurisdiction contrary to Art
                    34(2)(b)(iii) of the Model Law by granting relief under and in respect of the
                    OMNA and the notes (“Issue 6”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The Funds’ application raises one
                    further issue, unique to the Funds. That is whether the tribunal acted in excess
                    of its jurisdiction or in breach of natural justice by holding the Funds, as
                    assignees under the OMNA and the notes, liable alongside the rest of the secured
                    creditors for breaches of the APA (“Issue 7”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     I now deal with the issues in
                turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 1: Did the tribunal fail to consider the liquidator’s
                arguments, evidence and submissions on whether the ss 2.1 and 7.1 of the APA
                were qualified by the TAA?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The applicable legal principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     A party applying to set aside an award on the
                    basis that it has been denied natural justice must identify: (a) the relevant
                    rule of natural justice; (b) how that rule was breached; (c) how the breach was
                    connected to the making of the award; and (d) how the breach prejudiced his
                    rights: see <em>Soh Beng Tee &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount
                        Development Pte Ltd</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 86 (“<em>Soh Beng Tee”)</em> at [29] and <em>L W
                        Infrastructure Pte Ltd v Lim Chin San Contractors Pte Ltd and another
                        appeal</em> [2013] 1 SLR 125 (“<em>L W
                        Infrastructure</em>”) at [48].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The liquidator says that the relevant rule of
                    natural justice is the right to be heard. Encompassed within this rule is the
                    sub-rule that an arbitral tribunal cannot disregard submissions or arguments
                    made by a party without considering them on their merits. The defendants do not
                    challenge this proposition. I accept it as correct. The parties do not dispute
                    that if this sub-rule was breached then this would have caused the liquidator
                    and the secured creditors to have suffered prejudice. Further, the defendants do
                    not suggest that I ought to remit this issue to the tribunal if I find that
                    there was a breach of natural justice. Instead, both sides’ submissions
                    rest on whether this sub-rule was breached at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The liquidator’s submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Before the tribunal, the liquidator’s
                    main defence on the issue of liability was that the TAA qualified his obligation
                    under the APA to deliver clean title to the Plant Assets. The liquidator’s
                    evidence and submissions in support of this position before the tribunal can be
                    summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_96-p2_a"></a>(a)     The APA and the documents delivered
                        pursuant to the conditions precedent to closing must be read
                        collectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_96-p2_b"></a>(b)     All the parties knew from the outset and agreed that Pre-Closing Taxes
                        would be paid in eight annual instalments from 2004 to 2012 (except for
                        2005).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_96-p2_c"></a>(c)     It was a
                        condition precedent to closing under s 5.3(b)(iii)(4) of the APA that
                        the liquidator deliver to the defendants (in form and substance reasonably
                        satisfactory to the defendants and their counsel) “[a] copy of the
                        agreement duly signed by the appropriate Governmental Authority approving a
                        deferred payment scheme for the unpaid realty taxes affecting [the Plant
                        Assets]”. It is not disputed that this condition precedent was
                        fulfilled when the liquidator delivered the TAA to the defendants (see [52]
                        above).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_96-p2_d"></a>(d)     It was
                        a condition precedent to closing under s 5.3(b)(iii)(6) of the APA that
                        the liquidator deliver to the defendants any such documents as “[the
                        defendants] may reasonably require from [the liquidator] prior to Closing
                        Date to give [the defendants] full, good, legal, valid and valuable title to
                        [the Plant Assets] and to enable [the defendants] to become registered owner
                        thereof free from and clear of all claims, Liens, and encumbrances”.
                        The only document that the defendants asked for pursuant to this condition
                        precedent (and which the liquidator duly delivered) was a guarantee from the
                        secured creditors that the TAA instalments would be paid on time, provided
                        the defendants promptly paid their instalments under the notes on time (see
                        [59] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_96-p2_e"></a>(e)     The defendants were represented by one of the top law firms in Moria in
                        negotiating the APA and hence must have received legal advice on the Tax
                        Ordinance, the TAA and the other closing documents. Mr Y (one of the
                        defendants’ witnesses) confirmed during cross-examination that it was
                        the defendants’ lawyers who advised him that the defendants should be
                        able to obtain registered title to the land which formed part of the Plant
                        Assets within about two months from closing (thereby allowing them to
                        mortgage the land to raise financing).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_96-p2_f"></a>(f)     The actions of the defendants prior to the commencement
                        of the arbitration in 2008 were entirely consistent with the belief that the
                        Pre-Closing Taxes (which would otherwise give rise to a tax lien) were to be
                        dealt with exclusively in accordance with the TAA. In fact, the
                        defendants’ own Morian law expert, Justice A, expressed a similar
                        view:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">On 15 October 2004, Closing of the transaction took place on the basis
                            that [the liquidator and secured creditors] would meet all the payment
                            obligations under the [TAA]. But to [the defendants’] surprise,
                            the [the liquidator and secured creditors] did not act in accordance
                            with the terms of the TAA. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[The liquidator’s] failure to ensure payment of the first
                            installment [<em>sic</em>] of the accrued
                            pre-closing taxes triggered the enforcement claims of the City of
                            [Erebor] in relation to their lien over [the Plant Assets] ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">… The parties considered that for as long as [the liquidator
                            and secured creditors] comply with the terms of the [TAA] and meet the
                            scheduled payment provided therein, the property would be left
                            undisturbed. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... The provisions on warranty [<em>sic</em>]
                            should be read together with the provision dealing with the deferred
                            payment scheme mentioned [at Section 5.3(b)(iii)(4) of the APA]. The
                            Parties merely stipulated that the accrued taxes on the property were
                            for the account of [the liquidator and secured creditors] and were to be
                            settled with the local government under a deferred payment scheme. To
                            reiterate, the requirement of deferred payment scheme was incorporated
                            in the contract precisely to protect [the defendants] from the
                            possibility that should the taxes remain unpaid without any agreement as
                            to how they are to be settled, the City of [Erebor], at any time, could
                            sell the property in auction to satisfy its claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Counsel for the liquidator Mr Yeo points out
                    that the award does not, on its face, address any of the six points above. From
                    this, Mr Yeo invites me to draw the inference that the tribunal had either
                    improperly disregarded or at the very least failed to engage with the
                    liquidator’s submissions, arguments and evidence in reaching its
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendants’ submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Counsel for the defendants Mr Yeap does not
                    deny that the award does not deal with these points expressly. However, he
                    submits that the natural and appropriate inference is that the tribunal duly
                    considered all the evidence, arguments and submissions and simply preferred the
                    defendants’ over the liquidator’s. There is therefore no breach of
                    natural justice. For this proposition, Mr Yeap relies on four passages from the
                    award which I will now consider in greater detail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Analysis of the tribunal’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(1) The tribunal says that it considered the liquidator’s
                submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     The first passage is paragraph 390 of the
                    award where the tribunal expressly states that it has considered the
                    liquidator’s submissions:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">390. The Tribunal <em>has already considered, and rejected,
                            the Liquidator’s submission that the APA has to be read together
                            with the TAA (or vice-versa) and that the TAA amended or varied the
                            APA</em> so that, on its true construction, the APA did not
                        require a transfer of clean title at or within a reasonable period after
                        Closing, but that the combined effect of those two agreements was to defer
                        the transfer of clean title for some eight years.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    This passage contains a general statement by
                    the tribunal that it has considered the liquidator’s submissions. That
                    cannot in itself resolve the issue of whether the tribunal actually did so. The
                    central inquiry is whether the award reflects that the tribunal applied its mind
                    to the arguments put forward by the liquidator. In my view, a fundamental
                    problem with this passage is that it shows that a misunderstanding of the
                    liquidator’s defence. This is an important point to which I shall return
                    shortly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(2) The tribunal assumed that the defendants would be unable to
                obtain secured financing so long as the TAA was in place</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    The second passage is paragraphs 348 to 351
                    of the award. In those paragraphs, the tribunal construes the provisions of the
                    APA in light of its commercial context and concludes that the liquidator’s
                    case (which it understood as suggesting that the TAA had the effect of deferring
                    the transfer of clean title to the Plant Assets for eight years) did not make
                    “commercial sense” and “ignore[d] the other provisions of
                    the APA that envisaged [the defendants] being able to raise finance by
                    mortgaging the land”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">348. One of the conditions precedent to the Closing [Section
                        5.3(b)[(iii)(4)] of the APA was that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“(iii) [The liquidator] shall have delivered to [the defendants],
                        in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to [the defendants] and their
                        counsel, the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4) A copy of the agreement duly signed by the appropriate Governmental
                        Authority approving a deferred payment scheme for the unpaid realty taxes
                        affecting [the Plant Assets];”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">349. As has been seen, the TAA was an agreement between the Liquidator and
                        [Erebor]. It is the case of both the Liquidator and the Secured Creditors
                        that the effect of the TAA was that, to [the defendants’] knowledge,
                        and contrary to the various provisions of the APA that referred to the
                        obligation to deliver clean title free from and clear of all Liens, to [the
                        defendants] (and [the defendants] identified 17 such provisions), clean
                        title could not be delivered until the payment terms stipulated in the TAA
                        had been complied with by the Liquidator. Thus, every provision in the APA
                        that referred to the delivery of clean title had to be read as being
                        qualified by reference to the TAA, and the obligation to deliver clean title
                        was deferred until the last payment was made under the TAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">350. … It does not seem to the Tribunal to make much commercial
                        sense for a bargain for the sale and purchase of land to defer the passing
                        of clean title for many years, and to be dependent upon the satisfactory
                        performance by the vendor of its obligations to a third party. True it is
                        that the Liquidator was intending to satisfy his obligations to [Erebor]
                        from monies paid by [the defendants] to the Secured Creditors in
                        satisfaction of [the defendants’] indebtedness to them, some of which
                        the Secured Creditors were going to make available to the Liquidator, but
                        that ignores the other provisions of the APA that envisaged [the defendants]
                        being able to raise finance by mortgaging the land. The possibility of
                        mortgaging land which was subject to a lien in favour of [Erebor] would have
                        been remote.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">351. None of the parties to the APA would have been able to achieve its
                        respective aims if the land had been encumbered by a lien in favour of
                        [Erebor]. [The defendants] had to be satisfied that [they] would acquire the
                        land with clean title and would be able to use the land to raise
                        money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The tribunal assumed that the defendants
                    would be unable to mortgage the land so long as instalment payments under the
                    TAA were outstanding. This assumption contradicted the tribunal’s
                        <em>own</em> factual narrative which clearly showed
                    that the opposite was true: that it <em>was possible</em>
                    for the defendants to obtain the necessary tax clearances (and so obtain clean
                    title over the land and thereby mortgage the land) without waiting for the last
                    instalment payment under the TAA to be made in 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    For example, the tribunal acknowledged at
                    paragraph 207 of the award that Erebor issued an incomplete tax clearance
                    certificate for the relevant parcels of land based on the tax received from the
                    first instalment payment of the TAA:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">207. On the 11<sup>th</sup> October 2005 [the city
                        treasurer’s] office issued a real property tax clearance certificate.
                        The certificate identified [the Corporation] as having paid the realty taxes
                        on the four properties included as part of the four parcels of land acquired
                        by [the defendants]. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Paragraph 209 of the award showed that the
                    tribunal was aware that even the defendants believed that it was possible to
                    obtain the necessary tax clearances before 2012:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">209. [Representatives of the defendants] informed [a representative of the
                        secured creditors] that [the defendants] had been assessed in the amount
                        [equivalent to about US$614,000] for the arrears due from [the Corporation]
                        from 1999 to 2004, and that this had arisen because the payment made by the
                        Liquidator and [AKP] of the first instalment under the TAA had not been
                        properly allocated. They said that the correct clearances [<em>ie</em>, the tax clearance for all ten tax declarations
                        in relation to the four parcels of land which constitute the Plant Land
                        Assets] would only be issued when the settlement of the issue of the correct
                        allocation of the first instalment had been sorted out and that, <em>immediately after receipt of such a tax clearance</em>,
                            [<em>the defendants</em>] <em>would
                            have four titles transferred to</em> [<em>their</em>] <em>name</em>[<em>s</em>]. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    In fact, at paragraphs 216 and 217 of the
                    award, the tribunal describes one of the defendants’ attempts to obtain
                    tax clearances for all ten tax declarations so that it could execute the new
                    indenture (as well as start the process of mortgaging the land to raise its own
                    financing):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">216. On the 25<sup>th</sup> November 2005 [the
                        representatives of the defendants] again wrote to [the city treasurer].
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">217. ... They further pointed out [to the city treasurer] that the tax
                        arrears for the period from 1999 to 2004 was the responsibility of the
                        Liquidator, who would be writing to [the city treasurer] requesting that the
                        first instalment should be applied to the parcels of land assigned to [the
                        defendants] so that the appropriate tax clearances could be issued. Once
                        that had been done, the Secured Creditors would be able to obtain [the new
                        mortgage indenture] and Mortgage Participation Certificates could be
                        issued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Mr Yeap submits that it was the
                    liquidator’s own case that the TAA prevented the defendants from

                    accurate representation of the liquidator’s case at all. The above
                    exchange took place in the middle the liquidator being cross-examined about the
                    very separate topic of how the very first instalment paid under the TAA ought to
                    have been applied. Further, this line of questioning was initiated not by Mr
                    Yeap himself but by one of the arbitrators. This can be seen from the exchange
                    below which preceded the exchange above:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Yeap:    My question was not whether you had an
                            obligation [under the APA to apply the first TAA instalment payment
                            towards the discharge of taxes on Plant Land Assets], just in the course
                            of normal conduct, wouldn’t you have done that?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Liquidator:    No, sir.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Arbitrator 1:    Mr Yeap, this is for you to run this
                            cross-examination as you please, of course, but I thought you were going
                            to get to the point where you might ask the witness what, in his mind,
                            was his anticipation of when the transfer was to be registered and the
                            mortgage was to be registered, so that we know the basic assumptions
                            from which --</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Yeap:    I thought it was up to 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Arbitrator 1:    Well, you stopped just when you were
                            getting interesting, you see.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Liquidator:    Under normal circumstances, yes, the
                            transfer would happen after all the pre-closing taxes were
                        paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Arbitrator 1:    But when in your mind did you think that

                            arrangements which you had entered into?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Liquidator:    After all the pre-closing taxes had been
                            paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Arbitrator 1:    When did you expecting all the
                            pre-closing taxes to be paid -- 2012 or earlier?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Liquidator:    2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Arbitrator 1:    So you were expecting in your mind that
                            the transfer and the mortgage would not be registered until 2012? That
                            was your understanding of things?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Liquidator:    Under normal circumstance,

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Arbitrator 1:    Were there any extra-normal
                            circumstances or abnormal circumstances in this case?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Liquidator:    An exception. The City [of Erebor] might
                            give an exception. The City might give a clearance, although the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    It was also clear from the
                    liquidator’s cross-examination the next day that the liquidator did not
                    think that there was a problem in securing the necessary tax clearances (thereby
                    allowing the defendants to mortgage the land) even though the TAA was still in
                    effect:</p>

<b><u>Day 9, 25 March 2011</u></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Yeap:    In the second sentence here:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“As to the four … parcels of land we are likewise granted
                        tax amnesty on the [<em>sic</em>] and penalties and the
                        balance on the principal has been allowed to be paid in eight …
                        annual instalments …”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">-- as reflected in the TAA which you’ve attached. Then you go on to
                        say:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“On the basis of the above two items, we believe [the defendants]
                        can secure from the City of [Erebor] the necessary tax clearance for the
                        transfer of titles for the said four parcels of land.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I’m trying to understand this. If, as you have said … [the
                        defendants] may have to wait eight years … how do you reconcile that
                        with your last statement that you believe that [the defendants] can secure
                        from the City the necessary tax clearance?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Liquidator:    That was a personal belief. <em>If the pre-closing taxes have already been addressed by the
                                tax amnesty agreement, and the payments due under tax amnesty

                                liabilities might move the City to allow the issuance of the tax

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    The tribunal’s misunderstanding of the
                    liquidator’s case seems to have been reinforced by the defendants’
                    written submissions to the tribunal. The defendants summarised those submissions
                    as follows before me (I have taken the liberty of numbering the sentences for
                    ease of reference):<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    [T]he deferred payment scheme in Section
                            5.3(b)(iii)(4) of the APA, presumably the TAA, did not have any effect
                            of postponing the transfer of titles to [the defendants] to 2012 upon
                            the payment of the last TAA instalment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    The reference to the deferred payment scheme under
                            the APA was only to assure [the defendants] that the unpaid pre-Closing
                            taxes on [the Plant Assets] were settled, thereby paving the way for the
                            Liquidator, the Secured Creditors and the Shareholders of [the
                            Corporation] to transfer clean title of [the Plant Assets] to [the
                            defendants].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    If the parties’ intention under the APA was
                            that the deferred payment scheme had the effect of postponing the
                            transfer of title to a much later date after Closing, parties would and
                            should have provided in writing the qualifications to the obligations of
                            the Liquidator, the Secured Creditors and the Shareholders of [the
                            Corporation] under Sections 2.1, 7.2 and/or 7.3 and in other relevant
                            sections of the APA at the time of drafting of the APA. This was simply
                            not done ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original omitted]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>These submissions are confusing and confused. Sentence (1) was
                        not in dispute. Sentence (2) was entirely consistent with the
                        liquidator’s case. In fact, sentence (2) directly contradicts the
                        defendants’ own position (as I understand it) that the
                        liquidator’s obligations under the APA to deliver clean title to the
                        Plant Assets was unqualified. Sentence (3) was (and is) a
                        mischaracterisation of the liquidator’s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    I accept that if the tribunal had considered
                    both parties’ submissions and preferred the defendants’ submissions
                    over those of the liquidator then that must be the end of the matter. I accept
                    also that there would be no breach of natural justice if the tribunal had
                    considered but simply misunderstood the liquidator’s
                submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    What is troubling here is that the line of
                    reasoning adopted by the tribunal does not suggest that it had even considered
                    the liquidator’s submissions. In fact, it is puzzling that the tribunal at
                    paragraph 296 of the award states that there was “not a shred of
                    contemporaneous evidence” in favour of the liquidator’s position
                    (despite the material already described above):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">296. [The secured creditors and the liquidator] submitted that the APA had
                        to be construed in light of the TAA. As has been noted previously, the
                        parties to and the objectives of the two agreements, namely, the APA and the
                        TAA were completely different. The APA was an agreement for the sale and
                        purchase ... whereas the TAA was an agreement made to compromise historic
                        indebtedness and to enable the APA to be concluded to which only the
                        Liquidator and [Erebor] were parties. It is, in the Tribunal’s
                        opinion, improbable that any of the parties thought that the TAA discharged
                        or amended an agreement as comprehensive as the APA. <em>Indeed, it is to be noted there is not a shred of contemporaneous
                            evidence that anyone thought that the TAA had that effect</em>.
                        The Tribunal has no hesitation in rejecting such a submission.</p>

                    paragraphs 352 to 357 of the award. Here, the tribunal pointed out that the
                    historical background to s 5.3(b)(iii)(4) of the APA was important because
                    it was instructive to remember how the TAA became a condition precedent in the
                    APA. The tribunal first recalled that under s 5.3(c) of the MOA entered
                    into in January 2004, the liquidator’s obligation in relation to the
                    Corporation’s outstanding tax liabilities was to:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>apply</em> for the waiver by all appropriate
                        Governmental Authority of all tax liabilities of [the Corporation] affecting
                        any or all of [the Plant Assets], including but not limited to the liability
                        for income and/or real estate taxes ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    The tribunal next recalled that, and I have
                    already mentioned at [31] above, a few days after signing the MOA, the
                    defendants asked the liquidator to apply to Erebor for a waiver of unpaid taxes
                    affecting the Plant Assets or to settle those unpaid taxes if a waiver could not
                    be obtained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    The tribunal then recalls at paragraphs 355
                    and 356 of the award the events which I have described at [33] to [35] above.
                    The SP did not adopt the draft resolution prepared by the liquidator and the
                    defendants to waive the unpaid taxes but instead passed on 3 August 2004 a
                    resolution requiring the city treasurer to levy execution on all of the
                    Corporation’s properties. However, by 7 September 2004, the SP changed its
                    mind and passed the Tax Ordinance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Having described the historical background,
                    the tribunal then concludes at paragraph 357 of the award:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">357. In the light of that factual background, it does not seem to the
                        Tribunal that it is possible to construe the TAA as being intended to or
                        designed to derogate from the Liquidator’s obligation to deliver clean
                        title to [the defendants]. Clearly, what [the defendants] required was
                        unencumbered land, which was available to use as security for future
                        borrowing. That is why, from the outset, [the defendants were] insistent on
                        either the outstanding taxes being paid or a waiver of those taxes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    The tribunal’s analysis is odd, to say
                    the least. It does not seem to appreciate that the very background it described
                    at length militated against its own conclusion. The tribunal construed
                    s 5.3(c) of the MOA as being consistent with the unqualified obligation of
                    the liquidator to deliver unencumbered land to the defendants. In doing so, it
                    conflated the obligation of the liquidator to <em>apply</em> for a waiver of the unpaid taxes with the requirement to
                        <em>obtain</em> the waiver. (Incidentally, the
                    liquidator did in fact apply for the waiver so this condition precedent would
                    have been fulfilled had it been imported into the APA).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    Having conflated the obligations, the
                    tribunal assumed that regardless of the eventual terms which the parties were to
                    negotiate and agree in the APA, it must remain a requirement under the APA that
                    a waiver be obtained in respect of the unpaid taxes or that these unpaid taxes
                    should be settled. Again the tribunal appeared to have reached this conclusion
                    without engaging with the submissions of the liquidator on this
                point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    The APA was entered into on 10 September
                    2004, that is, three days <em>after</em> the SP enacted the
                    Tax Ordinance. By this time, the defendants <em>knew</em>
                    that the Pre-Closing Taxes were not waived and could not be waived. If the
                    defendants wanted the liquidator to pay all unpaid realty taxes prior to
                    closing, the defendants could have attempted to negotiate a condition precedent
                    in the APA to that effect. If the liquidator balked, the defendants had the
                    option of terminating the MOA<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> and walking away from the transaction at the
                    expiry of the exclusivity period (which incidentally was also on 10 September
                    2004) on the basis that the venture had become no longer commercially
                        viable.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    The defendants did not do so. Instead, they
                    signed the APA on the last day of the exclusivity period under the MOA
                        (<em>ie</em>, 10 September 2004) without importing
                    s 5.3(c) of the MOA into the APA. In other words, the defendants decided
                    that it was in their commercial interest to compromise by requiring the
                    liquidator to do no more than deliver the TAA under s 5.3(b)(iii)(4) of the
                    APA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    However, as I have mentioned above, showing
                    that the tribunal erred in its reasoning does not establish a breach of natural
                    justice. I am, however, satisfied that the liquidator has established that the
                    tribunal disregarded his evidence and submissions on this point. In the
                    circumstances, it was simply inexplicable that the tribunal did not even engage
                    with the liquidator’s argument that the Tax Ordinance and the TAA must
                    have been in the contemplation of all parties when they entered into the
                    TAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(4) The tribunal’s discussion of the secured creditors’
                witnesses’ evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    The fourth passage which Mr Yeap relies on
                    is paragraph 358 (which has to be read together with paragraph 359) of the
                    award:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">358. It was suggested by [the representatives of the secured creditors]
                        that [the defendants] knew from the outset that it would not get clean title
                        until 2012 when the TAA came to an end. There was no documentary evidence to
                        support that suggestion, and [the defendants’] witnesses all denied
                        that they had any such knowledge. Significantly, neither [the liquidator]
                        nor the Secured Creditors made such a suggestion in the contemporaneous
                        correspondence, and [the liquidator’s] attempt to advance the argument
                        in his oral evidence was clearly an afterthought and unpersuasive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">359. In the result, the Tribunal is unable to accept the evidence of [the
                        representatives of the secured creditors], and has no doubt that [the
                        defendants] believed, quite understandably, that clean title was going to be
                        delivered to it at or soon after Closing. It seems to the Tribunal highly
                        improbable that [the defendants] would have been prepared to invest in [the
                        Corporation’s Mithril plant] if [they were] not immediately going to
                        get clean title.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Mr Yeap points to this passage as proof that
                    the tribunal simply preferred the defendants’ case. I disagree. As I have
                    mentioned above, it was never the liquidator’s case that the TAA <em>varied</em> his obligations under the APA to acknowledge
                    contractually that the defendants could not mortgage the land to raise
                    additional financing until the last instalment of the TAA was paid in
                        2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> If anything,
                    this passage shows that the tribunal had reached its conclusion by rejecting an
                    argument that was never made to it, and thereby ignoring the arguments that were
                    made to it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on Issue 1</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    In light of the above, I am satisfied that
                    the liquidator was denied natural justice and that the award should be set aside
                    in its entirety for this reason alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 2: Did the tribunal fail to consider the liquidator’s and
                the secured creditors’ arguments, evidence and submissions on the issue of
                whether the defendants were responsible for the revocation of the TAA?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The liquidator’s and the secured creditors’
                submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    The liquidator’s case was that the
                    revocation of the TAA was caused (or primarily caused) by the defendants. As a
                    result, the defendants had only themselves to blame for any loss suffered as a
                    result of being unable to obtain clean title to the Plant Assets. In other
                    words, the defendants’ actions broke the chain of causation between any
                    breach of the APA and any loss which the defendants suffered. The
                    liquidator’s evidence and submissions in support of this position before
                    the tribunal can be summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_124-p2_a"></a>(a)     By purchasing the Plant Assets, the
                        defendants had purchased not only the Plant <em>Land</em> Assets but also the Plant <em>Non-Land</em> Assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_124-p2_b"></a>(b)     The defendants accepted that it was responsible for the
                        payment of Post-Closing Plant Asset Taxes (the second category of taxes
                        which were due on both Plant Land Assets and Plant Non-Land Assets; see [63]
                        above). This was confirmed by a key concession during the cross-examination
                        of one of the defendants’ witnesses, Mr X:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">Mr Yeo:    [Mr X], by this time, when you got this
                                letter of 22 March 2005, you were aware of this requirement under
                                the tax amnesty agreement, that current taxes had to be kept current
                                -- that current taxes had to be paid, otherwise one of the
                                consequences would be that the tax amnesty agreement is revoked. You
                                were aware of that point by then, right?</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">Mr X:  Yeah, from this letter, yes, definitely,
                                yes.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">Mr Yeo:    You were also aware that as between [the
                                defendants] and [the secured creditors and the liquidator], [the
                                defendants] had undertaken to pay the post-closing taxes in relation
                                to the properties -- land and non-land -- transferred to them, sold
                                to them; correct?</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">Mr X:  Yes, post-closing taxes was our
                                responsibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_124-p2_c"></a>(c)     At the
                        relevant time, the defendants were liaising with Erebor to obtain a tax
                        exemption for Post-Closing Plant Assets Taxes in relation to the Plant
                        Assets but were ultimately unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_124-p2_d"></a>(d)     The defendants failed to pay any of the
                        Post-Closing Plant Asset Taxes in relation to the Plant <em>Non-Land</em> Assets in 2005. The defendants also did not pay the
                        sum of about US$51,500 which it said represented the 2005 Post-Closing Plant
                        Asset Taxes in relation to the Plant <em>Land</em>
                            Assets<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_124-p2_e"></a>(e)     In the circumstances, the revocation
                        of the TAA was caused (or primarily caused) by the defendants’ own
                        breaches and so they could not rely on their own breach(es) or blame the
                        liquidator for the revocation of the TAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Mr Yeo argues that the tribunal ignored the
                    undisputed facts and the defendants’ concessions and did not actively
                    consider the liquidator’s submissions and arguments. In doing so, Mr Yeo
                    submits that the tribunal decided this issue for reasons of its own and thereby
                    breached the rules of natural justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    The secured creditors’ case before the
                    tribunal in summary was that the defendants were under a contractual obligation
                    under s 6.01(e) of the OMNA to pay the Post-Closing Plant Assets Taxes (see
                    [55(b)] above). It was therefore the defendants’ failure to pay the
                    Post-Closing Plant Asset Taxes that had caused the TAA to be revoked.
                    Alternatively, the secured creditors argued that they should not be held liable
                    jointly with the liquidator for any of his breaches of the TAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    Before me, counsel for the secured creditors
                    Mr Singh argues that the tribunal’s reasoning in the award shows that when
                    it dealt with s 6.01(e) of the OMNA, it failed to appreciate that the
                    liquidator and the secured creditors stood in a different position as against
                    the defendants. On that basis, he argues that the tribunal did not expressly or
                    implicitly deal with the secured creditor’s separate arguments in this
                    regard and thereby breached the rules of natural justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendants’ submissions </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Mr Yeap points to four separate passages in
                    the award to show that the tribunal more than adequately dealt with the issue of
                    revocation and that there was therefore no breach of the rules of natural
                    justice. I shall deal with each of them in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Analysis of the tribunal’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(1) The tribunal’s remarks that revocation of the TAA was a
                “hotly contested” issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    Mr Yeap first points to paragraph 148 of the
                    award where the tribunal referred to the reasons for the revocation of the TAA
                    as a “hotly contested” issue:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">148. The revocation of the TAA, and the reasons for that revocation, were
                        amongst the most hotly contested issues in the arbitration. [The defendants]
                        contended that the reason for the revocation was the failure of the
                        Liquidator to comply with the terms of the TAA. For his part, the
                        Liquidator, who was joined by the Secured Creditors in this submission,
                        contended that the reason for the revocation was that [the defendants]
                        failed to pay the taxes due on the parcels of land transferred to [them]
                        during 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Mr Yeap argues that this showed that the tribunal was fully
                        aware of the revocation issue and the submissions advanced by both
                        parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    As I have already said, the mere fact that
                    the tribunal acknowledges that an issue is live does not necessarily mean that
                    the tribunal has engaged with the submissions and arguments of both sides on
                    that issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    It is pertinent that the tribunal in this
                    passage says that “the Liquidator, who was joined by the Secured
                    Creditors in this submission, contended that the reason for the revocation was
                    that [the defendants] failed to pay the taxes due on the <em>parcels of land</em> transferred to it during 2005” [emphasis
                    added]. With respect, this misstates the liquidator’s (and the secured
                    creditors’) position. It is not disputed that the liquidator’s
                    position in the arbitration was that the defendants had failed to pay taxes to
                    settle the Post-Closing Plant Taxes in 2005. But this failure includes not only
                    the taxes due on the parcels of land (<em>ie</em>, Plant
                        <em>Land</em> Assets) but also the taxes due on the
                    Plant <em>Non-Land</em> Assets. It is also undisputed that
                    the liquidator repeatedly stated his position in the arbitration. The
                    tribunal’s error in this regard is consistent with Mr Yeo’s
                    submission that it had no actual regard for the submissions made by the
                    liquidator. It was also consistent with Mr Singh’s submission that the
                    tribunal had simply dealt with the liquidator and the secured creditors as if
                    they were a single entity, thereby depriving the secured creditors of their
                    right to have their separate submissions considered in light of their separate
                    position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    Further, this passage (as well as the
                    tribunal’s main analysis of this issue) appears in the part of the award
                    where the tribunal is discussing the chronology of events. I found this rather
                    curious. It was not at all clear whether the tribunal truly appreciated how the
                    issue of revocation was relevant in light of its own finding that the secured
                    creditors and the liquidator were in breach of the APA from the very outset
                    because the TAA did not have the effect of removing the statutory liens over the
                    Plant Assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    When I pressed Mr Yeap on this point in oral
                    submissions, he took the position that the tribunal’s analysis of this
                    issue was completely irrelevant to the issue of the US$80m in damages it awarded
                    to the defendants, but was relevant only to the issue of who was responsible for
                    paying the penalties and interest on the unpaid back taxes, when those penalties
                    and interest became payable upon the revocation of the TAA. In my view, this
                    made the location of the tribunal’s analysis of this issue within the
                    context of its entire award even more curious.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    In any event, as we shall see below, even
                    though the tribunal ostensibly recognised the importance of the issue to the
                    parties, the award does not actually analyse (i) the liquidator’s
                    submissions and the evidence put forward or (ii) the secured creditors’
                    submissions on this point at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(2) The tribunal accepted the liquidator’s purported concession
                that he was liable for the current taxes in 2005</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    Mr Yeap next relies on paragraphs 227 to 248
                    of the award where he says the tribunal determined that it was the liquidator
                    who was responsible for the TAA being revoked and shows that the tribunal simply
                    preferred the defendants’ evidence, arguments and submissions over the
                    liquidator’s.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    In paragraphs 227, 228 and 236 of the award,
                    the tribunal holds that the secured creditors’ payment on behalf of the
                    liquidator of about US$108,000 on 27 December 2005 to Erebor for the
                    Post-Closing Retained Assets Taxes (the third category of taxes; see [64] above)
                    was not sufficient to discharge all of the outstanding taxes, leaving a
                    shortfall of around about US$11,000. The liquidator himself acknowledged this in
                    a letter to Erebor dated 28 March 2006. The liquidator therefore owed
                    outstanding taxes to Erebor as at 31 December 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    At paragraphs 244 and 246 to 248 of the
                    award, the tribunal finds that as a result, the TAA was automatically revoked on
                    1 January 2006:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">244. Accordingly, the Tribunal holds that on the
                            31<sup>st</sup> December 2005, or at the latest, the
                            1<sup>st</sup> January 2006, the TAA was automatically
                        revoked.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">246. There was also considerable debate about whether, if the TAA was
                        automatically revoked by reason of the failure to pay current taxes after
                        Closing, the fault was that of the Liquidator or of [the defendants].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">247. <em>In the Liquidator’s Written Reply Closing
                            Submissions, he accepts that he was ultimately liable for payment of
                            current taxes</em> vis-à-vis [<em>Erebor</em>]<em>: see Paragraph 64.1. The Tribunal
                            agrees with that concession.</em> The Liquidator goes on to assert
                        that [the defendants] had a contractual responsibility to the Liquidator for
                        paying the current taxes. The Tribunal finds no justification for that
                        assertion in the APA, and the provision upon which the Liquidator relies
                        (Section 6.01(e) of the [OMNA]) contains a covenant to the Secured Creditors
                        and the Facility Agent but not to the Liquidator.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">248. The Tribunal finds that the TAA was automatically revoked by reason
                        of the failure of the Liquidator to pay the current taxes during 2005. The
                        latest date upon which the automatic revocation took place was the
                            1<sup>st</sup> January 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    In summary, the tribunal’s decision
                    that it was the liquidator who caused the revocation of the TAA at the latest on
                    1 January 2006 by failing to pay the full amount of (all) current taxes by 31
                    December 2005 turned on the liquidator’s concession that he was liable for
                    the payment of (all) current taxes (that means to say both the Post-Closing
                    Plant Assets Taxes and the Post-Closing Retained Assets Taxes). The tribunal
                    found that the liquidator was unable to rely on s 6.01(e) of the OMNA since
                    the defendants’ covenant to pay Post-Closing Plant Asset Taxes was given
                    only to the secured creditors and not to the liquidator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    In my judgment, the mere fact that the
                    tribunal dealt with an issue and gave its reasons for doing so does not mean
                    that it has considered both sides’ submissions. In fact, it is possible to
                    infer from the tribunal’s reasoning that it failed to address its mind or
                    to engage with one party’s submissions at all. I make the following
                    observations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    First, the tribunal fails even to mention
                    the express admission of the defendants’ witness Mr X that the defendants
                    were obliged to make payment of the Post-Closing Plant Assets Taxes (which
                    related to both Plant Land Assets and Plant Non-Land Assets) even though the tax
                    declarations remained in the name of the Corporation (see [124(b)] above).
                    Neither does the tribunal refer to the liquidator’s point that the
                    defendants refused to make payment of the Post-Closing Plant Asset taxes in
                    relation to the Plant Non-Land Assets for which they unsuccessfully sought tax
                    exemptions. Instead, the tribunal focuses only on the question of payment of
                    taxes for the Plant Land Assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    Second, and related to the first point, the
                    chronology set out by the tribunal in the award does not include the
                    correspondence between the defendants and Erebor in which the defendants sought
                    exemptions for the payment of taxes on the Plant Non-Land Assets. An example of
                    this is the tribunal’s summary of a letter dated 15 April 2005 which the
                    tribunal refers to at paragraph 184 of the award:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">184. On the 15<sup>th</sup> April 2005, [the
                        defendants’ in-house counsel] wrote a lengthy letter to [the city
                        treasurer]. She disputed the computation contained in [the city
                        treasurer’s] letter dated the 4<sup>th</sup> February
                        2005. She told [the city treasurer] that the reason for the dispute was that
                        the computation was “based on the assessed value of all properties
                        belonging to [the Corporation]”, but reminded him that only four
                        parcels of land had been assigned to [the defendants]. [The
                        defendants’ in-house counsel] said that there was a need for a
                        reconciliation of the city treasurer’s records and documents with [the
                        defendants'] authorised representatives …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original omitted]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The tribunal in its summary of the 15 April 2005 letter above
                        curiously refers only to the second and fifth paragraph of the letter but
                        omits the third and fourth paragraph which make it clear that the defendants
                        were aware that they were responsible for paying the 2005 Post-Closing Plant
                        Assets Taxes in respect of the Plant Non-Land Assets:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With respect to the buildings and machineries and other immovable
                        properties which were assigned to [the first defendant] under a Deed of

                        by the Asian Appraisal is only [about US$151.4m]. Please be reminded that
                        these machineries, buildings and other immovables have already depreciated
                        and the same have not been operational since 1999 when [the Corporation]
                        ceased operations. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is very important that your Office should also be informed that our
                        company has a pending request with the Honourable city mayor and the [SP]

                        Incentives Code] of [Erebor]. These tax exemptions are available to new
                        investors and even to existing enterprises which are being revived and whose

                        is still pending study by a Committee headed by [one of the Erebor City
                        Councillors] which Committee was specifically created for such purpose.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    Third, the tribunal’s reliance on the
                    liquidator’s concession that he was legally liable for the payment of all
                    the current taxes in 2005 was taken completely out of context. It is undisputed
                    that the liquidator remained legally liable to Erebor for all taxes so long as
                    he remained the nominal owner of the property on the title registry. However, it
                    was also undisputed that the defendants were responsible for the payment of the
                    Post-Closing Plant Asset Taxes. In order to arrive at its conclusion, it was
                    necessary for the tribunal to deal with and give reasons for dismissing the
                    concession of Mr X. But it did not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    In coming to its conclusion, it also appears
                    that the tribunal departed in a significant respect from the submissions of both
                    parties, and in particular, from the submissions of the defendants. From the
                    written submissions before the tribunal, it was clear that the defendants’
                    position was that the liquidator was delinquent in paying the Post-Closing
                        <em>Retained Assets</em> Taxes (not the Post-Closing
                        <em>Plant Assets</em> Taxes) in 2004 (not
                        2005),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> such that the TAA was automatically
                    revoked by as early as January 2005 (not January 2006).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> As for the defendants’ non-payment of
                    the Post-Closing Plant Asset Taxes in respect of the Plant <em>Non-Land</em> Assets, the defendants’ case (on which extensive
                    submissions were made) was that it could not be faulted for failing to pay these
                    taxes because of the actions of Erebor and the liquidator. In other words, the
                    defendants <em>accepted</em> that it was responsible for
                    paying Post-Closing Plant Assets Taxes but offered a defence for its failure to
                    do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    This much was conceded by Mr Yeap during
                    oral submissions before me:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Yeap:    Let me pause here. We never said we had no
                            responsibility in general to pay the post closing taxes, so this issue
                            is really a red herring. We always said we were trying to pay, we were
                            trying to pay the post closing taxes. And I have shown your Honour we
                            are trying to, we needed to get it discharged. <em>So we
                                never took the basis you, the liquidator, had to pay the post
                                closing taxes. That was never our case</em>. So the statement
                            that somehow the tribunal got it wrong, your Honour, is -- and I will
                            demonstrate to your Honour further on this. That is a total
                            mischaracterisation of how the issues were dealt with below. We accepted
                            we were supposed to be paying, we were trying to pay.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Court:    Which statement do you mean?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Yeap:    That [the defendants] had -- there was some
                            allegation by the applicants that the tribunal did not consider or was
                            under a misapprehension as to whether [the defendants] had an obligation
                            to pay post closing taxes. I will come back to that when I get to that
                            point further. I'll just leave it for the time being, your
                            Honour.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Court:    Very well.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Yeap:    So in paragraph 247, your Honour, your Honour
                            will see that the tribunal has made the point that the liquidator is
                            ultimately liable for payment of the current taxes
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[reads out paragraph 247 of the award]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I'll show your Honour the tribunal's -- how they pick up the issue
                        later.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Suffice to say, I also went through the APA again and as I recall there is
                        no specific provision in the APA saying that [the defendants were] to bear
                        the post closing [tax].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Court:    I know. But [Mr X, the key witness of the
                            defendants] admitted it in cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Yeap:    He accepted that. <em>We
                                proceeded on the basis that we were responsible, that's why we were
                                trying to pay.</em> So for us to say we had no real
                            responsibility had clean title been given to us -- our case was that if
                            -- you were supposed to give us clean title, we would have … paid
                            all the post closing [taxes], we were trying it pay the post closing
                            [taxes] but it became a being problem because of the back
                        taxes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I was thus satisfied from the above that the tribunal had
                        determined the issue on its own basis without regard to evidence and
                        submissions before it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(3) The tribunal “agreed” with the defendants that it
                was excused from its obligation to pay current taxes</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    The third passage Mr Yeap relies on is
                    paragraphs 409 to 411 of the award where the tribunal agreed with the defendants
                    that they did not have to pay current taxes because of the liquidator’s
                    and secured creditor’s breach of their obligations under the APA to
                    deliver clean title:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">409.  [The defendants contend] that [a specific
                            principle of Morian law] is irrelevant because the reason why [the

                                it was</em> [<em>their</em>] <em>responsibility to do so</em>, was because [they were]

                            years provided for [under another principle] in respect of claims under
                            a written contract where there is a claim for specific
                            performance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">410.  Thus, [say the defendants], as the Liquidator and
                            the Secured Creditors are in breach of their obligations under the APA,
                            [the defendants are] excused from performance of [their] obligations,
                            and time does not being to run against [them].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">411.  The Tribunal has concluded that [the
                            defendants’] submissions are correct. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    Mr Yeap says that the tribunal’s
                    phrase “if it was its responsibility to do so” in the passage
                    above shows implicitly that the tribunal took into account Mr X’s
                    admission and any submissions on it that the defendants was responsible for
                    paying Post-Closing Plant Asset Taxes. I do not agree. If this passage was
                    indeed meant to acknowledge Mr X’s admission and deal with it, then the
                    tribunal would have dealt with it in paragraph 247 where the tribunal was
                        <em>specifically</em> addressing its mind to that
                    question in the context of the revocation of the TAA. Having considered the
                    submissions of both sides, I am satisfied that this passage supports, rather
                    than undermines the liquidator’s and the secured creditors’ case
                    that there has been a breach of natural justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    The first point to make is that the
                    tribunal’s discussion in this passage is in relation to the issue of
                    whether a limitation defence was available to the liquidator and the secured
                    creditors under a certain principle of Morian law. It is therefore unclear, in
                    light of the tribunal’s own logic, how the issue of revocation was at all
                    related to the question of limitation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    It was also inexplicable why the tribunal
                    ascribed to the defendants an argument which the defendants did not make at all.
                    The defendants’ case in the arbitration on the limitation defence had
                    nothing to do with the revocation issue. Instead, it was framed as
                        follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[The defendants] say that [the liquidator and the secured creditors] have
                        cited the wrong [principle of Morian law] in relation to [the
                        defendants’] claim. [The defendants’] claim is based on the
                        reciprocal obligations under the APA (<em>the duties to pay
                            the Purchase Price and to deliver clean title to</em> [<em>the Plant Assets</em>]). According to [another principle
                        of Morian law], upon a breach of such reciprocal obligations, [the
                        defendants], being the injured [parties], may choose between fulfilment and
                        rescission of the obligation of the Liquidator, [the secured creditors]
                        and/or the [the shareholders of the Corporation] to deliver clean title of
                        [the Plant Assets] to [the defendants], with payment of damages in either
                        case. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    The defendants’ case therefore was
                    that it was entitled to withhold its payments under the notes so long as it had
                    not received clean title to the Plant Assets. Also, as conceded by Mr Yeap
                    above, it <em>was</em> the defendants’ case that they
                    were responsible for paying Post-Closing Plant Asset Taxes. There was therefore
                    no uncertainty about the position which would have warranted the tribunal using
                    the conditional form “if it was its responsibility to do so” when
                    describing the defendants’ position in respect of the Post-Closing Plant
                    Asset Taxes. In the circumstances, I am of the view that the tribunal’s
                    adoption of this argument for a completely unrelated point to my mind is not a
                    “middle path” between both parties’ submissions (<em>cf Soh Beng Tee</em> at [65(e)]). I agree with Mr Yeo that
                    the tribunal’s conclusion at paragraphs 409 to 411 of the award appears to
                    have been reached on its own basis with no reference to either parties’
                    submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    In any event, Mr Yeap’s reliance on
                    this passage was in truth an afterthought by the defendants as it did not appear
                    in the defendants’ written submissions in the applications and was
                    advanced for the first time only in oral submissions before me.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(4) The tribunal found that the defendants had mitigated their losses
                and acted reasonably in refusing to pay the outstanding “back-taxes”
                in 2005</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    The fourth passage which Mr Yeap relies
                        on<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> is found at paragraphs 459 to 465 of the award.
                    Again, this was a submission that was raised only in oral submissions before me
                    and which did not appear in any of the defendants’ written submissions
                    prior to that. In summary, the tribunal here was dealing with the liquidator and
                    secured creditor’s contention that the defendants had failed to mitigate
                    its loss. In particular, the tribunal was considering the liquidator’s and
                    the secured creditors’ submission that the defendants should have come
                    forward to pay the outstanding amount of back taxes (that is, Pre-Closing Taxes)
                    which the secured creditors and the liquidators were contractually liable to pay
                    under the APA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    The tribunal went through the conduct of the
                    parties throughout 2005, including the attempt by both the liquidator and the
                    defendants to persuade Erebor to apply the first TAA instalment towards the
                    Pre-Closing Taxes related to the Plant Land Assets, and concluded that the
                    defendants had behaved reasonably in the circumstances. Mr Yeap submits that
                    when read together with the other three passages above, the tribunal has made it
                    clear that it is the liquidator, and not the defendants, who was responsible for
                    the revocation of the TAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    This submission was a complete non-starter.
                    The tribunal here was dealing with the Pre-Closing Taxes. It was not dealing
                    with the post-closing tax obligations at all. Thus, if this passage was really
                    intended to resolve the issue of revocation (which it was not), again it
                    supports the liquidator’s and the secured creditors’ argument that
                    the tribunal ignored their arguments which centred around the responsibility for
                    paying Post-Closing Plant Assets Taxes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on Issue 2</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    Reading the award as a whole and having
                    regard to the documents which were placed before me, I am satisfied that the
                    liquidator was denied natural justice and that, even if I am wrong on Issue 1,
                    the award should be set aside in its entirety on the basis of my finding on
                    Issue 2. Given that I have found in favour of the liquidator, I do not find it
                    necessary to discuss the secured creditors’ submissions on this issue in
                    any more detail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 3: Did the tribunal, in awarding damages to the defendants for
                their loss of an opportunity to earn profits, exceed its powers by dealing with a
                matter that had not been submitted to it?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The applicable legal principles on Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model
                Law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    The relevant legal principles are not in
                    dispute. Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law provides that an arbitral award may
                    be set aside by the court if the award deals with a dispute not contemplated by
                    or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or contains
                    decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to the
                    arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    The Court of Appeal discussed the law on
                    setting aside an award on the ground of excess of jurisdiction under Art
                    34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law in <em>CRW Joint Operation v PT
                        Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) TBK</em> [2011] 4 SLR 305 at [31] to
                    [33] (“<em>CRW v PGN</em>”). As the Court of
                    Appeal said at [31]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31    It is useful, at this juncture, to set out some of
                            the legal principles underlying the application of Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of
                            the Model Law. First, Art 34(2)(a)(iii) is not concerned with the
                            situation where an arbitral tribunal did not have jurisdiction to deal
                            with the dispute which it purported to determine. Rather, it applies
                            where the arbitral tribunal improperly decided matters that [were not]
                            submitted to it or failed to decide matters that [were] submitted to it.
                            In other words, Art 34(2)(a)(iii) addresses the situation where the
                            arbitral tribunal exceeded (or failed to exercise) the authority that
                            the parties granted to it ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    The Court of Appeal made it clear in
                        <em>CRW v PGN</em> at [32] that in order to set aside
                    an award under Art 34(2)(a)(iii), in addition to satisfying the court that the
                    case comes within that provision, applicant must also satisfy the court that it
                    suffered actual or real prejudice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    The question of what matters are within the
                    scope of a submission to arbitration was recently considered by the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>PT Prima International Development v Kempinski
                        Hotels SA and other appeals</em> [2012] 4 SLR 98 (“<em>Kempinski</em>”). In <em>Kempinski</em>, the Court of Appeal emphasised (at [33] and [36]) the
                    importance that pleadings and the memorandum of issues play in delineating the
                    issues which are before an arbitral tribunal:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">33    The role of pleadings in arbitral proceedings is to
                            provide a convenient way for the parties to define the jurisdiction of
                            the arbitrator by setting out the precise nature and scope of the
                            disputes in respect of which they seek the arbitrator's adjudication.
                            ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">36    … In
                            arbitration, the parties can determine the scope of the arbitration

                            <em>vis-à-vis</em> the issues to be tried. As Dyson
                            LJ observed in <em>Al-Medenni v Mars UK
                                Limited</em> [2005] EWCA Civ 1041 at [21]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... It is fundamental to our adversarial system of justice that the
                            parties should clearly identify the issues that arise in the litigation,
                            so that each has the opportunity of responding to the points made by the
                            other. <em>The function of the judge is to adjudicate on
                                those issues alone. The parties may have their own reasons for
                                limiting the issues or presenting them in a certain way. The judge
                                can invite, and even encourage, the parties to recast or modify the
                                issues. Bu[t] if they refuse to do so, the judge must respect that
                                decision. One consequence of this may be that the judge is compelled
                                to reject a claim on the basis on which it is advanced, although he
                                or she is of the opinion that it would have succeeded if it had been
                                advanced on a different basis. Such an outcome may be unattractive,
                                but any other approach leads to uncertainty and potentially real
                                unfairness.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    Recognising that arbitration is a dynamic
                    and flexible process, the Court of Appeal also recognised at [37] that it was
                    possible to introduce new issues so long as the adjudicatory process ensures
                    procedural fairness:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">37    … Even where a new issue is raised by the
                            court on its own motion as a result of the evidence adduced during the
                            trial, the defence should, for the sake of good order, be amended so
                            that the plaintiff may file an amended reply and, if necessary, call
                            rebuttal evidence on the new issue. This is an established process to
                            ensure fairness to the party affected by the new issue. From the court's
                            perspective, any issue of fact and/or law that is relevant to the
                            dispute before it will normally be allowed to be raised by way of an
                            amendment to the pleadings so that all the issues relevant to the
                            dispute can be disposed of at the same time in the same trial (subject
                            only to the principle that a proposed amendment to a party's pleadings,
                            if allowed, must not result in prejudice to the other party which cannot
                            be compensated by way of costs).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    Thus, if a tribunal is of the view that a
                    party has not addressed the real issue on which the dispute before it turns, it
                    ought to invite that party to amend its pleadings so as to place that issue
                    squarely before the tribunal and to give unambiguous notice to the opposing
                    party that that issue is to be presented to and considered by the tribunal.
                    Having said that, the Court of Appeal also held that the failure of one party to
                    amend its pleadings cannot be determinative of whether the issue has been
                    submitted to the tribunal. Rather, the key question is one of substance over
                    form. The question is whether the opposing side was given sufficient notice of
                    and opportunity to meet the new case: <em>Kempinski</em> at
                    [47].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    This is, of course, subject to two
                    qualifications. First, a party cannot unilaterally enlarge the tribunal’s
                    jurisdiction beyond that permitted by the parties’ arbitration agreement
                    simply by the manner in which it frames its pleadings. Second, while each party
                    is entitled to an opportunity to present its case, it is entitled only to a
                        <em>reasonable</em> opportunity to do so. So a tribunal
                    before whom a party seeks to reframe its case, with or without consequential
                    amendments to its pleadings will have to consider whether acceding to that
                    request will cause unreasonable prejudice to the opposing party.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">My decision on Issue 3</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(1) The defendants’ own case on damages was that it had
                suffered a loss of actual profits and not a loss of an opportunity to earn
                profits</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    Mr Yeap accepts that the defendants’
                    pleadings characterised their loss as a loss of profits and sought compensation
                    equivalent to those profits lost. He accepts also, as he must, that the tribunal
                    approached the defendants’ loss as a lost opportunity to earn profits and
                    not as a loss of actual profits. His argument was that the issue of whether the
                    defendants had lost an opportunity to earn profits was always a live issue
                    before the tribunal. In support, he relies on the defendants’ notice of
                    arbitration. The defendants concluded their list of relief claimed with a
                    generic claim for damages:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">RELIEF SOUGHT</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">61. [The defendants] seek the following orders and reliefs:</p>

                        the APA;</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    According to Mr Yeap, the prayer for generic
                    “damages” was broad enough to include damages for loss
                    characterised as a lost opportunity to earn profits. I do not agree. Damages is
                    the default remedy for a cause of action in contract and is simply a claim
                    compensation for the loss suffered. The real question is, having regard to the
                    pleadings, evidence and submissions, what did the defendants assert they had
                    lost as a result of the breaches of contract alleged?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    Having considered the material put before
                        me,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> I agree with the secured
                    creditors and the liquidator that the defendants characterised their loss as the
                    actual profits that they would have earned but which they failed to earn because
                    of the breaches of contract. For virtually the entire arbitration, their claim
                    was framed as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_164-p2_a"></a>(a)     the defendants intended to mortgage
                        the Plant Assets in order to obtain additional financing amounting to US$86m
                        (later increased to US$106m);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_164-p2_b"></a>(b)     the purpose of the additional loans was to finance the
                        works needed to modernise and rehabilitate the Plant
                    Assets;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_164-p2_c"></a>(c)     because
                        the Plant Assets did not come with clean title, the defendants were unable
                        to obtain the additional loans from banks; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_164-p2_d"></a>(d)     because the defendants were unable to obtain
                        the additional loans, they would have earned actual profits for which they
                        ought to be compensated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    None of the documents which the defendants
                    presented to the tribunal and placed before me on these applications
                    characterised their loss as the loss of an opportunity to earn profits. In the
                    memorandum of issues jointly prepared by the parties to the arbitration, the
                    parties together framed the issue as one relating to a loss of profits. Thus,
                    for example:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    In the event the Tribunal finds that the
                            Liquidator, [the secured creditors] and/or the [shareholders of the
                            Corporation] breached the above mentioned
                            obligations/warranties/representations, what losses, damages and/or
                                <em>losses of profits</em> (if any) [the

                            sub-issues arise, namely, whether the Liquidator, the [the secured
                            creditors] and/or the [shareholders of the Corporation] are liable

                            third party financial institutions, and if so, the amount thereof. In
                            relation to this, the following sub-issues also arise:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(i)    whether the alleged breach(es) caused <em>the loss of profits</em> claimed by [the

                            claim for such <em>loss of profit</em> is affected
                            by the alleged failure on the part of [the defendants] to pay post
                            Closing taxes, which allegedly led to the revocation of the TAA
                            ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    In some arbitrations, the memorandum of
                    issues includes a catch-all provision which gives the arbitral tribunal some
                    latitude to add issues which are not expressly listed (see for example <em>TMM Division Maritima SA de CV v Pacific Richfield Marine Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2013] 4 SLR 972 at [52]). There was no such provision here.
                    Instead, the concluding provision in paragraph 8 of the agreed memorandum of
                    issues merely recorded that: “The Parties reserve their rights to modify,
                    vary and/or supplement the contents of this Memorandum.” This is entirely
                    consistent with the secured creditors’ and the liquidator’s position
                    that the tribunal was not given the unilateral power to add to the issues which
                    were expressly listed in the memorandum of issues. While the parties did agree
                    in paragraph 8 of the memorandum of issues that they remained free to modify,
                    vary or supplement the issues, party could not do so unilaterally, with no
                    notice formal or informal to the other party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    The defendants continued to characterise
                    their loss in this way up to and including the defendants’ written closing
                    submissions dated 23 May 2011. Those submissions stated the following at
                    paragraph 293:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">293. [t]he <em>quantification of loss of profits</em>
                        suffered by [the defendants] as a result of [the secured creditors and the
                        liquidators’] breaches of their obligations/ warranties/
                        representations under the APA is set out in the Witness Statement of [one of
                        the defendants’ experts] signed on 3 November 2010. The <em>loss of profits</em> as at 31 December 2009 was
                        quantified at US$368.578 million.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    It is to my mind clear beyond doubt that the
                    sole basis of the defendants’ case on loss before the tribunal was that by
                    reason of the breaches of contract which they alleged, the defendants would
                    actually have earned profits and ought therefore to be compensated for those
                    actual lost profits. It quantified those lost profits at
                US$368.578m.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(2) The tribunal understood the defendants’ original claim in
                the award as one of loss of profits</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    The tribunal also understood the
                    defendants’ case on loss as one concerning the loss of actual profits and
                    not the loss of an opportunity to earn profits. During the defendants’
                    oral closing submissions on 21 October 2011, Mr Yeap addressed the tribunal on
                    the alleged lack of evidence that the defendants had tried but failed to obtain
                    additional funding to modernise the steel plant. The chairman of the tribunal
                    then suggested that the defendants ought to be seeking compensation for the loss
                    of an opportunity to earn profits as opposed to seeking compensation for the
                    loss of actual profits:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Yeap:    Yes, but if you are expecting us to get
                            specific bankers to come and say "I was running this bank at that time,
                            [the defendants] had approached me and I had said no only because of
                            this reason", firstly, I don't think that would be realistic, if I may
                            say so, because of the nature of the litigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Chairman:    But what you are really then talking about,
                            Mr Yeap, is not actually the inability to raise the funds, it's the loss
                            of the opportunity.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Yeap:    I know. I was going to say that also. At the
                            end of the day, I was going to say that if the Tribunal felt that there
                            was a loss of an opportunity, <em>certainly it would be
                                open to the Tribunal to analyse it as a loss of a chance, or
                                alternatively what we call temperate damages</em>, which
                            incidentally has already been referred to in [the defendant’s
                            Morian Law expert, Justice A’s] first statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Like the common law principles, if the Tribunal is of the view that we
                        have suffered loss and it's a question of difficulty in proving that loss,
                        the quantum, then it is open to the Tribunal to give damages which it
                        believes to be fair and reasonable. So they've got the same principle as we
                        do in the common law system. It's not a new point, it has been flagged from
                        day one.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Chairman:    
              <em>But neither courts nor
                                tribunals just pluck figures out of the
                        air.</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Yeap:    Yes. I was going to say that <em>in considering what is fair and reasonable, it would be
                                open to the Tribunal to analyse this from a chance perspective. But
                                it may not be seen as a loss of a chance</em> per se<em>, but it dovetails with the concept of temperate
                                damages.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Arbitrator 1:    Yes so are you saying that temperate
                            damages is the [Morian law] equivalent of the concept of a loss of a
                            chance?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Yeap:    
              <em>I would say that they may
                                not be entirely equivalent, but the loss of a chance may well come
                                within the temperate damages doctrine.</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Chairman:    [Justice A] refers to temperate damages, but
                            I don't think so [the secured creditors’ and the
                            liquidator’s Morian Law expert Justice B] specifically deals with
                            this question.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Yeap:    No one asked [Justice A] about temperate
                            damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Chairman:    No, but I think he did deal with temperate
                            damages in his --</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Yeap:    Yes, it's in his statement. That's right we
                            dealt with exemplary, we dealt with temperate, we dealt with all kinds
                            of damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Chairman:    All I said was I don't think that [Justice
                            B] actually dealt with temperate damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Yeap:    He had every opportunity to do
                        so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Chairman:    Well.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Yeap:    You are correct.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Chairman:    But equally, <em>I don't
                                think that Justice A gave us much of an as</em> [<em>sic</em>] <em>to how the [Morian]
                                court might assess temperate damages, other than to stick one finger
                                in a mouth and stick it in the air and see which the way wind was
                                blowing.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    I make four observations about the exchange
                    above. First, this was the first time the defendants ever put its case on loss
                    on the basis that what it had lost was an opportunity to earn profits, or indeed
                    an opportunity to raise additional finances whether as a step towards earning
                    actual profits or towards a further, subsidiary opportunity to earn profits.
                    Second, rightly or wrongly, it was the defendants’
                    <em>own</em> case that any award for a loss of opportunity
                    had to be dealt with not under the concept in Morian law of “actual or
                    compensatory” damages but under the alternative concept in Morian law of
                    “temperate” damages. Third, it is obvious from the above exchange
                    that there was no evidence before the tribunal from Justice B, the Morian law
                    expert for the secured creditors and for the liquidator, on the concept of
                    “temperate” damages under Morian law. Fourth, as the Chairman
                    pointed out, the problem with this new alternative case characterising the
                    defendants’ loss as the loss of an opportunity to earn profits was that
                    there was insufficient evidence for the tribunal to quantify the
                    defendants’ opportunity of earning that profit and thereby to quantify the
                    compensation to be awarded for the loss. As the chairman of the tribunal put it,
                    “neither the courts nor the tribunals pluck figures from the
                    air”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    The following exchange then took
                        place:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Chairman:    So you say that because of the liquidator's
                            failure to transfer title to you, you <em>lost the
                                opportunity to raise the additional loans</em>?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Yeap:    That's right.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Chairman:    
              <em>That's the way it is now
                                put, is it</em>?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Yeap:    I think that's the way we have always put it,
                            it's just that we took it further to say that if we have had the loans
                            we would have basically -- I mean, the intention was to get on with the
                            enhancements but certainly because we couldn't get on with it, as it
                            turned out, we suffered operating losses. I mean, we could have -- if
                            those loans were permitted to be used for operating purposes, we may
                            well have done it, but the fact is that what is clear is without the
                            land, we couldn't get the additional loans. And that has always been our
                            case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Arbitrator 2:    It still leaves the problem, as I
                            understand it, Mr Yeap. The difference between loss of opportunity and
                            actual loss would be in one case you say "If I had the money, I would
                            have done this". And in the second, you say "If I had the money, I could
                            have done this". In either event you would need some kind of factual
                            basis to say what is it that you would or could have done with the
                            money. In one case it becomes loss of opportunity, in the other case it
                            becomes an actual loss. That's really where at least I think this
                            Tribunal will need a little help on facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    To my mind, the above exchange shows clearly
                    that the tribunal recognised, once all the evidence was in, that the defendants
                    ought to have characterised their loss as the loss of an opportunity to earn
                    profits. This exchange also shows clearly that the tribunal recognised that the
                    legal and factual underpinnings of an inquiry into a lost opportunity to earn
                    profits were quite different from those of an inquiry into a loss of actual

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(3) The tribunal expressly re-characterised the defendants’
                claim in the award as one of loss of an opportunity to earn profits</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    All of this is confirmed in the award
                    itself, where the tribunal explicitly recharacterises the defendants’ case
                    on loss from a claim to recover loss of actual profits to a “claim for
                    the loss of an opportunity to make increased profits” (at paragraphs 432
                    to 433 of the award):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">432.  [The defendants claim] that, as a result of the
                            failure to transfer clean title, [they were] unable to obtain the
                            Additional Loans (as defined in the APA) in order to rehabilitate,
                            modernise and upgrade the [Mithril Plant] so that [they had] lost
                            profits which are estimated to be [US]$368.6 million for the period
                            between 2005 and 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">433.  [The defendants assert] that the failure of the
                            Liquidator and the Secured Creditors to transfer clean title hindered
                            [their] efforts to raise money to refurbish and modernise the [Mithril
                            Plant], and that, in consequence, [they were] unable to earn the profits
                            that [they] would have been able to earn during a period when the
                            worldwide demand for [Mithril] was flourishing. Although this claim was
                            put as a loss of profits claim, <em>it is, in the
                                Tribunal’s view, better considered as a claim for the loss of
                                an opportunity to make increased profits, and the Tribunal will
                                consider it on that basis.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    At paragraph 445 of the award, the tribunal
                    again recharacterises the defendants’ loss as a lost opportunity to earn
                    profits:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">445.  The Tribunal next considers the damages to which
                            [the defendants are] entitled as a result of the breach of the APA by
                            the Liquidator and the Secured Creditors. <b><em>It is
                                clear that</em></b> [<b><em>the
                                defendants</em></b>]<b><em>cannot prove any actual
                                loss</em></b>. However, [<em>the
                                defendants’</em>] <em>case is
                                that</em> [<em>they</em>] <em>lost the opportunity to earn profits</em>. [They] did
                            not carry out the intended work of rehabilitation and modernisation, as
                            [they] did not have the funds to do so. The failure of the Liquidator
                            and the Secured Creditors to transfer clean title meant that [the
                            defendants were] unable to raise the additional loans against the
                            security of the new [indenture], and, in consequence, [were] unable to
                            carry out the work of rehabilitation and modernisation that it
                                [<em>sic</em>] was necessary to do in order to
                            make the plant more productive. As a result of the breach, therefore,
                            [the defendants] lost the opportunity to earn substantial
                            profits[.]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    Mr Singh argues that this recharacterisation
                    of the defendants’ case is significant because the tribunal themselves
                    recognise that “[<em>i</em>]<em>t is
                        clear that</em> [<em>the defendants</em>]
                        <em>cannot prove any actual loss</em>” [emphasis
                    added]. Mr Singh took this to mean that the tribunal found as a fact that the
                    defendants’ claim for loss of actual profits failed. I was initially
                    hesitant to accept this interpretation. I am keenly aware that an award has to
                    be construed generously and any passage in an award needs to be construed in the
                    context of the entire award and not read like a statute. On one reading, it is
                    at least <em>plausible</em> that the tribunal here is using
                    “actual loss” simply to refer to quantifiable out of pocket losses
                    (in other words, reliance loss) as opposed to the loss of expected future
                    profits (or expectation loss).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    On balance, however, it is my view that the
                    interpretation which Mr Singh puts on this passage is more consistent with the
                    tenor of the entire award. First, it was never the defendants’ case that
                    it suffered out of pocket losses. Rather, as the tribunal itself recognised in
                    paragraph 432, it was the defendants’ case that “as a result of the
                    failure to transfer clean title, it was unable to obtain the additional Loans
                    (as defined in the APA) in order to rehabilitate, modernise and upgrade the
                    [Mithril Plant] so that it has lost profits which are estimated to be
                    [US$368.6m] for the period between 2005 and 2009”. Second, in the
                    exchanges between the tribunal and counsel quoted above, the tribunal showed
                    itself acutely aware of the evidential difficulties that the defendants had in
                    establishing on the balance of probabilities that it had suffered actual losses
                    of US$386.6m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    For completeness I should add that I found
                    the following passage at paragraph 458 of the award particularly
                    difficult:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">458.  The Tribunal notes that under [a principle of
                            Morian law], there is a head of damages called “temperate or
                            moderate” damages. This category covers cases where it is not
                            possible readily to quantify the actual loss suffered, and the [Morian
                            Courts] thus award “temperate or moderate” damages.
                            However, in the present case, the Tribunal has received satisfactory
                            evidence that [the defendants] <em>did suffer actual loss
                                and has also received expert evidence of the likely quantum of such
                                loss</em>. Accordingly, the Tribunal does not find [this
                            principle] to be applicable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>This paragraph is consistent with the rest of the award
                        insofar as it suggests that the tribunal was satisfied that the defendants
                        had suffered some form of loss, though not loss of the kind it had chosen to
                        advance in its claim: lost actual profits. Nevertheless, even though Mr Yeap
                        had earlier pointed out that on the defendants’ own case, the gateway
                        under Morian law for a claim equivalent to the common law concept of a loss
                        of opportunity came under the Morian law concept of temperate damages, the
                        tribunal inexplicably decided that this concept was not applicable as it
                        held it had “received expert evidence of the likely quantum of such
                        loss”. With respect, the expert evidence that the tribunal had
                        received was on lost actual profits, and not on the loss of an opportunity
                        to earn profits. In reaching its conclusion: (i) to eschew the concept of
                        temperate or moderate damages under Morian law; and (ii) to take expert
                        evidence adduced to assist the tribunal to assess lost actual profits and
                        use that evidence to assess damages for the loss of an opportunity to earn
                        profits, it appears to me that the tribunal decided the matter on a basis
                        which was not submitted to it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Kempinski is distinguishable on the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    Mr Yeap relies on <em>Kempinski</em> to argue in the alternative that even if the issue of
                    a lost opportunity to earn profits was not expressly submitted to the tribunal,
                    the defendants’ claim for damages reframed in this way was “part
                    of, or directly related to, the dispute which the parties submitted for
                    arbitration” and therefore need not have been specifically
                        pleaded.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    In my view, the facts of <em>Kempinski</em> can be distinguished from the present case. In
                        <em>Kempinski</em>, K commenced arbitration against P,
                    alleging the wrongful termination of a management contract. After the arbitrator
                    had issued a first interim award but before he had issued a second interim
                    award, P discovered that K had entered into a similar arrangement with a third
                    party, allegedly in breach of the management contract. The arbitrator issued a
                    third interim award which held that the new arrangement was inconsistent with
                    the management contract and that K was not entitled to damages after the date of
                    the new arrangement. K applied to set aside the third interim award on the basis
                    that the issue was not within the scope of the parties’ submission to
                    arbitration since the new arrangement had not been specifically pleaded. The
                    High Court agreed with K and set aside the third interim award. The Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Kempinski</em>, reversing the High Court,
                    dismissed the application and restored that award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    The Court of Appeal found that the pleaded
                    issues submitted for arbitration included K’s claim (i) for damages for
                    “the remainder of the term of the [management contract]” and (ii)
                    specific performance. This meant that the issue of the legal effect of the new
                    arrangement on the continuing viability of these two claims after the date of
                    the new arrangement fell within the scope of the parties’ submission to
                    arbitration. It then held at [47]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">47    ... In our view, any <b><em>new
                                fact</em></b> or change in the law arising after a submission to
                            arbitration which is ancillary to the dispute submitted for arbitration
                            and which is known to all the parties to the arbitration is part of that
                            dispute and need not be specifically pleaded. It may be raised in the
                            arbitration, as [P] did when it raised the New Management Contract as
                            part of its <em>force majeure</em> defence to [K's]
                            claim. We should also point out that [K] was given sufficient notice of
                            and opportunity to meet [P's] <em>force
                                majeure</em> defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    The Court of Appeal was also satisfied that
                    K had suffered no prejudice as a result of the failure of P to amend its
                    pleadings. It emphasised (at [51]) that there had been “<em>extensive correspondence, written submissions and expert
                        evidence</em>” [emphasis added] on the legal effect of this new
                    arrangement. It was also clear that the arbitrator had on several instances
                    informed the parties that he wanted to be addressed on the legal effect of the
                    new arrangement. Seen in that light, P’s failure to amend its pleadings
                    was in substance immaterial in light of the ample notice that K had on this
                    issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    
          <em>Kempinski</em> was
                    a case where a <em>new fact</em> emerged in the course of
                    the arbitration which had a bearing on the quantum of damages or the viability
                    of the remedy of specific performance which was properly before the tribunal. In
                    the present case, there were no new facts which emerged in the course of the
                    arbitration. All that happened is that it occurred to the tribunal, almost at
                    the very end of the arbitration, that the defendants ought to have characterised
                    their loss in a different way in light of the evidence. Unlike <em>Kempinski</em>, the tribunal did not ask the parties to
                    address it on a claim for a lost opportunity to earn profits before quantifying
                    and awarding damages on that basis in its award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(4) “Loss of an opportunity to earn profits” is
                different from “loss of profit”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    However, can it be argued that the loss of
                    an opportunity to earn profits and a loss of actual profits are <em>in substance</em> the same thing? If that is the case, it is
                    irrelevant what label the tribunal puts on the defendants’ loss. At a high
                    level of conception, there is force in the argument that in both cases a party
                    is seeking to recover compensation for profits which he expected to earn from
                    activities which were in the future at the time of breach and which will now
                    never take place because of the breach. Seen in that light, loss characterised
                    as a loss of actual profits is necessarily the same a loss of an opportunity to
                    earn profits in the sense that earning the profits in both cases depends on the
                    future occurrence of uncertain events.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    Nevertheless, there is to my mind a
                    substantive distinction between the two ways of looking at loss. In a claim for
                    the loss of actual profits, the plaintiff asserts that but for the breach of
                    contract, he <em>would</em> (not <em>could</em>) have earned profits. In other words, the plaintiff is
                    asserting a direct link between the breach and the loss. If the plaintiff
                        <em>succeeds</em> in proving that link, he is entitled
                    to full compensation for his loss. If, on the other hand, the plaintiff
                        <em>fails</em> to prove that direct link, he recovers
                    nothing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    Damages assessed on the basis of actual lost
                    profits is thus an all or nothing exercise. This is an important point. Even if
                    the finder of fact is of the view that there is only a 51% chance that the
                    plaintiff would have gone on to earn the profits claimed if the breach had not
                    occurred, the plaintiff recovers full compensation. He does not recover 51% of
                    his loss. By the same token, even if the finder of fact is satisfied that the
                    plaintiff’s chance of going on to earn the profits claimed is as high as
                    49%, the plaintiff recovers nothing. He does not recover 49% of his
                loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    The position is completely different when a
                    plaintiff presents his loss as a lost opportunity to earn profits. On that
                    analysis, the plaintiff asserts that but for the breach of contract, he
                        <em>could</em> (not <em>would</em>) have earned profits. On this analysis, the plaintiff concedes
                    that his ability to earn profits is subject to events beyond his control (for
                    example, because of the actions of a third party). A plaintiff who proves this
                    assertion on a balance of probabilities is not entitled to full compensation and
                    cannot move directly to the assessment stage. He is entitled only to proceed to
                    the intermediate stage of proving the likelihood of those events occurring. That
                    likelihood is then ascertained by the finder of fact and applied at the quantum
                    stage to modulate the plaintiff’s damages proportionately. A party who
                    advances a case on the basis of a lost opportunity to earn profits concedes that
                    he might recover less in damages if he succeeds but mitigates his risk of
                    recovering nothing at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    This view is consistent with the way in
                    which the distinction is treated, at least under Singapore law (I will return to
                    this point later below at [191]). In the Singapore High Court case of <em>Super Continental Pte Ltd v Essential Engineering &amp;
                        Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2010] SGHC 365 (“<em>Super Continental</em>”), S contracted to purchase machines
                    from E. S planned to use these machines to manufacture certain products which it
                    would then sell for a profit. E’s machines were defective and as a result,
                    S specifically claimed both damages for actual loss of profits and, in the
                    alternative, damages for the loss of a chance to earn profits. Having found E
                    liable to S, Judith Prakash J turned to consider S’s claim for damages.
                    S’s case on actual lost profits was that it would have derived profits
                    from sales to certain businesses such as Singapore Airlines even though it did
                    not have a contract to supply Singapore Airlines with the product at the time of
                    the breach (<em>Super Continental</em> at [136]). Although
                    its evidence on the ability to earn a profit from Singapore Airlines was weak, S
                    argued that it merely had to show a real or substantial chance to earn that
                    profit in order for the court to award damages for actual loss of profits.
                    Prakash J disagreed and held at [142]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">142    ... In this connection, I think the plaintiff has
                            mixed up two different bases of claim. A plaintiff can make a claim for
                            actual loss of profits if he can show that on a balance of
                            probabilities, he would, apart from the defendant’s breach, have
                            earned such profits. Alternatively, he can make a claim for the loss of
                            a chance to make a profit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Prakash J then held that S failed to show that it would have
                        earned the projected profits and that his claim for actual loss of profit
                        failed on that basis. On the alternative claim, Prakash J was satisfied that
                        S had lost a real and substantial <em>chance</em> to
                        earn profits and not a speculative one. On that basis, she awarded S a
                        percentage of the profit S could have earned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    In light of my discussion at [162] to [187]
                    above, I am satisfied that the tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction by inquiring
                    into the defendants’ loss of an opportunity to earn profits even though it
                    was not an issue that was placed before it. I now move on to consider whether
                    the secured creditors and the liquidator suffered prejudice as a
                result.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(5) The secured creditors and the liquidator suffered prejudice </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    Mr Yeap makes two arguments in relation to
                    prejudice. First, he argues that even if the issue of a lost opportunity to earn
                    profits was not submitted to the tribunal, the secured creditors and the
                    liquidator suffered no prejudice since all the relevant evidence was before the
                    tribunal for it to determine the lost opportunity claim. Second, he argues that
                    there was in any event no prejudice because the tribunal concluded at paragraph
                    454 of the award that the defendants would have had a slightly better than even
                    chance of making substantially enhanced profits (and then put the figure at
                    55%). This, so the argument went, meant that if the tribunal had determined the
                    case based on the defendants’ original claim for actual lost profits, the
                    defendants would have satisfied the tribunal on the balance of probabilities
                    that it would have earned the profit claimed (because the tribunal ascribed a
                    probability of more than 50% to the chance) and therefore obtained 100% of the
                    actual lost profits claimed. Therefore, the secured creditors and the
                    liquidators should, if anything, be grateful that the tribunal re-characterised
                    the defendants’ claim and thereby limited the damages awarded against them
                    to only 55% of the projected profits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    Turning to his first argument, in my view,
                    the re-characterisation of the damages issue deprived the secured creditors and
                    the liquidators of an opportunity to adduce evidence and make submissions
                    on:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_190-p2_a"></a>(a)     the relevant legal principles under
                        Morian Law relating to damages for the loss of an opportunity; as well
                        as</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_190-p2_b"></a>(b)     gaps in the
                        evidence available to establish a claim for damages for loss of an
                        opportunity to earn profits (as opposed to a claim for actual loss of
                        profits).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_191"></a>191    Whatever the position might be under
                    Singapore law with respect of damages for the loss of an opportunity, the APA
                    was governed by Morian law. A key issue which the tribunal would have had to
                    consider, therefore, was whether a claim for the loss of an opportunity to earn
                    profits was recoverable under Morian law and if so, what were the relevant
                    principles for quantifying damages awarded on that basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    Both sides in this application tendered
                    expert evidence on Morian law from most eminent experts. The defendants adduced
                    expert evidence from Justice A. He contends that there is no distinction between
                    loss of profits and loss of an opportunity under Morian law. It is worth
                    pointing out that this directly contradicts the position taken by the defendants
                    before the tribunal that loss of opportunity cases “dovetails with the
                    concept of temperate damages” as opposed to “actual and
                    compensatory damages” (see transcript reproduced at [171] above). On the
                    other hand, the secured creditors’ Morian Law expert Justice B contends
                    that Morian law does not allow a claim on the basis of actual or compensatory
                    damages for the loss of an opportunity. His evidence is that, at best, temperate
                    or moderate damages should have been awarded and this would have led to a
                    significantly lower quantum of damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    It is not this court’s role to
                    determine whether the loss of a chance doctrine as it is understood at common
                    law is available under Morian law or how it should be characterised and treated
                    under Morian law. In my view, prejudice has been suffered by the secured
                    creditors and the liquidator because this evidence could have made a reasonable
                    difference to the tribunal: see <em>L W Infrastructure</em>
                    at [54].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a>194    It is also clear from the arbitral documents
                    that the liquidator and the secured creditors took the defendants’ claim
                    for actual lost profits at face value. Given that the defendants were running an
                    all or nothing claim on damages, the plaintiffs ran an “all or
                    nothing” defence directed solely towards attacking causation on the
                    balance of probabilities. In other words, the plaintiffs’ argument on
                    damages was that the defendants had failed to prove on the balance of
                    probabilities that the plaintiffs’ alleged breach had <em>caused</em> the defendants to suffer a loss of profits at all.
                    Evidence and submissions directed towards moving the balance of probabilities on
                    an actual lost profits claim is in substance and effect quite different from
                    evidence and submissions directed towards ascertaining the quantum of the chance
                    lost on the lost opportunity analysis. For one thing, the balance of
                    probabilities approach is binary whereas the lost opportunity approach is
                    infinitely shaded from 0% to 100%.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_195"></a>195    I therefore accept that the difference
                    between the defendants’ pleaded case on its loss and the approach on loss
                    which the defendants urged upon the tribunal and which the tribunal adopted is a
                    difference of substance and not form, and one which caused prejudice to the
                    liquidator and the secured creditors. Had the defendants’ claim in damages
                    been put from the outset, either primarily or in the alternative, as one arising
                    from a lost opportunity to earn profits, the tribunal would have had to inquire
                    explicitly at an intermediate stage, between liability and assessment, into the
                    proper percentage to be ascribed to the lost opportunity to earn profits. The
                    liquidator and secured creditors were entitled to adduce expert evidence and
                    made submissions on that issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196"></a>196    To this end, the tribunal observed in the
                    award at paragraph 451 that the liquidator’s expert accountant was
                    instructed only to provide a critique of the report prepared by the
                    defendants’ expert accountant and “provided no independent
                    assessment of the damages claim”. Mr Yeap argued that having made that
                    choice, the secured creditors and liquidator cannot now complain that it had no
                    opportunity to adduce further evidence at the hearing. But this is precisely the
                    point I make. Given the manner in which the defendants advanced its claim on
                    damages, it was perfectly legitimate for the liquidator and the secured
                    creditors to confine their defence to attacking the defendants’ assertion
                    that it could prove on the balance of probabilities that it had suffered loss
                    caused directly by the breach and that it could prove to the same standard the
                    quantum of that loss. That is a different exercise from ascribing a likelihood
                    to intermediate events between the breach and the lost profits. On the case on
                    damages which the defendants put forward, the likelihood of those intermediate
                    events was never in issue during the evidential phase and throughout virtually
                    all of the submissions phase.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a>197    The biggest difficulty with the award which
                    Mr Yeap had to grapple with was the lack of any analysis by the tribunal to show
                    how it determined that the defendants had a 55% chance of making substantially
                    enhanced profits. As the chairman of the tribunal himself recognised,
                    “neither courts nor tribunals just pluck figures out of the air”
                    (see [169] above). This observation is as true of lost actual profits as it is
                    of a <em>likelihood</em> of lost profits. Yet, the chairman
                    of the tribunal himself recognised during oral submissions that the
                    defendants’ submissions and evidence on the probability of the lost
                    opportunity were unhelpful:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Chairman:    … But if you now say, well, we lost
                            the chance to raise that sort of money, and we should get temperate
                            damages to represent that loss of a chance, what do we say? Do we say
                            it’s 1 per cent or 10 per cent or 5 per cent of that? How do we
                            begin? That’s where we need help.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a>198    Once the tribunal moved away from the
                    defendants’ pleaded all or nothing case on damages and the binary nature
                    of a lost actual profits claim, the secured creditors and the liquidators were
                    entitled to an opportunity to address the tribunal on where between 0% and 100%
                    the justifiable level of damages should rest in light of Morian law on damages,
                    expert evidence on the issue, the likelihood of the opportunity materialising
                    and the parties’ submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_199"></a>199    Mr Yeap’s second argument – that
                    the tribunal’s approach in fact left the liquidators and the secured
                    creditors better off – is also without merit. First, as I have mentioned
                    above, the tribunal found that the defendants were unable to prove their case on
                    actual loss. On my reading, that is a finding by the tribunal that the
                    defendants failed to prove on the balance of probabilities that it had suffered
                    a loss of actual profits. That finding in itself ought to have resulted in the
                    dismissal of the defendants’ claim on this head. The liquidator and the
                    secured creditors have clearly been prejudiced. In any event, the issue is not
                    whether the liquidator and the secured creditors are less worse off. Rather, the
                    issue is whether the liquidator and secured creditor were prejudiced because
                    they were unable to object to the inclusion of this new issue at such a late
                    stage or because they were unable to address the tribunal on this issue with
                    relevant evidence which could have led to a lower award of damages. I have found
                    that they were.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on Issue 3</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200"></a>200    To summarise the discussion from [155] to
                    [198], I am satisfied that the tribunal acted in excess of its jurisdiction in
                    making an award for damages for the loss of an opportunity to earn profits and
                    that the award should be set aside in its entirety on this basis
                alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 4: Did the tribunal, in awarding damages to the defendants for
                its loss of an opportunity to earn profits fail to give the liquidator and secured
                creditors an opportunity to address the tribunal on that question?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201"></a>201    My decision on Issue 3 renders Issue 4
                    largely academic. I have found that characterising loss as profits actually lost
                    is different in substance (and not merely form) from characterising loss as the
                    loss of an opportunity to earn profits. I have also found that the
                    recharacterisation of the defendants’ claim in this manner caused the
                    liquidator and the secured creditors prejudice because they did not have proper
                    notice of it and were not allowed an opportunity to address it with evidence and
                    submissions. The conclusion must be that the liquidators and the secured
                    creditors did not receive a fair hearing on this issue. However, for the sake of
                    completeness, since the parties made extensive submissions on this point I shall
                    deal with this point in slightly greater detail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_202"></a>202    The secured creditors’ and the
                    liquidator’s arguments on this point are twofold:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_202-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, they argue that by deciding
                        the issue of damages on the basis of a lost opportunity, they were denied
                        the opportunity to make submissions and/or introduce evidence on the
                        likelihood of the defendants’ opportunity to earn increased
                        profits.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_202-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, they argue that the decision was one which was wholly at odds with
                        the evidence tendered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_203"></a>203    Mr Yeap, on the other hand, relies on
                        <em>Soh Beng Tee</em> for the proposition that the
                    court must determine that the tribunal’s decision to award damages for
                    loss of opportunity to earn profits was “unexpected” before it the
                    award was liable to be set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_204"></a>204    In <em>Soh Beng
                        Tee</em>, F employed S to build a condominium. Despite numerous
                    requests for an extension of time, F gave S only a five day extension. When S
                    was unable to complete the building works in time, F terminated S’s
                    employment. S commenced arbitration against F. The arbitrator found in favour of
                    S, holding that S should have a reasonable amount of time to complete the
                    project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_205"></a>205    F sought to set aside the award on the basis
                    that the arbitrator had found that S was entitled to a reasonable amount of time
                    to complete the project and had thereby set “time at large”
                    without fixing what that reasonable extension of time ought to have been.
                    Further, the issue of whether time was at large as a result of F’s acts of
                    prevention had not been submitted on or canvassed before the arbitrator and F
                    had been unfairly deprived of the opportunity to present countervailing
                    arguments to the arbitrator. The trial judge found for F and set aside the
                    award. The Court of Appeal restored the award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_206"></a>206    The Court of Appeal pointed out that the
                    pleadings filed by the parties expressly referred to the issue of whether time
                    was at large; and noted that at the end of the hearing, the arbitrator
                    specifically called for and gave the parties the opportunity to tender written
                    submissions on the issue of whether time was at large.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_207"></a>207    The Court of Appeal held at [41] that even
                    where the issue was not truly alive during the arbitration, that would not, in
                    itself, amount to a breach of natural justice:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">41    In addition, even if
                            we were to determine that the issue of whether time was at large was not

                                se</em> would not be sufficient to inexorably lead to the
                            conclusion that the Arbitrator had necessarily failed to adhere to the
                            rules of natural justice in denying [F] an occasion to present its
                            contentions on the issue. <b><em>It is frequently a matter

                            Sir Michael J Mustill &amp; Stewart C Boyd, <em>The Law
                                and Practice of Commercial Arbitration in England</em>

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">If the arbitrator decides the case on a point which he has invented
                            for himself, he creates surprise and deprives the parties of their right
                            to address full arguments on the base which they have to answer.
                            Similarly, if he receives evidence outside the course of the oral
                            hearing, he breaks the rule that a party is entitled to know about and
                            test the evidence led against him.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_208"></a>208    As I have already mentioned above, it was
                    clear to me that the pleadings, evidence and submissions tendered by the
                    defendants were made purely to advance a claim for profits actually lost. In the
                    face of that, the liquidator and the secured creditors were entitled to position
                    their evidence and submissions to meet the defendants’ case as it was
                    presented.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_209"></a>209    Mr Yeap argues that since the
                    defendants’ loss of an opportunity to earn profits was expressly mentioned
                    during the exchange on 21 October 2011, the liquidator and the secured creditor
                    were not prevented from making submissions on this issue. In other words,
                    following this exchange, they could or should have taken the initiative to ask
                    the tribunal to hear them on the issue or to receive further written submissions
                    addressed to this issue; but they instead elected not to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_210"></a>210    It is important to understand in context how
                    the loss of an opportunity issue arose. The exchange between Mr Yeap and the
                    tribunal occurred well after the close of the evidential phase and after the
                    parties had filed two rounds of written closing submissions on 23 May 2011 and 4
                    July 2011 respectively. Mr Yeo, who was also counsel for the liquidator in the
                    arbitration, addressed the tribunal on damages on 20 October 2011. The secured
                    creditor adopted the liquidator’s submissions on the issue of damages.
                    During Mr Alvin Yeo’s submissions, he was repeatedly assured by the
                    tribunal that if he had not fully addressed the defendants’ submissions on
                    damages and if the tribunal needed further assistance, he would be given a
                    chance to address the tribunal once more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_211"></a>211    The issue of loss of an opportunity arose
                    the following day, 21 October 2011, after both the liquidator and secured
                    creditor had completed their oral submissions on all issues. The tribunal then
                    gave directions for the parties to file submissions on the limited issue of the
                    relief sought by the defendants. The tribunal did not give the parties free rein
                    to make additional submissions on whatever they chose. Further, in light of the
                    exchange with the chairman of the tribunal in which he pointed out the
                    difficulties in the defendants advancing a loss of an opportunity case on
                    damages on the state of the evidence before the tribunal and in light of the gap
                    in the submissions (see [169] and [196]), it appeared to me entirely reasonable
                    for all counsel to assume that the tribunal proposed to deal with the
                    defendants’ claim for relief as it had been pleaded and advanced up to
                    that point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_212"></a>212    In my view, for the reasons already stated
                    in Issue 3, if the tribunal thought that the defendants’ claim was better
                    considered as a claim for the loss of an opportunity to earn profits the
                    tribunal was obliged to give the parties the opportunity to deal with this new
                    point. Also for the reasons which I have already stated in Issue 3, I find that
                    the liquidator and the secured creditor suffered prejudice as a result. The
                    award should therefore be set aside in its entirety on this basis
                alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 5: Did the tribunal fail to consider the secured
                creditors’ arguments, evidence and submissions in relation to the Lost Land
                Claims?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_213"></a>213    The fifth issue concerns whether the
                    tribunal breached the rules of natural justice by not having regard to the
                    defences that the secured creditors ran in relation to the Lost Land Claims. In
                    particular, the question is whether the tribunal wrongly assumed that the
                    secured creditors had made a concession as to whether the parcel of land which
                    was the subject of the Lost Land Claims was truly
                “lost”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The background to the Lost Land Claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_214"></a>214    In the arbitration, the defendants sought
                    damages from the secured creditors and the liquidator, alternatively an
                    indemnity, in relation to two claims that were subsisting over land which formed
                    part of the Plant Assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_215"></a>215    The defendants rely on the indemnity found

                    to settle the claims in respect of the Celeborn Claim and the Lorien Claim

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_219"></a>219    The defendants’ claim appears to have
                    come about this way. In addition to the Lost Land Claims, one Mdm Vaire had
                    separately filed a petition in the Morian courts in 1998 claiming that she was
                    the true owner of the land in respect of the Celeborn Claim (which is the same
                    land as that of the Lorien Claim). Separately, the government of Moria commenced
                    an action in October 2004 for the cancellation of title in respect of the same
                    piece of land. Both Mdm Vaire’s claim and the government of Moria’s
                    claim made their way to the Morian Supreme Court. On 7 July 2010, the Morian
                    Supreme Court issued a decision that (i) upheld the grant of Mdm Vaire’s
                    petition and (ii) reinstated the government of Moria’s
                Claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_220"></a>220    In the arbitration, the defendants contended
                    that the liquidator and/or the secured creditors had breached ss 2.1 and/or
                    7.2 and/or 7.3 of the APA “in respect of the loss or absence of ownership
                    of the lands under or in respect of [the Celeborn Claim] and [the Lorien Claim],
                    and/or in failing to fully discharge such Claims for
                Settlement”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_221"></a>221    The defendants argued that because of the
                    Celeborn Claim and/or the Lorien Claim and/or the decision of the Morian Supreme
                    Court, they had lost approximately 9.5 hectares of land (which they later
                    reduced to 6.05 hectares instead) that should have been transferred to it under
                    the APA. On the defendants’ case, that land was lost because the Celeborn
                    Claim and/or the Lorien Claim and/or the Morian Supreme Court’s decision
                    meant that that land could not be transferred to it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_222"></a>222    The defendants further asserted that it was
                    entitled to be indemnified by the secured creditors, pursuant to s 6.8 of
                    the APA in the sum of about US$23.7m for the loss of the 6.05 hectares of
                    land.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summary of the tribunal’s decision on the Lost Land
                Claims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_223"></a>223    The tribunal found in favour of the
                    defendants and ordered that the secured creditors pay to the defendants the sum
                    of about US$23.7m in respect of the Lost Land Claims by way of an
                    indemnity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_224"></a>224    The tribunal’s decision on this issue
                    can be summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_224-p2_a"></a>(a)     the relevant provisions of the APA
                        in relation to the Lost Land Claims are s 6.8 and Schedule VI
                        (paragraphs 469 to 473 of the award);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_224-p2_b"></a>(b)     Under s 6.8 and Schedule VI of the APA, the secured
                        creditors undertook to “sort out the position” in relation to
                        the Lost Land Claims or indemnify the defendants in respect of it. As a
                        result of the Morian Supreme Court’s decision, the secured creditors
                        are not in a position to sort out the position and must therefore indemnify
                        the defendants (paragraph 476 of the award);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_224-p2_c"></a>(c)     The secured creditors’ submission that
                        the Lost Land Claims is premature must fail because “[t]he fact that
                        the APA gives the Secured Creditors until October 2012 to transfer the
                        [Celeborn] Land is of no consequence in the <em>light of the
                            acceptance by both</em> [<em>the
                            defendants</em>] <em>and the Secured Creditors,
                            that there is no prospect of the Secured Creditors being able to make

                        secured creditors’ submission that the Lost Land Claims is premature
                        must also fail because “[i]t is not open to the Secured Creditors to
                        contend, on the one hand, that the claim for indemnity is <em>“dead”</em>, and, on the other hand, that it is
                        premature” (paragraph 477 of the award); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_224-p2_f"></a>(f)     The tribunal accepted the
                        defendants’ valuation expert’s evidence that the “full
                        value of the freehold interest in the [Celeborn] Land” was about
                        US$23.7m and used that as the measure of the defendants’ loss
                        (paragraph 483 of the award).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The secured creditors’ submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_225"></a>225    Mr Singh contends that the tribunal erred in
                    the manner in which it construed s 6.8 and Schedule VI of the APA because
                    the clear language of the provisions (i) limited the scope of the indemnity
                    obligations to the settlement of the Celeborn Claim and the Lorien Claim and
                    these claims no longer existed by virtue of the Morian Supreme Court’s
                    decision and (ii) s 6.8 requires the secured creditors to indemnify the
                    defendants only to the extent that the defendants incurred any obligations,
                    liabilities, damages or costs or expenses as a result of the Celeborn Claim and
                    Lorien Claim. It does not require the secured creditors to “sort out the
                    position” in relation to these two claims. Mr Singh however rightly
                    concedes that this court does not exercise an appellate function over the merits
                    of the tribunal’s decision. Thus the parties will have to live with the
                    decision of the tribunal even if it erred in law in its construction of
                    s 6.8 and Schedule VI.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_226"></a>226    Mr Singh asserts that the tribunal’s
                    award on the Lost Land Claims should be set aside because the tribunal failed to
                    consider the secured creditors’ evidence and arguments on three
                    sub-issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_226-p2_a"></a>(a)     What exactly comprised the land
                        “lost” by the defendants that formed the subject of their Lost
                        Land Claims?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_226-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the land that was the subject of the Lost Land Claims were indeed
                        “lost”?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_226-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether the Lost Land Claims were
                    premature?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_227"></a>227    In doing so, Mr Singh focused most of his
                    submissions (rightly in my view) on the fact that the tribunal proceeded on the
                    basis that the secured creditors had “accepted” that there was no
                    prospect of them being able to transfer the relevant land to the defendants
                    prior to 15 October 2012. He argues that there is no support for this acceptance
                    in anything in the record. This was an acceptance which cut across the secured
                    creditors’ contention that the Celeborn land was not lost (because there
                    was still a chance that the land could be conveyed) and that any claim was
                    premature (because the secured creditors had until 15 October 2012 to make good
                    on their promise to settle the claims over the land).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_228"></a>228    Mr Singh argued that as was the case in
                        <em>Front Row Investment Holdings (Singapore) Pte Ltd v
                        Daimler South East Asia Pte Ltd</em> [2010] SGHC 80 (“<em>Front Row</em>”) where the arbitrator there mistakenly
                    thought that one party had abandoned one part of its claim because of a
                    concession which did not in fact take place, the tribunal here had mistakenly
                    assumed that the secured creditors had conceded the point when it in fact had
                    not.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the secured creditors accept that it would be impossible to
                transfer the land to the defendants following the Morian Supreme Court
                decision?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_229"></a>229    Mr Yeap makes several arguments to show why
                    the tribunal was justified in stating that the secured creditors accepted that
                    it would be impossible to transfer the land to the defendants following the
                    Morian Supreme Court’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_230"></a>230    First, he argues that the secured creditors
                    in their submissions in the arbitration never took the position that there was
                    any prospect of transferring title to the Celeborn land to the
                        defendants.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> He says it was not disputed by the
                    liquidator and the secured creditors that the results of (i) the Celeborn Claim,
                    (ii) the Lorien Claim, (iii) Mdm Vaire’s claim and/or (iv) the Morian
                    Supreme Court’s decision were that the relevant land (which formed part of
                    the Plant Land Assets which were to be conveyed to the defendants) had
                    effectively been lost. He also maintains that the tribunal on several occasions
                    put forward the proposition that the secured creditors were not in a position to
                    transfer title in respect of the Celeborn land and that secured creditors’
                    lead counsel in the arbitration (not Mr Singh) did not challenge that
                    proposition on any of those occasions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_231"></a>231    I cannot agree. In their initial closing
                    submissions filed in the arbitration on 23 May 2011, the secured creditors
                    contended expressly that there remained a chance that the Celeborn land could be
                    transferred to the defendants:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">283. Moreover, whilst the issue of ownership may have been settled between
                        [Mdm Vaire] … on the one hand, and [Celeborn] and [Lorien] on the
                        other hand, there are nevertheless <em><u>two sets of
                            proceedings</u></em> brought by the Government of [Moria], namely, the
                        Expropriation Proceedings, as well as the Reversionary Proceedings, which
                        have been reinstated by reason of the Appeal Judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">284. The Expropriation Proceedings was originally filed on 15 August 1983,
                        by Government of [Moria], through [the predecessor of the Corporation]. The
                        original aim was to obtain part of the [Celeborn] Land, measuring 30.25
                        hectares, for the use by [the Corporation] to operate the [the
                        Corporation’s Mithril plant]. Logically, there is a possibility that,
                        should the Expropriation Proceedings brought by the Government of [Moria] be
                        successful, then the title to [the Plant Land Assets], insofar as they are
                        the subject of the Expropriation Proceedings, would vest in [the defendants]
                        (as successors in title of [the Corporation]) …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">285. As for the Reversionary Proceedings, these were filed on 13 October
                        2004, for a reversion of parcels of land … which form part of the
                        [Celeborn] Land.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">286. Given that the Expropriation Proceedings and the Reversionary
                        Proceedings remain pending, the net effect on [the defendants] is uncertain.
                        Therefore, it remains clear that their claim is wholly premature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_232"></a>232    Mr Yeap says that these arguments were
                    speculative and that the tribunal agreed with that view. However, he was unable
                    to point to anywhere in the award where the tribunal agreed that it was
                    speculative.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_233"></a>233    It appears that it was in fact the
                    defendants who (incorrectly) suggested at paragraphs 327 to 331 of their initial
                    written submissions on liability dated 23 May 2011 that the secured creditors
                    did not challenge that the defendants had lost the Celeborn land:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">327. <em>The</em> [secured creditors and liquidator]
                            <em>do not challenge that</em> [the defendants]
                            <em>have indeed lost the Lost Land</em> but simply
                        assert that the Lost Land claim is rendered moot by the [Morian Supreme
                        Court Decision], as [Celeborn] was found not to be an heir of … the
                        original owner of [the relevant parcel of land]. [The Morian Supreme Court]
                        instead affirmed the 17 July 2004 decision of the [Morian] Regional Trial
                        Court that a [Mdm Vaire] was the rightful heir. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">328.  It bears highlighting that the result of the
                            aforesaid proceedings is that [the defendants] have most certainly lost
                            such part of [the Plant Assets] whether by reason of the [Morian Supreme
                            Court Decision] or otherwise …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">329. In their cross-examination of [Mr Y, one of the defendants’
                        witnesses], [the secured creditors’] solicitors did not challenge [Mr
                        Y’s] evidence on the issue of Lost Land …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">330. The Liquidator’s counsel also did not cross-examine [Mr Y] on
                        the issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">331.  In view of the fact that the [secured
                            creditors’ and liquidator’s] counsel both did not challenge
                            [Mr Y’s] evidence on this issue, [the defendants] humbly submit
                            that [the defendant’s] claim in this regard should be admitted in
                            full.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_234"></a>234    In their further written submissions on
                    liability filed on 4 July 2011, the secured creditors took issue with the
                    defendants’ “gross mischaracterisations of the Secured
                    Creditors’ position”. Referring to the extracts from the
                    defendants’ initial written submissions above, the secured creditors
                    submitted at paragraphs 174 to 180:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">174. Contrary to [the defendants’] misstatements … [t]he
                        Secured Creditors have never waived their right to insist that [the
                        defendants] do so to establish their claim. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">175. Indeed, the Secured Creditors had expressly sought to cross-examine
                        [Mr Y] on the issue of actual loss, by reference to the fact that [the
                        defendants] have been successfully leasing out [a shop situated on the land
                        subject to the Lost Land Claims] to a third party without any disturbance,
                        and in fact continue to do so. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">176. It is therefore patently inaccurate for [the defendants] to assert
                        that the Secured Creditors have never disputed or challenged that the land
                        alleged to be lost was indeed lost.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">177. It is also patently inaccurate for [the defendants] to assert that
                        [Mr Y] was never cross-examined by the Secured Creditors ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">180. [The defendants’] flawed submissions, viz. “In view of
                        the fat that [the secured creditors’ and liquidator’s] counsel
                        both did not challenge [Mr Y’s] evidence on this issue, [the
                        defendants] humbly submit that [the defendants’] claim in this regard
                        should be admitted in full”, should therefore be firmly
                        rejected.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original omitted]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_235"></a>235    The position taken by the secured creditors
                    in both their written submissions was entirely consistent with the position
                    taken by the secured creditors’ lead counsel during the arbitration where
                    he maintained that there was still a possibility that the defendants could
                    receive title to the land.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_236"></a>236    I am therefore satisfied from the objective
                    record that the secured creditors never conceded that there was no prospect of
                    transferring the land to the defendants. By failing to consider the arguments
                    which the secured creditors made in this respect, I am satisfied that the
                    tribunal breached the rules of natural justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_237"></a>237    In the circumstances, if the tribunal had
                    not assumed that the secured creditors accepted that there was no prospect of
                    transferring the land subject to the Lost Land Claims to the defendants, this
                    could <em>reasonably</em> have made a difference to the
                    outcome of the case since it was possible and plausible for the tribunal to
                    conclude otherwise: that the Lost Land Claims were indeed premature or that the
                    land was indeed not “lost”. The breach of natural justice here was
                    therefore not of a trivial and technical nature. The tribunal’s failure to
                    consider the secured creditors’ clearly-stated position caused prejudice
                    to them. In any event, the defendants did not dispute that the secured creditors
                    had suffered prejudice if I found that there was a breach of natural justice in
                    relation to Issue 5.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_238"></a>238    In light of my decision, I do not have to go
                    on to decide if Mr Singh is correct in contending that the tribunal failed to
                    consider the secured creditors’ submissions on what exactly comprised the
                    land “lost” by the defendants that formed the subject of the Lost
                    Land Claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_239"></a>239    I do, however, make one observation. The
                    tribunal noted that there was a dispute between the defendants and the secured
                    creditors on how to value the land subject to the Lost Land Claims should
                    liability for the indemnity be established and that “[t]he difference
                    between the two valuations was very substantial. [The defendants’]
                    valuation was [about US$23.7m] whereas [the secured creditors’] valuation
                    was that the ownership interest in the [relevant parcel of land] as at [31]
                    December 2010 was [about US$16,300]” (see paragraphs 479 and 482 of the
                    award).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_240"></a>240    From the objective record it is clear that
                    one of the key areas of disagreement was whether the “loss” should
                    be calculated on the basis of 6.05 hectares of land (which was what the
                    defendants contended) or based on 3.4071 hectares of land (which was what the
                    secured creditors contended in light of the provisions in Schedule VI of the APA
                    (reproduced at [216] above)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_241"></a>241    In spite of this, the tribunal simply stated
                    its conclusion that it preferred the defendants’ evidence over the secured
                    creditors’ evidence and that “[t]he indemnity must be the full
                    value of the freehold interest in the [Celeborn] Land, that is, [about
                    US$23.7m]” (see paragraph 483 of the award). The tribunal gave no reasons
                    for its conclusion. In those circumstances, even though I do not have to decide
                    the point, I had much sympathy for the secured creditors’ contention that
                    it was not given a fair hearing on the matter because the tribunal gave no
                    indication that it had even applied its mind to the language of Schedule VI of
                    the APA and how it ought to be construed when it came to quantifying the
                    loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on Issue 5</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_242"></a>242    To summarise the discussion from [213] to
                    [241] above, I am satisfied that the tribunal breached the rules of natural
                    justice and failed to give the secured creditors a fair hearing on the issue of
                    the defendants’ Lost Land Claims and that the parties who were jointly and
                    severally liable under the indemnity in s 6.8 of the APA had suffered
                    prejudice as a result.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 6: did the tribunal act in excess of its jurisdiction contrary
                to Art 34(2)(b)(iii) of the Model Law by granting relief under and in respect of the
                OMNA and the notes?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_243"></a>243    My holdings thus far mean that it is
                    strictly unnecessary to consider Issue 6. I go on to consider it nonetheless in
                    light of the extensive submissions of the parties on this point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_244"></a>244    The secured creditors and the Funds accept
                    that the defendants’ claim for damages against the liquidator and the
                    secured creditors for failing to deliver clean title to the Plant Assets fell
                    within the scope of the arbitration agreement in the APA. Their complaint here
                    is that the <em>relief</em> sought by the defendants in
                    relation to its payment obligations under the notes amounted <em>in substance</em> to a pre-emptive declaration that the defendants
                    were not liable under the OMNA and the notes. They submit further that if that
                    is the relief that the defendants wanted, they should have sought that relief in
                    accordance with the separate dispute resolution provision in the OMNA and not
                    that in the APA. Therefore, in granting the relief sought by the defendants at
                    [76(b)] and [76(c)] above, the complaint is that the tribunal exceeded its
                    jurisdiction under the arbitration agreement <em>in the
                        APA</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_245"></a>245    Issue 6 concerns the situation where the
                    dispute referred to the arbitrators is one that is not within the parties’
                    arbitration agreement or that goes beyond the scope of that agreement. In this
                    situation, the arbitral tribunal’s decision as to its own jurisdiction can
                    be challenged afresh by the court in exercise of its original jurisdiction
                        (<em>cf</em> the court’s limited role in a
                    challenge on the basis of natural justice): <em>Insigma
                        Technology Co Ltd v Alstom Technology Ltd</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 23 at
                    [21] and [22].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_246"></a>246    The starting point of the analysis must be
                    the express wording of the dispute resolution provisions in the APA and in the
                    OMNA. Before I turn to those provisions, I should also mention as a preliminary
                    point that it is undisputed that these provisions, like the contracts in which
                    they are found, are governed by Morian law. Having said that, I have considered
                    both experts’ evidence on Morian law I am satisfied that the applicable
                    principles are not materially different from those under Singapore
                law.</p>

                        APA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The tribunal’s findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_249"></a>249    The tribunal concluded that it had the
                    jurisdiction to grant the relief sought by the defendants for the following
                    reasons. It first decided at paragraph 85 of the award that the APA was the
                    principal agreement governing the relationship between the parties. Thus, the
                    tribunal held, the legal basis of the defendants’ payment obligations
                    under the notes arose under the <em>APA</em>, as the
                    parties’ principal agreement, and <em>not</em> under
                    the OMNA:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">85. There is, in the Tribunal’s view, no doubt that the APA was the
                        principal agreement. Nor, as will be illustrated, is there any doubt that
                        [the defendants’] payment obligation arose under the APA and not under
                        the [OMNA].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">86. Section 3.1 of the APA provides that “… for and in
                        consideration of the transaction [the defendants] shall pay the Purchase
                        Price within a period of eight (8) years from the Closing Date (the
                        “Payment Period”,) as follows: ...”. It can, therefore,
                        readily be seen that the obligations of [the defendants] (on the one hand)
                        and the Liquidator and the Secured Creditors (on the other hand) were
                        reciprocal. In exchange for the payment of the Purchase Price in the
                        stipulated manner the Liquidator and the Secured Creditors were to transfer
                        and deliver [the Plant Assets] free of encumbrances and [the
                        Corporation’s Liabilities] were to be discharged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>This is also evident from paragraph 88 of the award where the
                        tribunal held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">88. ... a dispute which arises from an alleged breach by the Secured
                        Creditors of their obligations under Section 2 of the APA requires [the
                        tribunal] to consider whether [the defendants were] obliged to perform its
                        reciprocal obligation and make payment of the Purchase Price. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_250"></a>250    At paragraph 99 of the award, the tribunal
                    then held that s 10.3 of the APA properly construed meant that the dispute
                    resolution provisions of the APA take precedence over any other dispute
                    resolution mechanism so long as any obligation of the secured creditors’
                    under the APA is involved:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">99. … if any dispute arises between [the defendants] and the
                        Secured Creditors relating to the alleged breach of an obligation by [the
                        defendants] under the … Notes, the SLCs or the [OMNA] itself,
                            <em>which does not relate to the rights and obligations
                            of the parties under the APA</em>, such a matter would be excluded
                        from the arbitration agreement in the APA notwithstanding the fact that the
                        … Notes and the SLCs had been issued pursuant to the APA. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">My decision on Issue 6</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_251"></a>251    With respect, I am unable to agree with the
                    tribunal’s construction of the dispute resolution
                provisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(1) “Notwithstanding anything herein” and “For
                the avoidance of doubt”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_252"></a>252    In my view, the phrase
                    “notwithstanding anything herein” in the first paragraph of
                    s 10.3 of the APA makes it clear that the parties contemplated a potential
                    overlap between matters which would constitute a “Dispute” in
                    s 10.1 and s 10.2 of the APA and a “default” in
                    s 10.3. If this were not the case, s 10.3 would be completely otiose.
                    The second paragraph of s 10.3, which begins with “[f]or the
                    avoidance of doubt”, reinforces this construction of
                s 10.3.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_253"></a>253    Further, s 10.1 and s 10.2 of the
                    APA appeared in the parties’ transaction as early as the MOA. Section
                    10.3, however, was introduced later, only when the dispute resolution mechanism
                    in the MOA was migrated into the APA. To my mind, this suggests that s 10.3
                    of the APA was inserted only <em>when</em> the terms and
                    conditions of the notes were finalised and embodied in the OMNA and only
                        <em>because</em> it became apparent to the parties that
                    there might be a situation in which obligations under the APA and the OMNA might
                    overlap. In that way, s 10.3 of the APA served to break a deadlock by
                    directing parties to the OMNA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_254"></a>254    That being the case, the question which the
                    tribunal asked itself – that is, whether the dispute falls within the
                    scope of the APA – is in my respectful view the wrong question. The
                    express wording of s 10.3 of the APA requires the tribunal instead to ask
                    itself whether this “dispute” is also a “default”
                    within the scope of the OMNA. If it is, then under s 10.3 of the APA, this
                    dispute ought to be decided in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions
                    in the OMNA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_255"></a>255    For the reason above, I cannot accept Mr
                    Yeap’s submission that the tribunal was correct in finding that the APA
                    was the principal and overarching document because it provided for the creation
                    of the OMNA and the notes. I also cannot accept the submission that because the
                    defendants’ payment and security obligations arose under the APA, the
                    disputes in respect of those obligations were rightly referred to arbitration
                    under the APA. For the same reasons, I also reject his related argument that the
                    tribunal had the jurisdiction to deal with a matter which constitutes a breach
                    both under the APA and the OMNA under s 10.2 of the APA. To my mind, that
                    ignores the clear meaning and intent of s 10.3 of the APA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(2) “a default under the Omnibus Agreement”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_256"></a>256    But what is a default under the OMNA? A
                    “Default” is defined in s 1.01 of the OMNA as an
                    “Event of Default” or an event which following the lapse of a
                    notice period would become an Event of Default. The Events of Default are set
                    out at s 8.01 of the OMNA. They include, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, (i) the failure to pay sums due under the OMNA (which would
                    be sums due under the notes) (s 8.01(a) of the OMNA) and (ii) the failure
                    to comply with the terms of the OMNA, the notes, the new mortgage indenture and
                    the SLCs (s 8.01(c) of the OMNA). Therefore, by seeking the relief that it
                    did in relation to its payment obligations under the notes, I agree with Mr
                    Singh that the defendants were effectively and in substance seeking a
                    prospective determination that it would not be liable for an “Event of
                    Default” (or that it would not be in default) if it did not pay the next
                    instalment on the notes because of the breaches of the APA by the liquidator and
                    the secured creditor. In my view, this was a matter which fell squarely within
                    the express carve-out in s 10.3 of the APA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_257"></a>257    Mr Yeap argues (in the alternative) that the
                    carve-out in s 10.3 of the APA, properly construed, applies only to what he
                    calls a “pure default”. He submits that a “pure
                    default” is different from a “dispute” under s 10.1
                    and s 10.2 of the APA. According to Mr Yeap, a “pure default”
                    occurs if the defendants simply refuse to meet their obligations under the
                    notes, the new indenture or SLCs. On the other hand, it is a
                    “dispute” and not a “pure default” if the
                    defendants’ refusal to make payment under the notes is in some way linked
                    to the secured creditors’ obligations under the APA. Seen in that light,
                    Mr Yeap submits that s 10.3 of the APA is intended to break a deadlock by
                    diverting parties to the OMNA only in the very limited situation of a
                    “pure default”. I do not agree. I fail to see why
                    “default” under the OMNA includes only uncontentious defaults but
                    not defaults that were “contentious”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_258"></a>258    In fact, Mr Yeap’s interpretation
                    would lead to absurd commercial results. The defendants assumed almost all of
                    the obligations under the OMNA. His interpretation would mean that it would have
                    the unilateral power to dictate whether a disagreement regarding its payment
                    obligation under the notes was to be resolved by the dispute resolution
                    mechanism under the APA or the OMNA. Upon a default, all it would have to do is
                    simply allege that it was relieved of its obligation to pay under the notes by a
                    breach of the secured creditors’ obligations under the APA (however
                    spurious). That would automatically render the matter a “dispute”
                    and remove it from the dispute resolution mechanism in the OMNA. In my view,
                    that could not have been the intention of the parties. That interpretation would
                    denude s 10.3 of the APA of all practical significance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(3) Commercial considerations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_259"></a>259    Further, in my view, it made perfect
                    commercial sense for the parties to have structured their dispute resolution
                    mechanism in the manner described above. The purpose of the APA was to ensure
                    that the Plant Assets were transferred to the defendants in exchange for the
                    issuance of the notes. As part of the commercial transaction, these notes were
                    meant to be (and indeed were) traded and on-sold to third parties (such as the
                    Funds and the parties who held the notes before them) who would have absolutely
                    no interest or involvement in the actual sale process of the Plant Assets. In
                    fact, this was expressly contemplated by s 9.04 of the OMNA which permits a
                    noteholder to assign all or any portion of its rights and obligations under the
                    OMNA, the notes, the SLCs and the new mortgage indenture (but not under the APA)
                    to anyone save for direct competitors of the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_260"></a>260    Indeed, this was the manner in which (at
                    least some of) the original secured creditors of the Corporation managed to exit
                    as creditors of the Corporation. The payments were thus structured to ensure
                    that a noteholder was entitled to transfer its rights and obligations under the
                    notes without any reference to the underlying transaction documented by the APA.
                    I should add here that Mr Yeap’s argument that the notes were technically
                    non-negotiable instruments does not address the real point here: that the
                    commercial intention of the parties was plainly for the notes to be on-sold to
                    third parties. Such third parties should not have to be, and would not want to
                    be, concerned with any dispute arising out of the APA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_261"></a>261    I am thus satisfied that the contractual
                    intention of the original parties to the transaction was for the notes to be
                    detached entirely from the APA and to take on a legal life of their own
                    following closing. Put another way, the dispute resolution mechanism in the OMNA
                    was the mechanism chosen by the parties to resolve all matters concerning the
                    payment and security obligations under the notes following closing. In my
                    respectful view, the tribunal’s construction of s 10.3 of the APA
                    would turn the commercial rationale of the entire transaction on its head. It
                    makes the notes a highly unattractive proposition for anyone to acquire in the
                    secondary market. That would in turn defeat the entire purpose of structuring
                    the transaction in the manner that the parties did. At least part of that
                    purpose was to allow secured creditors who did not wish to be tied to the
                    defendants for the long term to exit as creditors through the secondary market
                    rather than through some sort of accelerated repayment, in order not to disrupt
                    the defendants’ business or cash flow.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(4) The “non-exclusive jurisdiction” of the Morian
                courts </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_262"></a>262    Mr Yeap argues in the alternative that
                    s 9.08(b) of the OMNA is a permissive and not a mandatory provision. In
                    other words, the secured creditors may choose to but, are not obliged to, go to
                    the Morian courts to enforce their rights under the OMNA. If s 10.3 of the
                    APA is seen in that light, Mr Yeap argues, it is not attempting to break any
                    deadlock between the two dispute resolution provisions whenever there was an
                    overlap.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_263"></a>263    This argument is, with respect, a complete
                    non-starter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_264"></a>264    The “non-exclusiveness” of
                    s 9.08(b) of the OMNA concerns the non-exclusiveness of the Morian courts
                        <em>as a forum</em> as opposed to the non-exclusiveness
                    of court proceedings <em>as the only dispute resolution
                        mechanism</em>. In fact, the non-exclusive nature of s 9.08(b)
                    undermines Mr Yeap’s argument rather than supporting it. Section 9.08(b)
                    gives the Corporation’s creditors (in this context, the noteholders) the
                    ability to commence proceedings against the defendants in any other forum
                        (<em>ie</em>, any other court) outside Moria where the
                    defendants have assets. To my mind, this only goes to show that the dispute
                    resolution mechanism was drafted to facilitate noteholders’ rights of
                    recovery in the event of default. This, in my view, is entirely consistent with
                    the construction of s 10.3 of the APA described above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on Issue 6</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_265"></a>265    To conclude on Issue 6, I find that the
                    tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction by granting the relief set out at [76(b)] and
                    [76(c)] above. Therefore, even if I am wrong on Issues 1 to 5, I would have set
                    aside those heads of relief which the tribunal granted and which pertain to the
                    defendants’ payment and security obligations under the OMNA and the
                    APA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 7: Did the tribunal act in excess of its jurisdiction or in
                breach of natural justice by holding the Funds, as assignees under the OMNA and the
                notes, liable alongside the rest of the secured creditors for breaches of the
                APA?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_266"></a>266    My findings thus far are sufficient for the
                    Funds’ application to be allowed in its entirety. It is therefore not
                    strictly necessary for me to determine Issue 7. I nevertheless consider Issue 7
                    in light of the importance of this issue and the parties’ extensive
                    submissions on this point. The issue here is whether the Funds, who purchased
                    the right to receive payments under the notes in the secondary market and who
                    applied voluntarily to join the arbitration as parties, can now complain that
                    the tribunal acted in excess of its jurisdiction in finding them liable under
                    the APA when they were: (i) not parties to the APA; and (ii) the defendants
                    advanced no positive case against them throughout the arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The background to the Funds’ involvement in the
                arbitration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_267"></a>267    As mentioned above, s 9.04 of the OMNA
                    gave the original secured creditors of the Corporation the right to assign their
                    rights and obligations under the Relevant Documents (which included the OMNA and
                    the notes but crucially not the APA (see [248] above)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_268"></a>268    In a series of trades between 2005 and 2008,
                    the Funds purchased the right to receive payments under the notes on the
                    secondary market as distressed debt. The Funds’ counterparties in these
                    trades were not the original holders of the notes but were parties who were
                    themselves purchasers of rights from the original noteholders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_269"></a>269    The operative documents in each of these
                    trades includes (i) a transfer agreement (which in two instances are called
                    “assignment agreements” and in one instance is called a
                    “sale agreement”) as well as (ii) a notice of assignment which is
                    addressed to the facility agent for the notes (<em>ie</em>,
                    AKP) and the defendants. It also appears that all the transfer agreements are
                    governed by English law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_270"></a>270    Mr Jeyaretnam maintains that these trades
                    did not have the effect of constituting the Funds parties to the APA. Thus, he
                    argues, the Funds were not subject to any of the obligations under the APA,
                    including the obligation to transfer clean title to the defendants, nor were
                    they party to the arbitration agreement contained in s 10 of the APA.
                    According to Mr Jeyaretnam (and related to his argument on Issue 6 above which I
                    have accepted), the entire commercial purpose of structuring notes in the way
                    the parties did was to ensure that they could be traded on the secondary market
                    independently of the underlying transaction comprised in the APA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_271"></a>271    Although Mr Yeap contends otherwise, his
                    contention lacks any conviction and appears to be an afterthought. The
                    defendants did not name the Funds in their notice of arbitration in 2008.
                    Instead, the defendants named only the original noteholders (together with the
                    rest of the secured creditors of the Corporation). The defendants did so even
                    though they had by then already been served notice that the relevant notes had
                    been acquired by the Funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_272"></a>272    The Funds were formally joined as a party to
                    the arbitration only some two and a half years later on 22 March 2011 when they
                    volunteered to be so joined. If the defendants believed that this joinder meant
                    that non-parties to the APA were volunteering to be liable under the APA, one
                    would have expected them to welcome the joinder. Instead, the defendants asked
                    for evidence that the Funds were in fact transferees or assignees before
                    informing the tribunal that they would not object to the joinder. As I will
                    explain, the circumstances leading up to the Funds’ joinder application
                    are of central importance to the determination of this issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_273"></a>273    The tribunal’s award was issued in May
                    2012. To the Funds’ dismay, the tribunal permitted the defendants to
                    suspend without consequence their payment and security obligations under the
                    OMNA and notes. To the Funds’ surprise, the tribunal also found the
                    “Secured Creditors” (which the tribunal listed in Annex A to the
                    award) to be jointly and severally liable with the liquidator to the defendants
                    for US$80m in damages for breaches of the APA. To the Funds’ horror, they
                    found themselves named in Annex A alongside the rest of the secured creditors
                    (including the original noteholders) as parties liable to the defendants. In
                    other words, the defendants achieved a thorough windfall: although they had
                    commenced arbitration against all of the original 23 secured creditors of the
                    Corporation, they had been given far more than they asked for. They were now
                    able to look to the Funds in addition to these 23 secured creditors to recover
                    under the award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_274"></a>274    On 3 July 2012, the Funds applied separately
                    from the rest of the secured creditors to set aside the award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Funds’ submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_275"></a>275    Mr Jeyaretnam first contends that the
                    transfers could not and did not constitute the Funds a party to the APA. Since
                    the Funds were not a party to the APA, they could not have incurred any
                    obligations under the APA and ought never to have been held liable for damages
                    arising from breaches of obligations under the APA. This argument is
                    superficially attractive. But in my judgment, it conceals the real issue at
                    stake on the Funds’ application which, after all, is an application to set
                    aside the award. If the Funds became a party to the arbitration by virtue of a
                    joinder application and if the terms of reference of the tribunal include the
                    issue of whether the Funds are liable under the APA, Mr Jeyaretnam’s
                    argument serves merely to attack the tribunal’s decision on the merits. It
                    does not undermine the tribunal’s jurisdiction to hold the Funds liable
                    under the APA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_276"></a>276    On the merits, I have much sympathy for the
                    Funds’ position. It is indeed odd that a mere assignee of rights under the
                    notes who joins an arbitration voluntarily can end up being held to have
                    incurred obligations to the defendants under an agreement to which it was never
                    a party, and therefore to be jointly and severally liable to pay the defendants
                    US$80m. Instinctively it appears to me that the tribunal’s award is wrong,
                    at the very least because it cannot be that the original noteholders <em>and</em> the Funds are both liable at the same time. But all
                    of this is beyond the remit of the court in a setting aside application. The
                    Funds have to live with the tribunal’s decision, however surprising or
                    erroneous, unless a ground for setting aside is made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_277"></a>277    The outcome of this issue therefore hinges
                    on Mr Jeyaretnam’s alternative contention, which is that the Funds joined
                    themselves to the arbitration only for a limited purpose, which was because they
                    were affected by the relief sought by the defendants under the OMNA:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_277-p2_a"></a>(a)     The defendants had (wrongly)
                        commenced the arbitration to seek to avoid its payment obligations under the
                        notes and to prevent all noteholders from declaring an event of default. The
                        Funds joined the arbitration only as a party affected by the relief sought
                        by the defendants; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_277-p2_b"></a>(b)     In its notice of arbitration, the defendants’
                        allegations of breaches of the APA were limited to the original secured
                        creditors (including the original noteholders) and not to assignees of
                        entitlements under the OMNA or the notes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_278"></a>278    While Mr Jeyaretnam agrees that the Funds
                    are bound by the decision of the tribunal, he maintains that they are bound only
                    to the extent that the decision falls within the tribunal’s terms of
                    reference in relation to the Funds. After the Funds joined the arbitration, the
                    defendants did not amend their notice of arbitration to assert a claim that the
                    original noteholders <em>and</em> their assignees and
                    successors-in-interest were <em>all</em> to be held
                        <em>simultaneously</em> liable for breaches of the APA.
                    In light of this, Mr Jeyaretnam contends that the defendants’ case for
                    liability under the APA was asserted against only the original secured creditors
                    (including the original noteholders). So, he submits, the question of whether
                    the Funds (as an assignee of the notes) ought to be liable for obligations under
                    the APA falls entirely outside the tribunal’s terms of
                reference.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_279"></a>279    Mr Jeyaretnam relies on this submission to
                    assert that the tribunal breached the rules of natural justice by not giving the
                    Funds an opportunity to present their case on why assignees in their position
                    should not be held liable under the APA before holding that they were so
                    liable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendants’ submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_280"></a>280    Mr Yeap submits that the Funds voluntarily
                    subjected themselves to the tribunal’s jurisdiction without qualification
                    and conducted themselves throughout as if though they were content to be treated
                    in the same way as the original secured creditors and noteholders. As such, the
                    Funds placed themselves squarely within the four corners of the
                    defendants’ case and the tribunal’s terms of reference. The Funds
                    are therefore bound by the award regardless of whether the tribunal’s
                    decision was correct on the merits.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">My decision on Issue 7</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_281"></a>281    In my judgment, the resolution of this issue
                    requires careful consideration of the manner in which the parties conducted
                    themselves, starting with the events leading up to the Funds’ joinder
                    application all the way until the award was issued.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(1) The notice of arbitration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_282"></a>282    I turn first to the foundational document:
                    the defendants’ notice of arbitration. The Funds rely on paragraph 9 of
                    the notice of arbitration to support their argument that the defendants’
                    presented their case as being against only the original secured
                    creditors:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9. The Liquidator, the Secured Creditors, and/or [the shareholders of the
                        Corporation] stand in material breach of their obligations under the APA.
                        ... Furthermore, one or more of the Secured Creditors may have assigned or
                        transferred their entitlements under the Tranche A Note, the Tranche B Note
                        and/or the [OMNA] (all of which are referred to and elaborated upon
                        hereinafter) <em>but such assignment and/or transfer ought
                            not derogate from the obligations and liabilities undertaken by the
                            Secured Creditors under the APA for which there is no right of
                            assignment on the part of the Secured Creditors.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_283"></a>283    Mr Yeap argues that this paragraph does not
                    mean that the defendants took the position that assignees like the Funds could
                    never be liable under the APA. Instead, he contends that paragraph 9 is simply
                    the defendants’ explanation as to why it believes that the original
                    secured creditors who may have assigned or transferred their entitlements
                        (<em>ie</em>, the original noteholders) nevertheless
                    remain liable under the APA and are properly named as parties to the
                    arbitration. In my judgment, such an interpretation of paragraph 9 is completely
                    untenable in its context. The defendants must have believed that either the
                    original secured creditors or the assignees (but not both) were liable. Given
                    that the defendants would have received the notices of assignment from the Funds
                    by the time the notice of arbitration was issued, I am satisfied that the
                    defendants presented its case on the basis that only the original secured
                    creditors – and not the Funds – were liable under the
                APA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(2) A&amp;G’s letter 3 November 2010 and the parties’
                memorials</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_284"></a>284    The next significant event occurred on 3
                    November 2010 when Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP (“A&amp;G”) (then
                    counsel for the secured creditors in the arbitration) wrote to the tribunal as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whereas we previously acted exclusively for [AKP], we wish to inform that
                        we have been appointed to act <em>on the collective behalf of
                            the Secured Creditors</em>. <em>A list of specific
                            parties for whom we act is enclosed</em> for your
                        reference.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The 1st Memorial that we will shortly circulate is submitted <em>on their behalf</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_285"></a>285    The “list of Secured
                    Creditors” which A&amp;G enclosed included the Funds. Whatever the Funds
                    might have intended, the letter did suggest that the Funds saw their legal
                    position as indistinguishable from the rest of the secured creditors’ and
                    that they adopted all the arguments in the secured creditors’ 1st Memorial
                    which were of common application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_286"></a>286    The secured creditors’ 1st Memorial
                    contained both the secured creditors’ case in relation to the
                    tribunal’s lack of jurisdiction to halt payment under the notes as well as
                    its case in relation to clean title. The clean title argument, however, would
                    not have been available to an assignee in the position of the Funds unless it
                    was made in the alternative (<em>ie</em>, in the event that
                    an assignee could also be potentially be liable under the APA). But this is not
                    how it was presented to the tribunal. When the secured creditors’ 2nd
                    Memorial was presented to the tribunal, the Funds’ case was once again
                    presented without drawing any distinction between the Funds’ liability and
                    the secured creditors’ liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_287"></a>287    Despite this, and consistent with their
                    notice of arbitration, the defendants’ two memorials continued to present
                    their case on the basis that only the secured creditors who were party to the
                    APA could be held liable under the APA (to the exclusion of parties to whom the
                    original noteholders had assigned or transferred their entitlements under the
                    OMNA and notes).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(3) A&amp;G letters on 22 February 2011 and 11 March 2011</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_288"></a>288    On 22 February 2011, A&amp;G wrote to the
                    defendants’ solicitors to inform them that it would be applying formally
                    for the Funds to be joined as parties to the arbitration. In this letter,
                    A&amp;G describes the Funds as a “Secured Creditor, who was not
                    previously named in the Notice of Arbitration” and as
                    “[s]uccessor-in-interest” to the original
                noteholders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_289"></a>289    While I agree with Mr Jeyaretnam that it is
                    possible to read the phrase “successor-in-interest” as suggesting
                    that the Funds held by way of assignment only the right to be paid and did not
                    incur any obligations, I agree with Mr Yeap that the phrase in its context
                    suggested that the Funds were holding themselves out to be in the same position
                    in all respects as the original noteholders.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(4) The exchange with the tribunal on 22 March 2011</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_290"></a>290    About a week into the substantive hearing on
                    liability issues, the tribunal asked for an update on the joinder application.
                    The defendants’ counsel informed the tribunal that the defendants wished
                    to clarify if the Funds would be bound by the decision of the
                        tribunal:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Chairman:    ... So far as outstanding housekeeping
                            matters are concerned, there’s the issue of joinder.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Yeap:    Yes. We’ve looked at the documents and
                            in principle we have no objections, but I just wanted to clarify two
                            things. Number one is that presumably, they would agree to be bound by
                            the decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Chairman:    If they have become parties to the
                            arbitration then they have very little choice, having
                        applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Yeap:    I would have thought so, yes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Presumably in the context of the application that is being made, Allen
                        &amp; Gledhill would be considered as representing them in the proceedings?
                        I just wanted clarity on that point, that’s all.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A&amp;G:  Yes, we are representing the applicants to be
                            joined.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Yeap:    Very well then. Yes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_291"></a>291    Mr Jeyaretnam does not deny that the Funds
                    agreed to be bound by the tribunal’s decision. He contends instead that
                    “agreeing to be bound” means agreeing to be bound by the
                    tribunal’s findings made “for the purpose of other proceedings
                    … and having to take account of those and not reopen those
                        [findings]”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>. However, while accepting that the
                    Funds were willing to “take the rough with the smooth and would be bound
                    by the findings of the arbitrators”, Mr Jeyaretnam maintains that this
                    does not imply that the Funds had, by joining themselves as parties to the
                    arbitration, signed up to being held liable for damages on a claim that was made
                    against only the original secured creditors under an agreement to which the
                    Funds were never a party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_292"></a>292    While I have no doubt that this may have
                    been what the Funds thought at the time (why would they otherwise volunteer to
                    join an arbitration they need not be part of?), in my judgment, this did not
                    appear to be the objective message that they were sending to either the tribunal
                    or to the defendants. In the exchange above, when Mr Yeap used the phrase
                    “bound by the decision” it was obvious that he was referring to
                    the entire decision on the merits. The chairman’s response that
                    “[i]f they have become parties to the arbitration then they have very
                    little choice, having applied” showed that his underlying assumption too
                    was that having voluntarily applied to join the arbitration in the capacity of
                    “successor-in-interest” of a secured creditor, the Funds’
                    joinder application was unqualified and they agreed to be treated just like the
                    rest of the secured creditors. At no point in this exchange did counsel then
                    representing the funds suggest that their application to be joined as a party
                    was qualified in any way or that their position was distinct from the secured
                    creditors’ position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_293"></a>293    As a follow up to the exchange above,
                    A&amp;G on 24 March 2011 handed to the tribunal a document which the tribunal
                    described as “a list of secured creditors, both under the notice of
                    arbitration, and those represented by Allen &amp; Gledhill and joined as
                    parties”. This again suggested that the Funds were content with being
                    treated as if they were in the same legal position as the rest of the secured
                    creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(5) The agreed memorandum of issues </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_294"></a>294    On 18 May 2011, after the Funds had been
                    formally joined to the arbitration, the parties submitted an agreed memorandum
                    of issues. Mr Jeyaretnam argues that the liability issues here were framed as
                    being solely between the defendants and “the [Corporation’s]
                    secured creditors” and that this made it clear that the defendants’
                    claim was against the original secured creditors as opposed to assignees such as
                    the Funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_295"></a>295    The problem with this construction of the
                    memorandum of issues is that it completely undermines the Funds’ position
                    in respect of the secured creditors’ arguments which they now say were the
                    only arguments they aligned themselves with. For example, the following issue
                    was stated at paragraph 6:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6. Whether [the Corporation’s] Secured Creditors are entitled to an
                        order that [the defendants] pay [the Corporation’s] Secured
                        Creditors:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) the balance of the outstanding Purchase Price (in the event that the
                        Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction over the issue); and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) damages for losses caused by the interim injunction ordered by the
                        Singapore High Court and continued by the Tribunal by Procedural Order No. 5
                        dated 7 July 2010 (in the event the Tribunal has jurisdiction over this
                        issue).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>It was thus clear from an objective reading of the agreed
                        memorandum of issues that the Funds had aligned themselves completely and
                        without distinction with position of the secured
                creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on Issue 7</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_296"></a>296    In light of the above, I am satisfied from
                    the conduct of the Funds that they joined the arbitration on the basis that they
                    were content to be treated just like the other secured creditors, without
                    distinction and for all purposes. Whatever may be the merits of the
                    tribunal’s decision, I am satisfied that the tribunal acted within the
                    scope of its jurisdiction in finding the Funds liable under the APA. Further,
                    having aligned themselves with the position of the secured creditors, the Funds
                    are not entitled to complain on a setting aside application that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_296-p2_a"></a>(a)     the position of the Funds as
                        assignees was not put squarely in issue;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_296-p2_b"></a>(b)     the tribunal dealt with the identity of the
                        parties in only one paragraph (<em>ie</em>, paragraph 4
                        of the award) without any consideration of whether the Funds ought to be
                        treated differently from the rest of the secured
                    creditors;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_296-p2_c"></a>(c)     that
                        the agreed memorandum of issues did not contain the issue of the unique
                        position of the Funds; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_296-p2_d"></a>(d)     as a result of (a) to (c) above, it was denied natural
                        justice because the Funds had no opportunity to present any arguments as to
                        why their position was different from the rest of the secured
                        creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Despite this, as I have
                        already mentioned above, my decision on Issue 7 is strictly moot in light of
                        my decision in relation to the rest of the issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_297"></a>297    To conclude, for the reasons given above, I
                    allow all three applications in their entirety.</p>
