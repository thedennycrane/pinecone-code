This was wrong in principle. Mr Subbarayan’s interest in the Jln Membina Flat did not vanish upon his death – the question is whether his interest:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) became part of his estate; or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) passed to Mrs Subbarayan and/or Mr Damodaran who were the surviving co-owners of the Jln Membina Flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 This would in turn have an impact on Mrs Subbarayan’s and Mr Damodaran’s shares in the Jln Membina Flat presently.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Neither Mr Damodaran nor Mrs Subbarayan contended that Mr Subbarayan’s interest became part of his estate. However, Mr and Mrs Subbarayan had a daughter, Ms Tharumambal d/o Subbarayan (“Ms Tharumambal”), who was entitled to 25% of Mr Subbarayan’s estate in intestacy. As such, I asked that Mrs Subbarayan or her solicitors inform Ms Tharumambal of these proceedings, and check if she wished to be heard by the court (and in particular whether she might contend that Mr Subbarayan’s beneficial interest in the Jln Membina Flat had formed part of his estate).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 In response, I was informed that Ms Tharumambal had, in applying for letters of administration, declared Mr Subbarayan to have a one-third share in the Jln Membina Flat (presumably because he was registered as one of three joint tenants); she regarded his interest as <span class="font-italic">not</span> forming part of his estate, but instead as having devolved by survivorship.

All that Mr Damodaran could point to in his own affidavits was a passage where he stated that he had become aware that Mr Subbarayan was not feeling well in the morning of 1 October 2004, and that he had brought Mr Subbarayan to the hospital where the latter died. Mr Damodaran then added: “If only [Mrs Subbarayan] had acted earlier when [Mr Subbarayan] told her that he was unwell throughout the night before, he could have been saved.”

The answer was no. It was thus presumed that they held the beneficial interest in the same manner as that in which the legal interest was held, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that they were joint tenants both in law and in equity. There was no contrary common intention to displace this under step (b) of the <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>framework, and as such, “the parties will hold the beneficial interest in the property in the same manner as the manner in which they hold the legal interest” (<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>at [160(c)]).

Likewise, the equivalent phrase in step (a) (see <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>at [160(a)]) means that where there is insufficient evidence of the purchasers’ respective contributions, a legal joint tenancy will be presumed to also be an equitable joint tenancy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In its earlier decision in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Court of Appeal observed (at [101]) that my conclusion at [34] above will generally be right in the context of a typical marital relationship.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The presumptive inference is that Mr and Mrs Subbarayan held their interests in the Lower Delta Flat as legal and beneficial joint tenants.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Given these circumstances, I find that Mr and Mrs Subbarayan intended to own the Lower Delta Flat jointly; if either of them should die, it was intended that the survivor would become the absolute beneficial owner. Even if there were no such intention, the presumption of advancement would operate to bring about the same result. In this regard, having regard to the matters stated in [36] above, I find that the nature and state of the marriage was an “ordinary, caring matrimonial relationship”/“typical caring and amiable matrimonial relationship” (see <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> ([32] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [101]–[102]). It would thus be appropriate to apply the presumption of advancement, if that were required.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In this case, there is no need to rely on a presumption of advancement under step (e) of the <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> ([32] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) framework to rebut a presumption of resulting trust under step (a), because no presumption of resulting trust arises here due to the insufficient evidence of Mr and Mrs Subbarayan’s individual contributions to the purchase price of the Lower Delta Flat. Moreover, Mr Damodaran did not contend that there was a resulting trust as between Mr and Mrs Subbarayan in relation to the Lower Delta Flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 My conclusion that Mr and Mrs Subbarayan were both legal and beneficial joint tenants of the Lower Delta Flat is also consonant with the observation in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> ([32] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) regarding property ownership in a typical marital relationship. As stated at [101] of <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>, “… in cases where married spouses who contribute jointly (whether in equal proportions or otherwise) to the purchase of a property (in particular, their matrimonial homes) hold that property as legal joint tenants … there is a presumptive inference that the parties intended to hold the property as joint tenants in <span class="font-italic">equity</span> as well”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 That observation applies fully here: Mr and Mrs Subbarayan contributed jointly to their acquisition of the Lower Delta Flat (as can be seen from the refunds to both their CPF accounts when the flat was compulsorily acquired by the HDB); the flat was their matrimonial home (see <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> ([32] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [101]–[102]); and the flat was held by them as legal joint tenants.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">How did Mr and Mrs Subbarayan hold their interests in the Jln Membina Flat?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 For the foregoing reasons at [32]–[40] above, I concluded that when the Jln Membina Flat was acquired, it was likewise held by Mr and Mrs Subbarayan as legal and beneficial joint tenants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Mr Damodaran argued that because Mr Subbarayan had agreed for Mr Damodaran to become a joint tenant merely three years after the purchase of the Jln Membina Flat, Mr Subbarayan could not have intended for him (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Mr Subbarayan) and Mrs Subbarayan to hold the property as beneficial joint tenants.

</div> This argument is unsound. On Mr Damodaran’s own case, it was only in November 2003 that there were discussions about his taking over the balance of the loan and becoming a joint tenant; that was after the HDB had sent a final notice on 19 November 2003 about the housing loan being three months in arrears (for September to November 2003).

But Mr Damodaran did not contend that Mr Subbarayan’s beneficial interest had become part of his estate and ought to be divided 50% to Mrs Subbarayan, 25% to Mr Damodaran and 25% to Ms Tharumambal (who moreover was willing to have her share go to Mrs Subbarayan).

As such, I find that Mr and Mrs Subbarayan continued to hold their interest in the Jln Membina Flat jointly; Mr Damodaran then became a third legal joint tenant (with a beneficial interest as a tenant in common, in proportion to his contribution). Mr Damodaran rightly did not contend that there had been any advancement from his parents to him merely because they had added him as a third joint tenant; his case was that he would only get a share proportionate to his contribution to the Jln Membina Flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Low Yin Ni</span> <span class="font-italic">and another v Tay Yuan Wei Jaycie (formerly known as Tay Yeng Choo Jessy) and another </span>[2020] SGCA 58 (“<span class="font-italic">Low Yin Ni</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>recognised (at [10]) that in equity, some co-owners may hold their interests jointly as between each other (like the parents in that case), while other co-owners hold individual shares (like the son and daughter-in-law in that case). My conclusion here is in a similar vein: Mr and Mrs Subbarayan held a beneficial interest in the Jln Membina Flat jointly, with Mr Damodaran individually holding the remainder of the beneficial interest as a tenant in common.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">What happened to Mr Subbarayan’s beneficial interest in the Jln Membina Flat upon his death?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 From my finding that Mr and Mrs Subbarayan held their beneficial interest in the Jln Membina Flat jointly, it follows that upon Mr Subbarayan’s death, Mrs Subbarayan became the sole beneficial owner of that interest by survivorship. Mrs Subbarayan and Mr Damodaran remained legal joint tenants (until Mrs Subbarayan severed that joint tenancy in June 2019), and were beneficial tenants in common with Mr Damodaran’s share being proportionate to his contribution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 As such, I find that no part of Mr Subbarayan’s beneficial interest passed to Mr Damodaran upon his death. Ironically, this is also supported by what Mr Damodaran said about the circumstances in which he was added as a joint tenant: “The process of including me as joint tenant instead of as a tenant-in-common based on my individual contribution was out of convenience. As my father did not buy the [Jln Membina Flat] as an investment but rather as a home for his family (which included [Mrs Subbarayan], my wife, my children and I) we never made plans to convert the joint tenancy into a tenancy-in-common based on our respective contributions (even though that was the nature of our agreement).”

</div>
</div> That difference of $383.66 would be due to the interest he paid on the new housing loan of $10,800 as he paid it off in monthly instalments of $193.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 It is more accurate to use the principal sum of $171,400 rather than the sum of $171,783.66 inclusive of interest in reckoning Mr Damodaran’s contribution. I have likewise not included any interest paid by Mr and Mrs Subbarayan on the original housing loan, in the course of their reducing the principal amount due by $4,100 from $175,500 to $171,400, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, their contribution in this regard would be $4,100 and not $4,100 plus interest. Moreover, the other payments totaling $161,610.75 made by them at the time of purchase, and the additional $206.85 in fees paid from Mrs Subbarayan’s CPF account in 2004, were lump sum payments with no element of interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 If interest were included, that would mean that Mr Damodaran could get a greater share in the Jln Membina Flat by paying off the balance of $171,400 by way of a long-term loan, rather than by making a lump sum payment for all or much of the balance. It cannot be right that the more interest he paid, the greater his share would be. This would also not be consistent with the discussions in 2003–2004 on Mr Damodaran paying off the balance of the housing loan – that balance was around half of the cost of acquiring the Jln Membina Flat (leaving aside the issue of renovation costs), and the parties could not have intended that Mr Damodaran would get a share exceeding that proportion, just because of interest that he might pay in the years to come.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Excluding interest in ascertaining contributions is also consistent with “… the orthodox conception of the resulting trust as a trust which crystallises at the time the property is acquired” (<span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel v Emmanuel Priya Ethel Anne and another</span> [2016] 3 SLR 1222 (“<span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel</span>”) at [87] on <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> ([32] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [112]–[113] and [117]), as well as the proposition in <span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel</span> at [89] that “… it is correct to analyse the position by reference to the responsibility that is undertaken by each party for loan repayments at the time the property is acquired”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Excluding interest is correct on a resulting trust analysis, and it would also be consonant with the parties’ intentions here. It is likely that there was some agreement or understanding to the effect that Mr Damodaran would get a share in the Jln Membina Flat proportionate to his financial contribution towards it, in particular, his taking over the balance of the housing loan. The original mortgage was accordingly discharged. But he could not “grow” that share by paying interest on whatever new loan amount he chose to take up.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Mr Damodaran also claimed that he had been the one paying for the monthly loan instalments for the whole period from September 2001 until August 2003 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, for 24 months, totaling $16,872). His first affidavit was however inconsistent on this; at paragraph 7, he claimed to have paid the monthly loan instalments until August 2003, but at paragraph 8 he said that he had stopped paying in July 2003.

At least the instalment for the first month (for September 2001) would have been paid by Mr Subbarayan (from his CPF account), and Mr and Mrs Subbarayan had enough funds to meet the subsequent monthly loan repayments. But if Mr Damodaran had paid the monthly loan instalments, he would not thereby acquire any share in the Jln Membina Flat – a flat of which he was not one of the registered owners at that time. Mr Damodaran did not argue that any such payments had been made pursuant to an agreement, understanding or expectation that he would thereby get a share in the Jln Membina Flat. The only such agreement that he asserted was arrived at in November 2003 (pursuant to which he became a joint tenant and assumed responsibility for the balance of the mortgage loan).

However, it would have sufficed to refer to the payment of $13,288.61, since the court did not have to determine the parties’ exact contributions in order to work out their proportionate shares in the flat. The case is also distinguishable in that the purchase of the flat was LSK’s idea in the first place (see <span class="font-italic">Rosalind Lee </span>at [10]), and there was some agreement to the effect that she would become an owner of the flat one day (see <span class="font-italic">Rosalind Lee </span>at [5]–[6], [15] and [19]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Other contributions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Mr Damodaran also claimed to have paid towards utilities, service and conservancy charges and property tax from 2001 to date.

In cases where some of the parties became co-owners later, and they did not all make contributions at the same time, our courts have not reckoned the earlier parties’ contributions in terms of market value when the later parties came into the picture – see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Low Yin Ni</span> ([51] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [10] and <span class="font-italic">BUE </span><span class="font-italic">and another v TZQ and another </span>[2019] 3 SLR 1022 at [18].

Two possible justifications for equitable accounting are: (a) a right of contribution which is an incident of one discharging another’s obligation, or (b) that payment by one co-owner has increased the value of the property and the other co-owner should make an allowance for that in taking the benefit of the property’s increased value (see <span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel </span>at [97]–[101]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The excess payment of $4,480 does not seem to fall within the principles of equitable accounting – Mr and Mrs Subbarayan did not thereby discharge any obligation which Damodaran ought to have contributed towards, nor did the payment increase the value of the property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In any event, on the facts I did not consider that Mr Damodaran should be required to account for the sum of $4,480. Although I found that that sum did not go towards renovations, Mr Damodaran appeared to have spent at least $2,682.66 on furniture, furnishings, electrical appliances and the like.

</div> In all, Mr Damodaran would have spent more than the sum of $4,480 for the benefit of those living in the Jln Membina Flat.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Mrs Subbarayan’s affidavit dated 19 February 2020, para 22.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This was premised on Mr Damodaran’s family unit (comprising Mr Damodaran, his wife, and their two children) occupying more of the Jln Membina Flat than Mrs Subbarayan. But Mr Damodaran’s wife was also Mrs Subbarayan’s daughter-in-law, Mr Damodaran’s children were also Mrs Subbarayan’s grandchildren, and Mr Damodaran was Mrs Subbarayan’s son. Mr Damodaran had stayed with his parents all along, his wife did too when they got married, and his children had followed suit since their birth. No issue was ever raised about charging Mr Damodaran rent, until that was raised for the first time in these proceedings. As things transpired, Mr Damodaran became a co-owner of the Jln Membina Flat and contributed substantially to its acquisition. It would be wrong to charge Mr Damodaran rent on account of him, his wife, and his children staying in the Jln Membina Flat together with Mrs Subbarayan. This was not an extreme case like <span class="font-italic">In </span><span class="font-italic">re Pavlou</span> [1993] 1 WLR 1046 where one co-owner was in sole occupation of the property, and equitable accounting was thus held (at 1048 and 1050) to be justified. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 In Mrs Subbarayan’s affidavit, she had referred to such rent, and the $200/month she claimed to have contributed towards the household’s marketing expenses every month, in response to Mr Damodaran referring to his payments towards property tax, service and conservancy charges, and utilities. But I have not regarded those payments by Mr Damodaran as contributions that affect his share of the Jln Membina Flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In any event, whether in relation to the excess payment of $4,480 that Mr Damodaran had received from Mr and Mrs Subbarayan, the occupation rent which Mrs Subbarayan contended Mr Damodaran was now liable for, or the marketing expenses that Mrs Subbarayan claimed to have paid for, the facts show that these payments had been made with the intention of benefitting everyone who stayed in the Jln Membina Flat. In <span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel</span> ([71] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [105], the Court of Appeal made the following observations as to when equitable accounting may <span class="font-italic">not</span> be called in aid in the context of mortgage repayments: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In our judgment, the extent to which each party is expected to contribute to mortgage repayments will largely depend on the common understanding or agreement between the parties at the time the mortgage is taken out. … If there is a <span class="font-italic">material</span> departure from that common understanding, and one party repays more of the mortgage than was initially envisaged, then equitable accounting may be brought into play, unless it is shown that at the time the mortgage repayments were made, <span class="font-italic">the payor had the intention to benefit the other co-owners</span>. This follows from the fact that the basis underlying the remedy of equitable accounting is a notional request to contribute so as to restore the parties to what had been their common understanding at the time the mortgage was taken out; but if the evidence is that the payor intended to benefit the other co-owners, there would be no room for any such notional request for contribution to be inferred. In these circumstances, equity will not require a co-owner to contribute.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Although the Court of Appeal’s observations were made in the context of mortgage repayments, I see no reason why they should not apply with equal force to the various payments that Mrs Subbarayan sought equitable accounting for. There was no common understanding as to who should bear those expenses, and equitable accounting would thus be inappropriate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 It is understandable that Mrs Subbarayan would be upset about these proceedings having been brought by Mr Damodaran, the claims he made, and the positions he took. But I did not consider an accounting as between the parties to be warranted. It was submitted on Mrs Subbarayan’s behalf that anything Mr Damodaran had done for her on account of his filial duty should not be the subject matter of computation of contribution or equitable accounting.
