<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In this application, the defendant sought to
                    strike out portions of the plaintiffs’ Statement of Claim filed on 29
                    December 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiffs are a partnership operating a
                    restaurant and bar in Bali known as “Ku De Ta”. The third
                    plaintiff registered the trade mark “KU DE TA” in Indonesia in
                    2000 and holds proprietorship of that mark on behalf of the
                partnership.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The defendant is a company incorporated in
                    Singapore. In 2010, it opened a restaurant and bar at Marina Bay Sands that was
                    also styled “Ku De Ta”. In the course of its business, the
                    defendant used two trade marks incorporating the words “Ku de Ta”.
                    These trade marks (“the Nine Square Registered Marks”) were
                    registered in Singapore in 2004 and 2009 respectively by an Australian company,
                    Nine Squares Pty Ltd (“Nine Squares”). In 2009, the Nine Square
                    Registered Marks were licensed to Chris Au, who was the Chief Executive Officer
                    of the defendant. In turn, Chris Au assigned his rights under the license to the
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       When the plaintiffs came to know of the
                    restaurant and bar in Singapore, they took out an action against the defendant,
                    seeking, <em>inter alia</em>, an order that the
                    defendant:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">immediately ceases and be restrained from the use of the name/ mark
                        “Ku De Ta” or any name / mark similar

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       One of the causes of action pleaded in the
                    Statement of Claim was founded on s 55 of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 322, 2005 Rev
                    Ed) (“TMA”):</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The defendant took out the present application
                    under O 18 r 19(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Rules of Court (Cap
                    322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed), seeking to strike out paragraphs 32 – 35 of the
                    Statement of Claim (set out above at <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>), on
                    the basis that those paragraphs disclosed no reasonable cause of
                action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defendant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The protection given to well known trade marks
                    under s 55 is limited by s 55A of the TMA. Relying on s 55A(2), the defendant
                    submitted that the paragraphs it sought to strike out, which essentially
                    contained the plaintiffs’ cause of action based on s 55 of the TMA,
                    disclosed no reasonable cause of action:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Permitted use of well known trade
                        marks</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">55A. —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) Notwithstanding section 55, the proprietor of a well known
                        trade mark shall not be entitled to restrain by injunction the use in
                        Singapore of any registered trade mark in relation to goods or services
                        for which the latter is registered. </p>
<p class="Judg-1">In essence, the defendant’s submission was that the Nine Squares
                    Registered Marks were registered in Singapore. It was a licensed user of those
                    trade marks. It could therefore avail itself of the s 55A(2) defence. This
                    provided a complete answer to the plaintiffs’ claim under s 55 of the TMA
                    such that paras 32 – 35 of the Statement of Claim could disclose no valid
                    cause of action. Accordingly, those portions of the pleading should be struck
                    out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiffs’ case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The plaintiff, by contrast, submitted that s
                    55A(2) did not provide an absolute defence to a claim under s 55 of the TMA. The
                    defence would not apply where the registered trade marks were liable to be
                    invalidated. In addition to the Suit brought in the High Court against the
                    defendant, the plaintiffs were seeking the invalidation of the Nine Squares
                    Registered Marks against Nine Squares. The ability of the defendant to raise the
                    s 55A(2) defence was contingent on the plaintiffs failing in their invalidation
                    application, which had yet to be determined. As such, the high threshold for a
                    striking out application was not met, given that triable issues of law and fact
                    were present.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Having heard the submissions of counsel, I
                    dismissed the application. I now give my reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     It is trite law that it is only in plain and
                    obvious cases that recourse should be had to the summary process under O 18 r
                    19. As set out in <em>Singapore Civil Proceedure 2007</em>
                    (G P Selvam ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2007) at para 18/19/10 (“<em>Singapore Civil Procedure</em>”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">So long as the statement of claim or the particulars (<em>Davey v. Bentinck</em> [1893] 1 Q.B. 185) disclose some cause of
                        action, or raise some question fit to be decided by a judge, the mere fact
                        that the case is weak, and not likely to succeed, is no ground for striking
                        it out…</p>

                            permitted uses of well known trade marks for consistency with the
                            permitted uses of registered trade marks under section 28.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Pursuant to Article 3 of the Joint
                    Recommendation, member states are required to protect a well-known mark against
                    conflicting marks, business and domain names, at least with effect from the time
                    when the mark has become well known in the member state. When a mark is deemed
                    to be in conflict with a well-known mark in respect of identical or similar
                    goods and/or services, member states are obliged to provide certain remedies.
                    Article 4(2) provides that if the member state’s laws allow third parties
                    to oppose the registration of a mark, a conflict with a well-known shall
                    constitute a ground for opposition. Article 4(3) provides that even after
                    registration, the owner of a well-known mark shall be entitled to request that
                    the conflicting mark be invalidated. Significantly, Article 4(4) provides that
                    the owner of the well-known mark shall be entitled to request the prohibition of
                    the conflicting mark:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4) [ <em>Prohibition of Use</em>] The owner of a
                        well-known mark shall be entitled to request the prohibition, by a decision
                        of the competent authority, of the use of a mark which is in conflict with
                        the well-known mark. Such request shall be admissible for a period which
                        shall not be less than five years beginning from the time the owner of the
                        well-known mark had knowledge of the use of the conflicting mark. [emphasis
                        and brackets in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">(see also para 4.11 of the Explanatory Notes to the Joint
                    Recommendation). Member states are clearly obliged to provide the Article 4(4)
                    remedy <em>in addition</em> to the remedies of commencing
                    opposition or invalidation procedures provided in Article 4(2) and
                (3).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     If the defendant’s literal
                    interpretation of ss 55 and 55A(2) of the TMA were adopted, the owner of a
                    well-known mark would not be entitled to request the prohibition of the use of a
                    conflicting mark so long as the latter is a registered trade mark. This would
                    render Article 4(4) of the Joint Recommendation otiose, instead of giving effect
                    to it was ss 55 and 55A of the TMA were meant to. Arguably, therefore, s 55A(2)
                    could not be said to provide a complete answer to a claim under s 55 of the
                    TMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The interpretation that s 55A(2) is not an
                    unassailable defence was also buttressed by the consideration that s 55A was
                    meant to render the permitted uses of well known trade marks consistent with the
                    permitted uses of registered trade marks under s 28 of the TMA, which
                    provides:</p>

                            registered. This means that the proprietor of the other registered mark
                            can continue to use his mark without infringing the registered trade
                            mark, provided the use is in relation to goods or services for which his
                            mark is registered. If the use is in relation to goods or services which
                            are merely <em>similar</em> to those for which the
                            mark is registered, the defence may not apply.</p>

                            [TMA], it is stated that where the registration of a trade mark is
                            declared invalid to any extent, the registration shall to that extent be
                            deemed never to have been made. Similarly, in section 22(8) [of the
                            TMA], it is provided that where the registration of a trade mark is
                            revoked to any extent, the rights of the proprietor shall be deemed to
                            have ceased to that extent as from the date of the application for
                            revocation or, if the Registrar or the court is satisfied that the
                            grounds for revocation existed at an earlier date, from that
                            date.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in italics in original; emphasis in bold added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This is also the position taken in the UK, where s 11(1) of the Trade
                    Marks Act 1994 (c. 26) is <em>in pari materia</em> to our
                    local provision (see <em>Kerly’s Law of Trade Marks and
                        Trade Names</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 14th Ed, 2005) at para
                    14-147). If s 55A(2) is to mirror the scope and application of s 28(3), it
                    similarly ought not to provide a complete defence where the trade mark
                    complained of was not validly registered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The defendant had suggested that procedurally,
                    it was premature to bring a cause of action based on s 55 of the TMA before
                    invalidation proceedings were commenced. It submitted that the proper course, so
                    as to reconcile ss 55 and 55A(2), was for the registered trade mark to be
                    properly invalidated before restraining orders were sought. This, purportedly,
                    would strike the correct balance between the rights of the owner of the
                    registered trade mark and the rights of the owner of the well known mark. I did
                    not agree. First, the prolonged use of an invalidly registered trade mark could
                    result in substantial dilution of the goodwill accruing to the well known mark,
                    which is a form of damage not easily compensable in monetary terms. While the
                    owner of the registered trade mark could arguably state similar concerns, s
                    55(7) of the TMA places the onus on the owner of the well known mark to take
                    timely action as he loses his entitlement to seek certain remedies if he
                    acquiesces for a continued period of 5 years in the use of the allegedly
                    offending registered traade mark. This would limit the damage likely to be
                    suffered by the owner of the registered trade mark whereas the converse is not
                    true for the owner of the well known mark who would therefore be inadequately
                    protected. Second, as already mentioned above (at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>), one of the purposes of enacting ss 55 and 55A of the TMA
                    was to give effect to the Joint Recommendation. Paragraph 4.8 of the Explanatory
                    Notes to the Joint Recommendation suggests that owners of well known marks were
                    intended to be given early opportunities to take action against conflicting
                    registered trade marks. Adopting the defendant’s interpretation of the
                    statutory provision of the TMA would not give effect to this
                intention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Given the above, it was by no means plain and
                    obvious that paras 32 – 35 of the Statement of Claim could disclose no
                    valid cause of action based on a statutory interpretation of ss 55 and 55A of
                    the TMA. At the minimum, the pleadings in the Statement of Claim raised a
                    triable issue of law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether no valid cause of action could be made out when only the
                allegations in the pleading are considered</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The third plaintiff took out invalidation
                    proceedings at the Trade Mark Registry against the Nine Squares Registered Marks
                    in July 2010. On 14 January 2011, he made an application to refer the
                    invalidation proceedings to the High Court. This was denied by the Trade Mark
                    Registry on 19 January 2011. The third plaintiff subsequently withdrew his
                    application to the Trade Mark Registry and instead filed Originating Summons 198
                    of 2010 in the High Court to invalidate the Nine Squares Registered Marks. The
                    fact of the invalidation proceedings in the High Court was relied upon in the
                    plaintiffs’ submission that paras 32 – 35 of the Statement of Claim
                    should not be struck out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In response, the defendant submitted that the
                    commencement of invalidation proceedings by way of a separate Originating
                    Summons was irrelevant to the question of whether or not the plaintiffs had a
                    valid cause of action in the present Suit. This was because the invalidation was
                    not sought in the pleadings in the present Suit but in separate proceedings
                    against another separate party. In the Statement of Claim, only the fact of the
                    invalidation proceedings taken out with the Trade Marks Registry was
                        pleaded.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Since the application to the Trade
                    Marks Registry had been withdrawn, there was nothing in the Statement of Claim
                    to show that the Nine Squares Registered Marks were invalid or could be
                    invalidated even if all the pleadings in the Statement of Claim were proven.
                    Accordingly, the s 55A(2) defence applied as a complete defence such that no
                    valid cause of action could be made out against the defendant. The defendant
                    relied on the rule that a reasonable cause of action is a cause of action which
                    has some chance of success <em>when only the allegations in the
                        pleadings are considered</em> (see <em>Gabriel Peter
                        &amp; Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and
                    others</em>[1997] 3 SLR(R) 649 at [21]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In my view, it was not plain and obvious that
                    no valid cause of action could be made out even when only the allegations in the
                    Statement of Claim were considered. On the contrary, the plaintiffs had set out
                    clearly in their pleadings that “Nine Squares had no right to apply for
                    the registration of or to register the name / mark “Ku de Ta” in
                    the Singapore Registry of Trade Marks”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> It has also clearly
                    expressed its intention to seek the invalidation of the Nine Squares Registered
                        Marks.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>
                    These facts, if proven, would be sufficient to found a valid cause of action
                    against the defendant. The means by which the Nine Squares Registered Marks
                    would be invalidated was a matter of evidence and not fact that need not be set
                    out in the Statement of Claim. Putting the defendant’s case at the
                    highest, the plaintiffs’ Statement of Claim lacked sufficient
                    particularity. However, where a pleading is defective only in not containing
                    particulars to which the other side is entitled, application should only be made
                    for particulars under O 18 r 12, and not for an order to strike out the pleading
                    under O 18 r 19 (<em>Singapore Civil Procedure</em> at para
                    18/19/11).</p>
