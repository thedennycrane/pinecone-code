        Sundaresh Menon CJ (delivering the judgment of the

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The present appeals are both brought by the
                    appellant, PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) TBK (“PGN”),
                    against the respondent, CRW Joint Operation (“CRW”). Civil Appeal
                    No 148 of 2013 (“CA 148”) concerns the question of
                    whether a majority arbitral award dated 22 May 2013 (“the Interim
                    Award”) ordering PGN to pay CRW a sum of US$17,298,834.57 (“the
                    Adjudicated Sum”) should be set aside, while Civil Appeal No 149 of
                    2013 (“CA 149”) concerns the question of whether the order of
                    court dated 2 July 2013 granting CRW leave to enforce the Interim Award
                    against PGN in the same manner as a court judgment (“the Enforcement
                    Order”) should be set aside. The Adjudicated Sum was the amount that the
                    dispute adjudication board (“DAB”) constituted under the contract
                    between the parties (“the Contract”) found PGN liable to CRW for.
                    Reference of a dispute to the DAB is the first step under the dispute resolution
                    regime prescribed in the Contract. These appeals turn on the interpretation of
                    various aspe--cts of that regime as well as the effect of s 19B of the
                    International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the
                    IAA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Justice Quentin Loh and I have had the
                    advantage of reading in draft the judgment of Chan Sek Keong SJ. With
                    respect, we do not agree with Chan SJ’s views. This judgment sets out
                    the decision of this court, which is reached by a majority consisting of
                    Loh J and myself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       PGN is an Indonesian company that owns and
                    operates gas transmission systems in Indonesia. CRW is a group consisting of
                    three Indonesian limited liability companies. In 2006, PGN engaged CRW to
                    design, procure, install, test and pre-commission a pipeline to convey natural
                    gas from South Sumatra to West Java. The parties’ relationship was
                    governed by the Contract, which included (among other documents) a set of
                    conditions of contract (“the Conditions of Contract”). The
                    Conditions of Contract adopted, with modification, the standard provisions of
                    the <em>Conditions of Contract for Construction: For Building and
                        Engineering Works Designed by the Employer</em> (“the Red
                    Book”) published by the International Federation of Consulting Engineers
                    or, as that body is known in French, the Fédération Internationale des
                    Ingénieurs-Conseils (“FIDIC”). Specifically, the Conditions of
                    Contract were modelled on the 1999 edition of the Red Book (“the 1999 Red
                    Book”). The Contract was governed by Indonesian law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In the course of the project, CRW submitted a
                    number of Variation Order Proposals (“VOPs”) to PGN for variation
                    works which CRW contended it had carried out. These were disputed by PGN. The
                    parties referred their dispute over 13 VOPs to the DAB in accordance with the
                    dispute resolution mechanism set out in cl 20 of the Conditions of
                    Contract.</p>

                        DAB that is relevant to the dispute.</p>

                        parties because no NOD has been issued within the stipulated time frame, but
                        a party fails to comply with it, that failure may be referred to arbitration
                        directly without the parties having to first go through the steps set out in
                        cll 20.4 and 20.5.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The DAB decision which PGN rejected</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The DAB rendered several decisions on the 13
                    disputed VOPs. PGN accepted all of these decisions except the third decision
                    (“DAB No 3”), under which it was required to pay CRW the
                    Adjudicated Sum. This decision was conveyed to the parties on 19 November
                    2008 at a meeting. The DAB subsequently issued the written grounds for its
                    decision on 25 November 2008. PGN lodged an NOD against DAB No 3 on
                    20 November 2008 without waiting for those written grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The arbitration in 2009 </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       CRW made several requests to PGN for payment of
                    the Adjudicated Sum awarded under DAB No 3, but to no avail. Taking the
                    view that PGN was in breach of its obligations under the Conditions of Contract,
                    CRW commenced arbitration on 13 February 2009 claiming, essentially, a
                    declaration that PGN had an immediate obligation to pay CRW the Adjudicated Sum
                    and an order for “prompt payment” of that sum (“the 2009
                    Arbitration”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       PGN did not file a counterclaim. However, by way
                    of its defence, PGN sought from the tribunal (“the 2009 Tribunal”)
                    a declaration that: (a) DAB No 3 was not final and binding;
                    (b) PGN was not obliged to pay CRW the Adjudicated Sum; and (c) PGN
                    had not breached any of its obligations under the Conditions of Contract in
                    refusing to pay CRW that sum. In its defence, PGN also requested the 2009
                    Tribunal to “open up, review and revise” the DAB’s decision
                    in DAB No 3. PGN’s position, in essence, was that having issued an
                    NOD in respect of DAB No 3, it was no longer obliged to pay the Adjudicated
                    Sum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The majority of the 2009 Tribunal (“the
                    2009 Majority Arbitrators”) agreed with CRW. In their award dated
                    24 November 2009, which they termed a “final” award
                    (“the Final Award”), the 2009 Majority Arbitrators held (at [41])
                    that cl 20.4 of the Conditions of Contract made it “abundantly
                    clear” that a DAB decision had to be given prompt effect and could only
                    be varied by a subsequent amicable settlement or arbitral award. The 2009
                    Majority Arbitrators concluded that service of an NOD did not alter that
                    position. Such service was no more than compliance with a condition precedent
                    that had to be met before a party dissatisfied with a DAB decision could refer
                    that decision to arbitration. The 2009 Majority Arbitrators, and indeed, even
                    CRW, were in agreement that PGN could, if it wished, commence a new arbitration
                    to review and revise DAB No 3, but this was not a course open to it in the
                    2009 Arbitration because the only relief which CRW had sought in that
                    arbitration was for DAB No 3 to be honoured, and because PGN had not issued
                    a counterclaim to set aside that decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The first set of enforcement proceedings </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Pursuant to its application in Originating
                    Summons No 7 of 2010, CRW obtained leave under s 19 of the IAA to
                    enforce the Final Award in the same manner as a court judgment. PGN applied by
                    way of Originating Summons No 206 of 2010 (“OS 206”) to
                    have the Final Award set aside on various grounds. Primarily, it argued
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     the 2009 Majority Arbitrators
                        exceeded their jurisdiction in converting DAB No 3 into a final award
                        without first determining the correctness of the DAB’s decision on the
                        13 disputed VOPs;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with cl 20.6 of the
                        Conditions of Contract, which required the 2009 Tribunal to determine the
                        merits of the parties’ underlying dispute over the correctness or the
                        merits of DAB No 3 (the parties “Underlying Dispute”)
                        before DAB No 3 could be converted into a final award;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     the 2009
                        Majority Arbitrators’ refusal and/or failure to hear the parties on
                        the merits of the Underlying Dispute was a breach of natural
                    justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The judge who heard OS 206 (“the
                    OS 206 judge”) found in favour of PGN on only the first of the three
                    grounds listed at [11] above and set aside the Final Award on that basis (see
                        <em>PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) TBK v CRW Joint
                        Operation</em> [2010] 4 SLR 672 (“<em>Persero HC (2010)</em>”). She rejected PGN’s contention
                    that the parties’ agreed arbitral procedure had not been complied with and
                    that there had been a breach of natural justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     CRW appealed against the decision of the
                    OS 206 judge to set aside the Final Award. In its decision issued on
                    13 July 2011 (reported as <em>CRW Joint Operation v
                        PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) TBK</em> [2011] 4 SLR 305
                        (“<em>Persero CA</em>”)), the Court of
                    Appeal upheld the OS 206 judge’s decision that the 2009 Majority
                    Arbitrators had exceeded their jurisdiction in failing to consider the merits of
                    the parties’ Underlying Dispute before issuing the Final Award. The Court
                    of Appeal also held that there had been a breach of natural justice because PGN
                    had not been given a real opportunity to defend itself against the claim for the
                    sum it was ordered to pay CRW under DAB No 3.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The arbitration in 2011 </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In <em>Persero CA</em>,
                    the Court of Appeal commented, <em>obiter</em>, that:
                    (a) PGN was contractually obliged to comply with DAB No 3 even though
                    it had issued an NOD in respect of that decision and the merits of that decision
                    were being arbitrated; and (b) DAB No 3 was “enforceable
                    directly by an interim or partial award” (at [63]). Relying on the Court
                    of Appeal’s interpretation of cl 20 of the Conditions of Contract,
                    CRW commenced a second arbitration in October 2011 (“the 2011
                    Arbitration”). This time, it sought a final determination that PGN was
                    liable, on the merits, to pay CRW the Adjudicated Sum awarded under DAB
                    No 3, and pending that final determination, a partial or interim award for
                    the same sum (with interest).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The arbitral tribunal in the 2011 Arbitration
                    (“the 2011 Tribunal”) unanimously agreed that DAB No 3 was
                    binding on the parties even though PGN had issued an NOD in respect of that
                    decision. However, the 2011 Tribunal was divided on the issue of whether CRW was
                    entitled to enforce DAB No 3 by way of an interim award. The majority of
                    the 2011 Tribunal (“the 2011 Majority Arbitrators”) thought that
                    DAB No 3 could and should be enforced by an interim award. They opined that
                    enforcing DAB No 3 in that manner would give effect to the parties’
                    commercial intent in including the DAB mechanism in the Conditions of Contract;
                    otherwise, the DAB mechanism would be rendered toothless.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     One of the arguments which the 2011 Tribunal
                    had to deal with was PGN’s contention that the interim award sought by CRW
                    would be inconsistent with s 19B of the IAA (referred to hereafter as
                    “s 19B” for short). Section 19B provides:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     PGN contended that the interim award sought by
                    CRW would not be “final” for the purposes of s 19B since DAB
                    No 3 was liable subsequently to be opened up and reviewed pursuant to
                    cl 20.6[2] of the Conditions of Contract at the arbitration of the
                    parties’ Underlying Dispute over the merits of DAB No 3. The 2011
                    Majority Arbitrators disagreed with PGN. They were satisfied that an interim
                    award giving effect to DAB No 3 would possess the requisite measure of
                    finality and would not contravene s 19B. Their explanation was as follows
                    (at [51]–[52] of the Interim Award):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">51.    The Tribunal [<em>ie</em>,
                            the 2011 Majority Arbitrators] considers that even though [DAB
                            No 3] can be opened up at the arbitration hearing, an award giving
                            effect to it will still be final <u>up to a certain
                                point in time</u>, i.e. pending the resolution of the dispute
                            in the arbitration. Put another way, the decision is final as to the
                            issue before the Tribunal, namely, whether payment has to be made prior
                            to the determination of the matters raised in the NOD.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">52.    In other words, an interim award giving effect to
                            [DAB No 3] pending the resolution of the parties’ dispute is
                            still final in the sense that it will not and cannot be altered

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The dissenting arbitrator in the 2011
                    Arbitration regarded the interim award sought by CRW as a <em>provisional</em> award and considered that such an award was
                    precluded in an arbitration seated in Singapore by reason of s 19B. He was
                    of the view that by virtue of cl 20.6 of the Conditions of Contract (see
                    [5] above), an interim award giving effect to a decision of the DAB could be
                    revised, and this, he concluded, was directly contrary to
                s 19B.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The second set of enforcement proceedings </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Despite the issuance of the Interim Award, PGN
                    maintained its refusal to pay CRW the Adjudicated Sum awarded under DAB
                    No 3, prompting CRW to apply by way of Originating Summons No 585 of
                    2013 (“OS 585”) for leave to enforce the Interim Award in the
                    same manner as a court judgment. Leave was given in the form of the Enforcement
                    Order (as defined at [1] above), but PGN subsequently filed Summons No 3923
                    of 2013 (“SUM 3923”) to set aside that order. At the same
                    time, PGN also filed Originating Summons No 683 of 2013
                    (“OS 683”) to set aside the Interim Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     SUM 3923 and OS 683 were heard by
                    the same judge (“the Judge”), who was a different judge from the
                    OS 206 judge. PGN argued that the Interim Award was in effect a provisional
                    award because the 2011 Majority Arbitrators intended that award to be final only
                    up to the time the 2011 Tribunal determined the parties’ Underlying
                    Dispute on the merits with finality. The legislative history of s 19B, PGN
                    submitted, revealed that such provisional awards were prohibited by that
                    section. Furthermore, the Interim Award had the effect of preventing the 2011
                    Tribunal from proceeding to determine the merits of the Underlying Dispute
                    because that future determination would vary, amend, correct, review, add to or
                    revoke the Interim Award in a manner prohibited by s 19B(2). Therefore, PGN
                    contended, the 2011 Majority Arbitrators had acted in excess of their
                    jurisdiction, in breach of natural justice and/or in breach of the
                    parties’ agreed arbitral procedure in issuing the Interim Award, which
                    should therefore be set aside under s 24 of the IAA and/or Art 34(2)

                    Award and dismissed both SUM 3923 and OS 683 (see <em>PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) TBK v CRW Joint Operation
                        (Indonesia) and another matter</em> [2014] SGHC 146 (“<em>Persero HC (2014)</em>”)). He considered a provisional
                    award to be one which granted relief that was intended to be effective only for
                    a limited period (at [124]). He accepted that the Interim Award was a
                    provisional award in so far as it would cease to be effective “when
                    … the 2011 [T]ribunal has resolved with finality every aspect of the one
                    dispute before it” (at [143]). However, he held that there was nothing in
                    s 19B which either prohibited or permitted provisional awards.
                    Additionally, he was of the view that the legislative history of s 19B
                    clearly showed its limited purpose: it was added purely to clarify that all
                    arbitral awards, whether interim or final, were final and conclusive as to the
                    merits of the subject matter determined under the respective
                awards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Judge also held that the Interim Award did
                    not breach s 19B because it was final and binding. He reasoned that the
                    dispositive part of the Interim Award in effect declared that PGN had a
                    contractual obligation to “promptly pay” CRW the Adjudicated Sum
                    awarded under DAB No 3, and ordered PGN to make prompt payment of that sum.
                    Regardless of how the parties’ Underlying Dispute over the merits of DAB
                    No 3 was finally resolved in the future, the Judge stated, it would never
                    cease to be true that PGN had this contractual obligation and ought to have made
                    the requisite payment to CRW promptly. In that sense, the Interim Award was
                    final and binding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Furthermore, the Judge held, a future
                    determination of the merits of the parties’ Underlying Dispute would not
                    vary the Interim Award because the final award which set out that future
                    determination could be worded to stand alongside the Interim Award. If the 2011
                    Tribunal eventually found that the Adjudicated Sum awarded under DAB No 3
                    was correct, it would merely need to say so in its final award. If the 2011
                    Tribunal found that the Adjudicated Sum was too little, it would be open to the
                    tribunal to order PGN to pay CRW the additional amount in its final award.
                    Finally, if the 2011 Tribunal found that the Adjudicated Sum was too much, it
                    could require CRW to return the excess to PGN in its final award. In each of
                    these scenarios, the Judge considered, the final award resolving the
                    parties’ Underlying Dispute would not vary, amend, correct, review, add to
                    or revoke the Interim Award. Rather, the Interim Award and the final award would
                    stand together for enforcement. Hence, there would be no breach of
                    s 19B(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     On the basis of the foregoing, the Judge held
                    that none of PGN’s grounds of challenge (<em>ie</em>,
                    excess of jurisdiction, breach of natural justice and/or breach of the
                    parties’ agreed arbitral procedure) were sustainable. Consequently, both
                    SUM 3923 and OS 683 were dismissed. PGN filed separate Notices of
                    Appeal against each of those decisions (namely, CA 148 in respect of the
                    Judge’s dismissal of OS 683, and CA 149 in respect of his
                    dismissal of SUM 3923).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">PGN’s case on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     PGN’s case on appeal consists of two
                    arguments. The first is that the Interim Award is inconsistent with s 19B
                    because it is an award that only has interim finality. According to PGN, both
                    CRW and the 2011 Majority Arbitrators envisaged that the interim award sought by
                    CRW would be “subject to future variation”. It refers to a number
                    of documents to substantiate this submission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     First, it refers to that portion of the Terms
                    of Reference for the 2011 Arbitration where CRW’s claim and the relief
                    which it sought are summarised. It points out that what CRW sought was an
                    interim or partial award for the Adjudicated Sum awarded under DAB No 3
                        “<em>pending</em> the resolution of [the]
                    parties’ dispute” [emphasis added]. Second, it refers to
                    CRW’s Statement of Claim for the 2011 Arbitration and highlights that,
                    similarly, CRW expressly stated at para 30(a) thereof that it sought an
                    interim or partial award “<em>pending</em> the
                    resolution of [the] parties’ dispute” [emphasis added]. PGN argues
                    that the word “pending” in these two documents demonstrates that
                    CRW never intended the interim relief which it sought to finally dispose of the
                    parties’ Underlying Dispute over the merits of DAB No 3. Instead, it
                    always acknowledged the possibility that any interim award made by the 2011
                    Tribunal to give effect to DAB No 3 could be varied by a final award on the
                    merits of that DAB decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The third document which PGN submits supports
                    its first argument on appeal is the Interim Award. PGN points to [37] of that
                    award, where the 2011 Majority Arbitrators summarised CRW’s position in
                    the 2011 Arbitration as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">37. … The Tribunal further acknowledges that [CRW] had
                        at the Preliminary Hearing on 2 March 2012, confirmed its position
                        (which has been recorded in the scope of the Terms of Reference)
                        that:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    [CRW] would be relying on [DAB No 3] as
                                the basis for its application for an Interim Award;
                            and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   … in the event that it was
                                unsuccessful at the Interim Award stage, it would continue to rely
                                upon [DAB No 3] in seeking any Final Award, and would not seek
                                to open up and revise [DAB No 3].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>PGN argues that the fact that CRW was prepared to rely on DAB
                        No 3 even at the stage of seeking a final award on the merits of the
                        parties’ Underlying Dispute demonstrates that CRW essentially sought
                        only one relief in the 2011 Arbitration, <em>ie</em>,
                        the enforcement of DAB No 3. PGN reiterates that this shows that CRW
                        never intended the interim award which it sought to finally resolve the
                        parties’ Underlying Dispute. Instead, CRW was aware that any interim
                        award made could subsequently be varied by the 2011 Tribunal’s final
                        award on the merits of that dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In this regard, PGN also refers to
                    [51]–[52] of the Interim Award (reproduced at [17] above) and argues that
                    the 2011 Majority Arbitrators were themselves of the view that the Interim Award
                    would eventually be “altered” by the 2011 Tribunal’s final
                    award on the merits of the parties’ Underlying Dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The fourth document which PGN relies on in
                    respect of its first argument before this court is a unanimous partial award
                    dated 25 September 2014 (“the Partial Award”), which was made
                    in the 2011 Arbitration after SUM 3923 and OS 683 were heard by the
                    Judge. PGN seeks to have the Partial Award admitted into evidence by way of
                    Summons No 5277 of 2014 (“SUM 5277”). Our decision on
                    SUM 5277 is set out below at [37]–[40], together with our decision on
                    PGN’s other application for leave to adduce further evidence, Summons
                    No 5985 of 2014 (“SUM 5985”) (see [41]–[44]
                    below). For the time being, we simply set out the argument that PGN makes based
                    on the Partial Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In evaluating CRW’s claim against PGN in
                    respect of the 13 disputed VOPs, the DAB formulated nine heads of claim
                    (“Heads of Claim”). One of the questions which the 2011 Tribunal
                    addressed in the Partial Award was whether the DAB’s decision on each of
                    the nine Heads of Claim was in accordance with Indonesian law and the provisions
                    of the Contract (including the Conditions of Contract). The 2011 Tribunal
                    summarised its overall conclusion at [100.6]–[100.8] of the Partial Award.
                    Only [100.6(a)] and [100.6(c)] are relevant for present purposes, and they state
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a)    Heads of Claim Nos. 6 (Manufacture and
                            Installation of Additional Bends) and 8 (Additional Costs associated
                            with work at the Northern End of the Site in Areas of Reduced Width of
                            Way-leave) are dismissed;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">c)    
              <em>This Partial Award revises the
                                previous majority Interim Award insofar as Heads of Claim
                                Nos. 6 and 8 are dismissed.</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>PGN contends that the above extract from the Partial Award
                        clearly demonstrates that the Interim Award has in fact been varied by the
                        2011 Tribunal’s subsequent findings in the Partial Award, and this in
                        turn supports its argument that the Interim Award was only meant to have
                        interim finality, in breach of s 19B. Therefore, PGN submits, the
                        Interim Award should be set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     PGN’s second argument on appeal concerns
                    the effect of cl 20.4 of the Conditions of Contract. PGN argues that the
                    effect of cl 20.4 is that DAB No 3 ceases to be binding as soon as the
                    2011 Tribunal makes any award on the parties’ Underlying Dispute over the
                    merits of that DAB decision. Here, the 2011 Tribunal has made certain findings
                    on the merits of DAB No 3 as set out in the Partial Award. PGN argues that
                    DAB No 3 thus ceased to have any binding effect as from the date of
                    issuance of the Partial Award (<em>ie</em>,
                    25 September 2014). However, it does not go further to explain why the
                    Interim Award, which is founded upon DAB No 3, should therefore be set
                    aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     We note at this point that PGN bears the
                    burden of demonstrating that one or more of the grounds listed in s 24 of
                    the IAA and/or Art 34(2) of the Model Law for setting aside an arbitral
                    award are satisfied before the Interim Award can be set aside. PGN has not
                    explained which specific ground for setting aside would be satisfied if either
                    or both of its arguments on appeal are accepted. However, we understand the
                    essence of PGN’s case to be that if either or both of these arguments are
                    made out, it will have established that the Interim Award was subject to
                    revision and was hence not final; since such a non-final award would be contrary
                    to s 19B, which is part of the law governing the 2011 Arbitration, it would
                    follow that the 2011 Arbitration was not conducted in accordance with the
                    parties’ agreed arbitral procedure. If PGN can establish this, its
                    challenge to the Interim Award would fall within Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv) of the Model Law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">CRW’s case on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     CRW’s response to PGN’s first
                    argument on appeal hinges on the distinct and separate nature of two questions
                    which CRW says were put to the 2011 Tribunal in the 2011 Arbitration. The first
                    question is whether CRW is entitled to the Adjudicated Sum awarded under DAB
                    No 3 as a final determination of what is ultimately due to it. This, CRW
                    accepts, will entail evaluating DAB No 3 on the merits, and can only be
                    determined after an arbitration that examines and inquires into those merits.
                    The second question is whether CRW is entitled to an immediate award for the
                    Adjudicated Sum on the basis that CRW is entitled to this sum as a matter of the
                    proper interpretation of the Conditions of Contract, even though the 2011
                    Tribunal’s final determination of the first question may eventually lead
                    to a different result. CRW maintains that the 2011 Majority Arbitrators finally
                    disposed of the second question in the Interim Award. The Interim Award, CRW
                    submits, will not be varied by a future final award on the first question
                    because the latter award will deal with only that specific question. CRW also
                    argues that s 19B only precludes the variation by a later award of an
                    interim award previously made, and not the making of an interim award such as
                    the Interim Award in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     As regards PGN’s second argument on
                    appeal, CRW contends that PGN’s interpretation of cl 20.4 of the
                    Conditions of Contract is not commercially sensible. It argues that the
                    commercially sensible way of reading cl 20.4 is that DAB No 3 only
                    ceases to be binding upon the final determination of the parties’
                    Underlying Dispute over the merits of that DAB decision, and even if there is
                    any partial determination of the merits of DAB No 3 in the meantime, this
                    would not affect the Interim Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">PGN’s applications for leave to adduce further evidence –
                SUM 5277 and SUM 5985</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     As mentioned earlier, by way of SUM 5277
                    and SUM 5985, PGN seeks to adduce further evidence for the purposes of the
                    present appeals. The further evidence which is the subject matter of
                    SUM 5277 is the second affidavit of Mr Muhammad Husseyn Umar
                    (“Mr Umar”), while the further evidence which is the subject
                    matter of SUM 5985 is the fourth affidavit of Mr Umar.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">SUM 5277 – Mr Umar’s second affidavit</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Mr Umar’s second affidavit pertains
                    to new developments in the 2011 Arbitration that occurred after the hearing
                    before the Judge. The exhibits in that affidavit include the parties’
                    submissions to the 2011 Tribunal on the matters considered in the Partial Award
                    and the Partial Award itself. Apart from what we have already mentioned in
                    relation to the Partial Award (see [30]–[31] above), PGN also points out
                    that the 2011 Tribunal considered the possibility of collusion between the DAB
                    and CRW. During the hearing before the 2011 Tribunal, CRW’s
                    representative, Mr Boy Eka Setiabudhi (“Mr Setiabudhi”),
                    admitted that the DAB had prepared his witness statement. The 2011 Tribunal
                    ruled in the Partial Award that PGN had failed to cross the high threshold
                    necessary to make out either bad faith on the DAB’s part in arriving at
                    its decision in DAB No 3 or collusion between the DAB and CRW. However, it
                    also stated (at [76] of the Partial Award) that it “may not have been
                    advisable [for the DAB] to … draft witness statements on behalf of any
                    party”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     PGN argues that it should be given leave to
                    adduce Mr Umar’s second affidavit in evidence because that affidavit
                    supports its case on appeal. According to PGN, the Partial Award demonstrates
                    that the Interim Award was only meant to have interim finality. Furthermore,
                    although the 2011 Tribunal did not consider bad faith and/or collusion on the
                    part of the DAB to have been made out, it made the observation at [37] above on
                    the propriety of the DAB’s preparation of Mr Setiabudhi’s
                    witness statement. PGN maintains that Mr Setiabudhi’s admission that
                    the DAB had prepared his witness statement and the 2011 Tribunal’s
                    aforesaid observation highlight that “there is a real risk that the DAB
                    was acting unfairly and/or may have colluded with [CRW]”. In view of
                    this, PGN submits, the Interim Award should be set aside; otherwise, the
                    above-mentioned discrepancies will simply be whitewashed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     CRW does not appear to contest the admission
                    of the evidence set out in Mr Umar’s second affidavit. In fact, it
                    relies on the same to demonstrate that the 2011 Tribunal is currently still in
                    the process of reviewing the merits of the parties’ Underlying Dispute.
                    Additionally, CRW deals with the merits of PGN’s arguments predicated on
                    the new evidence. It argues that the Partial Award does not change the final and
                    binding nature of the Interim Award because the Interim Award only deals with
                    the distinct issue of whether CRW is entitled, pursuant to cl 20.4 of the
                    Conditions of Contract, to prompt payment of the Adjudicated Sum awarded under
                    DAB No 3, notwithstanding the fact that the 2011 Tribunal’s final
                    determination of the merits of the Underlying Dispute is still pending. The 2011
                    Tribunal’s subsequent ruling in the Partial Award that CRW is not entitled
                    to the quantum claimed under certain Heads of Claim, CRW submits, is only
                    relevant in so far as the separate issue of its final entitlement to the
                    Adjudicated Sum or any other sum determined by the 2011 Tribunal is
                    concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In our judgment, it is relevant for us to
                    consider the effect which the Partial Award has on the finality of the Interim
                    Award. Additionally, we note CRW’s willingness to address the merits of
                    PGN’s arguments predicated on the Partial Award. In the circumstances, we
                    allow SUM 5277 and admit Mr Umar’s second
                affidavit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">SUM 5985 – Mr Umar’s fourth affidavit</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Mr Umar’s fourth affidavit pertains
                    to further developments in the 2011 Arbitration after the Partial Award was
                    issued. CRW was directed by the 2011 Tribunal to set out its justification for
                    the quantum which it claimed under each of the Heads of Claim that the tribunal
                    had ordered (via the Partial Award) to be opened up, reviewed and revised. CRW
                    took the position that its basis of calculating the quantum which it was
                    entitled to under the 13 disputed VOPs was different from that adopted by the
                    DAB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     PGN argues that the evidence pertaining to
                    these new developments is relevant because CRW’s attempt to introduce a
                    new basis of calculation raises the question of whether the Interim Award, which
                    is based on DAB No 3, was properly rendered. PGN suggests that it was not
                    properly rendered since it appears that CRW itself intends to challenge the
                    entire basis of DAB No 3.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     CRW, on the other hand, argues that the
                    evidence in Mr Umar’s fourth affidavit is irrelevant for the purposes
                    of the present appeals as it relates to the 2011 Tribunal’s consideration
                    of the parties’ Underlying Dispute over the merits of DAB No 3. That,
                    CRW submits, is a distinct matter which has no bearing on whether DAB No 3
                    should be enforced by way of the Interim Award pending the 2011 Tribunal’s
                    determination of the parties’ Underlying Dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     We agree with CRW that Mr Umar’s
                    fourth affidavit relates to the merits of the parties’ Underlying Dispute
                    and not the Interim Award, and therefore has no relevance to the present
                    appeals. Accordingly, we dismiss SUM 5985.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Final, interim, partial and provisional awards</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     We digress briefly at this point to resolve
                    some points of terminology before proceeding to analyse PGN’s two
                    arguments on appeal. The terms “partial” award and
                    “interim” award are often used interchangeably to refer to the
                    same category of arbitral awards (see Gary B Born, <em>International Commercial Arbitration Vol III</em> (Wolters
                    Kluwer, 2nd Ed, 2014) (“Born”) at p 3020; and Nigel
                    Blackaby <em>et al</em>, <em>Redfern and
                        Hunter on International Arbitration</em> (Oxford University Press,
                    5th Ed, 2009) at paras 9.19–9.25). In broad terms, this category
                    of arbitral awards refers to awards made in the course of the arbitral
                    proceedings that dispose of certain preliminary issues or certain claims for
                    relief prior to the disposition of all the issues in the
                arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Born defines a “partial” award
                    (at p 3015) as one which:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… finally disposes of part, but not all, of the parties’
                        claim in an arbitration, leaving some claims for further consideration and
                        resolution in future proceedings in the arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In contradistinction, an
                    “interim” award (see Born at p 3020) is one which:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… does not dispose finally of a particular claim (<em>e.g.</em>, one of several claims for damages arising from
                        several alleged breaches of contract), but instead decides a preliminary
                        issue relevant to [the] disposing of such claims (<em>e.g.</em>, choice of law, liability, construction of a particular
                        provision). In this sense, an award is “interim” because it is
                        a step towards disposing of a portion of the parties’ claim (like a
                        partial award), but does not purport to make a final decision either
                        granting or rejecting those claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Both partial awards and interim awards are
                    capable of being recognised and enforced by domestic courts. They are also
                    susceptible to being set aside (see Born at pp 3018 and
                3021).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     “Provisional” awards, on the
                    other hand, are awards that are issued to protect a party from damage during the
                    course of the arbitral process. Gary B Born, <em>International Commercial Arbitration Vol II</em> (Wolters
                    Kluwer, 2nd Ed, 2014) defines a “provisional” award (at
                    p 2427) as one that is:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… intended to preserve a factual or legal situation so as to
                        safeguard rights the recognition of which is sought from the tribunal having
                        jurisdiction as to the substance of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     It is evident that provisional awards do not
                    definitively or finally dispose of either a preliminary issue or a claim in an
                    arbitration. Examples of provisional awards include those: (a) maintaining
                    the <em>status quo</em>; (b) preserving assets;
                    (c) preserving evidence or providing for inspection of property;
                    (d) preventing aggravation of the parties’ dispute; (e) ordering
                    the provision of security for underlying claims; (f) ordering the provision
                    of security for costs; and (g) ordering compliance with a confidentiality
                    obligation (see Gary B Born, <em>International Arbitration:
                        Law and Practice</em> (Wolters Kluwer, 2012) at p 210). An order
                    for the interim payment of damages prior to the final assessment of damages
                    taking place, as is contemplated (in an admittedly different but nonetheless
                    useful context for illustrative purposes) in O 29 r 9 of the Rules of
                    Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed), as well as the award dealt
                    with in <em>Diag Human SE v Czech Republic</em> [2013] All
                    ER (D) 309 (although the tribunal in that case appears, in our judgment, to
                    have mistakenly characterised the award as a partial rather than a provisional
                    award) would also fall in this category. Such orders are inherently capable of
                    being varied in due course. They do not give rise to a finding on or a
                    determination of the substantive rights of the parties and, therefore, are
                        <em>provisional</em> in nature. Section 12 of the
                    IAA expressly permits an arbitral tribunal to make several such orders or
                    directions in the course of an arbitration. However, s 2 of the IAA
                    provides that such orders or directions are not to be regarded as
                    “award[s]” for the purposes of the IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The term “final” award can be
                    understood in a number of ways. First, it can refer to an award which resolves a
                    claim or matter in an arbitration with preclusive effect (<em>ie</em>, the same claim or matter cannot be re-litigated). Even
                    provisional awards are “final” in this sense. As Born states (at
                    pp 3013–3014):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Even awards granting provisional relief can be considered to be
                        “final”, notwithstanding the fact that they will be superseded
                        by subsequent relief, because they finally dispose of a particular request
                        for relief. … [E]very award rendered during the course of an
                        arbitration, before its final conclusion, is “final” because
                        of the preclusive effect that it enjoys.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Second, it can refer to awards that have
                    achieved a sufficient degree of finality in the arbitral seat. Born states that
                    this would most obviously be so in cases where the award is granted
                    “confirmation or <em>exequatur</em>”, or is
                    no longer susceptible to being appealed against or being subject to annulment
                    proceedings in the arbitral seat (at p 3014).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Third, it can refer to the last award made in
                    an arbitration which disposes of all remaining claims. This is a
                    “final” award in the sense used in Art 32(1) of the Model
                    Law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">PGN’s first argument on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Against the background set out at
                    [45]–[53] above, we turn to the substantive issues before this court. In
                    sum, we reject PGN’s first argument on appeal because it fails to
                    appreciate that cl 20.4 of the 1999 Red Book (which is identical to
                    cl 20.4 of the Conditions of Contract) imposes a distinct contractual
                    obligation on the parties to comply promptly with a DAB decision once it is
                    issued. This is so whether or not the DAB decision is subsequently revised or
                    opened up, and whether or not the arbitral tribunal eventually concludes that a
                    different amount from that determined by the DAB is in fact due to the receiving
                    party (<em>ie</em>, the party that is to receive payment
                    under the DAB decision). In brief terms, the scheme under a contract which
                    incorporates the dispute resolution mechanism set out in cl 20 of the 1999
                    Red Book is that any differences as to matters arising under the contract may be
                    resolved in the first instance by the DAB. The DAB’s decision (if it is
                    sought) must be complied with and acted upon at once. However, a party that is
                    dissatisfied with the DAB’s decision may challenge it. Without derogating
                    from the obligation of the parties to immediately implement and give effect to
                    the DAB’s decision, an arbitral tribunal may, usually at a significantly
                    later point in time (and only if the parties fail to amicably settle their
                    differences over the DAB’s decision), open up and revise the DAB’s
                    decision. In doing so, the tribunal would be considering a conceptually distinct
                    question, namely, the state of the final accounts between the parties. We do not
                    agree that the 2011 Majority Arbitrators intended the Interim Award which they
                    made to be subsequently varied by future awards that would be issued in the
                    course of the 2011 Arbitration. Even if they did, s 19B operates to render
                    the Interim Award final and binding as regards the particular issue which that
                    award decided, namely, PGN’s obligation under cl 20.4 of the
                    Conditions of Contract to make prompt payment of the Adjudicated Sum awarded
                    under DAB No 3 to CRW. Nothing that the 2011 Tribunal says or does can
                    change that. We elaborate below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Interpretation of cll 20.4 and 20.6 of the Conditions of
                Contract </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     We begin with the interpretation of
                    cl 20.4 of the Conditions of Contract in so far as the effect of a DAB
                    decision is concerned. In our judgment, that clause imposes one distinct
                    contractual obligation on the parties and confers a conditional right on a party
                    who wishes to challenge a DAB decision. First, as to the obligation, we are
                    satisfied that cl 20.4 (specifically, cl 20.4[4]) imposes an
                    affirmative obligation on the parties to “promptly give effect to [a DAB
                    decision]”. In particular, the paying party (<em>ie</em>, the party that is required to make any payment under the
                    DAB’s decision) has a contractual obligation to pay <em>promptly</em>, notwithstanding its views on the merits of the
                    DAB’s decision. This point is neatly encapsulated by Prof Nael
                    G Bunni (“Prof Bunni”) in his article entitled
                    “The Gap in Sub-clause 20.7 of the 1999 FIDIC Contracts for Major
                    Works” [2005] ICLR 272 as follows (at p 276):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The [DAB’s] decision must be complied with by both parties,
                        which is a characteristic feature of the FIDIC DAB procedure … The
                        decision becomes, in effect, a contractual obligation on both parties such
                        that non-compliance with it by either of them is a breach of contract and
                        the party in breach would be liable in damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     This follows from the plain words of
                    cl 20.4[4] of the Conditions of Contract:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The [DAB’s] decision shall be binding on both Parties,
                            <em>who shall </em><b><em>promptly
                            </em></b><em>give effect to it unless and until it
                            shall be revised</em> in an amicable settlement or an arbitral
                        award as described below. … [emphasis added in italics and bold
                        italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In our judgment, the following propositions
                    cannot persuasively be disputed and bear emphasis:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_57-p2_a"></a>(a)     A DAB decision is immediately
                        binding once it is made. This may be distinguished from a DAB decision in
                        respect of which no NOD has been issued within the stipulated 28-day time
                        frame. Such a DAB decision, under cl 20.4[7], becomes “<em>final</em> and binding” [emphasis
                    added].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_57-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        corollary of a DAB decision being immediately binding once it is made is
                        that the parties are obliged to promptly give effect to it until such time
                        as it is overtaken or revised by either an amicable settlement or a
                        subsequent arbitral award.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_57-p2_c"></a>(c)     The fact that a DAB decision is immediately binding once
                        it is made until and unless it is revised by either an amicable settlement
                        or an arbitral award is significant. As will be evident shortly from our
                        discussion of the second of the two points mentioned at [55] above in
                        relation to cl 20.4, the process of amicable settlement under
                        cl 20.5 or arbitration under cl 20.6 may <em>only</em> be initiated by a party with a view to having the DAB
                        decision reviewed and revised if that party has issued an NOD. Hence, the
                        issuance of an NOD self-evidently does not and cannot displace the binding
                        nature of a DAB decision or the parties’ concomitant obligation to
                        promptly give effect to and implement it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Our second point in relation to cl 20.4
                    concerns the dissatisfied party’s conditional right to challenge a DAB
                    decision. A dissatisfied party (usually the paying party) who wishes to
                    challenge a DAB decision <em>must</em> issue an NOD, and
                    thereafter first attempt to amicably settle its disagreement with the DAB
                    decision with the other party. It is only if no amicable settlement is reached
                    or if no attempt at amicable settlement is made that the dissatisfied party has,
                    after 56 days from the date of issuance of the NOD, the right to refer the
                    merits of the DAB decision to arbitration. This follows from:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_a"></a>(a)     cl 20.4[5], which provides that
                        either party, if dissatisfied with a DAB decision, may, <em>within 28 days</em> after receiving the decision, give notice of
                        its dissatisfaction by issuing an NOD;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_b"></a>(b)     cl 20.4[6], which provides that except as permitted
                        under cl 20.7 or cl 20.8, no party may commence arbitration unless
                        an NOD has been issued;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_c"></a>(c)     cl 20.4[7], which provides that if an NOD is not
                        issued within 28 days after receipt of the DAB decision, the decision shall
                        become <em>final</em> and binding;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_d"></a>(d)     cl 20.5, which states that if an
                        NOD has been issued, the parties are to attempt to settle their dispute
                        amicably before commencing arbitration; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_58-p2_e"></a>(e)     cl 20.6, which states that “any
                        dispute in respect of which the DAB’s decision … has not become
                        final and binding” shall, unless settled amicably pursuant to
                        cl 20.5, be “finally settled by international
                        arbitration”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     It follows that the issuance of an NOD is a
                    condition precedent to a dissatisfied party’s ability to seek a review of
                    a DAB decision on the merits through either negotiations aimed at amicable
                    settlement or arbitration. But, as noted above, the issuance of an NOD does not
                    in any way displace the binding (albeit non-final) effect of the DAB decision in
                    question or the parties’ obligation to <em>promptly</em> give effect to and implement it. If an NOD has been
                    issued and if no amicable settlement of the parties’ dispute is reached
                    (or no attempt at amicable settlement is made) within 56 days from the date of
                    issuance of the NOD, then – and only then – the DAB decision in
                    question may be opened up, reviewed and revised at an arbitration which is
                    directed towards the merits of that decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     With regard to the first point that we have
                    referred to at [55] above (namely, the parties’ obligation to comply
                    promptly with a DAB decision), where compliance entails payment of a sum of
                    money determined by the DAB, the question arises as to whether this obligation,
                    if it is not complied with, is capable of being enforced by way of a separate
                    arbitration or, for that matter, by way of a separate interim award within the
                    same arbitration that is also concerned with the underlying merits of that DAB
                    decision. We recognise that there are different views on this. However, in our
                    judgment, this obligation is capable of being enforced by arbitration in the
                    manner just described for the reasons set out below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     To begin with, we return to the dispute
                    resolution framework set out in cl 20 of the Conditions of Contract,
                    especially cl 20.6 (which has been reproduced at [5] above), the effect of
                    all of which has been summarised at [6] above. To recapitulate, this framework
                    contemplates that “a dispute (of any kind whatsoever) … in
                    connection with, or arising out of, the Contract or the execution of the [w]orks
                    [thereunder]” may be referred to a DAB for its decision. If such a
                    dispute is indeed referred to a DAB and if the DAB’s decision has not
                    become final and binding because of the issuance of an NOD within the permitted
                    time frame, the dispute shall be resolved: (a) first, by amicable settlement, if
                    possible; and (b) failing amicable settlement, by
                arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The first question which arises is whether the
                    disputes that may be referred to arbitration exclude certain categories of
                    disputes which must be resolved in some other way. In our judgment, the broad
                    terms used in cl 20.4[1] and cl 20.6[1], which refer respectively to
                    “a dispute (of any kind whatsoever)” and “any dispute in
                    respect of which the DAB’s decision … has not become final and
                    binding”, militate against this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The specific dispute in the present appeals is
                    a narrow one – it is whether a DAB decision ordering the payment of a sum
                    of money gives rise to an immediate obligation on the part of a paying party
                        <em>who has issued an NOD in respect of that
                        decision</em> to promptly make the payment ordered by the DAB. Such a
                    dispute could conceivably be referred back, in the first instance, to the DAB
                    since it undoubtedly is one that “arises between the [p]arties in
                    connection with, or arising out of, the [c]ontract” as provided in
                    cl 20.4[1]. If such a dispute is so referred and if the DAB resolves it
                    affirmatively, there can really be no objection to that later DAB decision
                        (<em>ie</em>, the DAB decision that a binding but
                    non-final DAB decision ordering the payment of a specified sum does give rise to
                    an immediate obligation on the paying party’s part to promptly pay that
                    sum) being subsequently referred to arbitration (under cl 20.6 if an NOD is
                    issued and no amicable settlement under cl 20.5 is reached, or under
                    cl 20.6 read with cl 20.7 if no NOD is issued), or to the issuance of
                    an arbitral award which affirms the later DAB decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The real question then is whether it is
                        <em>essential</em> to first go through the process of
                    referring a dispute over the “binding” effect of a binding but
                        <em>non-final</em> DAB decision –
                    <em>ie</em>, a DAB decision in respect of which an NOD has
                    been issued – back to the DAB under cl 20.4 and then through a
                    further process of amicable settlement under cl 20.5 before referring it to
                    arbitration under cl 20.6.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Mr Christopher R Seppälä
                    (“Mr Seppälä”), who assisted FIDIC in drafting the
                    predecessor of cl 20.7 of the 1999 Red Book (<em>ie</em>, cl 67.4 of the 1987 edition of the Red Book
                    (“the 1987 Red Book”)) – the sub-clause which has given rise
                    to much of the confusion – has argued that this is unnecessary. In his
                    article entitled “Sub-Clause 20.7 of the FIDIC Red Book does not
                    justify denying enforcement of a ‘binding’ DAB decision”
                    (2011) 6(3) CLInt 17, he opines that a failure to comply with a binding but
                    non-final DAB decision can be referred directly to arbitration. In such a case,
                    there is no need for the receiving party in whose favour the DAB has ruled to
                    refer its dispute with the paying party over the latter’s non-compliance
                    with the binding but non-final DAB decision to the DAB for a further decision by
                    the DAB prior to commencing arbitration. Mr Seppälä observes that in most
                    cases, the party that issued the NOD (usually the paying party) would have
                    referred the merits of the DAB decision to arbitration, and its failure to
                    promptly comply with the DAB decision can then be dealt with as an issue within
                    that arbitration (at p 19). Mr Seppälä appears to take the view that
                    the NOD which is issued by the paying party in respect of the substantive merits
                    of the DAB decision is sufficient to permit the receiving party to refer its
                    dispute with the paying party over the latter’s non-compliance with that
                    DAB decision to arbitration. This is evident from the following excerpt from his
                    article (at p 20):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]ribunals and courts are, therefore, with respect, going too
                        far to suggest that, because Sub-Clause 20.7 does not refer to binding
                        decisions of a DAB, a failure to comply with a binding decision may not be
                        referred to arbitration. <em>It was unnecessary to deal with
                            binding decisions</em>, as it was clear – or so it was
                        thought – that, <em>as these had been the subject of a
                            notice of dissatisfaction, these could, by definition, be referred to
                            arbitration under Sub-Clause 20.6</em> … [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In our judgment, the position that
                    Mr Seppälä has argued for is self-evidently sensible for several
                    reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, in cases where an NOD has
                        been issued such that the DAB decision concerned remains binding but
                        non-final, it is important to be precise as to what the real difference
                        between the parties is. This can be explained by reference to the facts in
                        the present appeals. When the dispute emerged between PGN and CRW over the
                        matters that would later become the subject matter of DAB No 3, it was
                        referred to the DAB. The explicit decision in DAB No 3 was that the
                        Adjudicated Sum was payable by PGN to CRW. But, in our judgment, there was
                        also an inherent premise embedded within that decision, which is that the
                        Adjudicated Sum was payable <em>forthwith</em>. If, for
                        any reason, the DAB had intended that its decision ordering payment of the
                        Adjudicated Sum should only take effect later, it would have had to make
                        this explicit; otherwise, it seems indisputable to us that DAB No 3
                        also required the Adjudicated Sum to be paid forthwith by PGN to CRW. When
                        PGN then issued its NOD, it undoubtedly meant to convey its dissatisfaction
                        both with the explicit premise of DAB No 3 (namely, the valuation by
                        the DAB of CRW’s claims) as well as with its inherent premise (namely,
                        that the Adjudicated Sum was payable forthwith). If and to the extent this
                        was not made clear on the face of PGN’s NOD itself, it was undoubtedly
                        made clear in the positions that PGN took in the 2009 Arbitration as well as
                        in the 2011 Arbitration. In our judgment, this understanding of the true
                        nature of the difference between the parties – namely, as comprising
                        two facets, one explicit and the other, inherent – is reflected in
                        Mr Seppälä’s statement in the extract reproduced at [65] above
                        that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">… It was unnecessary to deal with binding decisions, as it was
                            clear – or so <em>it was thought – that, as
                                these had been the subject of a notice of dissatisfaction, these
                                could</em>, <b><em>by
                                definition</em></b><em>, be referred to
                                arbitration</em> under Sub-Clause 20.6. …
                            [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>The point, in essence, is that the dissatisfaction
                            expressed in an NOD already inherently extends to the requirement that
                            payment of the adjudicated amount be made forthwith, and there is
                            nothing further to be referred back to the DAB. This also follows as a
                            matter of logic: after all, what purpose can it serve to ask a DAB
                            whether a decision which it has already issued requiring one party to
                            make payment to the other should be promptly complied with? Why else
                            would the DAB have issued its decision in the first place? In this
                            regard, it bears reiteration that cl 20.4[4] of the Conditions of
                            Contract explicitly states that the parties “shall <em>promptly</em> give effect” [emphasis added] to
                            a binding but non-final DAB decision. The contrary argument –
                            namely, that a DAB decision need not be complied with once an NOD has
                            been issued in respect of it – seems to us to assume a surreal
                            quality. The purpose of a DAB is to render <em>interim</em> decisions that bind the parties until an
                            amicable settlement of their dispute is reached or an arbitral award
                            that resolves the underlying merits of their dispute is made; and the
                            simple point is that given the scheme of the Conditions of Contract as
                            we have analysed it at [55]–[57] above, any requirement to refer a
                            question as to the immediate binding effect of a binding but non-final
                            DAB decision back to the DAB seems to us not only wholly superfluous,
                            but also contrary to the express words of
                    cl 20.4[4].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, the receiving party would encounter a number of practical
                        difficulties if it is required to go through the steps set out in
                        cll 20.4 and 20.5 before it can refer the paying party’s
                        non-compliance with a binding but non-final DAB decision to arbitration. As
                        noted by the Judge at [45] of <em>Persero HC
                            (2014)</em>, there would be an inordinate delay. The receiving
                        party would have to wait up to 84 days (or such other period proposed by the
                        DAB and agreed to by the parties) for the DAB to render its decision on the
                        separate dispute as to whether the earlier binding but non-final DAB
                        decision is to be complied with promptly, plus another 28 days from the date
                        of receipt of the later DAB decision (answering the question of whether the
                        paying party has an obligation to promptly comply with the earlier binding
                        but non-final DAB decision) to see whether that decision becomes
                        “final and binding” by virtue of no NOD being issued within
                        the stipulated 28-day period. If either party issues an NOD within the
                        permitted time frame, a further 56 days would have to pass to enable the
                        parties to attempt to amicably settle their dispute over the paying
                        party’s non-compliance with the earlier (binding but non-final) DAB
                        decision. Given the purpose and context of the DAB scheme, it would not be
                        commercially sensible to interpret cl 20 as requiring the receiving
                        party to satisfy the conditions precedent in cll 20.4 and 20.5 before
                        it can refer a dispute over the paying party’s non-compliance with a
                        binding but non-final DAB decision to arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     This view is endorsed by FIDIC itself. FIDIC
                    issued a Guidance Memorandum for users of the 1999 Red Book on 1 April 2013
                    (“the FIDIC Guidance Memorandum”), where it set out its view on
                    how it intended cl 20 to be interpreted. It stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This Guidance Memorandum is designed to <em>make explicit
                            the intentions of FIDIC</em> in relation to the enforcement of the
                            <em>DAB decisions that are binding and not yet
                            final</em>, which is that <em>in the case of
                            failure to comply with these decisions, the failure itself should be
                            capable of being referred to arbitration under Sub-Clause 20.6
                            [Arbitration]</em>, <b><em>without
                            </em></b><em>Sub-Clause 20.4 [Obtaining Dispute
                            Adjudication Board’s Decision] and Sub-Clause 20.5 [Amicable
                            Settlement] being applicable to the reference.</em> [emphasis in
                        original omitted; emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In our judgment, it is significant that the
                    FIDIC Guidance Memorandum is directed at “mak[ing] explicit” the
                        <em>identical</em> point which we have canvassed above
                    at [64]–[66], namely, that it is unnecessary to go through the process set
                    out in cll 20.4 and 20.5 before referring a failure to comply with a
                    binding but non-final DAB decision to arbitration under cl 20.6. We do not
                    consider that this approach would extend the scope of the arbitration agreement
                    set out in cl 20.6 at all because it is already possible to refer a failure
                    to honour a binding but non-final DAB decision to arbitration for the reasons we
                    have set out at [61]–[63] and [66(a)] above. Rather, the real issue is
                    over the necessity to go through the preliminary steps set out in cll 20.4
                    and 20.5 before commencing arbitration. In this regard, FIDIC opted (in our
                    judgment, wisely and sensibly) to “make explicit the intentions of
                    FIDIC” that are already implicit in the cl 20 dispute resolution
                    framework for the reasons we have articulated. Moreover, the FIDIC Guidance
                    Memorandum itself, in the section entitled “Background”, makes it
                    clear that it is intended to clarify a point that many arbitral tribunals have
                    found to be “unclear”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A substantial number of arbitral tribunals have found Clause 20 to be
                            <em>unclear</em> on the issue of whether a [P]arty
                        may refer the failure of the other Party to comply with a DAB decision that
                        is ‘binding’ but not ‘final’ to arbitration as is
                        explicitly the case of a ‘final and binding’ decision under
                        Sub-Clause 20.7. … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     This is hardly the language of extension. It
                    is true that in its guidance memorandum, FIDIC suggested that cl 20.7
                    (among other provisions of the 1999 Red Book) be amended, but this does not
                    alter the fact that FIDIC’s proposed amendment to cl 20.7 is aimed at
                        <em>clarifying</em>, rather than changing, its existing
                    position and intention in relation to the dispute resolution framework under
                    cl 20. The inquiry cannot end at FIDIC’s proposed amendment to
                    cl 20.7. The real question is whether FIDIC intended (via its guidance
                    memorandum) to recommend changes to the substantive position under cl 20.
                    The FIDIC Guidance Memorandum in fact makes it clear that the issuance of the
                    memorandum was driven by <em>the lack of a consistent
                        understanding of FIDIC’s intention</em> (including on the part
                    of our courts, culminating in the decision in <em>Persero
                        CA</em>). In our judgment, this is inconsistent with any intention to
                    change the substantive position under cl 20. Further, we do not in any case
                    think that the absence of the suggested amendment from cl 20.7 of the
                    Conditions of Contract in the present case renders it inappropriate to find, as
                    we do (in line with Mr Seppälä’s contention), that the dispute over
                    PGN’s non-compliance with the DAB’s binding but non-final decision
                    in DAB No 3 was within the scope of the arbitration agreement in the Conditions
                    of Contract. There is certainly nothing in the FIDIC Guidance Memorandum to
                    suggest that FIDIC itself doubted whether, absent this suggested amendment, it
                    would be possible to refer a failure to honour a binding but non-final DAB
                    decision to arbitration directly without the parties having to first go through
                    the preliminary steps set out in cll 20.4 and 20.5.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     PGN argues that the Conditions of Contract
                    should not be interpreted with reference to the FIDIC Guidance Memorandum
                    because that was issued after the parties entered into the Contract (which
                    includes, among other documents, the Conditions of Contract). We find no force
                    in this argument. First, it is clear from the careful language which FIDIC
                    adopted in that memorandum that it was merely making “explicit”
                    what was all along implicit in cl 20 itself. As we have already said, we
                    consider, for the reasons we have already set out above, that, indeed, it is
                    implicit in cl 20 that a failure to comply with a binding but non-final DAB
                    decision is capable of being directly referred to arbitration without the need
                    for the parties to first go through the process prescribed by cll 20.4 and
                    20.5.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     One point that seems to have attracted almost
                    universal acceptance in this case, save of course on the part of PGN, is that
                    cl 20.4 (specifically, cl 20.4[4]) evinces a clear intention for
                    parties to <em>promptly</em> comply with a DAB decision,
                    irrespective of any disagreement or dissatisfaction with it. This serves the
                    vital objective of safeguarding cash flow in the building and construction
                    industry, especially that of the contractor, who is usually the receiving party.
                    The intention underlying cl 20.4 would be completely undermined if the
                    receiving party were restricted to treating the paying party’s
                    non-compliance as a breach of contract that sounds only in damages and must be
                    pursued before the available domestic courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Such a view is incompatible with the express
                    language of cl 20.4 as well as with the analysis we have set out at
                    [55]–[69] above. In addition, we consider that there are a number of other
                    grave difficulties with such a view, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_a"></a>(a)     If the receiving party is confined
                        to seeking damages for being denied sums that are eventually found to be due
                        to it, it would seem that the receiving party has no more than a right to
                        pre-award interest or, perhaps, a claim for financing charges. This would be
                        an unduly – and, in our judgment, an unsustainably –
                        parsimonious construction of cl 20.4 since courts and tribunals will
                        often already have the power to grant pre-award interest or allow claims for
                        financing charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_b"></a>(b)     Secondly, if the contention is that an order may be made to enforce
                        the obligation to promptly give effect to a binding but non-final DAB
                        decision, but only by the local courts and not by an arbitral tribunal
                        established pursuant to the parties’ contract, that would be a very
                        narrow contention and one that seems implausible. This is because it would
                        suggest that the intention underlying the dispute resolution framework
                        contained in the 1999 Red Book is to carve out from the jurisdiction of the
                        arbitral tribunal all matters relating to the immediate enforcement of
                        binding but non-final DAB decisions and to vest <em>only that
                            specific jurisdiction</em> in the courts, while preserving for the
                        arbitral tribunal the jurisdiction to rule on the merits of such DAB
                        decisions. To our knowledge, it has never been suggested that this was
                        FIDIC’s intention when the predecessor of cl 20 was drafted.
                        Moreover, such a construction fails to explain why a dispute over whether or
                        not a binding but non-final DAB decision is to be immediately complied with
                        cannot be directly referred to arbitration as set out at [61]–[66]
                        above. To say that this is so because such a dispute is not a
                        “dispute” as that term is used in cl 20.4, with respect,
                        flies in the face of what constitutes a “dispute” for the
                        purposes of an arbitration agreement (see <em>Tjong Very
                            Sumito and others v Antig Investments Pte Ltd</em> [2009]
                        4 SLR(R) 732 at [33]–[34]) as well as what PGN has in fact
                        contended at various stages of this protracted dispute between the
                        parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_c"></a>(c)     Further, it is not clear whether a claim by the receiving party for
                        pre-award interest or financing charges, on the alternative hypothesis set
                        out at [72(a)] above, would be capable of being brought before the
                        arbitration of the merits of the parties’ underlying dispute has been
                        completed. After all, can it be said that a claim for damages in the form of
                        financing charges or a claim for pre-award interest would accrue before it
                        has been finally determined what is actually due to the receiving party? If
                        not, this would pose a considerable obstacle because such a determination
                        would only take place at the end of the arbitration of the underlying
                        dispute. By then, if the arbitral tribunal rules in favour of the receiving
                        party, he would have an award he can enforce and there would be no need to
                        enforce the DAB decision, which would have been superseded by the award;
                        nor, generally, would there be any need for the receiving party to go to the
                        courts at all in such circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_d"></a>(d)     All of this also wholly undermines any expectation which
                        the receiving party may have of obtaining prompt payment of the sum awarded
                        to it under a DAB decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Additionally, in some circumstances, it may be
                    vital that parties promptly comply with a DAB decision. By way of example,
                    Prof Bunni has suggested that in some cases, prompt compliance may be
                    necessary simply to enable a party to continue to participate in the arbitration
                    of the merits of the DAB decision concerned. He puts it in this way at
                    p 278 of the article referred to above at [55]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… If, for example, the [DAB’s decision] involves a large sum
                        of money to be paid to the contractor who is experiencing financial
                        difficulties, then the employer’s failure to make such payment
                        promptly might mean the difference between the contractor on the one hand
                        being able to afford to continue in the arbitration; and on the other hand
                        being under such economic pressure that he is forced to concede to the
                        employer. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Indeed, this is true even aside from such dire
                    circumstances. Given the nature of the building and construction industry, it is
                    of general importance that contractors are paid promptly where the contract so
                    provides. As explained by the Judge at [23] of <em>Persero HC
                        (2014)</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Contractors invariably extend credit to their employer by
                        performing services or providing goods in advance of payment. Contractors
                        are also almost invariably the party in the weaker bargaining and financial
                        position as compared to their employer. A payment dispute between an
                        employer and a contractor takes time and money to settle on the merits and
                        with finality. Doing so invariably disrupts the contractor’s cash
                        flow. That disruption can have serious and sometimes permanent consequences
                        for the contractor. That potential disruption gives the employer significant
                        leverage in any negotiations between the parties for compromise. If the
                        contractor’s payment claim is justified, that disruption and its
                        consequences for the contractor are unjustified.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     In our judgment, cl 20.4 is aimed at
                    addressing precisely these concerns, and cl 20 should therefore be
                    interpreted in a manner which promotes prompt compliance with a DAB decision,
                    including, as noted above (and also by FIDIC), by enabling a failure to comply
                    with a binding but non-final DAB decision to be directly referred to arbitration
                    without the parties having to first go through the steps prescribed by
                    cll 20.4 and 20.5. In this regard, Frederic Gillion has suggested in his
                    article “Enforcement of DAB Decisions under the 1999 FIDIC Conditions of
                    Contract: A Recent Development: CRW Joint Operation v. PT Perusahaan Gas
                    Negara (Persero) TBK” [2011] ICLR 388 (at p 408) that the receiving
                    party should seek an award:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… giving full immediate effect to [its] right to have a DAB
                        decision complied with promptly in accordance with sub-clause 20.4 or
                        to damages in respect of the losing party’s breach of
                        sub-clause 20.4. That award will be final in that it will dispose of
                        the issue of the losing party’s failure to give prompt effect to the
                        DAB decision, which is a substantive claim distinct from the underlying
                        dispute covered by the DAB decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The position, ultimately, is a simple one. An
                    arbitration that settles the merits of a DAB decision will likely take
                    considerable time to determine. In contrast, an arbitral ruling concerning a
                    party’s failure to comply with that DAB decision will almost always be
                    made within a relatively short period of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     We note that Prof Bunni, in his article
                    cited at [55] above, ultimately concludes that cl 20 of the 1999 Red Book
                    does not entitle a receiving party to refer the paying party’s
                    non-compliance with a binding but non-final DAB decision directly to arbitration
                    without the parties having to first go through the process set out in
                    cll 20.4 and 20.5. He appears to have reached this conclusion on the basis
                    that since cl 20.7 only provides for the enforcement by arbitration of
                    final and binding DAB decisions, binding but non-final DAB decisions are not
                    similarly capable of being enforced by arbitration. He states (at
                    pp 277–278):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [A]lthough the clear intention of sub-clause 20.4 is that
                        the DAB’s decision should be complied with promptly, unless and until
                        it is revised in a subsequent forum (amicable settlement or arbitration),
                        and irrespective of whether or not one of the parties is dissatisfied with
                        it, sub-clause 20.7 is worded in such a way that it only deals with the
                        event where the parties are satisfied with the decision. The draftsmen did
                        not deal with circumstances where the parties are dissatisfied with the
                        decision, leaving that situation without any prompt solution or elucidation
                        hence creating a gap. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Prof Bunni states that cl 20 does
                    not offer the receiving party any solution in cases where the paying party fails
                    to comply with a binding but non-final DAB decision, other than to treat the
                    paying party as being in breach of contract. He acknowledges that this leads to
                    an unsatisfactory situation which is inconsistent with the express wording of
                    cl 20.4 (at p 273):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [A]s the remedy for such breach is damages that might be imposed
                        at some future date, it is of little value in the immediate term and is in
                        violation of the requirement in sub-clause 20.4 that the parties shall
                        “promptly give effect” to the DAB’s decision
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Therefore, he argues that the “gap” should be
                        remedied, and one suggestion he offers is for cll 20.6 and 20.7 of the
                        1999 Red Book to be amended so as to expressly allow a receiving party to
                        refer a paying party’s non-compliance with a binding but non-final DAB
                        decision to arbitration without having to first comply with the provisions
                        of cll 20.4 and 20.5 (at pp 281–282). We note that
                        Prof Bunni’s conclusion is based on his interpretation of the
                        effect of the express insertion of cl 20.7 into the Red Book (in the
                        form of cl 67.4 of the 1987 Red Book). We respectfully disagree with
                        him on this and turn to address this point now.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     In the article cited at [65] above,
                    Mr Seppälä discusses the effect of the express introduction of
                    cl 20.7. He acknowledges that cl 20.7, which expressly provides for
                    the enforcement by arbitration of final <em>and
                        binding</em> DAB decisions (<em>ie</em>, those in
                    respect of which neither party has issued an NOD within the stipulated time
                    frame), might conceivably be understood to suggest that binding but non-final
                    DAB decisions are not similarly capable of being enforced by arbitration since
                    they are excluded from the scope of cl 20.7. However, he argues that
                    cl 20.7 should not be interpreted in this manner. He undertakes an analysis
                    of the historical reason for the introduction of cl 20.7 (in the form of
                    its predecessor, cl 67.4 of the 1987 Red Book) to support his
                    argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     In all the editions of the Red Book published
                    prior to the 1999 Red Book, the role presently assigned to the DAB was
                    discharged by the “Engineer”. Disputes had to be referred to the
                    Engineer for decision before they could be referred to arbitration. There was a
                    gap in the version of the Red Book that was published in 1977 (“the 1977
                    Red Book”), in that there was no mechanism for a receiving party to
                    enforce an Engineer’s decision which had become final and binding save by
                    resort to the local courts. Mr Seppälä observes in his article (at
                    p 19):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [I]n the case of an international construction project, the
                        Contractor would almost certainly not want to go into a local court, which
                        would typically be in a developing country, because the local court often
                        could not, or would not, grant the desired relief. As a result, no
                        satisfactory remedy was available in the [1977 Red Book] where, in the case
                        of such a project, a party, typically the Employer, had failed to comply
                        with a final and binding decision of the Engineer under
                        Clause 67.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     While we do not accept Mr Seppälä’s
                    broad and general characterisation of the state of justice generally available
                    in “local” courts and courts in “developing”
                    countries, the passage nonetheless provides a candid explanation for
                    FIDIC’s decision to act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Clause 67.4 was first introduced in the
                    1987 Red Book to ensure that a receiving party could refer a paying
                    party’s failure to comply with a final and binding Engineer’s
                    decision to arbitration. Mr Seppälä argues that cl 67.4 and its
                    successor, cl 20.7 of the 1999 Red Book, should <em>not</em> be interpreted to mean that binding but non-final
                    Engineer’s/DAB decisions are not similarly capable of being enforced by
                    arbitration. He states in the article cited at [65] above (at p 20):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Nothing was intended to be implied about merely a
                        ‘binding’ decision as it was obvious – or so it was
                        thought at that time – that such a decision, together with the dispute
                        underlying it, could be referred to arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… It was unnecessary to deal with binding decisions, as it was
                        clear – or so it was thought – that, as these had been the
                        subject of a notice of dissatisfaction, these could, by definition, be
                        referred to arbitration under Sub-Clause 20.6 (and its predecessor,
                        Sub-Clause 67.3).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>It is evident that Mr Seppälä’s views are aligned
                        with those expressed in the FIDIC Guidance Memorandum. In short,
                        cl 20.7 makes perfect sense if one sees it as a mechanism by which the
                        receiving party under a DAB decision that has become <em>final and binding</em> can take steps, where that decision is not
                        complied with, to convert that decision into an internationally enforceable
                        arbitral award even though there is no dispute as to its underlying merits.
                        We thus agree with Mr Seppälä that cl 20.7 was never intended to
                        exclude a receiving party’s right to seek an arbitral award in
                        relation to a paying party’s failure to comply with a binding
                            <em>but non-final</em> DAB
                decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Before leaving this issue, we make some
                    observations on the views expressed by this court in <em>Persero
                        CA</em> at [67]–[68] because our decision here – namely,
                    that a paying party’s failure to comply with a binding but non-final DAB
                    decision is itself capable of being directly referred to a <em>separate</em> arbitration under cl 20.6 – differs from
                    those views. In <em>Persero CA</em>, the court adopted the
                    view that cl 20 contemplated a <em>single</em>
                    arbitration that would deal with all the differences between the parties:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">67    … Where [an] NOD has been validly filed
                            against a DAB decision by one or both of the parties, and either or both
                            of the parties fail to comply with that decision (which, by virtue of
                            the NOD(s) filed, will be binding but non-final), sub-cl 20.6 of
                            the 1999 [Red Book] requires the parties to finally settle their
                            differences in the <b><em>same</em></b> arbitration,
                                <em>both in respect of the non-compliance with the
                                DAB decision and in respect of the merits of that
                                decision</em>. In other words, <em>sub-cl 20.6 contemplates a single arbitration where all the
                                existing differences between the parties arising from the DAB
                                decision concerned will be resolved</em>.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">68    This observation is consistent with the plain
                            phraseology of sub-cl 20.6, which requires the parties’
                            dispute in respect of any binding DAB decision which has yet to become
                            final to be “finally settled by international
                            arbitration”. Sub-clause 20.6 clearly does not provide for
                            separate proceedings to be brought by the parties before different
                            arbitral panels even if each party is dissatisfied with the same DAB
                            decision for different reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original in bold italics; emphasis added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>With respect, the suggestion that all the differences between
                        the parties must be settled in a single arbitration fails to adequately
                        appreciate that an NOD issued in respect of a DAB decision is capable of
                        covering the paying party’s dissatisfaction with two different aspects
                        of the DAB decision: (a) the quantum that it is required to pay the
                        receiving party; and (b) the need to make <em>prompt</em> payment of that sum (see [66(a)] above). The dispute
                        over the paying party’s failure to <em>promptly</em> comply with its obligation to pay the sum that the
                        DAB finds it is liable to pay is a dispute in its own right which is capable
                        of being “finally settled by international arbitration”. In
                        our judgment, it is possible to refer that dispute to a separate
                        arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     In the present case, the parties had, by way
                    of the wide Terms of Reference adopted for the 2009 Arbitration, conferred upon
                    the 2009 Tribunal broad authority to not only deal with the issue of whether PGN
                    had to make immediate payment of the Adjudicated Sum awarded under DAB
                    No 3, but also consider the merits of the parties’ Underlying Dispute
                    in the same arbitration. As noted by this court at [43] of <em>Persero CA</em>, under the Terms of Reference for the 2009
                    Arbitration, the parties had consented to confer on the 2009 Tribunal:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… an unfettered discretion to reopen and review each and every
                        finding by the [DAB]. In other words, the Arbitral Tribunal was appointed to
                        decide not only whether CRW was entitled to immediate payment of the sum of
                        US$17,298,834.57 … but also “any additional issues of fact or
                        law which the Arbitral Tribunal, in its own discretion, [might] deem
                        necessary to decide for the purpose of rendering its arbitral award”.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Notwithstanding the broad Terms of Reference
                    for the 2009 Arbitration, the 2009 Majority Arbitrators concluded that they were
                    not required to open up, review and revise DAB No 3. This was because:
                    (a) CRW had limited its claim in the 2009 Arbitration to, essentially, a
                    declaration that PGN had an immediate obligation to pay CRW the Adjudicated Sum
                    and an order for “prompt payment” of that sum (see [8] above); and
                    (b) PGN had not filed a counterclaim, but rather, had couched its request
                    for the merits of DAB No 3 to be “open[ed] up, review[ed] and
                    revise[d]” in the form of a <em>defence to CRW’s
                        claim for immediate payment</em> (see [9] above), which defence was
                    untenable. For these reasons, the 2009 Majority Arbitrators proceeded on the
                    basis that the 2009 Arbitration was “<em>limited</em> to giving prompt effect to [DAB No 3]”
                    [emphasis added] (see [6] of the Final Award). This is evident from the
                    concluding paragraphs of the Final Award, where the 2009 Majority Arbitrators
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">48.    [PGN] has not served any
                        counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">51.    It follows that [PGN’s] Answer and
                            [PGN’s] request for an award to open up, review and revise [DAB
                            No 3] is but a defence to the claim for immediate payment of
                            US$17,298,834.57. For all the reasons set out above, this defence must
                            also fail and the Arbitral Tribunal [<em>ie</em>,
                            the 2009 Majority Arbitrators, in the context of this quotation] FINDS
                            accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This does not in any way affect [PGN’s] right to commence an
                        arbitration to seek to revise [DAB No 3]. The Arbitral Tribunal notes
                        that [CRW has] expressly agreed that [PGN] may do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">53.    In the light of the Arbitral Tribunal’s
                            findings …, <em>there is nothing further to be

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Unlike the 2009 Majority Arbitrators, the
                    court in <em>Persero CA</em> took the view that it made no
                    difference that PGN challenged the merits of DAB No 3 by way of a defence
                    only. It considered this to be a matter of form rather than substance, and said
                    (at [67] and [88]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">67    … The respondent to the proceedings may
                            raise the issues which it wishes the arbitral tribunal to consider
                            either in its defence and or in the form of a counterclaim. <em>There is no particular doctrine or rule that the respondent
                                can only dispute a binding but non-final DAB decision by way of a
                                counterclaim</em>. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">88    Counsel for CRW therefore accepted [before the 2009
                            Tribunal] that if PGN had sufficiently particularised its defence for
                            the Arbitration, the Arbitral Tribunal could proceed to examine the
                            merits of PGN’s dissatisfaction with [DAB No 3]. However,
                            despite this concession by CRW, the [2009 Majority Arbitrators] –
                            <em>curiously</em> – declined to open up,
                            review and revise [DAB No 3] on the <b><em>sole</em></b> basis that PGN had not filed a counterclaim
                            …
                            <em>As stated above at [67], it was not necessary for PGN
                                to file a counterclaim before it could challenge [DAB No 3] on
                                the merits</em>. In addition, PGN’s memorial dated
                            10 July 2009, in our view, did include sufficient details of the
                            alleged errors committed by the [DAB] (see [71] above). The Arbitral
                            Tribunal could quite easily have examined the underlying documents
                            placed before it to consider PGN’s allegations as well as
                            undertake a rehearing of the parties’ dispute in accordance with
                            sub-cl 20.6 of the [Conditions of Contract] after making an interim
                            order for payment in favour of CRW.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     With respect, we disagree with the views
                    expressed at [67] and [88] of <em>Persero CA</em>. As noted
                    earlier at [85] above, in the 2009 Arbitration, the 2009 Tribunal had
                    effectively only been asked to consider whether a dispute over the merits of DAB
                    No 3 could be a defence to CRW’s claim for immediate payment of the
                    Adjudicated Sum. The 2009 Majority Arbitrators held – in our judgment,
                    correctly – that such a dispute could not be a defence. In our judgment,
                    cl 20.4[4] of the Conditions of Contract, on its terms, makes it clear that
                    a dispute over the merits of a DAB decision is not a defence to a receiving
                    party’s claim for prompt payment of the sum awarded to it by the DAB. If
                    PGN wished to challenge DAB No 3, it was incumbent on PGN to pursue that by
                    filing a counterclaim or lodging a fresh request for arbitration. It was simply
                    no defence to CRW’s claim (pursuant to cl 20.4) for immediate payment
                    of the Adjudicated Sum awarded under DAB No 3 to say that an NOD had been
                    issued in respect of that decision. We thus do not think that the 2009 Majority
                    Arbitrators were wrong to proceed on the basis that the 2009 Arbitration was
                    “limited to giving prompt effect to [DAB No 3]” (at [6] of
                    the Final Award) and to turn down, on that basis, PGN’s request that the
                    2009 Tribunal “open up, review and revise” DAB No 3 on its
                    merits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     To sum up our analysis at [83]–[87]
                    above, cl 20.4 imposes a distinct contractual obligation on a paying party
                    to comply promptly with a DAB decision regardless of whether the decision is
                    final and binding or merely binding but non-final, and this obligation is
                    capable of being directly enforced by arbitration without the parties having to
                    first go through the preliminary steps set out in cll 20.4 and 20.5.
                    Further, we consider that a tribunal would be entitled to make a final
                    determination on the issue of prompt compliance alone if that is all it has been
                    asked to rule on, as was the case in the 2009 Arbitration. On the other hand,
                    where both the dispute over the paying party’s non-compliance with a
                    binding but non-final DAB decision as well as the dispute over the merits of
                    that DAB decision are put before the same tribunal, as was done in the 2011
                    Arbitration and, hence, in the case before us now, the tribunal can:
                    (a) make an interim or partial award which finally disposes of the first
                    issue (<em>ie</em>, whether the paying party has to
                    promptly comply with the DAB decision); (b) then proceed to consider the
                    second issue (<em>ie</em>, the merits of the DAB decision),
                    which is a separate and conceptually distinct matter as we have already noted;
                    and (c) subsequently, make a final determination of the underlying dispute
                    between the parties. This is consistent with the view expressed by Gerlando
                    Butera in his article “Untangling the Enforcement of DAB
                    Decisions” [2014] ICLR 36. He argues (at p 59) that where the paying
                    party lodges a counterclaim in an arbitration commenced by the receiving party
                    to enforce a binding but non-final DAB decision:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he merits of the [DAB decision] would ultimately have to be
                        considered within the same arbitration, but (it is submitted) there is
                            <b><em>no reason in principle why in that case the tribunal
                            should not first deal with and make a final (partial) award in respect
                            of [the paying party’s failure to promptly comply with the DAB
                            decision] without at the same time reviewing the merits of the first
                            decision</em></b>. On the contrary, it is submitted that that is
                        precisely what the tribunal should in that case do, having regard to the
                        parties’ agreement in clause 20.4 of the FIDIC Conditions that
                        they “<em>shall promptly give effect
                        to</em>” the decision. … [emphasis in italics in

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     In our judgment, this in fact is what the 2011
                    Majority Arbitrators did in this case. They fully intended the Interim Award to
                    be <em>finally</em> dispositive of the “prompt
                    compliance” issue mentioned in the extract quoted at [88] above,
                        <em>ie</em>, PGN’s obligation to comply promptly
                    with DAB No 3. They did not (and, for that matter, could not lawfully)
                    intend their conclusion on that issue to thereafter be varied. We turn now to
                    explain why we disagree with PGN’s submissions to the
                contrary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Did CRW and the 2011 Majority Arbitrators intend the Interim Award to
                be varied by future awards in the 2011 Arbitration?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     PGN relies on a number of documents to argue
                    that CRW and the 2011 Majority Arbitrators intended the Interim Award to be
                    “subject to future variation”. We have set out the significant
                    references above at [27]–[31]. We do not agree with PGN’s
                    interpretation of those documents for the reasons set out below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Significance of CRW characterising its claim as one for an
                interim or partial award “pending” the resolution of the Underlying
                Dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Beginning with CRW’s Statement of Claim
                    and the Terms of Reference for the 2011 Arbitration, we accept that CRW
                    characterised its claim as one for an interim or partial award “<em>pending</em> the resolution of [the] parties’
                    dispute” [emphasis added] (see [27] above). However, this does not
                    signify that CRW intended the Interim Award to be subject to variation by
                    subsequent awards made in the 2011 Arbitration. Rather, we regard this merely as
                    an acknowledgement by CRW that the 2011 Tribunal would have to carry on to
                    consider the parties’ Underlying Dispute over the merits of DAB No 3
                    notwithstanding that it might have rendered a decision granting CRW the
                    immediate relief that the latter sought in the form of an arbitral award
                    ordering PGN to promptly comply with DAB No 3. CRW undoubtedly wanted the
                    2011 Tribunal to determine its application for such relief first (indeed,
                    immediately), before proceeding to finally resolve the Underlying Dispute. This
                    much becomes evident when para 30(a) of CRW’s Statement of Claim,
                    which PGN referred us to, is read in its proper context. We set out below the
                    relevant parts of CRW’s Statement of Claim:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     It is clear from this that CRW acknowledged
                    that the 2011 Tribunal had the power to rule on the parties’ Underlying
                    Dispute over the merits of DAB No 3. Indeed, having regard to cl 20.6,
                    the contrary was unarguable. However, CRW also sought an interim or partial
                    award to immediately enforce PGN’s contractual obligation to promptly pay
                    CRW the Adjudicated Sum awarded under DAB No 3 pending the 2011
                    Tribunal’s determination of the Underlying Dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Significance of CRW’s position in the 2011 Arbitration
                that it would continue to rely on DAB No 3 even at the stage of seeking a final
                award </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     We turn next to [37] of the Interim Award,
                    which records CRW’s position in the 2011 Arbitration that it would rely on
                    DAB No 3 both at the stage of seeking an interim award, as well as (and
                    even if it were fail in its application for an interim award) at the stage of
                    seeking a final award on the parties’ Underlying Dispute over the merits
                    of that DAB decision (see [28] above). PGN argues that the fact that CRW was
                    prepared to rely on DAB No 3 even at the latter stage of seeking a final
                    award demonstrates that CRW never intended the interim award which it sought to
                    finally resolve the Underlying Dispute. We do not think PGN’s argument on
                    this point is sustainable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     It would be helpful to set out again [37] of
                    the Interim Award, where the 2011 Majority Arbitrators summarised CRW’s
                    position in the 2011 Arbitration as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">37. … The Tribunal further acknowledges that [CRW] had
                        at the Preliminary Hearing on 2 March 2012, confirmed its position
                        (which has been recorded in the scope of the Terms of Reference)
                        that:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    [CRW] would be relying on [DAB No 3] as
                                the basis for its application for an Interim Award;
                            and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   … in the event that it was
                                unsuccessful at the Interim Award stage, it would continue to rely
                                upon [DAB No 3] in seeking any Final Award, and would not seek
                                to open up and revise [DAB No 3].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     In our judgment, all that [37] of the Interim
                    Award indicates is that CRW had conveyed to the 2011 Tribunal that even if it
                    were not granted the interim award which it sought, in seeking a final award on
                    the parties’ Underlying Dispute, it would continue to rely on the
                    Adjudicated Sum set out in DAB No 3 as the correct quantum of the payment
                    due to it in respect of the 13 disputed VOPs. This particular paragraph of the
                    Interim Award does not, in our view, suggest in any way that CRW envisaged the
                    interim award which it sought to be “subject to future variation”
                    by the 2011 Tribunal’s final award on the parties’ Underlying
                    Dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Significance of the 2011 Majority Arbitrators’
                statement that the Interim Award would be “altered” by the 2011
                Tribunal’s final award</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     PGN also made reference to certain statements
                    by the 2011 Majority Arbitrators in the Interim Award which could be seen as
                    appearing to suggest that that award could be “altered” by the
                    2011 Tribunal’s final award on the parties’ Underlying Dispute (see
                    [29] above). However, this again is not warranted if the pertinent statements
                    are read in their proper context. We set out the relevant parts of the Interim
                    Award below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>Whether [CRW] is entitled to enforce [DAB No 3]

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">49.    In relation to the last issue, [PGN] relies on
                            [s 19B] to contend that Singapore legislation does not allow for
                            the kind of Interim Award or Partial Award as contemplated by [CRW].
                            [PGN]’s contention is that, since [DAB No 3] can be opened up
                            at the arbitration hearing, it is not “final” in the sense
                            contemplated in [s 19B] and an interim award cannot be issued.

                    read together, it becomes evident, in our judgment, that the 2011 Majority
                    Arbitrators were putting across what they regarded to be the same point in three
                    different ways. The general point they were making was that the Interim Award
                    would bear the requisite measure of finality required by s 19B. They
                    explained that this was because: (a) the Interim Award would finally
                    resolve the position between the parties for a certain period of time (<em>ie</em>, the Interim Award would have temporal finality);
                    (b) the Interim Award would finally resolve the issue of whether PGN had to
                    promptly comply with DAB No 3 even though it had issued an NOD in respect
                    of that decision (<em>ie</em>, the Interim Award would have
                    subject matter finality); and (c) the Interim Award would be final until
                    and unless it was altered by subsequent awards made in the 2011 Arbitration on
                    the merits of the parties’ Underlying Dispute. It is the last of these
                    that might appear problematic. However, as mentioned at the outset of this
                    paragraph, it is evident, in our judgment, that the 2011 Majority Arbitrators
                    regarded all three of their aforesaid explanations to be variations of one
                    another, and therefore, the way in which they put across the point at [52] of
                    the Interim Award should not be read in isolation. Rather, this must be read in
                    the light of the general point that the 2011 Majority Arbitrators were
                    making.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Furthermore, [53] of the Interim Award puts
                    paid to any suggestion that the 2011 Majority Arbitrators intended the Interim
                    Award to be varied. It is clear that the 2011 Majority Arbitrators were alive to
                    PGN’s argument that an interim or partial award would breach s 19B if
                    the decision that the 2011 Tribunal subsequently issued on the merits of the
                    parties’ Underlying Dispute had the effect of varying such an award. The
                    2011 Majority Arbitrators expressly rejected this submission at [53] of the
                    Interim Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     In our judgment, the real point which the 2011
                    Majority Arbitrators were making was this: <em>until</em>
                    an award on the merits of the parties’ Underlying Dispute had been
                    rendered, not only would the Interim Award be the final determination as to
                    PGN’s immediate obligation to make prompt payment of the Adjudicated Sum
                    awarded under DAB No 3, there would also be nothing to be set off against
                    that sum. But, once the award on the merits of the parties’ Underlying
                    Dispute had been issued, inevitably, an account would have to be taken of the
                    amounts actually due one way or the other, as well as of any payments that might
                    already have been made. It is true that the language in which the 2011 Majority
                    Arbitrators expressed themselves could have been more precise. The language
                    which they used might, on one reading, suggest that they thought the Interim
                    Award could be varied. As a matter of law, of course, it could not (see below at
                    [105]). Be that as it may, what we consider they <em>were</em> speaking about was the fact that the <em>accounts</em> between the parties would have to be adjusted as a
                    consequence of the 2011 Tribunal’s eventual award on the merits of the
                    parties’ Underlying Dispute. In short, it was not the Interim Award that
                    would be changed or revised, but the inevitable monetary <em>consequences and effects</em> of that award once the final award on
                    the merits of the Underlying Dispute had been made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    On this point, we return here to our brief
                    discussion on the proper understanding and definition of the various types of
                    awards mentioned at [45]–[53] above. Much of the confusion in this case
                    seems to us to have stemmed from a failure to differentiate between, on the one
                    hand, interim or partial awards, which entail a final determination of the
                    parties’ substantive rights or a final determination of preliminary issues
                    relevant to the resolution of the parties’ claims and, on the other hand,
                    provisional awards, which neither entail nor aid in a final determination of the
                    parties’ substantive rights. On no basis was the Interim Award a
                    provisional award. On the contrary, it was a final determination of whether PGN
                    had an immediate and enforceable contractual obligation to comply with DAB
                    No 3 even though it had issued an NOD in respect of that decision. This
                    point was answered in the affirmative by the 2011 Majority Arbitrators in the
                    Interim Award, and that answer is not susceptible to change regardless of
                    whatever award the 2011 Tribunal might eventually make on the parties’
                    Underlying Dispute over the merits of DAB No 3. The only thing that is
                    provisional in this context is the set of financial effects and consequences of
                    the Interim Award, and that is so because the Conditions of Contract provide
                    that in certain circumstances, a DAB decision may be revised by an arbitral
                    award that settles the underlying merits of that decision. If and when an award
                    on the merits of DAB No 3 is eventually made, that award would not alter
                    the Interim Award or render it any less final, even though it might alter the
                    financial effects and consequences that flow from the Interim
                Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Significance of the Partial Award’s purported revision
                of the Interim Award</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    The final thread of PGN’s argument
                    that CRW and the 2011 Majority Arbitrators intended the Interim Award to be
                    “subject to future variation” concerns the Partial Award, which
                    seemingly purports to revise the Interim Award by dismissing two of the nine
                    Heads of Claim which the DAB had formulated when considering CRW’s claim
                    against PGN in relation to the 13 disputed VOPs. It bears repeating the 2011
                    Tribunal’s conclusion at [100.6(c)] of the Partial Award:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This Partial Award <em>revises</em> the previous
                        majority Interim Award insofar as Heads of Claim Nos. 6 and 8 are
                        dismissed. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    It is not clear why the 2011 Tribunal
                    formulated its conclusion in those terms. There are a number of difficulties
                    with the terms which it used. First, the use of the word “revises”
                    is odd because the 2011 Majority Arbitrators had, as demonstrated earlier,
                    adopted the view that the Interim Award: (a) only settled the issue of
                    whether payment of the Adjudicated Sum awarded to CRW under DAB No 3 ought
                    to be made forthwith by PGN even though the arbitration of the parties’
                    Underlying Dispute over the merits of that DAB decision was still ongoing; and
                    (b) did not preclude a later decision on the merits of that underlying
                    dispute. The 2011 Tribunal therefore did not have to “revise” the
                    Interim Award when it found that two of the Heads of Claim were not made
                    out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Second, the reference to “Heads of
                    Claim” also makes no sense when considered in the context of the Interim
                    Award. The Interim Award makes no mention of any individual Head of Claim;
                    neither does it make any conclusion as to the merits of any Head of Claim.
                    Consequently, the Interim Award is not capable of being understood as though it
                    could be revised in the manner contemplated at [100.6(c)] of the Partial
                    Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Given these difficulties, we agree with
                    CRW’s submission that this part of the Partial Award should not be used as
                    the basis for concluding that the 2011 Majority Arbitrators intended the Interim
                    Award to be one that could subsequently be varied. The Partial Award concerns
                    the correctness of DAB No 3, which, as we have repeatedly emphasised, is a
                    wholly distinct issue from that finally disposed of in the Interim Award
                        (<em>ie</em>, whether PGN had an obligation to comply
                    promptly with DAB No 3 even though it had issued an NOD in respect of that
                    decision). In issuing the Partial Award, the 2011 Tribunal has taken a step in
                    reviewing the merits of the parties’ Underlying Dispute over the
                    correctness of DAB No 3. That process is by no means complete. CRW has
                    maintained that it will seek an order in the 2011 Tribunal’s final award
                    on the merits of the Underlying Dispute that it is entitled to an aggregate
                    amount exceeding the Adjudicated Sum awarded under DAB No 3. Whether it can
                    or cannot do so, and whether it will or will not succeed are not before us. For
                    these reasons, [100.6(c)] of the Partial Award does not, in our judgment, help
                    PGN’s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The effect of s 19B</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    In any event, even if the 2011 Majority
                    Arbitrators contemplated that the Interim Award might subsequently be varied by
                    future awards made in the 2011 Arbitration, this would not avail PGN, and in
                    particular, s 19B would not operate to render the Interim Award
                    unenforceable. Rather, that section plainly renders the Interim Award final and
                    binding as regards the particular issue which that award determined. The object
                    of s 19B, which was introduced into the predecessor of the IAA (<em>ie</em>, the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A,
                    1995 Rev Ed)) only in 2001, was set out by this court at [133]–[142]
                    of <em>PT First Media TBK (formerly known as PT Broadband
                        Multimedia TBK) v Astro Nusantara International BV and others and another
                        appeal</em> [2014] 1 SLR 372. There, we noted that s 19B, in
                    particular s 19B(1), was enacted to clarify the position that all awards,
                    regardless of the stage of the arbitration at which they were made, would have
                    the effect of being final and binding. This reflected the accepted position that
                    the issues decided under all arbitral awards were <em>res
                        judicata.</em> Such decisions would not be amenable to revision by the
                    arbitral tribunal. Section 19B does not have the effect of rendering the
                    tribunal <em>functus officio</em> once it has made an
                    interim, interlocutory or partial award in the sense of precluding it from
                    deciding any further matter in the arbitration which is not covered by the
                    award(s) already made. This is made clear in s 19A, which provides that a
                    tribunal may “make more than one award at different points in time during
                    the arbitral proceedings on different aspects of the matters to be
                    determined”. What <em>is</em> proscribed by
                    s 19B is a provisional award in the sense described at [49]–[50]
                    above. In our judgment, the Interim Award was not a provisional award in respect
                    of the issue which it dealt with; and if and to the extent the Partial Award
                    purports to vary or revise the Interim Award as opposed to merely reflect the
                    altered monetary consequences and effects that follow upon the issuance of the
                    Partial Award, then it is the Partial Award that would offend s 19B. For
                    the avoidance of doubt, we are merely setting out the logical conclusion of
                    PGN’s argument that the Partial Award has varied the Interim Award; not
                    that we think this to be true of the Partial Award for the reasons we have
                    already stated above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    We reiterate yet again that PGN’s
                    right to have the underlying merits of DAB No 3 reviewed at the 2011
                    Arbitration is in no way prejudiced by the fact that s 19B renders the
                    issue determined under the Interim Award <em>res
                        judicata</em>. This is because the Interim Award only deals with the
                    issue of whether PGN had an obligation to promptly comply with DAB No 3
                    even though it had issued an NOD in respect of that decision, and says nothing
                    about the underlying merits of DAB No 3.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Our conclusion on PGN’s first argument on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    For these reasons, PGN’s first
                    argument before this court, in our judgment, is without merit and we accordingly
                    reject it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">PGN’s second argument on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    We also reject PGN’s second argument
                    on appeal. According to PGN, pursuant to cl 20.4 of the Conditions of
                    Contract, DAB No 3 would cease to be binding as soon as the 2011 Tribunal
                    issues any award on any aspect of the parties’ Underlying Dispute over the
                    merits of that DAB decision. It contends that once that happens, it will be
                    absolved of its obligation to comply with the tribunal’s interim or
                    partial or any other award ordering it to comply promptly with DAB No 3.
                    However, PGN does not explain why this should be so. The fact that DAB
                    No 3, on which the Interim Award is predicated, ceases to be binding once
                    any award on its merits is made does not automatically render the Interim Award
                    unenforceable or liable to be set aside. PGN bears the burden of demonstrating
                    why this outcome should follow, but it has not discharged that
                burden.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Additionally, in our judgment, it would not
                    be commercially sensible to read cl 20.4 as entailing that DAB No 3
                    will cease to be binding as soon as the 2011 Tribunal makes any determination on
                    any aspect of the merits of the parties’ Underlying Dispute. The key point
                    is this: the Interim Award is a final decision requiring PGN to make prompt
                    payment of the Adjudicated Sum awarded to CRW under DAB No 3 pending the
                    resolution of the Underlying Dispute. That award may be enforced against PGN on
                    its terms, save only if there are grounds to set it aside or to resist
                    enforcement under the applicable legal framework. The Interim Award, at pain of
                    repeating the point, concerns PGN’s obligation under cl 20.4 to make
                        <em>prompt</em> payment of the Adjudicated Sum to CRW
                    even though PGN has issued an NOD in respect of DAB No 3 and the
                    arbitration of the merits of that DAB decision is still ongoing. That obligation
                    remains valid and binding regardless of any subsequent award on the merits of
                    the Underlying Dispute. If the Interim Award had never been made and the parties
                    had proceeded (in the absence of an amicable settlement) straight to an
                    arbitration of the Underlying Dispute, and if, in that arbitration, DAB
                    No 3 had been set aside, there would no longer be any basis for CRW to seek
                    an award or order for the enforcement of that DAB decision. But, where, as here,
                    the Interim Award requiring prompt payment of the Adjudicated Sum awarded under
                    DAB No 3 has already been made, that award remains enforceable. When the
                    merits of the Underlying Dispute (and, as a corollary, the state of the final
                    accounts between the parties) have been resolved, if there is, as a result, no
                    longer a net sum payable to CRW (the receiving party under the Interim Award),
                    then in those circumstances, there may be nothing left for CRW to enforce. But,
                    that simply is not the position at the present point in time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    In our judgment, this is the commercially
                    sensible way of reading cl 20.4 of the Conditions of Contract and the
                    related provisions. In the present case, there has not been a final
                    determination of the parties’ Underlying Dispute over the merits of DAB
                    No 3, and nothing has transpired to invalidate or affect the Interim Award
                    or CRW’s long overdue right to receive payment thereunder.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    In the premises, we allow SUM 5277, but
                    dismiss SUM 5985. We also dismiss both CA 148 and CA 149 with
                    costs to be taxed if not agreed, and make the usual consequential orders. It is
                    now a matter for CRW to decide what it will do with the Interim Award, which
                    this court has found (by a majority) to be a valid award made in accordance with
                    Singapore law and one that is not liable to be set aside.</p>

                    declining to set aside: (a) an interim award issued on 22 May 2013
                    (“the Interim Award”) by the majority of the arbitral tribunal in
                    International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) International Court of
                    Arbitration Case No 18272/CYK; and (b) an order of court made on
                    2 July 2013 granting the respondent, CRW Joint Operation
                    (“CRW”), leave to enforce that interim award in the same manner as
                    a judgment (“the Enforcement Order”). I have read the
                    majority’s judgment (“the Majority Judgment”) in draft and
                    agree with it with regard to the disposition of PGN’s applications to this
                    court in Summonses Nos 5277 and 5985 of 2014 for leave to adduce further
                    evidence. However, with regard to the substantive decision on PGN’s
                    appeals, I have adopted a different approach from the majority. In setting out
                    my reasons for differing from the majority, I shall in this judgment, unless
                    otherwise indicated, use the same abbreviated terms and case names as those used
                    in the Majority Judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    The facts and history of the arbitration
                    between the parties are set out in the Majority Judgment at [3]–[21]
                    above. The issue for determination in the present appeals is the legality of the
                    Interim Award made by the 2011 Majority Arbitrators ordering PGN to comply with
                    DAB No 3 forthwith pending the determination by the 2011 Tribunal of the
                    correctness (<em>ie</em>, the merits) of DAB
                    No 3.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    In my view, the Interim Award issued by the
                    2011 Majority Arbitrators should be set aside on one or more of the following
                    grounds, the first two of which are interrelated:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_114-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Interim Award was issued with
                        regard to “the dispute which arises from PGN’s failure to pay
                        CRW, whether promptly or at all, pursuant to [DAB No 3]” (see
                            <em>Persero HC (2014)</em> at [6]), <em>ie</em>, the dispute as to whether DAB No 3 was
                        enforceable by an arbitral tribunal under cl 20.6 of the Conditions of
                        Contract via an interim award pending the tribunal’s determination of
                        the merits of DAB No 3. That dispute, which the Judge termed the
                        “secondary dispute”, was not a dispute that was referable to
                        arbitration under cl 20.6 of the Conditions of
                    Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_114-p2_b"></a>(b)     The 2011
                        Majority Arbitrators had no mandate under cl 20.6 of the Conditions of
                        Contract to issue the Interim Award to enforce DAB No 3 pending the
                        2011 Tribunal’s final adjudication on the parties’ dispute over
                        the merits of DAB No 3 (referred to hereafter as the parties’
                        “primary dispute”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_114-p2_c"></a>(c)     Even if the 2011 Majority Arbitrators had the mandate
                        under cl 20.6 of the Conditions of Contract to issue the Interim Award
                        pending the 2011 Tribunal’s decision on the primary dispute, the
                        Interim Award was, and was intended to be, in substance a provisional award
                        that fell outside the ambit of an “award” as defined in
                        s 2 of the IAA, and therefore was not enforceable under s 19 of
                        the IAA in the same manner as a judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    The legal relationship between the parties
                    is set out in the Contract, which is governed by Indonesian law. The Contract is
                    effectively a domestic contract. It includes (<em>inter
                        alia</em>) the Conditions of Contract, which incorporate, with
                    modifications, the standard provisions of the 1999 Red Book published by FIDIC.
                    The Red Book is based on the standard conditions of contract used by the UK
                    Institute of Civil Engineers (“the ICE Conditions”), and
                    incorporates common law concepts, in particular, principles of contract
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    The Interim Award is the second arbitral
                    award issued in the dispute between CRW and PGN over the issue of the immediate
                    enforceability of DAB No 3 by way of an arbitral award. Since the issuance
                    of DAB No 3, two rounds of arbitration and three rounds of court
                    proceedings have been expended on this issue. Various interpretational issues
                    have been canvassed on the scope of cll 20.4 to 20.7 of the Conditions of
                    Contract, as well as on the effect of s 19 (in particular, s 19B) of
                    the IAA on the Interim Award, which is the subject matter of the present
                    appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The dispute resolution mechanism under the Conditions of
                Contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    The dispute resolution mechanism under the
                    Conditions of Contract is set out in the Majority Judgment at [5]–[6]
                    above. The material clauses are cll 20.4 to 20.7, in particular,
                    cll 20.4 and 20.6. In the context of these appeals, the dispute resolution
                    process under these clauses is as follows (the sub-clauses are indicated in
                    square brackets for ease of reference):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117-p2_a"></a>(a)     If “a dispute (of any kind
                        whatsoever)” arises between the parties “in connection with,
                        or arising out of, the Contract or the execution of the [w]orks
                        [thereunder]”, either party may refer the dispute in writing to the
                        DAB for its decision (see cl 20.4[1]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117-p2_b"></a>(b)     If the dispute is referred to the DAB, the
                        decision of the DAB “shall be binding on both Parties, who shall
                        promptly give effect to it unless and until it shall be revised in an
                        amicable settlement or an arbitral award” (see
                        cl 20.4[4]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117-p2_c"></a>(c)     Either party who is dissatisfied with the DAB’s decision may
                        issue a Notice of Dissatisfaction (“NOD”) to the other party
                        within 28 days after receiving the DAB’s decision. Except as stated in
                        cl 20.7 and cl 20.8, neither party is entitled to commence
                        arbitration of a dispute unless an NOD has been issued (see
                        cll 20.4[5]–20.4[6]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117-p2_d"></a>(d)     If no NOD has been issued by either party within the
                        stipulated time frame, then the DAB’s decision shall become
                        “final and binding” upon both parties (see
                        cl 20.4[7]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117-p2_e"></a>(e)     Where a DAB decision has become final and binding on the parties by
                        virtue of the fact that no NOD has been issued within the stipulated time
                        frame, and one party fails to comply with the DAB decision, the other party
                        may refer that failure to arbitration directly without the parties having to
                        first go through the steps set out in cll 20.4 and 20.5 (see
                        cl 20.7).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117-p2_f"></a>(f)     If an NOD is issued by either party, the parties must first attempt to
                        settle their differences amicably pursuant to cl 20.5 before commencing
                        arbitration under cl 20.6. Arbitration may only be commenced if no
                        amicable settlement is reached or no attempt at amicable settlement is made
                        after 56 days from the day on which the NOD was issued.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117-p2_g"></a>(g)     In the event that the parties do
                        proceed to arbitration under cl 20.6, the arbitral tribunal shall have,
                        in the arbitration, “full power to open up, review and revise
                        … any decision of the DAB … relevant to the dispute”.
                        In addition, the parties may, in the arbitration, put forward evidence and
                        arguments which were previously not presented to the DAB and/or not stated
                        in the NOD (see cll 20.6[2]–20.6[3]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    It can be seen from the above summary of the
                    material terms of the Conditions of Contract that the parties’ primary
                    dispute (as to the merits of DAB No 3) can be referred to arbitration under
                    cl 20.6 because that clause contains the arbitration agreement between the
                    parties. The scope of cl 20.6 is crucial to the determination of whether
                    the 2011 Majority Arbitrators had the mandate to issue the Interim Award pending
                    the 2011 Tribunal’s decision on the primary dispute. Whether they had the
                    requisite mandate depends on whether the secondary dispute (as defined by the
                    Judge in <em>Persero HC (2014)</em>) is referable to
                    arbitration under cl 20.6. If that dispute is not referable to arbitration,
                    there would have been no basis on which the 2011 Majority Arbitrators could have
                    issued the Interim Award. This is a contractual issue which turns on whether the
                    parties had vested the 2011 Tribunal with the power to make an interim award
                    ordering immediate enforcement of DAB No 3 pending the tribunal’s
                    determination of the primary dispute. This contractual issue includes the scope
                    of the 2011 Tribunal’s powers under the ICC Rules of Arbitration in force
                    as from 1 January 1998 (“the 1998 ICC Rules of Arbitration”)
                    and the IAA, as the parties agreed to arbitrate their disputes under the 1998
                    ICC Rules of Arbitration and the IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Chronology of the arbitral and enforcement proceedings relating to
                DAB No 3</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    On 20 November 2008, one day after the
                    DAB communicated its decision in DAB No 3 to the parties at a meeting on
                    19 November 2008, PGN issued an NOD in respect of DAB No 3 without
                    waiting for the DAB’s written grounds of decision, which were subsequently
                    released on 25 November 2008. PGN thereby became entitled (but was not
                    obliged) under cl 20.4[6] to commence arbitration under cl 20.6 to
                    resolve the parties’ primary dispute when the parties did not reach an
                    amicable settlement of that dispute within the time frame stated in
                    cl 20.5. However, PGN took no action to refer its dissatisfaction with DAB
                    No 3 to arbitration under cl 20.6, and at the same time, also took no
                    steps to comply with DAB No 3, contrary to what was required by
                    cl 20.4[4].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 2009 Arbitration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    PGN’s inaction forced CRW to take
                    steps to enforce payment of the Adjudicated Sum awarded under DAB No 3.
                    Clause 20.4[4] required PGN to “<em>promptly</em> give effect to [DAB No 3] unless and until it
                    shall be revised in an amicable settlement or an arbitral award”
                    [emphasis added]. Since neither of these outcomes had materialised, CRW was
                    entitled to payment by the terms of cl 20.4[4], and PGN’s failure to
                    pay CRW the Adjudicated Sum was clearly a breach of contract. There could be no
                    dispute whatsoever on this proposition of law. CRW was entitled to commence
                    court proceedings against PGN for breach of contract based on cl 20.4[4].
                    As PGN is an Indonesian company, CRW could have sued PGN in an Indonesian court
                    for payment of the Adjudicated Sum. Subject to any issue of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, CRW could also have commenced a similar
                    action in a Singapore court if PGN has assets in Singapore, and would in all
                    likelihood have been able to obtain summary judgment for the Adjudicated Sum,
                    subject to whatever defences and counterclaims PGN might have under Singapore
                    law (see [174] below]). However, for reasons best known to itself, CRW did not
                    commence court proceedings, and instead decided on 13 February 2009 to
                    enforce DAB No 3 by way of arbitration under the 1998 ICC Rules of
                    Arbitration pursuant to cl 20.6 of the Conditions of
                Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The parties’ respective positions in the 2009
                Arbitration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    In its notice of arbitration for the 2009
                    Arbitration, CRW sought a declaration that it was entitled to immediate payment
                    of the Adjudicated Sum awarded under DAB No 3 and an award for immediate
                    payment by PGN of that sum. CRW did not include the primary dispute in its
                    notice of arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    In response, PGN contended that the 2011
                    Tribunal should:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_122-p2_a"></a>(a)     dismiss CRW’s
                    claims;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_122-p2_b"></a>(b)     declare

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_122-p2_c"></a>(c)     declare

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_122-p2_d"></a>(d)     declare that PGN had not committed
                        any breach of obligation in not paying CRW the aforesaid
                    sum;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_122-p2_e"></a>(e)     open up,
                        review and revise DAB No 3 on the merits, and hear relevant witnesses
                        and experts to obtain information and evidence pertaining to the primary
                        dispute; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_122-p2_f"></a>(f)     order CRW to reimburse PGN’s costs and expenses arising out of the
                        arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    At a preliminary meeting with the parties on
                    1 June 2009, the 2009 Tribunal directed that the following two preliminary
                    issues be heard:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_123-p2_a"></a>(a)     Was CRW entitled to immediate
                        payment of the Adjudicated Sum awarded under DAB No 3
                        (“Question 1”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_123-p2_b"></a>(b)     Regardless of whether the answer to Question 1 was
                        yes or no, was PGN entitled to request the 2009 Tribunal to open up, review
                        and revise DAB No 3 or any other certificate on which it was based
                        (“Question 2”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Final Award by the 2009 Majority Arbitrators</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    It can be seen from the terms of
                    Question 1 that the answer to it was a foregone conclusion because the
                    answer was already spelt out by the express words of cl 20.4[4] (see
                    [117(b)] above). Clause 20.4[4] required the parties to “<em>promptly</em> give effect to [DAB No 3]”
                    [emphasis added]. There is no ambiguity in the words of cl 20.4[4]. The
                    2009 Majority Arbitrators so held, and added the rider that although PGN had an
                    obligation to make immediate payment of the Adjudicated Sum awarded to CRW under
                    DAB No 3, the DAB’s decision could be reviewed in an
                    arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    With regard to Question 2, the 2009
                    Majority Arbitrators held that since PGN had not served any counterclaim, its
                    contention that (<em>inter alia</em>) DAB No 3 should
                    be opened up, reviewed and revised was not a defence to CRW’s
                    claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    The 2009 Majority Arbitrators accordingly
                    issued an award which they described as a “final” award (<em>ie</em>, the Final Award as defined at [10] above of the
                    Majority Judgment) ordering PGN to pay CRW the Adjudicated Sum awarded under DAB
                    No 3, subject to PGN’s right to commence a new arbitration to open
                    up, review and revise DAB No 3. In substance, it would appear that the 2009
                    Majority Arbitrators intended the Final Award to be provisional in nature in
                    that it could be altered or revised in a new arbitration on the merits of DAB
                    No 3.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The first set of enforcement proceedings in the High Court –

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    CRW applied to the High Court by way of
                    Originating Summons No 7 of 2010 and obtained leave under s 19 of the
                    IAA to enforce the Final Award in the same manner as a judgment. PGN applied via
                    OS 206 to set aside the Final Award under s 24 of the IAA on the
                    following grounds:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_127-p2_a"></a>(a)     the 2009 Majority Arbitrators
                        exceeded their jurisdiction in converting DAB No 3 into a final award
                        without first determining the parties’ primary dispute on the
                        merits;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_127-p2_b"></a>(b)     the

                        of Contract, which required the 2009 Tribunal to determine the primary
                        dispute before DAB No 3 could be converted into a final
                    award;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_127-p2_c"></a>(c)     the 2009

                        parties’ respective arguments on the merits of the primary dispute was
                        a breach of natural justice; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_127-p2_d"></a>(d)     DAB No 3 was not made in accordance with the
                        Contract (including the Conditions of Contract) in that the DAB did not
                        apply Indonesian law, which was the governing law of the Contract, and/or
                        added new claims to those originally submitted by CRW, thereby
                        double-counting several claims which had previously been
                    settled.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The High Court’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    In the High Court, the OS 206 judge (as
                    defined at [12] of the Majority Judgment above) accepted PGN’s first
                    ground for challenging the Final Award and set aside the Final Award on that
                    basis (see <em>Persero HC (2010)</em>). However, she
                    rejected PGN’s other grounds for challenging the Final Award. The
                    OS 206 judge held as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_128-p2_a"></a>(a)     The “dispute” which
                        CRW wanted the 2009 Tribunal to resolve was “whether CRW was entitled
                        to <em>immediate</em> [payment] by PGN of the
                        [Adjudicated Sum] set out in [DAB No 3]” [emphasis in original]
                        (see <em>Persero HC (2010)</em> at [30]). This dispute,
                        which the OS 206 judge termed “the Second Dispute”, was
                        plainly outside the scope of cl 20.6 and was also not an issue which
                        had been referred to the DAB. The Final Award, which purported to decide
                        this “dispute”, therefore exceeded the scope of the
                        parties’ arbitration agreement (at [30] and [37]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_128-p2_b"></a>(b)     Clause 20.6 did not allow an
                        arbitral tribunal to make final a binding but non-final DAB decision
                            (<em>ie</em>, a DAB decision in respect of which an
                        NOD has been issued) without first hearing the parties’ submissions on
                        the merits of that DAB decision. The 2009 Tribunal’s powers under
                        cl 20.6 were expressly stated as being to “open up, review and
                        revise” DAB No 3, which meant that an adjudication on the Second
                        Dispute without determining the correctness of DAB No 3 would be
                        tantamount to converting that binding but non-final DAB decision into a
                        final arbitral award and ignoring the provisions of the Conditions of
                        Contract concerning dispute resolution (at [33]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>It should be noted that both of the above holdings by the
                        OS 206 judge concerned the jurisdiction of the 2009 Tribunal. I should
                        also point out that the Second Dispute (as defined by the OS 206 judge
                        in <em>Persero HC (2010)</em>) is the mirror image of
                        the secondary dispute (as defined by the Judge in <em>Persero
                            HC (2014)</em>). For simplicity, I shall hereafter, where
                        appropriate to the context, use the term “the enforceability
                        dispute” to refer interchangeably to the Second Dispute and the
                        secondary dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    The OS 206 judge’s holding at
                    [128(a)] above rests on the premise that the 2009 Tribunal had no jurisdiction
                    to decide the enforceability dispute as it should have been, but was not first
                    referred to the DAB under cl 20.4[1] for its decision. In my view, this
                    premise is not supported by the words of cl 20.4[1]. The enforceability
                    dispute is not a “dispute … in connection with, or arising out of,
                    the Contract or the execution of the [w]orks [thereunder]” for the
                    purposes of cl 20.4[1] as it arose upon the failure of PGN to comply with
                    DAB No 3 and has nothing to do with the Contract or the execution of the
                    works thereunder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    After deciding the enforceability dispute,
                    the OS 206 judge made certain observations (at [38] of <em>Persero HC (2010)</em>) as to how CRW could have enforced DAB
                    No 3 in an arbitration pursuant to cl 20.6:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I now come to the question posed in [15] above on what the
                        winning party can do, in the face of a valid NOD, to enforce a binding but
                        not final decision of the DAB when the other party fails to give prompt
                        effect to it as required by sub-cl 20.4 of the 1999 Red Book. Either
                        party may submit the dispute covered by the DAB decision in question to
                        arbitration if [an] NOD has been served. The losing party can ask the
                        arbitral tribunal to review and revise the DAB Decision. <em>Alternatively, the winning party can ask the arbitral tribunal to
                            review and confirm the DAB decision. It can include a claim for an
                            interim award</em> vis-à-vis <em>the DAB decision
                            to be enforced, with the amount owed as set out in the DAB decision to
                            be paid … accordingly.</em> The amount paid out is liable
                        to be returned to the payer, depending on how the tribunal, after reviewing
                        [the] DAB decision, decides the case. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    The OS 206 judge made the alternative
                    suggestion set out in italics in the above quotation after taking note of the
                    arbitral award in ICC Case No 10619, which a learned arbitrator,
                    Mr Christopher R Seppälä, had commented on favourably (see
                    [178]–[179] below). In my view, the logic of the alternative suggestion
                    is, with respect, problematic. If the enforceability dispute (<em>ie</em>, “whether CRW was entitled to <em>immediate</em> [payment] by PGN of the [Adjudicated Sum] set out in
                    [DAB No 3]” [emphasis in original] (see <em>Persero
                        HC (2010)</em> at [30])) was plainly outside the scope of
                    cl 20.6, how could it come within the scope of cl 20.6 (and, as a
                    consequence, be enforceable by an arbitral award) merely by referring the
                    parties’ primary dispute to arbitration under that clause?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Court of Appeal’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    CRW appealed against the OS 206
                    judge’s decision. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal (see <em>Persero CA</em>). The material holdings of the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Persero CA</em> are summarised below:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_132-p2_a"></a>(a)     A reference to arbitration under
                        cl 20.6 was in the form of a rehearing of the merits of a binding but
                        non-final DAB decision (at [66]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_132-p2_b"></a>(b)     Clause 20.6 required the parties to finally settle
                        their differences in the same arbitration, both in respect of the
                        non-compliance with the DAB decision concerned and in respect of the merits
                        of that decision. Clause 20.6 contemplated a single arbitration where
                        all the existing differences between the parties arising from the DAB
                        decision concerned would be resolved. In the arbitration, the respondent
                        could raise either a defence or a counterclaim against the claimant’s
                        claim (at [67]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_132-p2_c"></a>(c)     
            <em>What the 2009 Majority Arbitrators ought to have
                            done, in accordance with the Terms of Reference for the 2009 Arbitration
                            (and in particular, cl 20.6), was to make an interim award in
                            favour of CRW for the Adjudicated Sum awarded under DAB No 3 (or
                            for such other amount as the 2009 Majority Arbitrators deemed
                            appropriate) and then proceed to hear the parties’
                            “substantive dispute” afresh before making a final award
                            on that dispute</em> (at [79]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_132-p2_d"></a>(d)     The 2009 Majority Arbitrators did not have the
                        power under cl 20.6 to issue the Final Award in the manner that they
                        did, <em>ie</em>, without assessing the merits of
                        PGN’s defence and of DAB No 3 as a whole (at
                    [82]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_132-p2_e"></a>(e)     The failure
                        of the 2009 Majority Arbitrators to consider the merits of DAB No 3
                        before making the Final Award meant that they exceeded their jurisdiction in
                        making that award. PGN suffered real prejudice as a result of the decision
                        of the 2009 Majority Arbitrators (at [85]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_132-p2_f"></a>(f)     
            <em>There appeared to be a
                            settled practice, in arbitral proceedings brought under cl 20.6 of
                            the 1999 Red Book, for the arbitral tribunal to treat a binding but
                            non-final DAB decision as immediately enforceable by way of either an
                            interim or partial award pending the final resolution of the

                        (at [101]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    I pause here to observe that like the
                    OS 206 judge, the Court of Appeal, in holding that the 2009 Majority
                    Arbitrators could and should have made an interim award in favour of CRW
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> the enforceability dispute and then
                    proceed to hear the primary dispute afresh, referred to and expressly approved
                    of Mr Seppälä’s comments on the arbitral award in ICC Case
                    No 10619. It would seem that the authority or justification for the Court
                    of Appeal’s holding at [132(c)] above was the arbitral award in that ICC
                    case. I should also point out that the Court of Appeal’s statement at
                    [132(f)] above as to the “settled practice” in arbitral
                    proceedings under cl 20.6 of the 1999 Red Book is, as will be seen, not
                    supported by the practice of international arbitrators. It would appear that the
                    Court of Appeal justified that particular statement by reference to arbitration
                    cases supporting the approach taken in ICC Case No 10619, but not those
                    which do not support that approach. In any event, the scope of cl 20.6 of
                    the Conditions of Contract cannot be determined by “settled
                    practice”, but must instead be determined by the court on the basis of
                    what that clause states. A “settled practice” is only a factor to
                    be taken into account by the court in construing the scope of
                    cl 20.6.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 2011 Arbitration </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    Relying on the Court of Appeal’s
                    statements at [79] and [101] of <em>Persero CA</em>, CRW
                    referred both the primary dispute and the enforceability dispute to a second
                    arbitration under cl 20.6 on 28 October 2011 (<em>ie</em>, the 2011 Arbitration). This time, CRW sought, <em>inter alia</em>, a “partial or interim award”
                    for payment of the Adjudicated Sum awarded under DAB No 3, or such other
                    sum as might be found by the 2011 Tribunal to be appropriate pending its
                    resolution of the primary dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    At a preliminary meeting held on
                    2 March 2012, CRW made it clear to the 2011 Tribunal that: (a) it
                    would be relying on DAB No 3 as the basis of its application for an interim
                    award; and (b) in the event that it was unsuccessful in applying for an
                    interim award, it would still rely on DAB No 3 in seeking a final award,
                    and would not seek to open up, review or revise DAB No 3. In other words,
                    the inclusion of the primary dispute in CRW’s reference to arbitration was
                    merely a matter of form, notwithstanding that cl 20.6 required the 2011
                    Tribunal to open up and review the merits of DAB No 3.</p>

                    application for a preliminary hearing limited to the grant of an interim or
                    partial award as set out at [136(a)] above, with the relief set out at [136(b)]
                    above omitted from the application. The 2011 Majority Arbitrators noted at [38]
                    of the Interim Award that CRW had limited the basis of its claim for an interim
                    or partial award to “the enforcement of [DAB No 3], without
                    reviewing the merits of [DAB No 3]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    In response, PGN filed a counterclaim
                    disputing, <em>inter alia</em>: (a) the 2011
                    Tribunal’s jurisdiction to grant the partial or interim award sought by
                    CRW; and (b) the correctness of DAB No 3. PGN’s contentions are
                    set out in the Terms of Reference for the 2011 Arbitration as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">35.    [PGN] denies that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to
                            render a partial or interim award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">36.    The Tribunal has the power and duty to open up and
                            review [DAB No 3] upon the issuance of the Notice of
                            Dissatisfaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">37.    In so doing[,] the Tribunal has to adjudicate the
                            claims on the basis of the substantive merits of [the] claims in order
                            to render a Final Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">38.    … [CRW] has to establish the merits of its
                            substantive claim in this reference. [CRW] has provided no factual [or]
                            legal basis in support of the merits of its substantive claim in its
                            Request for Arbitration and [PGN] is not in a position to respond to it
                            accordingly. In the premises, the claim should be dismissed as lacking
                            in substantiation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">40.    Yet in the further alternative, by referring [DAB
                            No 3] to arbitration, [CRW] has by conduct recognised that [DAB
                            No 3] is no longer binding and the final entitlement of [CRW]
                            … has to be determined finally based on the merits of the
                            substantive claims … [and] the pleadings[.] [B]asis and
                            substantiation [are] lacking in the Request for Arbitration. The claim
                            should therefore be dismissed in its entirety.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">41.    … [DAB No 3] did not deal with all
                            [the] matters referred to the [DAB], failed to take into account
                            relevant facts and was not in accordance with Indonesian law. Further,
                            [DAB No 3] failed to give any proper reason contrary to
                            Clause 6 of the DAB Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">42.    [DAB No 3] also contained the following
                            errors [five were listed]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">44.    Based on the above,
                            [PGN] seeks the following reliefs:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    To dismiss [CRW’s] claims in the Request
                                for Arbitration in its entirety;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   To declare that [DAB No 3] shall be

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The parties’ arguments before the 2011 Tribunal</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   CRW’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    CRW’s arguments in support of its
                    claims before the 2011 Tribunal were essentially based on the statements of the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Persero CA</em> at [79] and [101]
                    –
                    <em>ie</em>, that CRW was entitled to an interim award
                    giving effect to DAB No 3 pending the final resolution of the
                    parties’ primary dispute so long as both the primary dispute and the
                    enforceability dispute were referred to an arbitral tribunal for hearing in the
                    same arbitration. CRW relied on a number of academic articles in support of the
                    Court of Appeal’s aforesaid statements in <em>Persero
                        CA</em>. However, it is not clear how those articles could have added
                    any weight to CRW’s case since the Court of Appeal’s statements were
                    themselves founded on those same articles. CRW also argued that the Court of
                    Appeal’s statements were part of the <em>ratio
                        decidendi</em> of its decision to dismiss CRW’s appeal in
                        <em>Persero CA</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   PGN’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    PGN relied on the arguments set out in the
                    extract from the Terms of Reference for the 2011 Arbitration quoted at [138]
                    above, and further argued that: (a) the IAA did not allow for a partial or
                    interim award of the nature sought by CRW; (b) the statements of the Court
                    of Appeal at [79] and [101] of <em>Persero CA</em> were
                        <em>obiter</em>; and (c) the academic articles
                    relied on by CRW did not address mandatory provisions of Singapore arbitration
                    law such as s 19B of the IAA as well as Indonesian law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Interim Award by the 2011 Majority Arbitrators</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    The 2011 Majority Arbitrators held in favour
                    of CRW. The dispositive part of the Interim Award stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">56.    Pending the final
                            resolution of the Parties’ dispute raised in these proceedings,
                            including the disputes which are set out in the [NOD], the majority of
                            the Tribunal declares that:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    upon the construction of Clause 20 of the
                                [Conditions of Contract], [DAB No 3] is binding on both Parties
                                who shall promptly give effect to it; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   [PGN] shall promptly pay the sum of
                                US$17,298,834.57 as set out in [DAB No 3].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    I pause here to note that except for the
                    addition of the words “[p]ending the final resolution of the
                    Parties’ dispute” and “promptly” in the Interim
                    Award, the terms of the payment order made in the Interim Award were almost
                    identical to the terms of the payment order made by the 2009 Majority
                    Arbitrators in the Final Award (see [65(vi)(II)] of the Final
                Award).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    The 2011 Majority Arbitrators gave the
                    following reasons for their decision to grant the Interim Award:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">44.    … [T]he entire purpose of [the DAB]
                            mechanism was to ensure the Contractor’s cashflow is not disrupted
                            by allowing him to be paid <u>in the
                            interim</u>, while the Employer’s right to challenge the
                            preliminary adjudication contained in the DAB decision is reserved until
                            the arbitration. To achieve that commercial purpose, the DAB Decision
                            (even where the NOD has been given by one Party) should be treated as
                            binding <u>in the interim</u> and enforceable
                            pending the final resolution in the arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">45.    … This would also give some meaning to the
                            “binding” effect of a DAB Decision, as otherwise it would
                            be meaningless. This construction [of cl 20.4] is supported by
                                [<em>Persero CA</em>], specifically at
                            paragraphs 63, 79 and 101…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">47.    …[H]aving regard to [<em>Persero CA</em>] as a whole, and in particular,
                            paragraphs 63 and 79 of [<em>Persero CA</em>],
                            paragraph 101 was part of the overall reasoning of
                            Clauses 20.4 to 20.6, and therefore forms part of the ratio
                            decidendi of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">49.    … [PGN] relies on section 19B of the
                            [IAA] to contend that Singapore legislation does not allow for the kind
                            of Interim Award or Partial Award … contemplated by [CRW].
                            [PGN’s] contention is that, since [DAB No 3] can be opened up
                            at the arbitration hearing, it is not “final” in the sense
                            contemplated in section 19B and an interim award cannot be issued.
                            …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">51.    The [majority of the 2011] Tribunal considers that
                            even though [DAB No 3] could be opened up at the arbitration
                            hearing, an award giving effect to it would still be final <u>up to a certain point in time</u>, i.e. pending the
                            resolution of the dispute in the arbitration. Put another way, the
                            decision is final as to the issue before the [2011] Tribunal, namely,
                            whether payment has to be made prior to the determination of the matter
                            raised in the NOD. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">52.    In other words, an interim award giving effect to
                            [DAB No 3] pending the resolution of the parties’ dispute is
                            still final in the sense that it will not and cannot be altered
                                <u>until the arbitration hearing</u>. While
                            the [majority of the 2011] Tribunal appreciates that the reasoning is
                            somewhat circular, the issue is whether to adopt a reasoning that better
                            fulfils the entire objective of the DAB provisions, or one that
                            essentially renders the DAB mechanism toothless. The [majority of the
                            2011] Tribunal feels the former is to be preferred.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">53.    It is also implicit in [<em>Persero
                                CA</em>] (the [Court of Appeal] must be presumed to have had
                            the provisions of the IAA in mind and yet raised no difficulty with
                            them) … that an interim or partial award to enforce [DAB
                            No 3], pending the resolution of the parties’ dispute in the
                            arbitration, would not fall foul of section 19B.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[underlining in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The dissenting opinion in the 2011 Arbitration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    The dissenting arbitrator in the 2011
                    Arbitration (“the 2011 Dissenting Arbitrator”) issued a dissenting
                    opinion stating (<em>inter alia</em>) the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.7    … [Section 19B(2) of the IAA] makes it
                            clear that once a Tribunal has made an award under [s 19A] of the
                            IAA, the effect of that award is clearly to be a final award which
                            cannot be varied, amended, corrected, reviewed, added to or revoked by a
                            subsequent award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.8    If an award issued by a tribunal would amount to a
                            final award under [s 19B(2)] of the IAA, it would mean that any
                            monetary award made in favour of [CRW] would be immediately enforceable
                            under the New York Convention [<em>ie</em>, the
                            Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral
                            Awards]. Any such award issued by the Tribunal now, would have to be
                            honoured by courts of a contracting state to the New York
                            Convention.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.9    [CRW’s] lawyers had in their letter to the
                            Tribunal dated 14 February 2013 suggested that the parties will
                            still need to address the merits of the claim in the final award, even
                            if [CRW] had already been rendered with an enforceable interim award
                            now. However, having obtained an enforceable award … that cannot
                            be varied or amended or revoked, [CRW] does have the right to go off to
                            a court of a New York Convention State to seek immediate enforcement [of
                            the] sum of US$17,298,834.57. There is no need and it would in fact be
                            illogical for a claimant who has a final award, to go back to the
                            Tribunal to have the merits heard, and to then make a finding of fact as
                            to whether or not there is a monetary claim due to the claimant. It
                            would be far more likely for any practical claimant to simply proceed
                            with enforcement proceedings as soon as it has obtained an interim
                            award, and not waste further time going off to a hearing to prove the
                            merits of its case on the evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.10  In addition to the clear and unambiguous wording

                                    practitioners have long assumed that the position is the same as
                                    well … Thus, clause 14</em> [which later
                                became s 14 of the International Arbitration (Amendment) Act
                                2001 (Act 38 of 2001)] <em>… amends the
                                    Act to state clearly that the position in Singapore for
                                    international arbitrations is that interim awards are final and

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.17  … Singapore legislation does not allow for

                            a final and binding award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.18  In this arbitration … [CRW] has clearly

                            sum of US$17,298,834.57, and not simply a declaration that [DAB
                            No 3] is binding, and should immediately be complied with. It is
                            likely that such a declaration would be a final award, which would not
                            contravene the IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.20  The fundamental problem … in this case is

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.26  Since all awards in Singapore are deemed to be

                            terminate these arbitration proceedings. It may be contended that the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.27  As the [Interim Award made by the 2011 Majority

                            the Court of Appeal in [<em>Persero CA</em>]. This
                            is because the [Interim Award] is a final award without going into the
                            merits of the case, and without hearing the evidence and submissions of
                            the Parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.28  The Court of Appeal had indeed made it very clear
                            that an arbitral tribunal is not entitled to issue a final award without
                            an examination of the merits of [DAB No 3]. The decision by the
                            [2011 Majority Arbitrators] would in fact contravene this ruling by the
                            Court of Appeal as they would in fact have issued a final award, without
                            examining the merits of [DAB No 3].</p>

                    disagreed with the 2011 Majority Arbitrators’ opinion that the statements
                    of the Court of Appeal at [79] and [101] of <em>Persero
                        CA</em> were part of the <em>ratio decidendi</em>
                    of its decision. He pointed out that: (a) the Court of Appeal did not refer
                    to s 19B of the IAA, and the parties did not argue the points mentioned at
                    [79] and [101] of <em>Persero CA</em> before the Court of
                    Appeal; and (b) the OS 206 judge also did not mention s 19B of

                    the Interim Award in the same manner as a Singapore judgment. Leave was granted

                    set aside the Interim Award. The Judge dismissed both SUM 3923 and

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The arguments and issues in SUM 3923 and OS 683</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   PGN’s arguments </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    Before the Judge, PGN’s principal
                    argument with regard to SUM 3923 and OS 683 was still that, as decided
                    by the Court of Appeal in <em>Persero CA</em>, CRW was not
                    entitled to enforce DAB No 3 by way of an interim award which was final and
                    binding without the 2011 Tribunal first determining the parties’ primary
                    dispute over the merits of DAB No 3. PGN’s arguments, as set out at
                    [16] of <em>Persero HC (2014)</em>, were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_147-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Interim Award was in substance
                        a provisional award because the 2011 Majority Arbitrators intended it to
                        have finality only up to the time the 2011 Tribunal determined the primary
                        dispute on the merits and with finality.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_147-p2_b"></a>(b)     The IAA did not permit a tribunal to issue a
                        provisional award. As a matter of form, s 2 of the IAA referred only to
                        “interim, interlocutory or partial award[s]” and made no
                        mention of provisional awards. As a matter of substance, and more
                        importantly, s 19B(1) of the IAA deemed every award which a
                        Singapore-seated arbitral tribunal issued – however it might be
                        described – to be final and binding. Furthermore, the legislative
                        history of s 19B showed an intent not to permit provisional
                        awards.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_147-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        2011 Tribunal therefore had no power to award CRW provisional relief as it
                        attempted to do in ordering, in the Interim Award, that “[p]ending
                        the final resolution of the Parties’ dispute … [PGN] shall
                        promptly pay the sum of US$17,298,834.57 as set out in [DAB
                        No 3]” to CRW.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_147-p2_d"></a>(d)     Section 19B(1) of the IAA deemed the Interim Award
                        to be a final and binding award. That overrode the 2011 Majority
                        Arbitrators’ intent that the Interim Award should have only
                        provisional effect. Further, under s 19B(2) of the IAA, no future award
                        made by the 2011 Tribunal could vary the Interim Award. The 2011 Majority
                        Arbitrators had therefore converted DAB No 3, which had only interim
                        finality under the Conditions of Contract, into an award which, under
                        s 19B of the IAA, was final and unalterable. The 2011 Majority
                        Arbitrators had therefore determined with finality the existence and extent
                        of PGN’s obligation to pay CRW. Further, they had done so without
                        determining or even considering the parties’ primary dispute on the
                        merits.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_147-p2_e"></a>(e)     The
                        primary dispute was founded on the very question that the 2011 Majority
                        Arbitrators had determined in the Interim Award, namely, the existence and
                        extent of PGN’s obligation to pay CRW. The Interim Award had therefore
                        inadvertently rendered the primary dispute <em>res
                            judicata</em>. This was contrary to the parties’ arbitration
                        agreement, which required an arbitral tribunal to hear the parties’
                        submissions on the primary dispute before determining that dispute on the
                        merits with finality and making it <em>res
                            judicata</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_147-p2_f"></a>(f)     In addition, having inadvertently rendered the primary
                        dispute <em>res judicata</em>, the 2011 Majority
                        Arbitrators had also rendered the 2011 Tribunal <em>functus
                            officio</em> on the issue of how much PGN actually had to pay CRW.
                        The 2011 Tribunal had no power to inquire any further into the primary
                        dispute to ascertain that amount. This was despite the 2011 Majority
                        Arbitrators’ express intention to go on to hear and determine
                        (together with the 2011 Dissenting Arbitrator) the primary dispute on the
                        merits and with finality in the 2011 Arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    On the basis of these arguments, PGN
                    contended that the Interim Award should be set aside for the following reasons,
                    as set out at [122] of <em>Persero HC (2014)</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_148-p2_a"></a>(a)     under Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iii) of the Model Law, because the 2011 Majority
                        Arbitrators had exceeded their mandate or jurisdiction in converting the
                        DAB’s binding but non-final decision in DAB No 3 into a final
                        award without determining the parties’ primary dispute on the merits;
                        and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_148-p2_b"></a>(b)     under
                            s 24(<em>b</em>) of the IAA, because the 2011
                        Majority Arbitrators had resolved the primary dispute with finality in
                        breach of the rules of natural justice by shutting out PGN’s case on
                        the merits of the primary dispute; and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_148-p2_c"></a>(c)     under Art 34(2)(<em>a</em>)(iv) of the Model Law, because the arbitral procedure was
                        not in accordance with the parties’ arbitration
                    agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   CRW’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    CRW’s submissions before the Judge, as
                    set out at [17] of <em>Persero HC (2014)</em>, were
                        (<em>inter alia</em>) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_149-p2_a"></a>(a)     CRW was correct to place both the
                        primary dispute and the enforceability dispute before the 2011 Tribunal and
                        to seek an interim award on the latter dispute. That approach was consistent
                        with the parties’ arbitration agreement as interpreted by the Court of
                        Appeal in <em>Persero CA</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_149-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Interim Award was not a
                        provisional award. It was a final and binding award as mandated by
                        s 19B(1) of the IAA, and would not be varied in breach of s 19B(2)
                        of the IAA by the final award to be made in the 2011 Arbitration. The
                        Interim Award was final and binding with regard to the enforceability
                        dispute pending the final resolution of the primary dispute. And the final
                        award in the 2011 Arbitration need not and would not vary the Interim Award
                        because it would determine with finality a different dispute – namely,
                        the primary dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_149-p2_c"></a>(c)     The 2011 Tribunal was not <em>functus
                            officio</em> because it had determined with finality only one of
                        the disputes placed before it – namely, the enforceability dispute
                        – expressly leaving the primary dispute to be heard and determined on
                        the merits and with finality in a future decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Judge’s decision in <span class="ToggleRoman" style="font-style:normal">Persero HC (2014)</span></p>

                            which could be taken to have cast doubt on that long-standing view. In
                            that decision, <em>Tang Boon Jek Jeffrey v Tan Poh Leng
                                Stanley [2001] 3 SLR 327</em> (“<em>Tang Boon Jek</em>”), the Court of Appeal held that an
                            arbitral tribunal under the IAA is not <em>functus
                                officio</em> on <b><em>any</em></b> aspect of
                            the dispute before it until it has determined <b><em>every</em></b> aspect of the dispute before it. Section 19B
                            makes clear that every award, whatever type of award it might be, is
                            final and binding on those aspects of the parties’ dispute which
                            that award determines.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">127    Section 19B, therefore, ensures that every award carries
                            preclusive effect on its subject-matter, regardless of what other
                            aspects of the dispute remain to be determined, and regardless of
                            whatever else that award might call itself. As the Court of Appeal put
                            it (<em>First Media</em> at [140]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">It can be seen from [the Minister’s] speech … that
                            Parliament’s intention to align the effect of interim awards with
                            that of final awards was driven by its object of providing that all
                            awards – interim and final – should reflect the principle of
                            finality. What this meant was that an award, once issued, was to be
                            final and conclusive as to the merits of the subject-matter determined
                            under that award; and it could thereafter only be altered in the limited
                            circumstances provided for in Arts 33 and 34(4) of the Model Law.
                            This is nothing more than another way of saying that the issues
                            determined under the award are <em>res
                                judicata</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">128    Subject only to that principle, it is my view that
                            s 19B does not prohibit a tribunal from issuing a provisional
                            award, at the very least in a case where (as here) the parties’
                            contract gives them a substantive, contractual right to provisional
                            relief. The IAA deals with the powers of a tribunal in making an award
                            in two sections: s 19A and s 19B. Neither section prohibits in
                            terms a tribunal from issuing a provisional award. Indeed, there is no
                            section of the IAA which in terms prohibits or permits a provisional
                            award. The IAA does not use the word “provisional” or the
                            term “provisional award” anywhere, in any
                        context.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">135    In my view, therefore, the explicit objective of
                            section 19B of the IAA is its sole objective. It serves <b><em>only</em></b> to confirm that every award, to be
                            properly called an award, must be final and binding on its
                            subject-matter. The impetus for that confirmation, as the LRRD
                                [<em>ie</em>, the Law Reform and Revision
                            Division of the Attorney-General’s Chambers] acknowledges in
                            paragraph 2.33.2 of its report [<em>ie</em>,
                            “Review of Arbitration Laws” (LRRD No 3/2001)], is to
                            dispel any uncertainty caused by <em>Tang Boon
                                Jek</em> (see [126] above). That is why the LRRD says in that
                            paragraph: “We believe that it is important to state clearly
                            … the position … that an award made and delivered in the
                            course of an arbitration is for the purposes of the issues decided
                            therein, final and binding between the parties”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">136    Section 19B therefore does not override the
                            parties’ autonomy to agree in their contract that they should have
                            substantive provisional rights which, like all substantive rights, are
                            enforceable. The only limitation imposed by s 19B is that an award
                            which enforces any such substantive right must preclude the parties from
                            revisiting the subject matter of that award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The [Interim Award] is final and binding on its
                            subject-matter</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">137    It is my view that
                            the [Interim Award] is final and binding on its subject-matter and
                            therefore complies with s 19B(1). The subject-matter of the
                            [Interim Award] is CRW’s undisputed substantive provisional right
                            to be paid now and PGN’s substantive obligation to argue only
                            later. In other words, the subject-matter of the [Interim Award] is the
                            secondary dispute. The [Interim Award] has thus determined <b><em>with finality </em></b> CRW’s substantive but
                            provisional right to be paid promptly, without having to wait for all
                            remaining aspects of the parties’ one dispute to be resolved with
                            finality. Section 19B of the IAA prevents the parties and the
                            tribunal from revisiting the secondary
                            dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">138    This view is
                            supported by a respected arbitration treatise. Gary Born adopts this
                            view in <em>International Commercial
                                Arbitration</em> (Kluwer Law International, 2009) at
                            p 2023:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The better view is that provisional measures should be and are
                            enforceable as arbitral awards under generally-applicable provisions for
                            the recognition and enforcement of awards. Provisional measures are
                            “final” in the sense that they dispose of a request for
                            relief pending the conclusion of the arbitration. Orders granting
                            provisional relief are meant to be complied with, and to be enforceable,
                            in the parties’ conduct outside the arbitral process; they are in
                            this respect different from interlocutory arbitral decisions that merely
                            decide certain subsidiary legal issues (e.g., choice of law, liability)
                            or establish procedural timetables. It is also highly important to the
                            efficacy of the arbitral process for national courts to be able to
                            enforce provisional measures. If this possibility does not exist, then
                            parties will be able to be significantly more willing to refuse to
                            comply with provisional relief, resulting in precisely the serious harm
                            that provisional measures were meant to foreclose.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">139    This view is also
                            consistent with the approach of the tribunal in ICC 10619, endorsed
                            by the Court of Appeal in [<em>Persero CA</em>]
                            … The facts of ICC 10619 are neatly summarised at [57] to
                            [61] of [<em>Persero CA</em>]. The contract in that
                            case contained provisions similar to cll 20.4 to 20.7 of the [1999]
                            Red Book, including the provision that interim adjudications should
                            carry interim finality. The contractor there obtained several interim
                            adjudications in its favour. The employer gave notice of its
                            dissatisfaction with those adjudications and failed to comply with them.
                            The contractor commenced an arbitration, raising both the primary and
                            the secondary dispute [the “secondary dispute” in the
                            context of ICC Case No 10619 being the dispute over the
                            employer’s failure to comply with the said interim
                            adjudications].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">140    The tribunal
                            in ICC 10619 issued an interim award to the contractor on the
                            secondary dispute. It justified its interim award on the basis that that
                            award merely gave effect to a substantive provisional right under the
                            parties’ contract. The tribunal adopted this contractual basis in
                            preference to a procedural basis arising under the applicable rules of
                            arbitration or under a feature of French law. That feature, known as the
                                <em>référé provision</em>, allows a claimant to
                            secure an award for interim payment even if there is no contractual
                            right to it, but only if it can show that its ultimate right to the
                            payment is not seriously disputable. As the tribunal said:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">22.    The question now arises as to whether and on
                                what legal basis this Tribunal may adjudicate the present dispute by
                                an interim award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">… [T]his Tribunal wishes to emphasize that neither the
                            provisions of Article 23 of the [1998] ICC Rules [of Arbitration]
                            nor the rules of the French [New Code of Civil Procedure] relating to
                            the <em>référé provision</em> are relevant. For one
                            thing, the judgement to be hereby made is not one of a conservatory or
                            interim nature, <em>stricto sensu</em>, but rather
                            one giving full immediate effect to a right that a party enjoys without
                            discussion on the basis of the [c]ontract and which the parties have
                            agreed shall extend at least until the end of the arbitration. For the
                            second thing, the will of the parties shall prevail over any
                            consideration of urgency or irreparable harm or <em>fumus
                                boni juris</em> which are among the basics of the French
                                <em>référé provision.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">141    Likewise, the [Interim Award] gives full immediate
                            effect to CRW’s substantive provisional right under the [1999] Red
                            Book to be paid now, pursuant to [DAB No 3] and without further
                            discussion, and which the parties agreed shall extend until the end of
                            the 2011 [A]rbitration. It is that substantive right, and nothing else,
                            which is the subject-matter of the [Interim Award]. The [Interim Award]
                            does nothing more than to give effect to the parties’ agreement
                            that PGN should “pay now and argue later”. And it does so,
                            as required by s 19B, with preclusive effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The [Interim Award] will not be
                        varied</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">142    Section 19B(2) puts it beyond the [2011
                            Tribunal’s] power in any future award to “vary, amend,
                            correct, review, add to or revoke” the [Interim Award]. That is
                            no cause for concern. The [2011 Tribunal] is perfectly able to dispose
                            of the primary dispute without breaching s 19B(2). The final award
                            will be drawn no differently than it would be if, in 2008, PGN had paid
                            CRW voluntarily under [DAB No 3] or if PGN had, under a
                            hypothetical contract which did not include a contractual security of
                            payment regime, made full payment to CRW under protest while validly
                            reserving all its rights to challenge CRW’s rights to receive the
                            payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">143    The [Interim Award], by its terms, ceases to be
                            effective when, and only when, the [2011 Tribunal] has resolved with
                            finality every aspect of the one dispute before it. The award or awards
                            which the [2011 Tribunal] will go on to issue to achieve that resolution
                            need not deal with the [Interim Award] in any way that is inconsistent
                            with s 19B(2). The [Interim Award] will simply, in accordance with
                            its terms, cease to have effect at that point in time. Further, the fact
                            that each of these future partial award[s] will be immediately
                            enforceable once issued is also not a concern. The [2011 Tribunal] can
                            easily address that issue by releasing a single final award or
                            collecting all partial awards for release together.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    In concluding his analysis, the Judge held
                    that even assuming that the IAA prohibited provisional awards (which he defined
                    (at [124] of <em>Persero HC (2014)</em> as “award[s]
                    granting relief which is intended to be effective for a limited period”),
                    the 2011 Tribunal could determine the parties’ primary dispute without
                    varying the Interim Award. At [151]–[154] of <em>Persero HC
                        (2014)</em>, the Judge explained:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">151    If the [2011 Tribunal] finds that the DAB was
                            correct in its decision, then the [2011 Tribunal] need do no more than
                            merely say so in its final award and stop there. The [Interim Award] and
                            the final award will stand together for enforcement. There is no breach
                            of the stricture in s 19B(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">152    If, on the other hand, the [2011 Tribunal] holds
                            that the DAB awarded CRW too little (assuming that such a holding is
                            open to the [2011 Tribunal] even though CRW has not served a notice of
                            its dissatisfaction), then the [2011 Tribunal] need do no more than make
                            that finding and order PGN to pay CRW the additional amount. Again, the
                            [Interim Award] and the final award will stand together for enforcement.
                            Again, there is no breach of the stricture in
                        s 19B(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">153    The only possible concern arises if the [2011
                            Tribunal] finds that the DAB awarded CRW too much. But in that
                            situation, the [2011 Tribunal] need do no more than make that finding
                            and issue a final award requiring CRW to return the excess. Once again,
                            the [Interim Award] and the final award will stand together for
                            enforcement. If PGN fails to comply with the [Interim Award] but
                            nevertheless attempts to recover under that final award, CRW can resist
                            that attempt simply by relying on the [Interim Award] by way of set-off.
                            That is expressly permitted by s 19B(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">154    In each of these three scenarios, and on the
                            assumption that s 19B does not permit an award whose effectiveness
                            is limited by time even if the parties’ contract gives them a
                            substantive right to that effect, the final award will undoubtedly have
                            to accommodate or take account of the [Interim Award]. But in none of
                            these scenarios does that necessarily involve the final award varying,
                            amending, correcting, reviewing, adding to or revoking the [Interim
                            Award] contrary to s 19B. The [Interim Award] and all future awards
                            (whether interim, partial or final) taken together, and after giving
                            effect to any set-off which arises between [the parties] (as
                            s 19B(1) expressly permits), will reflect the ultimate
                            determination of all aspects of the parties’ dispute and, in
                            particular, determine who is the ultimate debtor and the ultimate
                            creditor and to what extent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    At [129]–[134] of <em>Persero HC (2014)</em>, the Judge rejected PGN’s argument that
                    the legislative history of s 19B showed that the IAA did not permit
                    provisional awards:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">129    Mr Jeyaretnam [counsel for PGN] submits it is
                            by implication that a Singapore-seated tribunal lacks the power to issue
                            a provisional award. He relies on a report issued by the Law Reform and
                            Revision Division of the Singapore Attorney-General’s Chambers
                            (“the LRRD”) titled “<em>Review of
                                Arbitration Laws LRRD No 3/2001</em>”. This report
                            led to the amendments to the IAA in 2001 … which inserted
                            s 19A and s 19B into the IAA. Mr Jeyaretnam points to
                            paragraph 2.23.2 of this report and to the footnote to that
                            paragraph. Paragraph 2.23.2 says this: “The omission of the
                            expression ‘provisional awards’ … is deliberate as
                            the Bill contemplates that all awards enforcement of which is sought
                            (including interim and partial awards) are to be final in
                            nature”. In its footnote to the phrase “provisional
                            awards” in this same sentence, the LRRD says that it deliberately
                            chose not to adopt s 39 of the English Arbitration Act 1996
                            (c 23).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">132    I do not accept Mr Jeyaretnam’s
                            submission that the LRRD’s report shows a legislative intent not
                            to permit provisional awards. First, the LRRD made its comments on the
                            wording of s 19A of the IAA. That provision empowers a tribunal to
                            make different awards at different points in time on different aspects
                            of the matters that it has to determine. Therefore, when the LRRD refers
                            to its deliberate omission of the expression “provisional
                            awards” in s 19A, the LRRD is simply drawing attention to
                            the fact that any award, to be properly called an award, must carry
                            preclusive effect on its subject-matter. In that sense, it appears to me
                            that the LRRD was simply deprecating the <b><em>expression</em></b> “provisional award” rather than
                            the <b><em>concept</em></b> of an award which has
                            provisional effect, but which is also final and binding on its
                            subject-matter. That is not an oxymoron, as I will explain below. The
                            LRRD’s decision not to use the term “provisional
                            award” in s 19A of the IAA is to my mind a measure to avoid
                            confusing nomenclature rather than a measure to restrict the content of
                            an award, provided that the award has preclusive effect as required by
                            s 19B.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">133    Second, I cannot discern in these passages from
                            the LRRD’s report a legislative intent to regulate the content of
                                <b><em>awards</em></b>. It is true that the LRRD
                            states expressly in its footnote (see [129] above) that it decided not
                            to include in our IAA an equivalent to s 39 of the English Act. It
                            is also true that s 39 is headed “Power to make provisional
                                <b><em>awards</em></b>”. But the heading is
                            misleading. The subject-matter of s 39 is not provisional <b><em>awards</em></b> but provisional <b><em>orders</em></b>. What [s] 39 does is to empower an English
                            arbitral tribunal to grant relief by way of a provisional <b><em>order</em></b> if the parties have agreed that it should
                            have that power and if it could grant that same relief by way of a final
                                <b><em>award</em></b>. Section 39 is therefore
                            procedural in nature. It acknowledges and gives effect to the
                            parties’ freedom to agree [to] a procedural right to provisional
                            relief. It says nothing about the parties’ freedom to agree that
                            they should have by contract a substantive provisional right which is
                            capable in itself of being the subject-matter of an <b><em>award</em></b>. Thus the concluding proviso of s 39 makes it
                            clear that s 39 is entirely separate from an arbitral
                            tribunal’s power to make <b><em>awards</em></b> on
                            different aspects of the dispute before it at different times under the
                            English equivalent of s 19A. I cannot discern in this report an
                            intent to prohibit a Singapore-seated arbitral tribunal from issuing a
                            provisional <b><em>award</em></b>, at the very least if
                            the award is based on a substantive provisional right under the
                            parties’ contract, and if the award deals with that right with
                            preclusive effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">134    The flaw in Mr Jeyaretnam’s argument is
                            the assumption that an English tribunal has the power to issue an
                                <b><em>award</em></b> which determines its
                            subject-matter in such a way that it can be varied by a future award and
                            that the position in Singapore is consciously different. In fact, as the
                            Minister’s speech shows (see [126] above), English law and
                            Singapore law both mandate that an <b><em>award</em></b>
                            must be final and binding.</p>

                            Tribunal] receives PGN’s evidence and submissions under
                            cl 20.6[3] and resolves the primary dispute with finality. The only
                            thing that will change with time is that PGN’s obligation to pay
                            under the [Interim Award] comes to an end the moment the [2011 Tribunal]
                            disposes with finality of the last aspect of the one dispute before it.
                            All of this is so simply because all of this is what the parties agreed

                            relationship between the final award (or awards) and the [Interim Award]
                            is that the former supersedes the latter on one view (see [143] above)
                            or must accommodate the latter on another (see [154] above). In neither
                            case will the final award or awards <b><em>alter</em></b>

                            is what s 19B(1) mandates. But it is both final and binding only on
                            its subject matter: the <b><em>secondary</em></b>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">160    Fourth, the remaining determination which the

                            the matters it set out in its notice of dissatisfaction. It can invoke
                            cll 20.6[2] and cl 20.6[3] to invite the [2011 Tribunal] to open up

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>The [Interim Award] has no preclusive effect on the

</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">163    … [T]he result of s 19B deeming the
                            [Interim Award] to be final and binding accords entirely with the
                            parties’ contractual intention. Even if the IAA prohibits
                            provisional awards and even if the [2011 Majority Arbitrators have]
                            overreached by trying to issue a provisional award, the result of
                            s 19B operates only with regard to the secondary dispute. The
                            parties’ right to have the primary dispute determined on its
                            merits with finality, not being the subject-matter of the [Interim
                            Award], remains unaffected as provided for by their contract. Nothing in
                            the IAA stands in the way now of the [2011 Tribunal] resolving the
                            primary dispute on its merits and with finality.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>The merits of the primary dispute are not
                            </em></b>
<b>res judicata</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">164    It follows from the discussion above that the
                            primary dispute is not <em>res judicata</em>. The
                            [2011 Tribunal’s] final award will not revisit the subject-matter
                            of the [Interim Award].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">165    The correct analysis is that the [1999] Red
                            Book’s security of payment regime deliberately gives the
                            parties’ dispute two temporal aspects. A typical dispute can be
                            divided along topical lines. Section 19A of the IAA permits a
                            tribunal to issue a series of interim or partial awards on each of these
                            topics. Each award in that series is both final and binding on its
                            subject-matter. It is no different where the parties’ contract
                            permits the tribunal to divide the one dispute before it on temporal
                            lines. The true distinction between the primary dispute and the
                            secondary dispute is not topical but temporal: argue <b><em>later</em></b>, pay <b><em>now</em></b>. If the
                            parties have agreed that their dispute can be divided in that manner,
                            into two temporal aspects, s 19A of the IAA allows the tribunal to
                            give full effect to the parties’ agreement and decide each
                            temporal aspect separately and by separate awards, each of which is
                            final, binding and enforceable on its subject matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">166    The [Interim Award] is solely concerned with the
                            secondary dispute: how much PGN should pay now. When the [2011 Tribunal]
                            eventually considers the primary dispute, and hears the parties
                            “argue later”, it will determine the rights and
                            obligations of the parties on all other aspects, temporal and topical,
                            of the parties’ one dispute. It will do so based on different
                            contractual provisions, different evidence, different submissions of law
                            and at a different point in time. That does not restrict the [2011
                            Tribunal’s] freedom to conduct the full inquiry into the primary
                            dispute which the parties’ agreement envisages and

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the enforceability dispute was referable to arbitration under

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Clause 20.6 of the Conditions of Contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    Whether an interim award may be issued to
                    enforce DAB No 3 pending the 2011 Tribunal’s adjudication on the
                    parties’ primary dispute turns on an interpretation of the words of
                    cl 20.6 of the Conditions of Contract to determine its ambit. As mentioned
                    earlier, cl 20.6 constitutes the arbitration agreement between the parties
                    as there is no other clause in the Conditions of Contract that provides for
                    arbitration of any dispute between the parties. Although cl 20.7 provides
                    for arbitration upon the failure of a party to comply with a final and binding
                    DAB decision, the arbitration still takes place pursuant to cl 20.6. Before
                    I consider the scope of cl 20.6, it is necessary to note that
                    cl 20.4[6] provides that neither party shall be entitled to commence
                    arbitration of a dispute unless an NOD has been issued in accordance with
                    cl 20.4, or unless either cl 20.7 or cl 20.8 applies. In the
                    present case, PGN served an NOD, and therefore, either PGN or CRW was entitled
                    (subject to compliance with cl 20.5) to commence arbitration of the dispute
                    contemplated by cl 20.4[6].</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    It bears reiteration that cl 20.6
                    constitutes the arbitration agreement between the parties. The crucial words in
                    cl 20.6 that delineate the kind of dispute that may be referred to
                    arbitration are the opening words of cl 20.6[1], namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Unless settled amicably, any dispute in respect of which the DAB’s
                        decision (if any) has not become final and binding shall be finally settled
                        by international arbitration. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Clause 20.6 is applicable only to what I shall term
                        (where appropriate to the context) a “cl 20.6 dispute”
                        –
                        <em>ie</em>, a dispute in respect of which:
                        (a) the DAB decision concerned “has not become final and
                        binding” as an NOD has been issued; and (b) no amicable
                        settlement has been reached. DAB No 3 is such a DAB decision as PGN
                        issued an NOD in respect of that decision and no amicable settlement was
                        reached between the parties. Clause 20.6 also provides that such a
                        dispute shall be “finally settled by international
                        arbitration”. What then is the cl 20.6 dispute in relation to
                        DAB No 3 that is to be finally settled by international
                        arbitration?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    In my view, the cl 20.6 dispute in
                    relation to DAB No 3 which is to be finally settled by international
                    arbitration is the primary dispute between the parties, <em>ie</em>, the dispute as to whether DAB No 3 was a correct
                    adjudication. The words “finally settled” can only apply to the
                    merits of DAB No 3, <em>ie</em>, whether that DAB
                    decision was correct. They are only applicable to the primary dispute. They are
                    not intended to and cannot apply to the enforceability dispute (<em>ie</em>, whether DAB No 3 is enforceable by an arbitral
                    award pending the determination of the primary dispute on the merits) because of
                    the preceding qualifying words “[u]nless settled amicably” in
                    cl 20.6[1]. These words refer back to cl 20.5, which requires the
                    parties to try to settle their dispute amicably, failing which the dispute
                    “shall be finally settled by international arbitration”. These
                    words are predicated on a dispute that can be settled amicably. On the facts of
                    the present case, the “amicable settlement” requirement can only
                    relate to the primary dispute as to whether or not DAB No 3 was a correct
                    adjudication. That dispute is a factual dispute which PGN and CRW can resolve
                    amicably as it concerns the quantum of CRW’s claims against PGN. The
                    “amicable settlement” requirement cannot relate to the
                    enforceability dispute because that is a dispute on what the law is. A dispute
                    on the law is intended to be settled by a tribunal or a court. Of course, it can
                    be argued that even the legal dispute in the present case (<em>ie</em>, the enforceability dispute) can be settled amicably between
                    the parties either by PGN agreeing to promptly pay CRW the Adjudicated Sum
                    awarded under DAB No 3 pending an arbitral award on the primary dispute, or
                    by CRW agreeing not to enforce DAB No 3 until the arbitration of the
                    primary dispute has been completed. But, as I have just explained, this is not
                    the kind of dispute contemplated by cl 20.6 because of the use of the words
                    “shall be finally settled by international arbitration” in
                    relation to a dispute which is not settled amicably. Those words, in my view,
                    can only refer to a factual dispute such as the parties’ primary dispute.
                    To reiterate, a dispute over a question of law cannot be settled amicably in the
                    context of cl 20.6 –
                    <em>ie</em>, PGN and CRW cannot settle among themselves
                    whether, as a matter of law, DAB No 3 is enforceable by an interim award
                    pending the resolution of the primary dispute by arbitration. That dispute
                        (<em>viz</em>, the enforceability dispute) can only be
                    decided by a tribunal or a court. The concept of amicable settlement in
                    cll 20.4 and 20.5 is meant for factual disputes, and not legal disputes
                    such as the enforceability dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    Furthermore, cl 20.4[6] makes it clear
                    that a dispute which a party is entitled to refer to arbitration is a dispute in
                    respect of which an NOD has been issued, <em>ie</em>, a
                    dispute as to the correctness of the DAB’s adjudication on the
                    claimant’s claims. In the present case, the subject matter of PGN’s
                    NOD in respect of DAB No 3 was precisely the correctness of the DAB’s
                    determination of the quantum of CRW’s claims, and not the issue of whether
                    or not PGN had to promptly comply with DAB No 3 pending an arbitral award
                    on the correctness of DAB No 3. Clause 20.4 does not make any
                    provision for a dispute as to the <em>enforceability</em>
                    of DAB No 3 to be settled by arbitration because under this clause, PGN and
                    CRW are already required to “<em>promptly give effect
                        to</em> [DAB No 3] unless and until it shall be revised in an
                    amicable settlement or an arbitral award” [emphasis added]. In other
                    words, pursuant to cl 20.4, DAB No 3 is already enforceable unless and
                    until it is revised by an amicable settlement or an arbitral
                award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    For these reasons, in the present case,
                    arbitration under cl 20.6 is limited to arbitration of the primary dispute
                    between the parties. The enforceability dispute is not a cl 20.6 dispute
                    and does not fall within the scope of cl 20.6 of the Conditions of
                    Contract. Hence, the 2011 Tribunal had no mandate to determine any dispute other
                    than the primary dispute; it therefore had no jurisdiction or power to grant, in
                    relation to the enforceability dispute, an interim award ordering the
                    enforcement of DAB No 3 pending its resolution of the primary
                    dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    This conclusion does not detract from the
                    meaning and effect of cl 20.4, and is consistent with it. For CRW to be
                    able to refer the enforceability dispute to arbitration, there has to be a
                    dispute between CRW and PGN in relation to PGN’s <em>obligation</em> to <em>promptly</em> comply with
                    DAB No 3 pending an arbitral award on the correctness of that DAB decision.
                    As I have stated earlier, there can be no such dispute for the simple reason
                    that cl 20.4[4] expressly provides that PGN (as well as CRW)
                        “<em>shall promptly</em> give effect to [DAB
                    No 3] unless and until it shall be revised in an amicable settlement or an
                    arbitral award” [emphasis added]. In the present case, there has been
                    neither an amicable settlement of nor an arbitral award on the parties’
                    primary dispute over the merits of DAB No 3. In the 2011 Arbitration,
                    unlike in the 2009 Arbitration, PGN did not dispute that it had an obligation
                    under cl 20.4 to comply with DAB No 3. Instead, it took the position
                    that there was effectively no dispute between the parties that could be referred
                    to arbitration under cl 20.6 –
                    <em>ie</em>, there was in effect no referable dispute
                    between the parties as to PGN’s obligation to promptly comply with DAB
                    No 3 pending the determination of the primary dispute on the merits. Since
                    there was, in relation to the enforceability dispute, no dispute that could be
                    referred to arbitration, there was no legal basis for the exercise of any power
                    vested in the 2011 Tribunal (assuming it had such a power) to make an interim
                    award in respect of that dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    In this connection, Prof Nael
                    G Bunni pointed out in his article “The Gap in Sub-Clause 20.7
                    of the 1999 FIDIC Contracts for Major Work” [2005] ICLR 272
                    (“Prof Bunni’s article”) that cl 20 of the 1999
                    Red Book did not expressly confer a right on a winning party to refer to
                    arbitration the losing party’s failure to comply with a binding but
                    non-final DAB decision. He noted that “there is no solution offered
                    within cl 20 other than simply treating the non-compliant party as being in
                    breach of contract” (at p 272). Prof Bunni suggested that
                    cll 20.6 and 20.7 be amended so as to allow relief by way of arbitration
                    regardless of whether or not an NOD had been filed and whether or not the DAB
                    decision in question had become final. In my view, Prof Bunni is correct in
                    stating that there is a gap in cl 20 of the 1999 Red Book in that it does
                    not provide for arbitration to enforce a binding but non-final DAB decision.
                    But, as will be seen, this gap is not accidental. In my view, arbitration was
                    deliberately omitted as a means to enforce such a DAB decision as it was not
                    necessary in the legal environment in which the predecessor of cl 20
                        (<em>viz</em>, cl 67 of the 1987 Red Book)
                    operated (see [166]–[170] below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Comparison of cl 20.6 and cl 20.7</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    Clause 20.6 may be contrasted with
                    cl 20.7, which is only applicable to a DAB decision that has become final
                    and binding. Under cl 20.7, a failure to comply with such a DAB decision
                    may be directly referred to arbitration under cl 20.6 without the parties
                    having to first go through the steps set out in cll 20.4 and 20.5. As a
                    failure to comply with a final and binding DAB decision is a question of fact,
                    the issuance of a final award under cl 20.7 would normally be a formality.
                    In <em>Persero CA</em>, the Court of Appeal held at [55]

                        cll 20.6 and 20.7 would, reasonably, come to the same conclusion. In my
                        view, this interpretation is correct. However, after making the aforesaid
                        statement, the Court of Appeal then stated (without considering the
                        inconsistency with its finding of “no immediate recourse” at
                        [55] of <em>Persero CA</em>) that the aggrieved party
                        in the above scenario could have immediate recourse to enforce a binding but
                        non-final DAB decision merely by referring the parties’ substantive
                        dispute over the merits of that DAB decision to arbitration under
                        cl 20.6 and seeking, in that arbitration, an interim award ordering
                        enforcement of that DAB decision pending the tribunal’s decision on
                        its merits (see <em>Persero CA</em> at [63], [66] and
                        [67]). The Court of Appeal did not explain why, if the dispute over a
                        party’s non-compliance with a binding but non-final DAB decision could
                        not be referred to arbitration on its own, it could be the subject matter of
                        an interim award if the parties’ substantive dispute over the merits
                        of that DAB decision were referred to arbitration under
                    cl 20.6.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    Leaving this point aside, Mr Seppälä
                    has criticised the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>Persero CA</em> for implying from the wording of cl 20.7 that a
                    failure to comply with a binding but <em>non-final</em> DAB
                    decision cannot be directly referred to arbitration without the parties first
                    going through the steps set out in cll 20.4 and 20.5. In his article
                    “How Not To Interpret the FIDIC Disputes Clause: The Singapore Court of
                    Appeal Judgment in Persero” [2012] ICLR 4, he disclosed that he was the
                    drafter of the predecessor of cl 20.7 of the 1999 Red Book, namely,
                    cl 67.4, which was inserted in the 1987 Red Book (the fourth edition of the
                    Red Book). Clause 67.4 was inserted for a limited purpose – to fill
                    the gap in the pre-1987 editions of the Red Book, which did not provide for a
                    remedy where there was non-compliance with a DAB decision that had become
                        <em>final and binding</em>. In tracing the history of
                    cl 20.7 in his article “Sub-Clause 20.7 of the FIDIC Red Book
                    does not justify denying enforcement of a ‘binding’ DAB
                    decision” (2011) 6(3) CLInt 17 (also referred to hereafter as
                    Mr Seppälä’s “2011 article” where appropriate to the
                    context), Mr Seppälä wrote (at p 20):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">From this brief excursion into the history of the disputes clause in the
                        FIDIC Red Book, it can be seen that Sub-Clause 67.4, of which
                        Sub-Clause 20.7 is the successor, was simply put into the [1987 Red
                        Book] … to ensure that, where a party had failed to comply with a
                        final and binding decision, such failure could be referred to arbitration.
                        Nothing was intended to be implied about merely a ‘binding’
                        decision, as it was obvious – or so it was thought at the time –
                        that such a decision, together with the dispute underlying it, could be
                        referred to arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    Given its origin, Mr Seppälä is
                    justified in stating that cl 20.7 was not intended to be interpreted in the
                    way that the Court of Appeal did in <em>Persero CA</em>.
                    Although this point is well taken, it also gives rise to an equally pertinent
                    point, which is that Mr Seppälä did not consider why cl 67.4 was not
                    added to the Red Book until 1987. There must be a reason – after all, as
                    at 1987, the Red Book, which was first published in 1957, had already been used
                    industry-wide for many decades. A logical reason would be that, if
                    cl 67.4/cl 20.7 was not inserted for such a long time, it was because
                    there was no necessity for it. Indeed, in tracing the origin of cl 20.7 in
                    his 2011 article, Mr Seppälä has also shown this to be the case –
                    why, historically, there was no provision in the nature of cl 20.7 of the
                    1999 Red Book until cl 67.4 was inserted in the 1987 Red Book. At
                    pp 18–19 of his 2011 article, he wrote:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As regards arbitration, Clause 67 of the [1977 Red Book (as defined
                        at [80] of the Majority Judgment above)] had provided that disputes or
                        differences in respect of which the decision of the Engineer <b><em>had not become ‘final and binding’</em></b>
                        – because a party had expressed dissatisfaction with the decision

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The problem had, doubtless, arisen because, as is well
                            known, the first edition of the FIDIC Red Book published in 1957 had
                            been based closely on a UK domestic form of contract (the ICE
                            Conditions) and, under English law (at least at that time), where a debt
                            was ‘indisputably due’ from a debtor in England, relatively
                            speedy summary judgment was available from the English courts. There
                            would be no need for, or advantage in, submitting the matter to
                            arbitration. Therefore, apparently, for that reason, arbitration was not
                            provided for in that case in the Red Book</em>, just as it had not
                        been provided for in that case in the relevant UK form of contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    In my view, this passage confirms that there
                    was no necessity for cl 67.4/cl 20.7 in the very first version of the
                    Red Book published in 1957 (“the 1957 Red Book”) because the ICE
                    Conditions, upon which it was based, operated in the context of a judicial
                    system (English) that provided a cheaper and faster mode of enforcement in the
                    form of summary judgment. The dispute resolution provisions in the 1957 Red Book
                    were good enough for the UK building and construction industry at that time.
                    There was no need for an alternative method of dispute resolution in the form of
                    arbitration to settle undisputed and undisputable monetary claims. At p 19
                    of his 2011 article, Mr Seppälä wrote:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Evidently, when the Red Book had originally been prepared, the draftsmen
                        had failed to note that, in the case of an international construction
                        project, the Contractor would almost certainly not want to go into a local
                        court, which would typically be in a developing country, because the local
                        court often could not, or would not, grant the desired relief. As a result,
                        no satisfactory remedy was available in the [1977 Red Book] where, in the
                        case of such a project, a party, typically the Employer, had failed to
                        comply with a final and binding decision of the Engineer under
                        Clause 67.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    In 1957, international arbitration was not
                    likely to have been foremost in the minds of the drafters of the Red Book. It
                    was only in 1975 that the UK became a signatory to the Convention on the
                    Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (more commonly known as
                    “the New York Convention”). It is therefore not unexpected that no
                    steps were taken to provide the alternative remedy of an arbitral award for
                    building and construction claims which were undisputed and undisputable. An
                    architect’s or an engineer’s certificate, whether interim (<em>ie</em>, binding but non-conclusive) or final (<em>ie</em>, binding and conclusive), was good enough for all
                    practical purposes for enforcement by way of court proceedings, as opposed to
                    arbitral proceedings. As Lord Denning MR noted in <em>Dawnays Ltd v F G Minter Ltd and Trollope and Colls
                        Ltd</em> [1971] 1 WLR 1205 (“<em>Dawnays</em>”) at
                        1209–1210:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… An interim certificate is to be regarded virtually as cash, like
                        a bill of exchange. It must be honoured. Payment must not be withheld on
                        account of cross-claims, whether good or bad – except so far as the
                        contract specifically provides. Otherwise any main contractor could always
                        get out of payment by making all sorts of unfounded cross-claims. All the
                        more so in a case like the present, when the main contractors have actually
                        received the money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    While Mr Seppälä’s explanation of
                    the origin of cl 20.7 supports his argument that no inference as to the
                    scope of the disputes referable to arbitration under cl 20.6 should be
                    drawn from the <em>insertion</em> of cl 20.7 in the
                    Red Book (in the form of cl 67.4 of the 1987 Red Book), in my view, an
                    inference may reasonably be drawn from the <em>long
                        absence</em> of cl 20.7 until 1987, namely, that disputes over
                    non-compliance with binding but non-final DAB decisions were not intended to be
                    referable to arbitration. When the Red Book was first published in 1957,
                    enforcement by an arbitral award of a DAB decision that had become final and
                    binding (<em>ie</em>, where no NOD had been issued by
                    either party) was unnecessary, or considered unnecessary, because there was a
                    faster and cheaper way to enforce such a DAB decision – namely, by way of
                    summary judgment in court proceedings. If an arbitral award were essential for
                    enforcement purposes, FIDIC would surely have inserted cl 20.7 in the Red
                    Book a long time ago. Clause 20.7 became necessary or useful only when the
                    Red Book was adopted for international building and construction contracts in
                    foreign jurisdictions, where disputants might not wish to settle their disputes
                    in “local” courts (as explained by Mr Seppälä at p 19 of
                    his 2011 article). And indeed, cl 20.7 was inserted only in 1987 (in the
                    form of cl 67.4 of the 1987 Red Book) after Mr Seppälä had drawn
                    attention to its desirability in cases where the Red Book was used in
                    international building and construction contracts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    It may also be noted that a binding but
                    non-final DAB decision is similar to an architect’s or an engineer’s
                    interim certificate of payment, in that both the former and the latter provide
                    for interim finality against the party that is required to make payment
                    (typically the employer). Clause 67 of the 1987 Red Book provides for an
                    engineer’s certificate. Clause 20.4 of the 1999 Red Book has merely
                    substituted the DAB for the engineer to adjudicate disputes arising from the
                    contract in question or the execution of the works thereunder. A claim based on
                    a binding but non-final DAB decision is not a claim for damages, but a claim for
                    payment of the sum certified by the DAB as being payable. Such a claim (and
                    likewise, a claim based on an architect’s or an engineer’s interim
                    certificate of payment) may be enforced by summary judgment in court
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    In my view, therefore, the Court of
                    Appeal’s conclusion in <em>Persero CA</em> –
                    <em>viz</em>, that the enforceability of DAB No 3
                    pending the 2009 Tribunal’s determination of the parties’ primary
                    dispute over the merits of that DAB decision was not an arbitrable matter within
                    the scope of cl 20.6 – was correct, but for the wrong reason (namely,
                    that it was implicit from the scope of cl 20.7, which applied only to
                    binding and <em>final</em> DAB decisions).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    Mr Seppälä’s explanation for the
                    absence of cl 20.7 from the Red Book until 1987 is also equally relevant
                    and pertinent in explaining why cl 20.6 was, from its inception, drafted to
                    be applicable only to a cl 20.6 dispute (as defined at [159] above), and
                    not to a dispute in the nature of the enforceability dispute. As I have just
                    mentioned at [171] above, a binding but non-final DAB decision is akin to an
                    architect’s or an engineer’s interim certificate of payment under
                    standard building and construction contracts in England and Singapore. In the
                    1999 Red Book, the DAB is merely substituted for the engineer as the adjudicator
                    under cl 20.4[1] to adjudicate disputes relating to the contract in
                    question or the execution of the works thereunder. An engineer’s or an
                    architect’s interim certificate entitles the contractor to commence court
                    proceedings for summary judgment on the basis of the certificate, subject to
                    established legal rights such as the right of set-off (among other defences) and
                    counterclaims (see <em>Dawnays</em> and also [188] below).
                    Employers and contractors who adopt the 1999 Red Book to govern their
                    contractual relationship may reasonably be assumed to know the purpose of
                    cl 20, and to have agreed to the limited scope of cl 20.6 as
                    originally intended by the drafters of the Red Book.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    To reiterate, when the Red Book was first
                    introduced in 1957, it was unnecessary to rely on arbitration to enforce an
                    engineer’s interim certificate of payment (the then equivalent of a
                    binding but non-final DAB decision) as the ordinary judicial process at that
                    time could provide a speedier and cheaper remedy. No doubt, suing in court might
                    have some disadvantages, in that the losing party could plead a defence of
                        (<em>inter alia</em>) set-off or a counterclaim. But,
                    absent such a defence or counterclaim, the winning party would be entitled to
                    judgment based on the engineer’s interim certificate on a summary basis.
                    That was the judicial regime upon which the conditions of contract in the 1957
                    Red Book, and in particular, the scope of the then equivalent of cl 20.6,
                    were predicated. Singapore has a similar, if not more liberal, judicial regime
                    in relation to the Singapore Institute of Architects’ standard form of
                    contract (see <em>China Construction (South Pacific) Development
                        Co Pte Ltd v Leisure Park (Singapore) Pte Ltd</em> [1999]

                    contractor is entitled to summary judgment on an architect’s certificate
                    in the absence of fraud or improper pressure (see <em>GTMS

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    With respect, the 2009 Majority Arbitrators,
                    the 2011 Majority Arbitrators, the OS 206 judge in <em>Persero HC (2010)</em> and the Court of Appeal in <em>Persero CA</em> did not undertake a textual, contextual, historical
                    or purposive analysis of cl 20.6. Both the OS 206 judge in <em>Persero HC (2010)</em> and the Court of Appeal in <em>Persero CA</em> provided no explanation for their assumption
                    that if the parties’ primary dispute over the merits of DAB No 3 were
                    referred to arbitration under cl 20.6, the 2009 Tribunal would have the
                    requisite jurisdiction to order the immediate enforcement of DAB No 3 by
                    issuing an interim award to that effect <em>vis-à-vis</em>
                    the enforceability dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    In the court below, the Judge devoted a
                    considerable part of his written grounds of decision in <em>Persero HC (2014)</em> to analysing the scope of cl 20.6. At
                    [38], he held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [Clause] 20.6 is drafted to resolve the <em>primary</em> dispute and not to resolve the <em>secondary</em> dispute. In other words, cl 20.6 is drafted
                        only to enable the employer to “argue <em>now</em>”. It is not drafted to enable the contractor to
                        compel the employer to “pay now and argue <em>later”</em>. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>At [49], the Judge reiterated his finding that
                        “cl 20.6 is drafted only with determination <em>with finality</em> in mind and even then only of the <em>primary</em> dispute” [emphasis in original].
                        Having made these findings, the Judge, instead of logically following
                        through to hold that cl 20.6 did <em>not</em>
                        support the assumption of the OS 206 judge in <em>Persero HC (2010)</em> and the Court of Appeal in <em>Persero CA</em> (<em>viz</em>, that
                        if the parties’ primary dispute had been referred to the 2009
                        Tribunal, the enforceability dispute could have been placed before the
                        tribunal as well on the back of that reference), held – inconsistently
                        with his own findings – that that assumption was correct in law. He
                        then proceeded to consider the application of ss 19A and 19B of the IAA
                        to the Interim Award, and held that the award had been accorded preclusive
                        effect by s 19B on the basis that the enforceability dispute was within
                        the mandate of the 2011 Tribunal under cl 20.6.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">ICC Case No 10619</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    In coming to the conclusion that the 2011
                    Majority Arbitrators had the jurisdiction or power to issue the Interim Award,
                    the Judge also relied on the arbitral award in ICC Case No 10619 as part of
                    his reasoning. I shall now examine this arbitration case (with the caveat that
                    the decision of an arbitral tribunal has no precedent value whatsoever in a
                    court of law).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    The arbitral award in ICC Case
                    No 10619, which concerned the scope of an arbitral tribunal’s powers
                    under cl 67.4 of the 1987 Red Book, provided the foundation for the
                    suggestion of the OS 206 judge in <em>Persero HC
                        (2010)</em> and the Court of Appeal in <em>Persero
                        CA</em> that in the 2009 Arbitration, CRW should have first referred
                    the parties’ primary dispute to arbitration and then sought, in relation
                    to the enforceability dispute, an interim award in the same arbitration for
                    immediate payment of the Adjudicated Sum awarded under DAB No 3. The Court
                    of Appeal expressly endorsed (at [63] of <em>Persero
                        CA</em>) the views expressed by Mr Seppälä on the arbitral award
                    in ICC Case No 10619 in his article “Enforcement by an Arbitral
                    Award of a Binding but not Final Engineer’s or DAB’s decision under
                    the FIDIC Conditions” [2009] ICLR 414. In that article, Mr Seppälä
                    stated that the arbitral tribunal in ICC Case No 10619 (at
                    p 424):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… perfectly understood the way clause 67 of the [1987 Red
                        Book] is to function and its decision to order payment of the
                        engineer’s decisions by way of an interim award, notwithstanding the
                        contractor’s earlier notice of dissatisfaction, accords fully with the
                        intention of clause 67.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    Mr Seppälä stated that the same result
                    should be reached in the case of a DAB decision made under cl 20 of the
                    1999 Red Book because the relevant language of that clause is essentially the
                    same as that of cl 67 of the 1987 Red Book. In ICC Case No 10619, the
                    tribunal granted an interim award enforcing certain decisions made by the
                    engineer under cl 67 of the 1987 Red Book on the grounds that the
                    employer’s failure to pay the certified sums was a breach of contract.
                    This was despite the fact that the contractor (the party seeking to enforce the
                    engineer’s decisions) had issued an NOD in respect of those decisions. The
                    tribunal held as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22.    The question now arises as to whether and on what
                            legal basis this Tribunal may adjudicate the present dispute by an
                            interim award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This point can be easily exhausted. If the … Engineer’s
                        decisions have an immediate binding effect on the parties so that the mere
                        fact that any party does not comply with them forthwith is deemed a breach
                        of contract, notwithstanding the possibility that at the end they may be
                        revised or set aside in arbitration or by a further agreement to the
                        contrary, there is no reason why in the face of such a breach the Arbitral
                        Tribunal should refrain from an immediate judgment giving the
                        Engineer’s decisions their full force and effect. This simply is the
                        law of the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27.    Finally, whereas according to [cl] 67.1 of
                            the [1987 Red Book], the Engineer’s decisions shall have an
                            immediate binding effect, the Arbitral Tribunal holds that <em>provisional enforcement of this award must be
                                ordered</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>

                        (2014)</em>, the Judge relied on, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, ICC Case No 10619 in support of his finding that an
                    interim award carried interim finality and therefore complied with s 19B of
                    the IAA. His reasoning on this point, which I referred to earlier at [150]
                    above, is reproduced again below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">137    It is my view that the [Interim Award] is final

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">139    This view is also
                            consistent with the approach of the tribunal in ICC 10619, endorsed
                            by the Court of Appeal in [<em>Persero CA</em>]
                            … The facts of ICC 10619 are neatly summarised at [57] to
                            [61] of [<em>Persero CA</em>]. The contract in that
                            case contained provisions similar to cll 20.4 to 20.7 of the [1999]
                            Red Book, including the provision that interim adjudications should
                            carry interim finality. The contractor there obtained several interim
                            adjudications in its favour. The employer gave notice of its
                            dissatisfaction with those adjudications and failed to comply with them.
                            The contractor commenced an arbitration, raising both the primary and
                            the secondary dispute [the “secondary dispute” in the
                            context of ICC Case No 10619 being the dispute over the
                            employer’s failure to comply with the said interim
                            adjudications].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">140    The tribunal
                            in ICC 10619 issued an interim award to the contractor on the
                            secondary dispute. It justified its interim award on the basis that that
                            award merely gave effect to a substantive provisional right under the
                            parties’ contract. The tribunal adopted this contractual basis in
                            preference to a procedural basis arising under the applicable rules of
                            arbitration or under a feature of French law. That feature, known as the
                                <em>référé provision</em>, allows a claimant to
                            secure an award for interim payment even if there is no contractual
                            right to it, but only if it can show that its ultimate right to the
                            payment is not seriously disputable. As the tribunal said:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">22.    The question now arises as to whether and on
                                what legal basis this Tribunal may adjudicate the present dispute by
                                an interim award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">… [T]his Tribunal wishes to emphasize that neither the
                            provisions of Article 23 of the [1998] ICC Rules [of Arbitration]
                            nor the rules of the French [New Code of Civil Procedure] relating to
                            the <em>référé provision</em> are relevant. For one
                            thing, the judgement to be hereby made is not one of a conservatory or
                            interim nature, <em>stricto sensu</em>, but rather
                            one giving full immediate effect to a right that a party enjoys without
                            discussion on the basis of the [c]ontract and which the parties have
                            agreed shall extend at least until the end of the arbitration. For the

                                <em>référé provision.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    It is pertinent to note the nature of the
                    interim award made in ICC Case No 10619. The tribunal declined to issue the
                    interim award under Art 23 of the 1998 ICC Rules of Arbitration, which sets
                    out the ambit of an arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction to order conservatory
                    and interim measures, because it considered that the interim award was (at
                    [22]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… not one of a conservatory or interim measure, <em>stricto sensu</em>, but rather one giving full immediate effect
                        to a right that a party enjoys without discussion on the basis of the
                        [c]ontract and which the parties have agreed shall extend at least until the
                        end of the arbitration. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Instead, the tribunal ordered <em>provisional
                            enforcement</em> of the engineer’s decisions in question by
                        way of an interim award on the basis that the claimant (the contractor) had
                        an immediate contractual right to payment of the sums certified by the
                        engineer. It should also be noted that there was no discussion by the
                        tribunal as to whether it had the jurisdiction or power to make such an
                        interim award. It would seem that the parties did not dispute that the
                        tribunal had the requisite jurisdiction or power.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    In the light of ICC Case No 10619 and
                    the article by Mr Seppälä referred to at [178] above, the Court of Appeal
                    in <em>Persero CA</em> preferred Mr Seppälä’s
                    view (<em>viz</em>, that in cases of non-compliance with a
                    binding but non-final DAB decision, an arbitral tribunal under cl 20.6 of
                    the 1999 Red Book had the power to issue an interim award for payment of the sum
                    decided by the DAB pending the tribunal’s determination of the merits of
                    the DAB’s decision) to Prof Bunni’s opinion that there was a
                    gap in the enforcement provisions of cl 20 in this regard. The Court of
                    Appeal went further to hold (at [101] of <em>Persero
                        CA</em>) that there appeared to be a “settled practice”
                    in arbitral proceedings brought under cl 20.6 of the 1999 Red Book for the
                    arbitral tribunal to treat a binding but non-final DAB decision as immediately
                    enforceable by way of either an interim or partial award pending the
                    tribunal’s final resolution of the parties’ dispute over the merits
                    of that DAB decision. The Court of Appeal’s statement was clearly
                        <em>obiter</em> (as the Judge in <em>Persero HC (2014)</em> held at [100]–[102]). It is doubtful
                    whether there is indeed such a “settled practice” in international
                    arbitration, and even if there is, it is not necessarily persuasive when
                    considering the issue in the Singapore context. Mr Taner Dedesade, in his
                    article “Are ‘Binding’ DAB Decisions Enforceable?”
                    (2011) 6(3) CLInt 13, has listed a number of ICC arbitrations where the
                    arbitral tribunals reached different conclusions on the issue of the immediate
                    enforceability of a binding but non-final DAB decision pending an arbitral award
                    on a dispute over the merits of that DAB decision. Indeed, FIDIC has
                    acknowledged that international arbitrators are divided on this issue (see [183]
                    below). It was for this very reason that FIDIC issued the FIDIC Guidance
                    Memorandum on 1 April 2013 to users of the 1999 Red Book to reset the
                    position for future cases. This guidance memorandum is discussed

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Background:</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A substantial number of arbitral tribunals have found Clause 20 to be
                        unclear on the issue of whether a party may refer the failure of the other
                        Party to comply with a DAB decision that is ‘binding’ but not
                        ‘final’ to arbitration as is explicitly the case of a
                        ‘final and binding’ decision under Sub-Clause 20.7. A DAB
                        decision is ‘binding’ and not ‘final’ when either
                        Party, within 28 days after receiving the DAB decision, gives notice to the
                        other party of its dissatisfaction with the DAB decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">International arbitral tribunals have been divided over whether, in the
                        event of a failure to comply with a DAB decision issued under Clause 20
                        of the [1999] Red Book, which is ‘binding’ but not
                        ‘final’, the failure itself may be referred to arbitration,
                        without Sub-clause 20.4 [<em>Obtaining Dispute
                            Adjudication Board’s Decision</em>] and Sub-Clause 20.5
                            [<em>Amicable Settlement</em>] being applicable to
                        the reference. This issue was also the subject of the judgment of the
                        Singapore High Court in [<em>Persero HC (2010)</em>]
                        and the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Singapore [in <em>Persero CA</em>] dismissing an appeal from that [Singapore High
                        Court] judgment … which set aside an ICC award directing enforcement
                        of a DAB decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The same concern applies to Clause 20 of the Yellow Book, and the
                        Silver Book, as that Clause is worded in substantially identical terms in
                        them.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    The express purpose of the FIDIC Guidance
                    Memorandum should be carefully noted. Unlike the majority of this court in the
                    present appeals (see [68]–[69] of the Majority Judgment above), I do not
                    think the FIDIC Guidance Memorandum is intended to make <em>explicit</em> what is <em>implicit</em> in the
                    intention underlying cl 20.6. It would be invidious for FIDIC to make
                    explicit in 2013 the intention of the drafters of a clause which was first
                    adopted in 1957, and which remained in the Red Book largely without any
                    substantive change until 2013, save for the insertion of cl 67.4 of the
                    1987 Red Book (now cl 20.7 of the 1999 Red Book). In my view, the purpose
                    of the FIDIC Guidance Memorandum is to make <em>explicit</em> FIDIC’s intention to recommend “<em>changes</em>” [emphasis added] to the 1999 Red Book,
                    including <em>amending</em> cl 20.7 to provide for
                    summary or expedited relief in cases of non-compliance with binding but
                    non-final DAB decisions. Specifically, FIDIC recommended amending cl 20.7
                    to provide for such non-compliance to be directly referred to arbitration
                    without the parties having to first go through the steps set out in
                    cll 20.4 and 20.5. The scope of the type of dispute which could be referred
                    to arbitration under cl 20.6 was enlarged by the changes to cl 20.7
                    recommended by FIDIC. The contents of the recommended amendment to cl 20.7
                    makes FIDIC’s intention in this regard clear beyond doubt. In my view, the
                    FIDIC Guidance Memorandum is a clear and unambiguous acknowledgement by FIDIC
                    that cl 20.6, without the recommended amendment to cl 20.7, is not
                    applicable to any dispute relating to a failure to comply with a binding but
                    non-final DAB decision, nor to any dispute as to whether or not such a DAB
                    decision is enforceable by an interim award. Such DAB decisions have to be
                    enforced by court proceedings instead as intended by the drafters of
                    cl 20.6. In this connection, I should add that the FIDIC Guidance
                    Memorandum vindicates Prof Bunni’s, rather than
                    Mr Seppälä’s, opinion on the scope of cl 20.6. The FIDIC
                    Guidance Memorandum does not apply and cannot be used to interpret the scope of
                    cl 20.6 of the Conditions of Contract in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    In cases where FIDIC’s recommended
                    amendment to cl 20.7 of the 1999 Red Book is incorporated into the contract
                    in question, a contractor who has the benefit of a binding but non-final DAB
                    decision may obtain an arbitral award to enforce it. Whether, in such cases,
                    this amendment will affect the contractor’s right to sue in court based on
                    the binding but non-final DAB decision is not clear. It is not in every case
                    that arbitration is a more effective, expeditious and economical dispute
                    resolution process than court proceedings, as demonstrated by the lengthy
                    arbitral proceedings in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    In issuing the Interim Award, the 2011
                    Majority Arbitrators reasoned (at [45] of the Interim Award) that if DAB
                    No 3 were not enforceable pending the 2011 Tribunal’s determination
                    of the primary dispute between the parties, the word “binding”
                    would be “meaningless”. In my view, this explanation is not
                    defensible for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_186-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, CRW could have sued PGN for
                        payment of the Adjudicated Sum awarded under DAB No 3 in an Indonesian
                        court (Indonesia being PGN’s country of incorporation) or even in a
                        Singapore court (if PGN has assets here (see [120] above and [234]
                        below)).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_186-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, as suggested by the OS 206 judge in <em>Persero
                            HC (2010)</em>, a successful claimant may refer a dispute over
                            <em>the merits</em> of the binding but non-final
                        DAB decision in question to arbitration under cl 20.6 immediately upon
                        the respondent failing to comply with it. In the reference, the claimant
                        will produce that DAB decision as <em>prima facie</em>
                        evidence that it is correct unless and until it is revised by an amicable
                        settlement or an arbitral award. The burden is then shifted to the
                        respondent to adduce evidence to show the contrary. Clause 20.6 gives
                        the claimant a right to expedite the arbitral process where the respondent
                        deliberately abstains from complying with the DAB decision concerned, as PGN
                        did in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_186-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, if no NOD is issued by either party, the DAB decision would
                        become final and binding. If it is not complied with, the successful
                        claimant would be able to invoke cl 20.7 to refer the
                        respondent’s non-compliance to arbitration under cl 20.6 and
                        obtain an arbitral award for payment of the sum awarded by the DAB. There
                        would be no defence to such a claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Clause 20.6 in a security of payment context </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    I mentioned earlier (at [176] above) that in
                        <em>Persero HC (2014)</em>, the Judge held that:
                    (a) cl 20.6 was drafted only to enable the employer to “argue
                        <em>now</em>” [emphasis in original], and <em>not</em> to enable the contractor to compel the employer to
                    “pay now and argue <em>later”</em> [emphasis
                    in original] (at [38]); and (b) thus, “cl 20.6 [was] drafted
                    only <em>with finality</em> in mind and even then only of the
                        <em>primary</em> dispute” [emphasis in original] (at
                    [49]). Nevertheless, the Judge disregarded these findings when he held that
                    cl 20 of the Conditions of Contract incorporated a security of payment
                    scheme akin to that set out in the Building and Construction Industry Security
                    of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed). This holding lies at the heart
                    of the Judge’s approach. Early on in <em>Persero HC
                        (2014)</em>, he said (at [22]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The [1999] Red Book’s dispute-resolution regime is found in
                        cl 20 under the heading “Claims, Disputes and
                        Arbitration”. The heart of this regime is cll 20.4 to 20.7.
                        These provisions have two objectives. First, they establish arbitration as
                        the sole method for the parties to resolve their disputes with finality (or
                        as cl 20.6 puts it, for those disputes to be “finally
                        settled”). <em>Second, they establish a contractual
                            security of payment regime, intended to be available to the parties even
                            if no statutory regime exists under the applicable law.</em>
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    With respect, the two objectives stated in
                    the above passage are problematic. The first objective (<em>viz</em>, that of “establish[ing] arbitration as the sole
                    method for the parties to resolve their disputes with finality”) applies
                    in relation to only the primary dispute between PGN and CRW, and not the
                    enforceability dispute. Neither cl 20.6 nor cl 20.7 is expressed to
                    apply to the enforceability dispute. The Judge assumed that the enforceability
                    dispute must be resolved by arbitration under cl 20.6 when it was
                    inconsistent with his own findings at [38] and [49] of <em>Persero HC
                        (2014)</em>. The second objective – that of
                    “establish[ing] a contractual security of payment regime, intended to be
                    available to the parties even if no statutory regime exists under the applicable
                    law” – is also stated as an undisputed fact. However, there is
                    actually nothing in the Red Book (upon which the Conditions of Contract are
                    based) to suggest that its drafters had in mind a security of payment scheme
                    akin to similar schemes established by legislation in the UK, Singapore and many
                    Australian states. Historically, this is not correct. I have earlier shown (at
                    [168]–[174] above) that historically, an engineer’s interim
                    certificate of payment (the precursor of a binding but non-final DAB decision)
                    operated in the context of a judicial system (specifically, the English judicial
                    system) under which a successful claimant in a building and construction dispute
                    could quickly obtain from the respondent payment of the sum awarded by the
                    adjudicating body by commencing a court action for summary judgment (bearing in
                    mind that a binding but non-final DAB decision is akin to an engineer’s or
                    an architect’s interim certificate of payment). Under English law, a claim
                    based on a binding but non-final DAB decision would be subject to any set-off
                    (among other defences) or any counterclaim (see <em>Dawnays</em> and <em>Gilbert-Ash (Northern) Ltd v
                        Modern Engineering (Bristol) Ltd</em> [1974] AC 689 (“<em>Gilbert-Ash</em>”)), unless otherwise
                agreed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    The very first version of the Red Book
                        (<em>ie</em>, the 1957 Red Book) was based on the ICE
                    Conditions (see the extract from Mr  Seppälä’s 2011 article
                    reproduced at [167] above), and the provisions of the Red Book have remained
                    largely unchanged except for the addition of cl 20.7 to the Red Book in
                    1987 (in the form of cl 67.4 of the 1987 Red Book). Between 1957 up to the
                    time the FIDIC Guidance Memorandum was issued on 1 April 2013, the FIDIC
                    Red Book did not cater to a “pay now, argue later” regime. I would
                    venture to suggest that it was precisely because contractors did not have the
                    economic power to incorporate contractual provisions requiring employers to
                    “pay now and argue later” that the legislature (in Australia, the
                    UK and Singapore) had to intervene by introducing legislation to establish a
                    statutory security of payment regime so as to ease or protect contractors’
                    cash flow. The security of payment regime is a relatively recent development. It
                    was only in 1996 that the UK established a statutory security of payment scheme
                    for the building and construction industry in England and Wales, followed by
                    Scotland and Northern Ireland. The Australian states were the next to introduce
                    security of payment regimes. Singapore introduced such a regime only in 2004
                    (via the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 2004
                    (Act 57 of 2004)), and Malaysia followed suit in 2012. In my view, the
                    legislature had to intervene because the contractual machinery was inadequate to
                    protect contractors’ cash flow. Experience shows that few employers would
                    want to pay contractors promptly if they can argue first and pay later. That is
                    the nature of the capitalist beast.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    As early as 1964, the problem of cash flow
                    disruptions in the building and construction industry in England was identified
                    in <em>The Placing and Management of Contracts for Building and
                        Civil Engineering Works</em> (March 1964), the report of a committee
                    chaired by Sir H Banwell (for a short account of this topic, see Chow
                    Kok Fong, <em>Security of Payments and Construction
                        Adjudication</em> (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2013) at
                    paras 1.7–1.12). In <em>Dawnays</em>,
                    Lord Denning expounded on the importance of cash flow in the building and
                    construction industry, and interpreted a clause in a building and construction
                    contract between a contractor and a subcontractor in that light. In <em>Modern Engineering (Bristol) Ltd v Gilbert-Ash (Northern)
                        Ltd</em> (1973) 71 LGR 162, Lord Denning reiterated his
                    social philosophy as follows (at 167):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There must be a ‘cash flow’ in the building trade. It is the
                        very lifeblood of the enterprise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_191"></a>191    On appeal, the House of Lords overruled
                        <em>Dawnays</em> in <em>Gilbert-Ash</em>. Lord Diplock commented (at 718):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My Lords, I accept the importance of “cash flow” in the
                        building industry. In the vivid phrase of Lord Denning M.R.:
                        “It is the very lifeblood of the enterprise” (71 L.G.R. 162,
                        167). But so it is of all commercial enterprises engaged in the business of
                        selling goods or undertaking work or labour; and so it was in the first half
                        of the 19th century when this common law remedy for breach of warranty was
                        “established” and in 1893 when its application to contracts
                        for sale of goods received statutory recognition in the Sale of Goods Act.
                        “Cash flow” is the lifeblood of the village grocer too, though
                        he may not need so large a transfusion from his customers as the shipbuilder
                        in <em>Mondel</em> v. <em>Steel</em> [[1841] 8 M &amp; W 858] or the
                        sub-contractor in the instant appeal. It is also the lifeblood of the
                        contractor whose own cash flow has been reduced by the expense to which he
                        has been put by the sub-contractor’s breaches of contract. It is not
                        to be supposed that so elementary an economic proposition as the need for
                        cash flow in business enterprises escaped the attention of judges throughout
                        the 130 years which had elapsed between <em>Mondel</em>
                        v. <em>Steel</em> and <em>Dawnays’</em> case in 1971, or of the legislature itself
                        when it passed the Sale of Goods Act in 1893.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In other words, cash flow is important, even vital, to any
                        business. However, it is a different thing to read a security of payment
                        scheme into a contractual structure originally established in 1957 and
                        applied largely without much substantive change up to now (apart from the
                        insertion in 1987 of what is now cl 20.7 of the 1999 Red Book and the
                        amendments recommended by FIDIC in 2013 via the FIDIC Guidance Memorandum)
                        as if employers had agreed with contractors, pursuant to that contractual
                        structure, to pay first and argue later, rather than to argue first and pay
                        later.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Is the Interim Award in substance a provisional award? </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    I turn now to my third ground for allowing
                    PGN’s appeals (see [114(c)] above). PGN has argued that DAB No 3 is
                    in substance a provisional award, which is not a type of award covered by the
                    definition of “award” in s 2 of the IAA (see
                    [147(a)]–[147(b)] above). What is not highlighted in PGN’s arguments
                    is the fact that a binding but non-final DAB decision is <em>inherently provisional</em> in nature because it is expressly stated
                    in cl 20.4[4] to be revisable by an amicable settlement or an arbitral
                    award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">CRW’s written case on provisional awards </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    CRW submits that the Interim Award is not a
                    provisional award. Its arguments are set out at paras 63–83 of its
                    written case for the present appeals as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">63    First, one cannot
                            use the statute of another country [<em>ie</em>,
                            the UK] to characterise an interim award that is not subject to the UK
                            Arbitration Act 1996. The only relevant question is whether the Interim
                            Award is an “interim award” under the IAA.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">64    … Only PGN is
                            calling the Interim Award a provisional award, and it does so for the
                            sole purpose of saying that there is no such thing as a provisional
                            award under the IAA. This is not a valid form of argument.
                            …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">65    Under the IAA, an
                            award includes any interim or partial award. Section 19A(1) makes
                            it clear that an “arbitral tribunal may make more than one award
                            at different points in time during the arbitral proceedings on different
                            aspects of the matters to be determined.” Section 19A(2)(b)
                            makes it clear that an arbitral tribunal may make an award relating to
                            “a part only of the claim” which is submitted to it for
                            decision. That is exactly what the [2011 Majority Arbitrators]
                            did.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">66    … [T]here are at

                            and Question 2 [<em>ie</em>, the secondary

                            dispute in the 2011 Arbitration, that part being whether PGN must make
                            payment to CRW first whilst time is taken for the arbitral process to
                            decide exactly how much PGN owes CRW
                            …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">67    … [T]he
                            subject matter of the Interim Award is CRW’s undisputed
                            substantive provisional right to be paid now and PGN’s substantive
                            obligation to argue only later. CRW has a substantive but provisional
                            right to be paid promptly, without having to wait for all aspects of the
                            parties’ dispute to be resolved with
                            finality.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">68    As long as the
                            [Interim Award] has preclusive effect on its subject-matter, and is
                            therefore final and binding between the parties, it is irrelevant, for
                            the purposes of recognition and enforcement of the award under the IAA,
                            that the effect of the [Interim Award] is only to provide provisional

                            arbitration. In other words, the issue of whether CRW had the right to
                            provisional relief to be promptly paid US$17,298,834.57 pending the
                            final determination in the 2011 Arbitration was merely the subject
                            matter of the Interim Award. The 2011 [Majority Arbitrators’]
                            decision on that issue is however final and

                            deals with Section 19A of the IAA, contains a footnote which says

                            omitted from the IAA because “the [IAA] contemplates that all

                            chose not to use the expression “interim award”.

                            Section 39 can arguably be found in Section 12 of the IAA; for

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">72    Further,

                            it is no more than a statement of party autonomy and not a mandatory

                            awards are not considered “provisional awards”. A good
                            example is the case of ICC Case No. 10619 … which was cited

                            obligations of parties in the interim period during the pendency of the
                            arbitration renders the term “interim award” in
                            Section 2 of the IAA superfluous. This cannot have been the
                            intention of the legislature.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">75    Section 2 of the IAA provides that an arbitration award includes:

                            (c) a partial award. PGN submits that the term “interim
                            award” could have several meanings:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    a “partial award” where the

                            arbitral tribunal to make interim awards falling within
                            category (iii). With respect, the Interim Award falls squarely

                    the Interim Award on 22 May 2013, the 2011 Tribunal issued a (unanimous)
                    direction on 4 November 2013 to bifurcate the hearing of the primary
                    dispute into two tranches – first, on “issues of principle”,
                    and second, on “issues of quantum” (see [19] of the Partial
                    Award). The hearing of the first tranche took place from 10 to 12 February
                    2014, with six witnesses (three from each side) testifying on the nine Heads of
                    Claim which were the subject matter of DAB No 3.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>At [100.7] of the Partial Award, the 2011 Tribunal stated that
                        it would issue further directions for the parties on the issue of quantum in
                        relation to the Heads of Claim which were to be opened, reviewed and revised
                        by it (subject to proof of quantum).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196"></a>196    In other words, after the Interim Award was
                    issued, the 2011 Tribunal reviewed DAB No 3 in “principle” to
                    determine whether the nine Heads of Claim based on which the DAB had assessed
                    the value of the 13 disputed VOPs were correctly included in CRW’s claims,
                    and found that the DAB had wrongly included two Heads of Claim, Nos 6 and
                    8. Even at this stage of the inquiry into the merits of DAB No 3 (<em>ie</em>, the merits of the primary dispute between the
                    parties), the 2011 Tribunal has already found DAB No 3 to be incorrect,
                    without having to determine the correctness of DAB No 3 with regard to the
                    remaining seven Heads of Claim. The Partial Award has “revise[d]”
                    the Interim Award because it is expressed to have that effect; specifically, the
                    Partial Award has revised the Interim Award by excluding Heads of Claim
                    Nos 6 and 8. These two Heads of Claims have an aggregate value of
                    US$3,683,756.08, being US$3,175,139.04 for Head of Claim No 6 and
                    US$508,617.04 for Head of Claim No 8 (see [94.1] of the Partial Award,
                    where the quantum of the nine Heads of Claim considered by the DAB is set out).
                    Consequently, the Adjudicated Sum awarded to CRW under DAB No 3 has been
                    revised downwards by US$3,683,756.08, thereby reducing the total amount payable
                    thereunder to US$13,615,078.49.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties’ skeletal arguments after the issuance of the
                Partial Award</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a>197    The Partial Award was made after the Judge
                    issued his written grounds of decision in <em>Persero HC
                        (2014)</em>, but before the present appeals were heard. PGN and CRW
                    each filed skeletal arguments on 22 December 2014 to address the
                    implications of the Partial Award on the Judge’s decision in <em>Persero HC (2014)</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">PGN’s skeletal arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a>198    In its skeletal arguments, PGN argued that
                    since the Partial Award had expressly revised the Interim Award, the latter was
                    never, in substance, intended to be a final and binding award; otherwise, the
                    2011 Tribunal would not have revised it. According to PGN, the Partial Award
                    raises three questions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_198-p2_a"></a>(a)     As the substantive effect of the
                        Interim Award was intended to be temporary, is that award enforceable in the
                        same manner as a judgment?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_198-p2_b"></a>(b)     Does the temporary nature of the Interim Award conflict
                        with s 19B of the IAA such that it should be set
                    aside?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_198-p2_c"></a>(c)     As the
                        Interim Award has been revised by the Partial Award such that DAB No 3
                        is no longer binding on the parties, what is the status of the Interim Award
                        – is it still enforceable in the same manner as a judgment pursuant to
                        the Enforcement Order (as defined at [1] of the Majority Judgment above), or
                        is it liable to be set aside?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_199"></a>199    At para 10 of its skeletal arguments,
                    PGN argues as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_199-p2_a"></a>(a)     As the Partial Award has revised
                        the Interim Award, PGN is no longer obliged to give effect to DAB No 3.
                        Thus, the Enforcement Order made on 2 July 2013 must be set
                        aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_199-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        2011 Majority Arbitrators’ intention for the Interim Award to have
                        only “interim finality” contravenes s 19B of the
                        IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_199-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        Interim Award was issued without consideration of the merits of DAB
                        No 3 and does not accord with the dispute resolution mechanism under
                        the Conditions of Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_199-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Interim Award and the Partial Award cannot stand
                        together for the purposes of enforcement.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_199-p2_e"></a>(e)     The Interim Award should be set aside as the
                        2011 Majority Arbitrators exceeded their power or jurisdiction, and/or acted
                        contrary to the parties’ agreed arbitral procedure, and/or in breach
                        of the rules of natural justice in making that award.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_199-p2_f"></a>(f)     If the Interim Award is not set
                        aside, as a consequence of the application of the principles of <em>res judicata</em>, issue estoppel and merger of cause of
                        action, the 2011 Tribunal would become <em>functus
                            officio</em> for the purposes of the substantive arbitral
                        proceedings concerning the parties’ primary dispute over the
                        correctness of DAB No 3.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">CRW’s skeletal arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200"></a>200    In the skeletal arguments which it filed
                    after the Partial Award was issued, CRW did not respond to PGN’s skeletal
                    arguments specifically. It submitted at para 10 of its skeletal arguments
                    that the Partial Award “is simply incapable of having any impact on the
                    Interim Award or the decision below, and is completely irrelevant to these
                    appeals”. According to CRW, the Interim Award stands on its own as a
                    separate and independent award. CRW also reiterates all the arguments on
                    provisional awards set out in its written case for the present appeals (see
                    [193] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">What is a “provisional” award?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201"></a>201    What is a “provisional” award
                    in the context of arbitration? In the court below, the Judge defined it as
                    “an award granting relief which is intended to be effective for a limited
                    period” (see [124] of <em>Persero HC (2014)</em>),
                    without providing the source of his definition. In my view, in contrast to a
                    final award, a provisional award is one which is subject to alteration or
                    revision, or even nullification, after a full hearing on the merits of the
                    dispute which is the subject matter of the arbitration (the subject matter of
                    the 2011 Arbitration being, in this case, the parties’ primary dispute
                    over the correctness of DAB No 3). The Judge’s definition fits
                    exactly the terms of the Interim Award, which the 2011 Majority Arbitrators
                    intended to be effective with regard to DAB No 3 only until the 2011
                    Tribunal’s final resolution of the parties’ primary dispute. The
                    same or similar meaning of “provisional” award can be seen from
                    s 39 of the Arbitration Act 1996 (c 23) (UK) (“the
                    UKAA”), which introduced the concept of a provisional award into the
                    realm of English arbitration law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Sections 39 and 47 of the UKAA </p>

                    dealt with provisional <em>orders</em> instead. In

                    1 CLC 563 (“<em>Nikola Rotenberg</em>”),
                    the English High Court likewise noted this “curious feature” of
                    s 39 (at [43]), and said (in the same paragraph):</p>

                        order on a provisional basis any relief which it would have power to grant
                        in a final award.’ As there stated, any relief granted pursuant to
                        such a power is ‘provisional’ only i.e. it is not final and
                        binding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>On appeal, the English Court of Appeal made no distinction
                        between “orders” and “awards” in s 39 when
                        it endorsed the English High Court’s interpretation, but said that
                        “[i]t is necessary, however, to set out the distinction between

                    UKAA corresponds to s 19A (read with s 19B(1)) of the IAA. These
                    provisions make an award final and binding on the parties and on any persons
                    claiming through them. It was on this ground that the Judge held that the
                    argument by PGN’s counsel in the proceedings below, Mr Philip
                    Jeyaretnam SC (“Mr Jeyaretnam”) – namely, that a
                    Singapore-seated tribunal lacked the jurisdiction to issue a provisional award
                    as provisional awards had been omitted from the IAA – was flawed because
                    it was predicated on the assumption that English arbitration law was different
                    from Singapore arbitration law (see [152] above). To be fair to
                    Mr Jeyaretnam, I do not think he made such an assumption in his arguments.
                    He was merely contending that s 39 of the UKAA provided for provisional
                    awards, but the IAA did not do so because that kind of award had been
                    deliberately omitted by the Law Reform and Revision Division of the
                    Attorney-General’s Chambers (“the LRRD”) when drafting the
                    IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_205"></a>205    The UKAA does not have an equivalent of

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Except as provided in Articles 33 and 34(4) of the Model Law, upon an
                        award being made, including an award made in accordance with
                        section 19A, the arbitral tribunal shall not vary, amend, correct,
                        review, add to or revoke the award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Section 19B was introduced to negate the decision of the
                        Court of Appeal in <em>Tang Boon Jek Jeffrey v Tan Poh Leng
                            Stanley</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 273 (“<em>Jeffrey Tang</em>”). In that case, it was held that an
                        arbitral tribunal under the IAA was not <em>functus
                            officio</em> on any aspect of the dispute before it until it had
                        determined every aspect of that dispute. Section 19B makes it clear
                        that every award, whatever type of award it might be, is final and binding
                        on those aspects of the dispute which the award determines (see <em>Persero HC (2014)</em> at [126]). As the Court of Appeal
                        said in <em>PT First Media TBK (formerly known as
                            PT Broadband Multimedia TBK) v Astro Nusantara International BV and

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Parliament’s intention to align the effect of interim
                        awards with that of final awards was driven by its object of providing that
                        all awards – interim and final – should reflect the principle of
                        finality. What this meant was that an award, once issued, was to be final
                        and conclusive as to the merits of the subject-matter determined under that
                        award; and it could thereafter only be altered in the limited circumstances
                        provided for in Arts 33 and 34(4) of the Model Law. This is nothing
                        more than another way of saying that the issues determined under the award
                        are <em>res judicata</em>. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_206"></a>206    The last sentence of the quotation above
                    suggests that s 19B was introduced to address the issue of <em>res judicata</em>. In my view, given that s 19B was
                    specifically enacted to negate the decision of the Court of Appeal in <em>Jeffrey Tang</em>, it was intended to restore or restate the
                    established law that once a tribunal has issued an award (be it an interim,
                    interlocutory, partial or final award), the tribunal is <em>functus officio</em> in relation to the specific issue(s) dealt with
                    by the award –
                    <em>ie</em>, the tribunal cannot revisit its decision and
                    change it even if it turns out to be wrong. Section 19B, as drafted, is
                    wide enough to express both the principle of <em>functus
                        officio</em> and the principle of <em>res
                        judicata</em> in relation to arbitral awards. But, it was not
                    necessary for s 19B to address the <em>res
                        judicata</em> principle since <em>Jeffrey
                        Tang</em> was concerned <em>not</em> with that
                    principle, but rather, with <em>the</em> functus officio
                        <em>principle.</em> The <em>res
                        judicata</em> principle would continue to apply whether or not
                    s 19B was enacted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_207"></a>207    An interim award, such as the Interim Award
                    in the present case, does not go into the merits of the substantive or
                    underlying dispute between the parties (in the present case, the primary dispute
                    between PGN and CRW over the correctness of DAB No 3). Therefore, when an
                    interim award is made, no issue of <em>res judicata</em>
                    should arise in relation to the merits of the parties’ underlying dispute.
                    However, since s 19B is worded so widely as to encompass not only the
                        <em>functus officio</em> principle but also the
                        <em>res judicata</em> principle with regard to
                    “all awards – interim and final” (as stated in <em>First Media</em> at [140]), it is liable to cause confusion,
                    especially in a case like the present case, where an interim award ordering the
                    payment of a sum of money is made. Clearly, the Interim Award cannot render the
                    primary dispute between PGN and CRW over the merits of DAB No 3 <em>res judicata</em> since that dispute has yet to be determined
                    with finality by a tribunal. The Judge recognised this when he drew a
                    distinction between the issue decided by the Interim Award and the issue which
                    would be decided by the final arbitral award made in respect of the merits of
                    DAB No 3.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_208"></a>208    Given that s 47 (read with s 58)
                    of the UKAA and s 19A (read with s 19B(1)) of the IAA provide that an
                    arbitral award may not be revisited because the tribunal is <em>functus officio</em> in respect of the issue(s) dealt with in that
                    award, the rationale for s 39 of the UKAA is not difficult to appreciate.
                    It is intended to provide a form of arbitral award that would fall outside
                    s 47 (read with s 58) of the UKAA. In other words, given that
                    s 47 (read with s 58) of the UKAA reflects the principle of finality
                    in the sense of a tribunal becoming <em>functus
                        officio</em> as just described, s 39 of the UKAA is intended to
                    provide otherwise <em>vis-à-vis</em> provisional awards,
                        <em>ie</em>, that a tribunal is not <em>functus officio</em> after making a provisional award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_209"></a>209    For these reasons, I find the Judge’s
                    explanation in <em>Persero HC (2014)</em> for the omission
                    of a Singapore equivalent of s 39 of the UKAA from the IAA wholly
                    unpersuasive. The Judge held (at [132]) that the LRRD’s decision not to
                    use the term “provisional award” in s 19A of the IAA was
                    “to avoid confusing nomenclature rather than … to restrict the
                    content of an award, <em>provided that</em> the award has
                    preclusive effect as required by s 19B” [emphasis added]. With
                    respect, the proviso added by the Judge is confusing. A provisional award is, by
                    definition, an award that does not have preclusive effect where the merits of
                    the parties’ underlying dispute are concerned as it does not make any
                    determination of the merits of that dispute. Contrary to the Judge’s
                    explanation, the LRRD’s decision not to use the term “provisional
                    award” in s 19A of the IAA is, as I see it, not merely a matter of
                    “avoid[ing] confusing nomenclature”. The inclusion of provisional
                    awards in s 19A (and likewise, in the definition of “award”
                    in s 2) of the IAA would cause no confusion because the mandatory force of
                    s 19B of the IAA would render a provisional award final and binding, just
                    as in the case of an interim award or a partial award. Any confusion would be
                    obliterated by the force of s 19B, which was exactly how the Judge dealt
                    with the Interim Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The omission of an equivalent of s 39 of the UKAA from the
                IAA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_210"></a>210    In its report “Review of Arbitration
                    Laws” (LRRD No 3/2001), the LRRD explained (at para 2.23.2)
                    that the omission of the expression “provisional awards” from the
                    International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill 2001 (Bill 38 of 2001), which
                    introduced (<em>inter alia</em>) the clause that later
                    became s 19B of the IAA, was deliberate “as the Bill contemplates
                    that all awards enforcement of which is sought (including interim and partial
                    awards) are to be final in nature”. The footnote to this comment also
                    states that s 39 of the UKAA “was not adopted”. The
                    LRRD’s explanation is quite clear. Because the IAA was intended to apply
                    only to awards that were “final in nature” (although the LRRD did
                    not explain what it meant by this expression in relation to awards under the
                    IAA), there was no room for a provisional award of the kind contemplated under
                    s 39 of the UKAA. A provisional award of that nature would not fit into the
                    statutory scheme of “award[s]” contemplated by the IAA.
                    Section 39 of the UKAA was therefore not incorporated into the IAA. The
                    fact of the matter is that the LRRD did not want to introduce into the IAA the
                    novel concept of a provisional award to cater for awards that might subsequently
                    be altered or revoked.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_211"></a>211    With this background in view, the thrust of
                    PGN’s submission that the Interim Award was in substance a provisional
                    award of the type prescribed under s 39 of the UKAA (and excluded from the
                    IAA) is perfectly clear. PGN’s contention is that by not adopting
                    s 39 of the UKAA, the LRRD intended the IAA to exclude provisional awards
                    from its ambit; thus, if the Interim Award were in substance a provisional
                    award, it would not be enforceable under the IAA as an award. In my view, the
                    Judge’s reasoning does not answer PGN’s arguments on this issue.
                    There is really no answer if the Interim Award is indeed in substance a
                    provisional award.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_214"></a>214    Paragraph 203 of the DAC Report makes
                    it clear that the DAC considered that cl 39 was intended to <em>enlarge</em> the traditional jurisdiction of arbitrators
                    under English arbitration law, which did not extend to the making of provisional
                    awards. Prior to the enactment of s 39 of the UKAA, arbitrators under
                    English arbitration law did not have the power to make provisional awards. The
                    DAC was of the view that <em>enlarging</em>
                    arbitrators’ jurisdiction by giving them such power could serve a very
                    useful purpose in certain trades and industries where cash flow was of
                    particular importance. The DAC had in mind security of payment schemes, whether
                    contractual or statutory, which required employers to make interim payments to
                    contractors, subject to an adjudicator’s final determination. Such orders
                    or awards would be provisional, and not final, in nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_215"></a>215    In my view, the DAC’s explanations in
                    paras 202 and 203 of the DAC Report are inconsistent with and undermine the
                    Judge’s holding as well as CRW’s argument that a provisional award
                    is an interim award under s 19A of the IAA.</p>

                    the reason set out in para 203 of the DAC Report (namely, that a
                    provisional order or award could serve “a very useful purpose” in
                    trades and industries where cash flow is of particular importance) when it
                    decided not to incorporate an equivalent of s 39 of the UKAA into the IAA.
                    Two practitioners’ text commentaries provide contrasting views on the
                    objective of s 39 of the UKAA and the status of a provisional award made
                    under that section for the purposes of enforcement as a foreign award in a
                    foreign jurisdiction under the New York Convention. In Robert Merkin &amp; Louis
                    Flannery, <em>Arbitration Act 1996</em> (Informa,
                    5th Ed, 2014) (“<em>Merkin &amp;
                    Flannery</em>”), the authors write (at
                    pp 155–156):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Provisional orders or provisional
                        awards?</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is clearly some ambiguity concerning whether section 39
                        empowers a tribunal to make a provisional <b><em>award</em></b> (as the title of the section suggests) or simply a
                        provisional <b><em>order</em></b>, which is the word used in
                        section 39. The difference is important: provisional awards may not be
                        enforceable at all in an international context – enforcement under the
                        New York Convention is confined to ‘final’ awards, whose effect
                        is permanently dispositive (subject to challenges, etc.). Furthermore, there
                        is some ambiguity in the word ‘provisional’: does it mean
                        ‘temporary’?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There are clues in the DAC Report, which refers to this provision being
                        used (for example) ‘in trades and industries where cash flow is of
                        particular importance’, and the reference to courts having powers to
                        make orders for interim payments. <em>In our view, the
                            section is indeed intended to confer on arbitrators the power to grant
                            interim financial relief in the form of an award, which may not be
                            entirely dispositive as to the arbitration, nor would it be an award
                            under section 47 (awards on different issues), but it would be
                            final in its own right.</em> (There is no other form of award
                        recognised by the legislation.)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The clear intention behind the provision was to allow
                            parties to confer on tribunals the right to make a binding award,
                            usually for a sum of money, where liability had been
                        admitted</em>, and substantial damages had been claimed (and were
                        likely to be awarded), so that the only question was as to quantum, in
                        respect of which the final award would only be for the balance due from the
                        respondent. The language used in the section is unfortunate (particularly
                        the use of the word ‘provisional’), as it appears that the award
                        would in some way be reversible, which we suggest was not the intention of
                        the drafters of the Act. <em>A provisional award under
                            section 39 might typically be used to grant interim financial
                            relief on the same basis that interim damages can be awarded by a court,
                            thereby preserving the claimant’s cash flow.</em> Needless
                        to say, anecdotal evidence suggests that the power is rarely exercised by
                        tribunals, who are probably (quite rightly) cautious about making awards
                        unless they are final on the issues concerned.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_217"></a>217    In Nigel Blackaby <em>et
                        al</em>, <em>Redfern and Hunter on International
                        Arbitration</em> (Oxford University Press, 5th Ed, 2009)
                        (“<em>Redfern &amp; Hunter</em>”), the
                    following point is made (at footnote 4 on pp 514–515):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The English Arbitration Act 1996, s. 39, is an exception to the
                        general rule [that all awards are “final” with regard to the
                        specific issues decided therein] in granting a power to make
                        “provisional awards”, if the parties agree that the tribunal
                        shall have the power. Interestingly, s. 39 only mentions the word
                        “award” in the marginal note, and the body of the section
                        refers to “orders”. See, Hunter and Landau, <em>The English Arbitration Act 1996: Text and Notes</em> (1998,
                        Kluwer), p 35; <em>whether such orders are enforceable
                            under the New York Convention is questionable, and is a matter for the
                            courts of the country where enforcement is sought</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_218"></a>218    Thus, whilst <em>Merkin &amp;
                        Flannery</em> expresses the view that an award made under s 39 of
                    the UKAA is intended to be “final” for the purposes of enforcement
                    under the New York Convention, <em>Redfern &amp;
                        Hunter</em> says that the enforceability of such an award is
                    questionable and is a matter for the courts of the country where enforcement is
                    sought. As far as Singapore is concerned, whichever view is correct, a
                    provisional award is not an award under the IAA as the definition of
                    “award” in s 2 of the IAA deliberately excludes provisional
                    awards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_219"></a>219    Professor Bunni’s article (cited
                    at [164] above) comments on the effect of s 39 of the UKAA with regard to
                    provisional awards as follows (at pp 282–283):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Will the applicable law of the contract permit recognition of a
                        provisional award rendered in consequence to arbitration under
                        Sub-Clause 20.7? Will the arbitration rules adopted permit such a
                        course of action?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The answer to these questions would depend not only on the
                        applicable law of the contract, but on the arbitration rules to be applied
                        and of course on the parties’ submissions. For example,
                        Article 23(1) of the [1998] ICC Rules of Arbitration provides
                        that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“Unless the parties have otherwise agreed, as soon as the file
                            has been transmitted to it, the Arbitral Tribunal may, at the request of
                            a party, order any interim or conservatory measure it deems
                            appropriate”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The words “any interim or conservatory measure”
                        are wide enough to permit a provisional award to be rendered, <em>subject of course to the provisions of the applicable
                            law</em>. Taking, for example, the 1996 English Arbitration Act,
                        section 39(1) provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“The parties are free to agree that the tribunal shall have
                            power to order on a provisional basis any relief which it would have
                            power to grant in a final award”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Section 39(4) then goes on to provide that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“Unless the parties agree to confer such power on the tribunal,
                            the tribunal has no such power”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Therefore, it would seem that in an ICC arbitration
                            case under the 1996 English Arbitration Act, a tribunal would have the
                            power to issue a provisional award under sub-clause 20.7 since the
                            parties involved would have conferred that power on the tribunal through
                            the adoption of the [1998 ICC Rules of Arbitration].</em>

                    virtue of s 3 of the IAA. Article 17 provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral tribunal may, at the
                        request of a party, order any party to take such interim measure of
                        protection as the arbitral tribunal may consider necessary in respect of the
                        subject-matter of the dispute. The arbitral tribunal may require any party
                        to provide appropriate security in connection with such measure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_222"></a>222    It can be seen from s 12 of the IAA
                    that the plenitude of powers conferred on an arbitral tribunal to order interim
                    measures does not include the power to make an interim order for payment of
                    money, unlike s 39 of the UKAA (which expressly mentions “a
                    provisional order for the payment of money”), although it does include
                    the power to prevent the dissipation of assets as a means of avoiding payment to
                    a successful claimant. It is reasonable to assume that s 12 of the IAA was
                    carefully drafted or structured to meet the objectives of the IAA. If s 12
                    was intended to include a power on the part of an arbitral tribunal to make an
                    interim order for payment of money, that would have been stated explicitly in
                    the same way that s 39 of the UKAA expressly provides for the making of
                    provisional orders for payment of money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_223"></a>223    Finally, it should be noted that an order
                    under s 12 of the IAA is not an “award” for the purposes of
                        (<em>inter alia</em>) enforcement under s 19 of
                    the IAA. Section 2 of the IAA defines the term “award” as
                    “a decision of the arbitral tribunal on the substance of the dispute and
                    includes any interim, interlocutory or partial award but excludes any orders or
                    directions made under section 12”. Section 2 does not refer to
                    a provisional award for the same reason that a provisional award was excluded
                    from the IAA.</p>

                    can include interim awards for payment of money. It may be recalled that in ICC
                    Case No 10619, the arbitral tribunal, in issuing an interim award ordering
                    the payment of money, did not rely on Art 23, but relied instead on the
                    terms of the parties’ contract, which was subject to French law. In my
                    view, even if the 1998 ICC Rules of Arbitration can be interpreted to permit an
                    interim award for payment of money, such an award would not be enforceable as a
                    court judgment under the IAA because it would be a provisional order and, hence,
                    would not be an “award” as defined in s 2 of the
                IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the 2011 Majority Arbitrators issue or intend to issue the
                Interim Award as a provisional award? </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_226"></a>226    PGN contends that the 2011 Majority
                    Arbitrators intended the Interim Award to be a provisional award because they
                    not only said that an award giving effect to DBA No 3 would only be
                    “final <u>up to a certain point in
                    time</u>” [underlining in original] (see the Interim Award at
                    [51]) and “will not and cannot be altered <u>until the
                        arbitration hearing</u>” [underlining in original] (at [52]),
                    thereby implying that the Interim Award could and might be altered at or after
                    that point in time, but also stated that the Interim Award was an award
                    “[p]ending the final resolution of the Parties’ dispute” (at
                    [56]) –
                    <em>ie</em>, the Interim Award was intended to have
                    provisional effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_227"></a>227    In my view, the aforesaid statements of the
                    2011 Majority Arbitrators as well as the form and content of the Interim Award
                    show clearly what was in their minds. They did not want to issue an interim
                    award which might have the effect of rendering the 2011 Tribunal <em>functus officio</em>. They wanted to issue an award with
                    interim finality so as to ensure that the 2011 Tribunal would not be <em>functus officio</em> after the award was issued. Hence, they
                    stated that the Interim Award would be unalterable (or final) only “up to
                    a certain point in time” [underlining in original omitted], and
                    thereafter could be altered at the hearing of the parties’ primary dispute
                    over the merits of DAB No 3 because cl 20.4[4] expressly provided that
                    a binding but non-final DAB decision was subject to revision by either an
                    amicable settlement or an arbitral award. At the same time, the 2011 Majority
                    Arbitrators also wanted to issue an award in a form that would not fall foul of
                    s 19B of the IAA, bearing in mind the Court of Appeal’s decision in
                        <em>Persero CA</em>. Ultimately, finding themselves in
                    a dilemma at the crossroads, they had to fall back on that Court of Appeal
                    decision for support. They “presumed” that the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Persero CA</em> had considered s 19B of the
                    IAA and had found no difficulty with it (see [53] of the Interim Award). Thus,
                    the 2011 Majority Arbitrators issued the Interim Award with temporal finality,
                    unalterable only up to the time the primary dispute between the parties was
                    determined on the merits by the 2011 Tribunal, but alterable at or after that
                    point of time. In substance, they issued the Interim Award on the basis or
                    understanding that it could be subject to alteration at the arbitration of the
                    primary dispute. In my view, the 2011 Majority Arbitrators really had no choice
                    but to issue what was in substance a provisional award because of
                    cl 20.4[4] of the Conditions of Contract. As I have observed earlier, it is
                    inherent in the nature of a binding but non-final DAB decision that it is
                    subject to revision either through an amicable settlement, or at an arbitration
                    of the merits of the underlying dispute between the parties as to the
                    correctness of that DAB decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Judge’s characterisation of the legal effect of the Interim
                Award</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_228"></a>228    In <em>Persero HC
                        (2014)</em>, the Judge declined to accept the 2011 Majority
                    Arbitrators’ characterisation of what they intended the legal effect of
                    the Interim Award to be. He held, as a matter of law, that the Interim Award was
                    not merely final up to a certain point in time – instead, it was final and
                    binding under s 19B(1) of the IAA because it had preclusive effect as to
                    the subject matter of the award, and therefore could not be altered in breach of
                    the stricture set out in s 19B(2). The Judge read the Interim Award as
                    complying with s 19B because that section has mandatory effect. He said
                    that the Interim Award would not and could not be varied or altered, and
                        <em>that it was what the parties had agreed to</em>.
                    The last statement is curious. The parties had merely agreed to cl 20 of
                    the Conditions of Contract, which provides that DAB No 3 shall be promptly
                    complied with unless and until it is revised by an amicable agreement or an
                    arbitral award. There is no factual basis for concluding that the parties agreed
                    to the DAB’s binding but non-final decision in DAB No 3 being made
                    unalterable, given that cl 20.4[4] expressly states the contrary. There is
                    nothing in cl 20 to suggest that the parties had agreed that the
                    enforceability dispute could be referred to arbitration under cl 20.6, or
                    that an arbitral award with provisional effect would be subject to s 19B of
                    the IAA. What the parties had agreed to was the very issue that the Judge had to
                    decide.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Variation of the Interim Award by the Partial Award </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_229"></a>229    Notwithstanding the emphatic statements of
                    the Judge that the Interim Award would not and could not be revised, the 2011
                    Tribunal did precisely that when it expressly “revise[d]” the
                    Interim Award by issuing the Partial Award. In my view, nothing can be clearer
                    than the holding at [100.6(c)] of the Partial Award, which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This Partial Award <b><em>revises</em></b> the previous
                        majority Interim Award insofar as Heads of Claim Nos. 6 and 8 are
                        dismissed. [emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>What this holding means is that Heads of Claim Nos 6 and
                        8 are no longer part of or enforceable under the Interim Award. In effect,
                        the 2011 Tribunal has decided that DAB No 3 was wrong in so far as it
                        included in the Adjudicated Sum of US$17,298,834.57 the aggregate value of
                        Heads of Claim Nos 6 and 8 amounting to US$3,683,756.08. The Partial
                        Award has excluded two Heads of Claim from the Interim Award. Although the
                        Partial Award is expressed to revise only the Interim Award and not DAB
                        No 3, in reality, it has indirectly revised DAB No 3.
                        Consequently, if DAB No 3 is still binding on the parties
                        (notwithstanding the express words of cl 20.4[4] of the Conditions of
                        Contract), it can only be for the reduced sum of
                    US$13,615,078.49.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_230"></a>230    Another point to note is that one of the
                    issues before the 2011 Tribunal at the hearing that led to the issuance of the
                    Partial Award was “[w]hether there was collusion between the DAB and
                    [CRW] and/or bad faith on the part of the DAB in reaching [DAB No 3], or
                    bad faith on the part of [CRW] in seeking to enforce [DAB No 3]”
                    [emphasis in original omitted] (at [68] of the Partial Award). The 2011 Tribunal
                    summarised PGN’s argument on this point at [69] of the Partial Award as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[PGN’s] global objection to [DAB No 3] is that there was
                        collusion with [CRW] and/or bad faith on the part of the DAB. [PGN relies]
                        on (inter alia) the fact that the DAB came up with its own basis in the
                        evaluation of certain claims, including some which had never been presented
                        by [CRW], “corrected” records and drafted the witness
                        statement of Boy Eka Setiabudi (one of [CRW’s] witnesses) dated
                        24 November 2008, on behalf of [CRW].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>After examining the relevant provisions of the 1998 ICC Rules
                        of Arbitration and the Indonesian Civil Code, the 2011 Tribunal concluded
                        that PGN had failed to prove either collusion or bad faith and dismissed
                        PGN’s argument (at [70]–[84] of the Partial Award). Supposing,
                        however, that the 2011 Tribunal had found in favour of PGN on the issue of
                        bad faith and/or collusion, the tribunal would surely have set aside DAB
                        No 3, just as it had revised DAB No 3 after considering the
                        evidence on whether the DAB was correct in including Heads of Claim
                        Nos 6 and 8 in DAB No 3. If the 2011 Tribunal had set aside DAB
                        No 3, it would also have set aside the Interim Award, just as it had
                        (via the Partial Award) expressly revised the Interim Award on the facts. If
                        that had been the case, would the Interim Award nonetheless currently still
                        remain extant and “final and binding” under s 19B of the
                        IAA? If so, it would mean that the 2011 Tribunal’s award setting aside
                        DAB No 3 (assuming such an award had been made) has no legal effect,
                        just as the Partial Award has no legal effect because it revised the Interim
                        Award contrary to s 19B of the IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_231"></a>231    In my view, the fact that the 2011 Tribunal
                    issued the Partial Award to <em>expressly revise</em> the
                    Interim Award supports PGN’s argument that all along, the 2011 Majority
                    Arbitrators intended to issue the Interim Award as, in substance, an alterable
                    or revisable award. The Interim Award was meant to be provisional and binding on
                    the parties only until the final adjudication of their primary dispute over the
                    merits of DAB No 3. Indeed, the words of s 39(3) of the UKAA
                    (reproduced earlier at [202] above) encapsulate exactly what the 2011 Tribunal
                    did in relation to the Interim Award when it issued the Partial Award. I set out
                    again s 39(3) of the UKAA below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Any such order shall be subject to the tribunal’s final
                        adjudication; and the tribunal’s final award, on the merits or as to
                        costs, shall take account of any such order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_232"></a>232    Accordingly, for all the reasons given
                    above, I find that the Interim Award was, and was intended to be, in substance a
                    provisional award. As such, it is not an “award” that is
                    recognised under the IAA, and is therefore not enforceable under s 19 of
                    the IAA in the same manner as a judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Concluding remarks</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_233"></a>233    It has taken more than six and a half years
                    since DAB No 3 was issued on 25 November 2008 to reach the stage when,
                    given the Majority Judgment dismissing the present appeals by PGN, CRW is now
                    able to enforce the Interim Award in the same manner as a judgment. But, that
                    may not bring matters to a close as the Partial Award still stands. The
                    following issues come to mind:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_233-p2_a"></a>(a)     Can the Interim Award be enforced
                        against PGN for the whole of the Adjudicated Sum of US$17,298,834.57,
                        whether in Singapore or elsewhere, when that sum has been revised downwards
                        to US$13,615,078.49 by the Partial Award?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_233-p2_b"></a>(b)     If the Interim Award can be enforced for the
                        whole of the Adjudicated Sum, does it mean that the Partial Award has no
                        legal effect because: (i) the 2011 Tribunal had no power to issue the
                        Partial Award to revise the Interim Award in the face of s 19B of the
                        IAA; and/or (ii) the Partial Award may be disregarded as having no
                        legal effect on the Interim Award (which, it should be noted, is an
                        unexecuted award)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_233-p2_c"></a>(c)     On the other hand, if the Interim Award can only be enforced for the
                        reduced sum of US$13,615,078.49 (because CRW wishes or is directed by the
                        court to give effect to the Partial Award), does it not mean that in effect,
                        the Interim Award has been revised by the Partial Award, notwithstanding
                        s 19B of the IAA?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>These issues will
                        not arise if the court is prepared to recognise the Interim Award as being,
                        in substance, a provisional award that is outside the ambit of an
                        “award” as defined in s 2 of the
                IAA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_234"></a>234    I have observed earlier that if PGN has
                    assets in Singapore, CRW could have sued PGN in Singapore from the inception
                    upon PGN’s failure to make prompt payment of the Adjudicated Sum. After
                    more than six and a half years, CRW has now obtained a judgment (<em>viz</em>, the Majority Judgment) which is no different from
                    the judgment which it might have obtained had it sued PGN in Singapore at the
                    outset as posited. If PGN currently has no assets in Singapore, CRW will have to
                    enforce the Interim Award either in Indonesia (PGN’s country of
                    incorporation) or in some other jurisdiction where PGN has assets. Such
                    enforcement proceedings will take time. In the meantime, the adjudication by the
                    2011 Tribunal on the remaining seven Heads of Claim is on-going and will be
                    resolved sooner or later. It remains to be seen whether CRW will be able to
                    enforce the Interim Award against PGN before the 2011 Tribunal renders its final
                    award on the parties’ primary dispute over the merits of DAB
                    No 3.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_235"></a>235    For the reasons given above, I hold
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_235-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Interim Award was issued with
                        regard to a dispute (<em>ie</em>, the enforceability
                        dispute) which was not a dispute that was referable to arbitration under
                        cl 20.6 of the Conditions of Contract;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_235-p2_b"></a>(b)     the 2011 Majority Arbitrators had no mandate
                        under cl 20.6 of the Conditions of Contract to issue the Interim Award
                        to enforce DAB No 3 pending the 2011 Tribunal’s final
                        adjudication on the parties’ primary dispute over the merits of DAB
                        No 3; and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_235-p2_c"></a>(c)     even if the 2011 Majority Arbitrators had the requisite mandate to
                        issue the Interim Award pending the 2011 Tribunal’s decision on the
                        primary dispute, the Interim Award was, and was intended to be, in substance
                        a provisional award that fell outside the ambit of an “award”
                        as defined in s 2 of the IAA, and was thus not enforceable under
