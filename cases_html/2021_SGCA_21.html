As such, Ong had allegedly breached his fiduciary duties to SHGCC. Written grounds in that suit, dismissing SHGCC’s claims, were released on 7 May 2018 (“the Malaysian Judgment”).

</div> For the purposes of the present action in Singapore and this appeal, two substantive issues arise from the Malaysian Judgment. First, whether Borneo Ventures had indeed breached the warranties given in the SA. Second, whether the Malaysian Judgment binds Borneo Ventures either under the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res</span><span class="font-italic"> judicata</span>, the principles of issue estoppel or abuse of process. Just to complete the picture, we should add that the Judge held that the Malaysian Judgment does not bind Borneo Ventures and that Ong had breached the warranties he gave in the SA.

Ong argues that the Subject Land was in fact subject to PHSB/OBSB’s proprietary interests, as those interests arose from the Common Expectation that the developer of the Co-Gen Facility would be the occupier, as well as owner, of the Subject Land. This contention necessarily means that SHGCC was <span class="font-italic">not </span>the sole legal and beneficial owner of the Subject Land. If this contention is valid, that would mean that there was a breach of the Land Warranty. Moreover, even if PHSB/OBSB was found <span class="font-italic">not</span> to have had any proprietary interest in the land (as the Judge concluded), Ong would necessarily have breached the Land Warranty when OBSB obtained an interest in the Subject Land under the S&amp;P.

Listing 94.9 hectares as SHGCC’s effective land area in the 2013 Valuation Report was hardly proof that SHGCC did not own the Subject Land, much less that PHSB had a proprietary interest in the land. Indeed, the Subject Land was excluded from valuation not because the valuer had surveyed the Sembulan Land himself to determine SHGCC’s assets, but because Ong himself had specifically instructed the valuer to exclude this portion.

</div> This arrangement stood in sharp contrast to the restructuring of the Maybank Loan given to PHSB. There, the Sembulan Land was put up as security as well. However, the charge created pursuant to the restructured Maybank Loan made no exclusions, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Subject Land was not excluded from the security provided by SHGCC for the restructuring of the Maybank Loan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 According to Ong, the difference between the two arrangements demonstrated that PHSB had an interest in the Subject Land. Where security arrangements did <span class="font-italic">not</span> involve PHSB and its creditors (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the SS Agreement), any pledge of security excluded the Subject Land. Where arrangements <span class="font-italic">did</span> involve PHSB and its creditors (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> the Maybank Loan), the Subject Land would not be excluded from the security, presumably because PHSB had the requisite interest in the land to offer it as security for its loans. Ong contends that these documents were available to the due diligence team of Borneo Ventures as the SA was being prepared. Accordingly, a comparison between the Maybank Loan and the SS Agreement would have revealed PHSB’s proprietary interest in the Subject Land. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Again, we find the comparison drawn between the Maybank Loan and the SS Agreement to be strained and tenuous. In fact, it is not obvious that such a comparison was warranted at all. Moreover, the inferences that Ong urges us to draw are neither intuitive nor compelling. If PHSB’s proprietary interest in the Subject Land is as obvious as he claims it to be, it is curious that such mental gymnastics are required to establish his case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The third document that Ong relies on is a caveat lodged by Bank Islam (“the Bank Islam Caveat”) dated 6 December 2010.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> We recognise that such a caveat could be interpreted to mean that Bank Islam believed PHSB had an interest in the Subject Land. Why else would Bank Islam have lodged a caveat against the land? But Bank Islam’s belief said little about PHSB’s <span class="font-italic">actual</span> proprietary interest in the Subject Land. In any case, this was just one possibility, bearing in mind that the security could well have been provided by SHGCC (the owner of the entire Sembulan Land), and that it is not uncommon for related parties to provide security for each other in loan situations. Moreover, even if we accepted that the Bank Islam Caveat evinced PHSB’s interest in the Subject Land, it was unclear how this would suggest that <span class="font-italic">OBSB </span>had a similar interest in the Subject Land or how this amounted to a disclosure of the same. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 For these reasons, we agree with the assessment of the Judge that Ong had not made any disclosure that PHSB had a proprietary interest in the Subject Land to enable Ong to enjoy the benefit provided under cl 8A(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(i) of the SA. No reasonable person in the position of Borneo Ventures would have thought that PHSB had such a proprietary interest in the Subject Land when the entire Sembulan Land was on record as belonging to SHGCC. We note that Ong was careful to have instructed the valuer, in preparing the 2013 Valuation Report, to exclude the Subject Land from valuation. But he, for reasons not disclosed, chose not to inform the valuer why that portion of the Land should be excluded from the valuation. We would ask the same question too – why did he not simply inform the representatives of Borneo Ventures that that portion of the land did not belong to SHGCC but to PHSB? We could not find any reasonable basis to disagree with the Judge who thought that the non-disclosure was part of Ong’s plan to steal a march on Borneo Ventures by surreptitiously removing the Subject Land from SHGCC right before completion of the SA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In the result, we agree with the Judge that there was a breach of the Land Warranty on Ong’s part and that he is not entitled to enjoy the limitation of liability accorded under cl 8A(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)(i) of the SA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Asset Disposal Warranty </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 As for the Asset Disposal Warranty, a plain reading of the relevant provisions would suggest that this warranty was really intended to prevent the sellers from dissipating the assets <span class="font-italic">of the company that was being sold</span>. If, instead, an asset was simply being returned to its rightful owner, such an act would not count as an asset disposal that breaches the warranty. Indeed, paragraphs 4.1(c) and 4.1(g) suggest that it is <span class="font-italic">SHGCC</span>’s assets that must have been “sold, abandoned, or [disposed of]”, for there to have been a breach of the Asset Disposal Warranty. Therefore, the inquiry turns to determining whether the Subject Land was <span class="font-italic">SHGCC’s</span> property. That further depends on whether the Malaysian Judgment’s holding on that issue should be recognised or not. We address this below at [48].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Arm’s Length Warranty</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 As for the Arm’s Length Warranty, the preliminary question would be whether the S&amp;P was a transaction conducted at an arm’s length. The requirement for transactions to have been conducted on an “arm’s length” basis speaks to two main concerns. The first is taxation (see paragraph 6.6(b) of Schedule 2 of the SA). Transactions not conducted at an arm’s length basis may be regarded as attempts to circumvent capital gains tax and other tax regulations. If such transactions are only discovered post-acquisition, the company may be liable to penalties for tax avoidance. The second concern is independence (see paragraphs 11.1 and 11.2(a) of Schedule 2 of the SA). Transactions not conducted at an arm’s length basis may be regarded as attempts to enrich related/connected parties at the expense of the company that is being acquired. Warranties such as those found in paragraphs 11.1 and 11.2(a) of Schedule 2 exist to protect purchasers in an acquisition, by ensuring that they do not inherit a shell of a company when the acquisition is completed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In view of the mischief that the Arm’s Length Warranty was designed to address, a proper characterisation of the S&amp;P is critical. In other words, was it a mere formalisation of PHSB/OBSB’s proprietary interest in the Subject Land (such an interest arising from proprietary estoppel founded on the Common Expectation) or was it an attempt by Ong to steal a march on Borneo Ventures by surreptitiously removing the Subject Land from SHGCC right before completion of the SA? This again, depends on whether the Malaysian Judgment’s holding on PHSB/OBSB’s proprietary interest in the Subject Land should be recognised. To this question, we now turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Recognition of Malaysian Judgment, issue estoppel and abuse of process   </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Recognition of the Malaysian Judgment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Before a foreign judgment is taken to be <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>, the preliminary issue is whether it should be recognised at all: <span class="font-italic">Humpuss Sea Transport Pte Ltd (in compulsory liquidation) v PT Humpuss Intermoda Transportasi TBK and another</span> [2016] 5 SLR 1322 (“<span class="font-italic">Humpuss</span>”) at [65]–[66]. According to <span class="font-italic">Humpuss </span>at [67], under the common law, a foreign judgment will be recognised if: (a) it is a final and conclusive judgment of a court which, (b) according to the private international law of Singapore, had jurisdiction to grant the judgment and (c) if there is no defence to its recognition. The Judge found the first two elements were fulfilled but declined to recognise the Malaysian Judgment on the ground that it had been procured by fraud.

</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Broadly speaking, foreign judgments will not be recognised if they had been procured by one of two types of fraud. The first is extrinsic fraud (<span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>bribery of a solicitor, counsel or witness, or collusion with a representative party to the prejudice of beneficial interest:<span class="font-italic"> Eleven Gesellschaft Zur Entwicklung Und Vermarktung Von Netzwerktechonologien MBH v Boxsentry Pte Ltd </span>[2014] SGHC 210 (“<span class="font-italic">Boxsentry</span>”) at [103]). This type of fraud may be simply pleaded without any special restrictions. The second type of fraud is intrinsic fraud (<span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>fraud which is “imputed from alleged false statements made at the trial, which were met by counter-statements by the other side, and the whole adjudicated upon by the Court and so passed on into the limbo of estoppel by the judgment”: <span class="font-italic">Hong Pian Tee v Les Placements German Gauthier Inc</span> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 515 (“<span class="font-italic">Hong Pian Tee”</span>) at [20]). Foreign judgments can only be challenged on the ground of intrinsic fraud if “fresh evidence has come to light which reasonable diligence on the part of the defendant would not have uncovered and the fresh evidence would have been likely to make a difference in the eventual result of the case”: <span class="font-italic">Hong Pian Tee </span>at [30]. The distinction between the two types of fraud has been variously described as fraud going to the jurisdiction of the court (extrinsic fraud) and fraud going to the merits of the judgment (intrinsic fraud); perjury during discovery (extrinsic fraud) and perjury at trial (intrinsic fraud); or fraud taking place outside trial (extrinsic fraud) as opposed to within trial (intrinsic fraud): <span class="font-italic">Boxsentry </span>at [103] and [108]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 We are of the view that no matter how Ong and OBSB’s actions in the Malaysian Suit are characterised, they are not sufficient to justify denying recognition of the Malaysian Judgment. If the allegation was that there had been extrinsic fraud, it would have been a result of Ong and OBSB’s failure to disclose all material facts at trial. The real question in such a situation would be whether such perjury <span class="font-italic">produced</span> the judgment given: <span class="font-italic">Boxsentry </span>at [108]. With respect, the Judge’s catalogue of Ong’s omissions does not sufficiently address the point whether the perjury produced the judgment or not. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 For example, the Judge took the view that there was no Common Expectation because Ong was in charge of both PHSB and SHGCC at that time. According to her, it was meaningless to speak of a “common” expectation when the reality was that Ong was “talk[ing] to himself” and executing a unilaterally conceived plan (see [23(a)] above). The Judge found that this absurdity was not appreciated by the Malaysian court but did not analyse how any of Ong’s omissions could have been the effective cause of the Malaysian court’s finding.

</div> It is true that the Malaysian court was not apprised of PHSB’s financial arrangements for repaying its loans. But with respect, the source of the funds should not matter. What is important is that PHSB took on debts and liabilities in reliance on the Common Expectation. That much is clear here. PHSB did take up the Maybank Loan to build the Co-Gen Facility and we are inclined to agree with the Malaysian court

Again, it is true that the Malaysian court was not apprised of OBSB’s financial arrangements to procure the money for this purchase. But again, we are not able to see why the source of funds should matter. The Malaysian court held that “[it] is inconceivable that someone would pay the redemption sum of RM33.6million for those assets unless the redeemer expects or is assured that the land on which the assets were constructed would belong to him.”

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  ROA Vol. 5 Part 22, p 135 - Suit No. BKI – 22NCvC – 21/2-2016 (Judgment 7 May 2018) at lines 992 – 995.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This reasoning is not only logical, it is consistent with business sense and we do not see any flaw in it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Finally, the Judge evidently took a dim view of Ong’s integrity. She pointed to the fact that Ong did not disclose to the Malaysian court that the Bank Islam Loan was for working capital, not the development of the Co-Gen Facility. Ong was also effectively enriching himself since he owned the construction company that was tasked to build the Co-Gen Facility. The Co-Gen Facility itself proved to be a flop since it only supplied electricity for three years under PHSB and one year under OBSB before halting operations completely. But all these facts simply do not go towards showing whether there was a Common Expectation, or whether there was reliance on the Common Expectation on the part of PHSB/OBSB. In other words, these omissions in our view, did not seriously hobble the Malaysian court’s ultimate findings <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>the Common Expectation and the proprietary estoppel that was established on the facts before the Malaysian court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 If the suggestion is that the Malaysian Judgment had been procured by <span class="font-italic">intrinsic </span>fraud, we are similarly of the view that this has not been established. Intrinsic fraud can only be pleaded under special circumstances. There must be new evidence that emerged after trial and such evidence must have been beyond the reach of the complaining party’s reasonable diligence. We cannot see how any of the additional evidence adduced (<span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> the SS Agreement, the tenancy agreements between SHGCC and PHSB, the ownership structure of the company that built the Co-Gen Facility) was not discoverable or beyond the reach of reasonable diligence of either SHGCC or Borneo Ventures (which was in control of SHGCC at the time of the Malaysian Suit). Even if the evidence was fresh evidence that could not have been discovered at that stage, we are of the view that the new evidence would not have been material to the Malaysian court’s findings. In that regard, we reiterate what has been discussed earlier at [50]-[54].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In our view, the Malaysian Judgment was <span class="font-italic">not </span>procured by fraud. There is therefore no bar to its recognition by our courts. We turn next to the question of whether the Malaysian Suit gives rise to <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>. As Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) stated in <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck and others </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 453 (<span class="font-italic">“Goh Nellie</span>”) at [17], “the umbrella doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>encompasses three conceptually distinct though interrelated principles.” These are cause of action estoppel, issue estoppel, and the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> (otherwise known as the doctrine of abuse of process). Cause of action estoppel was not pleaded and that was correct because the Malaysian Suit and the present proceedings involve entirely different causes of action. We move next to consider issue estoppel and the defence of abuse of process. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue Estoppel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In <span class="font-italic">Lee Tat Development </span><span class="font-italic">Pte Ltd v Management Corporation of Strata Plan No 301 </span>[2005] 3 SLR(R) 157 this court spelt out the four elements which must be present to raise issue estoppel (at [14] – [15]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) there must be a final and conclusive judgment on the merits; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) that judgment must be of a court of competent jurisdiction; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) there must be identity of parties in relation to the two actions; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) there must be an identity of subject matter in the two actions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 It is beyond question, and here we agree with the Judge, that the first two elements are fulfilled in the present case.

</div>
</div> However, with respect, we are unable to concur with the Judge on the other two elements, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, identity of parties and identity of subject matter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the court there, having reviewed the authorities, stated (at [32]) that “the courts have not taken a narrow view of what [identity of parties] means”. <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie </span>further reiterated that issue estoppel may arise in civil actions between the same parties or their <span class="font-italic">privies</span> – see also <span class="font-italic">Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police </span>[1982] AC 529 at 541. The Malaysian Suit and the present action involved common defendants. The plaintiffs in the respective actions are, however, different. The question, therefore, is whether SHGCC can be regarded as Borneo Ventures’ privy. In that regard, “the required commonality is a direct interest in the subject matter of the litigation, a parallel or corresponding interest in that subject matter and not simply a financial interest in the result of the action”: <span class="font-italic">China North Industries Investment Ltd v Ronald RC Chum &amp; Ors </span>[2007] HKCU 2128<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [81]. What then, would qualify as a “direct interest in that subject matter”? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In <span class="font-italic">Canam Enterprises Inc. v Coles </span>47 O.R. (3d) 446 (<span class="font-italic">“Canam”</span>), the plaintiff sued the defendant-solicitor who had previously represented the former in an unsuccessful action against a mortgagee. The defendant-solicitor was estopped from adding that mortgagee as a third party to the proceedings. In that case, the solicitor and his client had parallel interests in the subject matter of the litigation. Nordheimer J held, at [24], that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the proper resolution of the issue may be tested by observing what would have occurred had [the plaintiff] been successful in the Mortgage action and avoided liability on the mortgage. There can be no doubt that [the defendant-solicitor] would have claimed the benefit of [the plaintiff’s] success as relieving him from any possible liability to [the plaintiff]. If [the defendant-solicitor] could claim the benefit of [the plaintiff’s] success, it seems fair that he should equally bear the burden of [the plaintiff’s] failure…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In much the same way, had SHGCC succeeded in the Malaysian Suit against OBSB and Ong, Borneo Ventures would have been able to claim that there had been a contractually prohibited asset disposal and that there had been a contractually prohibited transaction conducted not at arm’s length. These would have amounted to breaches of the Arm’s Length and Asset Disposal Warranties. Borneo Ventures would, in other words, have been able to claim the benefit of SHGCC’s favourable judgment against OBSB. In the circumstances, SHGCC is undoubtedly the privy of Borneo Ventures.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Borneo Ventures contends otherwise. It cites <span class="font-italic">Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 301 </span>[2009] 1 SLR(R) 875 (“<span class="font-italic">Lee Tat </span>2009”) at [51] for the proposition that “a person who litigates in different rights is in law separate persons” [emphasis in original omitted].

</div>
</div>
</div> It then points to the fact that the Malaysian Suit involved SHGCC holding its director to account while the present matter involved Borneo Ventures enforcing its contractual rights. Identity of parties is therefore not established. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 We disagree. The statement quoted in the preceding paragraph and cited from <span class="font-italic">Lee Tat 2009</span> is not applicable here. The question there was whether, notwithstanding the fact that the parties were <span class="font-italic">identical</span> in the two suits, they could be treated as separate persons in law. That was answered by reference to the nature of the rights which the parties sought to enforce in the two suits. Here, the query differs. The question is whether, notwithstanding the fact that the parties are <span class="font-italic">different</span> in the two suits, the law may treat them as the same. This is answered by considering whether there is a privity of interest between these different parties in their respective suits. For the reasons discussed above, there certainly is privity of interest in the present matter. We would also like to add that it would be taking a myopic view to assert that the Malaysian Suit only concerned SHGCC and its attempt to hold its directors to account. That was only one aspect. The central question in that suit concerned the existence of a Common Expectation between SHGCC and OBSB which, if it existed, would in turn affect who had proprietary interest in the Subject Land. Indeed, in the suit, because of the eventual finding of the court on the central matter of Common Expectation, the issue of holding the directors of SHGCC to account did not arise.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Moreover, we are of the view that where group companies are concerned, the rules governing identity of parties (which already eschew excessively technical distinctions/formulations) should have regard to the special relationship which exists between those companies within the corporate structure. When such companies have demonstrably vested interests in each other or other close connections (for example, when they effectively share the same assets portfolio, as was the case here), those circumstances would be relevant factors for the court to take into account to determine whether there was privity of interest between them.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 We will now pause to highlight certain facts of this case. At the time the Malaysian Suit was brought against Ong and OBSB, Borneo Ventures was already the majority shareholder (holding 77.5% of the shareholding) of SH Group. SHGCC was wholly owned by SH Group and was thus under the control of Borneo Ventures. Borneo Ventures was effectively conducting the claim made by SHGCC in the Malaysian Suit against Ong and OBSB. It lost. There was clear identity of interest between Borneo Ventures and SHGCC and the latter was clearly the privy of the former in the Malaysian Suit. It would be unjust, and indeed in our view outrageous, that Borneo Ventures could still claim, in the present action, that it was not bound by the decision of the Malaysian Court on the question of PHSB/OBSB’s proprietary entitlement to the Subject Land.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66  As for identity of subject matter, both suits (the Malaysian Suit as well as the present action) turned on the specific issue of who owned the Subject Land. The Malaysian Suit found that SHGCC owned it (legally speaking) but was estopped from enforcing its strict legal rights in relation to the Subject Land. As such, Ong had not breached his fiduciary duties to SHGCC when he agreed to transfer the Subject Land to OBSB for a nominal consideration. The present action also turns on whether PHSB/OBSB had a proprietary interest in the Subject Land. If PHSB/OBSB is found to have an interest in the Subject Land, it cannot truly be said that there had been a breach of either the Asset Disposal or Arm’s Length Warranty (see [45] – [46] above). As such, we differ from the Judge and hold that there was identity of subject matter for the purposes of issue estoppel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Borneo Ventures acknowledges that the Common Expectation came up in both the Malaysian Suit and in the present action. But it contends that the Common Expectation point was raised in the service of different arguments. In the Malaysian Suit, it was raised in order to determine OBSB’s proprietary interest in the Subject Land. In the present proceedings, it was raised to ascertain Ong’s state of mind in the lead-up to the SA. That is, whether Ong should have disclosed OBSB’s proprietary interest to Borneo Ventures.

</div>
</div> These being different matters, issue estoppel did not arise. We disagree. Borneo Ventures cannot cast doubt on the Common Expectation point without attacking the Malaysian Judgment. The Common Expectation was a fundamental plank of the Malaysian Judgment. In fact, it was one of the elements that had to be established to make out a finding of proprietary estoppel, which was in turn the entire basis of the judgment. Any attempt to cast doubt on that finding (concerning the Common Expectation) is effectively an attempt to re-litigate the same point. Accordingly, we are not persuaded by Borneo Ventures’ arguments on the question of<span class="font-italic"> </span>identity of subject matter either.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Having established identity of parties and identity of subject matter, Ong has shown that he is entitled to raise the defence of issue estoppel. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Abuse of Process/Extended Doctrine of Res Judicata</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 As for the defence of abuse of process, the doctrine was best summarised in <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie </span>at [41]: “where the issue ought to have been raised [in the earlier proceeding] and was not, it might nonetheless amount to an abuse of process subsequently to litigate that same issue”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The Judge rejected this defence because in her view Borneo Ventures could not have joined in as a co-plaintiff to SHGCC’s claim in the Malaysian Suit.

</div> First, the causes of action were different. The present matter involved Borneo Ventures enforcing its contractual rights under the SA. On the other hand, the Malaysian Suit concerned, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, Ong’s alleged breaches of fiduciary duties owed to SHGCC as its director. OBSB was joined as a co-defendant on the basis that it would have been privy to such a breach. Second, the applicable laws were different as well. The present action centred on the SA which was governed by Singapore law (per cl 12.15(a) of the SA).

</div>
</div> The Malaysian Suit related to Ong’s conduct in effecting a transfer of the Subject Land to OBSB. The law governing the transfer of the Subject Land, according to the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">lex situs</span>, would have been Malaysian law. For these reasons, the Judge took the view that the present action and the Malaysian Suit were fundamentally different proceedings. Ong, therefore, was not being sued twice over the same issues.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 With respect, we disagree. The law relating to the doctrine of abuse of process was set out by this court in <span class="font-italic">Lim Geok Lin Andy v Yap Jin Meng Bryan and another appeal </span>[2017] 2 SLR 760 (“<span class="font-italic">Andy Lim</span>”). There (at [38]), the court affirmed that the legal test is a fact specific one, depending on all the circumstances of a case, including: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the later proceedings are nothing more than a collateral attack upon the previous decision;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether there is fresh evidence that warranted re-litigation; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether there are <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>reasons why an issue which ought to have been raised in the earlier action was not; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) whether there are other special circumstances that justify allowing the case to proceed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Ultimately, the defence will be successfully raised where “<span class="font-italic">some connection </span>can be shown between the party seeking to relitigate the issue and the earlier proceeding where that essential issue was litigated, which would make it unjust to allow that party to reopen the issue” [emphasis in original] (at [44]). Repeated claims by the same plaintiffs or repeated claims against the same defendant are not necessarily the critical factor. Fairness or oppressiveness, as demonstrated by the facts of the case, is the decisive factor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In <span class="font-italic">Andy Lim</span>, the appellant (“Lim”) had been subpoenaed as a witness in an earlier set of proceedings (“the 2010 Suit”). There, his testimony supported the plaintiff’s (“Park”) claim for a share of profits. Lim, in his testimony at those proceedings, had claimed that he too had been entitled to a share of the profits. The Judge dismissed Lim’s bare assertion for lack of proof. This finding was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. When the 2010 Suit proceeded to consider the account of profits, Lim belatedly applied to intervene in the proceedings. Ultimately, this application was dismissed as well in <span class="font-italic">Andy Lim</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 <span class="font-italic">Andy Lim </span>supports a finding of abuse of process in the present action for two reasons. First, it recognised that the defence of abuse of process can be successfully invoked where the <span class="font-italic">same defendant </span>has been sued twice by different plaintiffs on identical issues which had already been determined in an earlier action: <span class="font-italic">Andy Lim </span>at [43]. That is plainly the case here too. Ong has defended the existence of the Common Expectation in two separate suits brought against him by two separate plaintiffs (SHGCC and Borneo Ventures). As stated earlier (at [63]), we regard Borneo Ventures’ submissions on the Common Expectation as an unacceptable collateral attack on the Malaysian Judgment. Second, in <span class="font-italic">Andy </span><span class="font-italic">Lim</span>, Lim’s entitlement to a share of profits was “not strictly an issue” in the 2010 Suit. Notwithstanding this, his later attempt to re-litigate the issue was dismissed as an abuse of process. In the present action, the proprietary interest in the Subject Land was <span class="font-italic">squarely </span>an issue already decided in the Malaysian Suit. As stated in [65] above, Borneo Ventures was in fact conducting the Malaysia Suit on behalf of SHGCC. Borneo Ventures’ attempt in the present action to relitigate the same issue is clearly oppressive to Ong and is an abuse of process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Moreover, with regard to the Judge’s reasoning (as stated above at [70]), we see no reason why Borneo Ventures could not simply have applied to join in the Malaysian Suit and requested the Malaysian court to apply Singapore law in relation to Borneo Ventures allegations of breaches of warranties given in the SA. If the concern was <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens</span>, there were sufficient factors militating in favour of Borneo Ventures lodging its claims in Malaysia. For one, that would have housed all related proceedings in one setting, with the benefit of a full, holistic perspective on all aspects of the acquisition contemplated in the SA. Second, it is doubtful that initiating a claim in a Malaysian court would really give rise to serious inconvenience to Borneo Ventures (which is incorporated in Singapore). Yet, Borneo Ventures did not even attempt to litigate the entire matter in one forum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In fact, Borneo Ventures’ attempt to characterise the Malaysian Judgment as having been procured by fraud (when such an allegation was not even pleaded) runs contrary to its stated position all along. In the earlier stages of the present action in Singapore, it: (a) asserted that the issue of ownership was irrelevant to the present matter; (b) admitted that SHGCC was estopped from denying OBSB’s proprietary interest; and (c) even <span class="font-italic">relied </span>upon the finding of the Malaysian court (that OBSB had a proprietary interest in the Subject Land) to assert that this “confirm[ed]” that Ong had breached the various warranties in the SA.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 For these reasons, we are of the view that Borneo Ventures’ attempts to challenge the Malaysian court’s finding on the issue of the Common Expectation were an abuse of process. For clarity, we do not regard the entire action in these courts as an abuse of process – it is not. Our opinion here is confined only to Borneo Ventures’ arguments on the Common Expectation issue and the challenges to OBSB’s proprietary interest in the Subject Land. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Accordingly, in light of the discussions at [48] to [76] above and recognising and accepting the Malaysian court’s findings in relation to the issue of the proprietary interest in the Subject Land, we hold, contrary to the Judge’s findings, that the Asset Disposal and Arm’s Length Warranties were not breached and the claims of Borneo Ventures on those premises fail.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The appropriate relief </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 As found above at [32] and [44], the Land Warranty was breached and Ong could not avail himself of the protection of the limitation of liability clauses. To that extent, Borneo Ventures succeeds (albeit partially) in its action. The next question we need to consider is whether the Judge was correct to have granted to Borneo Ventures an injunction requiring Ong not to transfer the proprietary interest in the Subject Land to OBSB. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Generally, the contractual remedy for a breach of warranty is an award of damages: Robert Thompson, <span class="font-italic">Sinclair on Warranties and Indemnities on Share and Asset Sales </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 9th Ed, 2014) at para 3-01. This will be the standard relief until and unless damages are shown to be an inadequate remedy: JD Heydon AC, M J Leeming, P G Turner, <span class="font-italic">Meagar, Gummow &amp; Lehane’s Equity Doctrines and Remedies </span>(LexisNexis, 5th Ed, 2015) at 20-030. Damages may be inadequate for a variety of reasons. The broad rule is that damages are inadequate where the subject matter of the contract is special and only specific performance can vindicate the (unfulfilled) expectation interest. Illustrative examples are contracts for the sale of land (which the law recognises has special value/meaning) or unique chattels (<span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>rare china jars in <span class="font-italic">Falcke v Gray </span>(1859) 4 Drew 651 at 658; or prize-winning racehorses in <span class="font-italic">Borg v Howlett</span> (1996) 8 BPR 15, 535 at 538). When a plaintiff establishes his entitlement to specific performance, he may seek to enforce contracts by injunctions (as Borneo Ventures has sought to do): I.C.F. Spry, <span class="font-italic">The Principles of Equitable Remedies</span> – <span class="font-italic">Specific Performance, Injunctions, </span><span class="font-italic">Rectification and Equitable Damages</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 9th Ed, 2014) at p 590.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In the present case, there is no proof that damages would be an inadequate remedy for the breach. The expectation interest remained substantially unaffected. As Goi (GSH’s representative in the purchase) remarked, Borneo Ventures was “buying a 27-hole golf course, golf club and two hotels”.

</div> That was in substance, what it had intended to purchase. It has received all that. We appreciate that there could well be an argument that the SA contemplated the purchase of the Subject Land as well. Land, being of special value, is typically ordered to be transferred when a contract for the sale of such land falls through. But that would be assuming that SHGCC never intended to part with the Subject Land. Pertinently, in the Malaysian Judgment, it was held that the proprietary interest of the land lay with OBSB, not SHGCC. For the reasons set out in [48] to [76] above, we have recognised and accepted that finding. SHGCC cannot now, attempt to claim the land by a backdoor mandatory injunction. Indeed, the fact that the land was not part of the SA cannot truly be described as a ‘loss’. The Subject Land was never intended to be part of the SA in the first place (again, a finding made in the Malaysian Judgment that we have accepted). What then was the true loss here? The breach of the Land Warranty represented a lost opportunity for GSH to bargain for a lower purchasing price on account of that as well as potential tax liabilities. Payment of damages would adequately address the losses.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Damages and Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In our view, the appropriate amount of damages should be based on the fair market value of the Subject Land at the time of purchase, with interest. This would have been the amount that would have been deducted from the acquisition price if GSH had been properly apprised of the fact that the Subject Land was not part of the deal. The award of damages should also have regard to any tax liability incurred by SHGCC on account of the S&amp;P, and any tax penalties that SHGCC would be required to pay due to the S&amp;P. Based on the figure so arrived at, Ong should only pay to Borneo Ventures 77.5% of the same, as under the SA, Borneo Ventures only acquired 77.5% of the shares of SH Group and the remaining still belong to Ong.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Awarding the full measure (rather than 77.5%) of the sums described above would result in both a windfall for Borneo Ventures and an excessively punitive result for Ong. Borneo Ventures, in purchasing shares in the SH Group, only paid for 77.5% of the company. That meant it was only purchasing 77.5% of the SH Group’s assets. If the Subject Land had been inadvertently excluded from the purchase, it would mean that Borneo Ventures had been, in the most approximate sense, short-changed of 77.5% of the Subject Land. That is the loss which the damages should address. In a similar vein, any tax liability incurred by the SH Group due to the S&amp;P would have been shouldered by all of its shareholders, in an amount proportionate to their respective shareholdings: Borneo Ventures would have shouldered 77.5%, while Ong would have taken on 22.5%. To make Ong pay Borneo Ventures for <span class="font-italic">all</span> of the tax liability incurred (<span class="font-italic">ie. </span>100%) would have (a) overcompensated Borneo Ventures and (b) penalised Ong twice for the same wrongdoing. That would not be just. The fairer result is to apportion damages according to their respective shareholdings in the SH Group. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 We therefore order an inquiry be held before the Registrar to assess (a) the damages due to Borneo Ventures and (b) the rate and period for which interest should be payable on the sum of damages awarded. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In view of the fact that Ong has succeeded in relation to the issues of the Disposal Warranty and the Arm’s Length Warranty, as well as on the relief granted, we order that each party shall bear its own costs in relation to this appeal. As regards the question of costs at the trial, we think that the costs order made by the Judge ought to be adjusted with Borneo Ventures being entitled to only 50% of the costs at trial. As regards the costs of the Inquiry before the Registrar, we shall leave that to the Registrar, who will be best able to take into account the positions adopted by the parties on the matters he is tasked to inquire into and his eventual rulings on those matters.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Judith Prakash<br/>Justice of the Court of Appeal</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Chao Hick Tin<br/>Senior Judge</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Belinda Ang<br/>Judge of the Appellate Division</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><div class="txt-body text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-right">Lem Jit Min Andy, Selvaratnam Sharmini Sharon, Poon Pui Yee and Zhuang Changzhong (Harry Elias Partnership LLP) for the appellant.<br/>Teh Guek Ngor Engelin SC, Yeo Yian Hui Mark, Huen Hui Min Jessie and Lim Xiao Wei Charmaine (Engelin Teh Practice LLC) for the respondent.<br/></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
