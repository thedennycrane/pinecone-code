        V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal arises from the collapse of a tower
                    crane (“the Tower Crane”) at a project site at the National
                    University of Singapore Society Kent Ridge Guildhouse at Kent Ridge Drive/Law
                    Link (“the Project Site”) on 22 February 2008. Tragically,
                    the collapse of the Tower Crane resulted in the deaths of three
                        workers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Following this,
                    the main contractor for the project, Kimly Construction Private Limited
                    (“Kimly”), sued the sub-contractor, Lee Tong Boon trading as Rango
                    Machinery Services (“Rango”), from whom it had rented the Tower
                    Crane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Rango in turn brought in Tan Juay Pah
                    (“TJP”), the certifying mechanical engineer whom it had engaged to
                    inspect the Tower Crane, as a third party, claiming an indemnity against him in
                    the event that it was found liable to Kimly. TJP is a professional mechanical
                    engineer who is registered as an authorised examiner (“AE”) under
                    the Workplace Safety and Health Act (Cap 354A, 2007 Rev Ed)
                    (“the WSHA”) and its relevant regulations (these regulations and
                    the WSHA will hereafter be collectively referred to as “the WSH
                    Regime”). As an AE, TJP is authorised by the Ministry of Manpower
                    (“the MOM”) to inspect, test and certify lifting machines,
                    including tower cranes, as being safe for use.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       TJP then brought in Feng Tianming
                    (“Feng”), a professional civil and structural engineer, and FES
                    Engineering Pte Ltd (“FES”), the approved crane contractor, as
                    fourth parties, claiming an indemnity and/or contribution from them in turn.
                    Feng had been engaged by Rango to design and supervise the construction of the
                    foundation of the Tower Crane, while FES had been engaged by Rango to erect and
                    maintain the Tower Crane. (In this regard, we note that there is an
                    inconsistency in the decision by the trial judge (“the Judge”)
                    dated 28 January 2011 (<em>viz</em>, <em>Kimly Construction Pte Ltd v Lee Tong Boon (trading as Rango
                        Machinery Services) (Tan Juay Pah, third party; Feng Tianming and another,
                        fourth parties)</em> [2011] SGHC 26 (“the
                    Decision”)), which states both (at [9]) that FES was engaged by Kimly and (at [22]) that FES was engaged by Rango. We have
                    found that [22] of the Decision states
                    the correct position, <em>ie</em>, FES was engaged by
                        Rango.)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>

                        alia</em>, that (see [4]
                    of the Decision):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     Kimly succeeded in its claim against

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_c"></a>(c)     TJP’s claim against Feng and FES
                        was dismissed by virtue of TJP’s undertaking not to call any evidence
                        against them should his submission of “no case to answer” fail
                        (which turned out to be the case in the court below).</p>

                    the latter (“the Sub-Contract”). The material terms of the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[underlining and emphasis in bold in original; emphasis added in
                        italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Sub-Contract between Rango and Kimly
                    contained an express term (<em>viz</em>, cl 4.8) that
                    Rango would indemnify Kimly against “all claims, damages, costs,
                    expenses, litigation or liabilities made against or incurred by
                        Kimly”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> arising out
                    of Rango’s negligence or breach of the Sub-Contract. Unlike the agreement
                    between Rango and Kimly, which was reduced into writing in the form of the
                    Sub-Contract, Rango’s oral engagement of TJP on or around 15 August
                    2006 was not condensed into a written contract. Further, there is no evidence of
                    any agreement by TJP to indemnify Rango. On the evidence, no specific terms were
                    discussed between Rango and TJP. In particular, there was no discussion of any
                    term that TJP was to indemnify Rango. We find that there can be no doubt that
                    neither Rango nor TJP even remotely considered the issue of risk allocation
                    between themselves and non-parties to their contract in the event that TJP was
                    found wanting in the discharge of his professional obligations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       It is also undisputed that the fee which Rango
                    paid TJP for his services was just $716.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The structure of the Tower Crane</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Tower Crane was a saddle-jib crane. For our
                    purposes, the critical structural aspect of the Tower Crane was the mast anchor
                    assembly (located at the base of the mast), which comprised four mast anchors
                    (also known as foundation anchors or fixing angles) embedded in concrete. These
                    were identified as mast anchors #1 to #4 respectively. Each of the mast
                    anchors had five joints, identified as joints <em>a</em> to <em>e</em> respectively. The four mast
                    anchors were in turn connected to the four legs of a mast section by pin-joints.
                    The mast of the Tower Crane comprised seven mast sections (identified as
                    masts #1 to #7 respectively) placed one on top of the other, with the mast
                    anchors at its base.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> It is undisputed that the component
                    parts of the Tower Crane, including the mast anchors, were supplied by
                    Rango.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The erection of the Tower Crane</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Tower Crane was erected on
                    18 November 2006 and was used at the Project Site from that date until it
                    collapsed on 22 February 2008. Before it could be used at the Project Site,
                    certain requirements under the WSHA as well as the Workplace Safety and Health
                    (General Provisions) Regulations (Cap 354A, Rg 1, 2007 Rev Ed)
                    (“the WSH Regulations”), read with the “<font style="text-transform: uppercase;">Occupational Safety an[d] Health Division Guidelines for the
                        Submission for Use of Tower Crane in Factory Premises</font>”
                    issued by the MOM on 26 May 2005 (“the 2005 MOM Guidelines”),
                    had to be met. For the purposes of this appeal, the relevant version of the WSH
                    Regulations is that which was in force before the amendments introduced by the
                    Workplace Safety and Health (General Provisions) (Amendment) Regulations 2009
                    (No S 463/2009).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Prior to the erection of the Tower Crane on
                    18 November 2006, Feng had prepared the design drawings and calculations
                    according to which the Tower Crane was eventually erected. These drawings had
                    been submitted to the MOM on 14 September 2006 in order to seek its
                    approval for the use and operation of the Tower Crane. The MOM issued its
                    approval on 29 September 2006, and Feng proceeded to authorise the erection
                    of the Tower Crane. On 9 November 2006, Feng issued a Certificate of
                    Supervision certifying that: (a) he had supervised the foundation works for
                    and the erection of the Tower Crane; (b) the foundation works were
                    structurally sound and complied with all the requirements under the WSHA; and
                    (c) the Tower Crane was safe for use.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     It is undisputed that TJP carried out three
                    inspections of the Tower Crane as set out below:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     The first inspection was on
                        15 August 2006. As part of this inspection, TJP engaged Hi Tech NDT
                        Inspection Services (S) Pte Ltd (“Hi Tech”) to perform
                        non-destructive tests (“NDTs”) on certain critical parts of
                        the Tower Crane (but not the mast anchors). On 18 August 2006, prior to
                        the erection of the Tower Crane, TJP submitted a Third Party Inspection
                        Report to the MOM certifying that: (i) the critical parts of the Tower
                        Crane had been checked for surface flaws; (ii) thickness gauging had
                        been conducted at various points of the crane structure to ascertain the
                        thickness of the metal used; and (iii) the Tower Crane was of sound
                        material and was suitable for use. This Third Party Inspection Report had to
                        be submitted together with the “USE OF TOWER CRANE SUBMISSION
                        CHECKLIST” in Appendix 1 of the 2005 MOM Guidelines<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> (“the Use of Tower
                        Crane Checklist”) as the Tower Crane was more than eight years old
                        (see cl 3.3 of the 2005 MOM Guidelines).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     The second inspection was on 18 November
                        2006 after the Tower Crane had been erected at the Project Site. TJP
                        conducted a load test on the Tower Crane, then signed a Lifting Equipment
                        Certificate (prescribed in Appendix 5 of the 2005 MOM Guidelines)
                        certifying that the Tower Crane: (i) had been examined thoroughly as
                        far as construction permitted; (ii) complied in all respects with the
                        requirements pertaining to lifting equipment as stipulated under the WSH
                        Regulations; and (iii) was safe for use.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     The third inspection was a further
                        post-installation check on or around 20 November 2007. Thereafter, TJP
                        signed a second Lifting Equipment Certificate to the same effect as the
                        first (see the preceding sub-paragraph).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The collapse of the Tower Crane</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 22 February 2008, the Tower Crane,
                    after having been in use at the Project Site for more than a year, collapsed.
                    Part of the jib landed outside the Project Site, hitting two trees, which in
                    turn damaged a linkway, a bus stop sign and a few motorcycles parked in the
                    vicinity. The counterweight of the Tower Crane landed on the roof of a
                    substation, causing partial structural damage to it. Of the three workers killed
                    in the collapse, two were in the Tower Crane’s cabin. Of these two, one
                    was not an authorised crane operator.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Investigations into the cause of the collapse</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Matcor Technology &amp; Services Pte Ltd
                    (“Matcor”), a consultancy company providing services in forensic
                    failure investigation, materials assessment and advanced NDTs, was commissioned
                    by Kimly to investigate the general condition of the respective components of
                    the Tower Crane and determine the presence of any cracks that might have existed
                    prior to the collapse. Matcor was also commissioned by the MOM to investigate
                    and report on the causes behind the Tower Crane’s collapse. Matcor
                    prepared seven reports in total, three for Kimly and four for the
                MOM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The three reports which Matcor prepared for
                    Kimly were:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     Report No M08258 on the NDTs
                        done on the masts of the Tower Crane;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     Report No M08259 on the NDTs done on the jibs,
                        counter-jibs and A-frame of the Tower Crane; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     Report No M08260 analysing the
                        cracked sections of the Tower Crane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     These three reports were exhibited in the
                    affidavit of evidence-in-chief of David Tay, Kimly’s expert witness.
                    Unfortunately, none of these reports addressed the primary cause of the Tower
                    Crane’s collapse. Therefore, at the trial in the court below, Kimly relied
                    instead on one of the reports which Matcor prepared for the MOM, <em>viz</em>, Report No M08163 (“Report 163
                    (MOM)”). This report observed the presence of pre-existing cracks in
                        joint <em>e</em> of each of the four mast anchors
                    and joint <em>b</em> of mast anchor #4. It also
                    observed cracks and porosity in the columns of mast #1. (The cracks in the
                    mast anchors and mast #1 will hereafter be collectively referred to as
                    “the Pre-Existing Cracks”.) Report 163 (MOM), however, drew
                    no conclusions as to the cause of the Tower Crane’s collapse. The Judge in
                    fact held that this report “bore the appearance of a preliminary report
                    before further testing was carried out” (see the Decision at [17]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Rango also referred to another report prepared
                    by Matcor for the MOM, <em>viz</em>, Report No M08209
                    (“Report 209 (MOM)”). This report stated in cl 3.0
                    (which was entitled “<font style="text-transform: uppercase;">Discussion</font>”):<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The primary failure was located at the pin-joints of the mast anchor
                        assembly which was not covered by non-destructive test or adequately
                        inspected during the pre-erection stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Report 209 (MOM) then went on to observe in the same
                        clause:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The erection submission document [<em>ie</em>, the Third Party Inspection Report which TJP submitted to
                        the MOM on 18 August 2006 (see sub-para (a) of <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above)] had only a brief summary of the
                        non-destructive test of the crane. Non-destructive test (NDT) was supposed
                        to be conducted on the critical parts of the crane by [Hi Tech] during the
                        pre[-]erection inspection. The submitted NDT results, shown by marking on
                        drawings, however did not cover the mast #1 and mast anchor assembly.
                        The mast components and mast anchor assembly are deemed as critical
                        parts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The proceedings below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Kimly brought an action against Rango for
                    breach of the Sub-Contract, averring that the collapse of the Tower Crane was
                    due to and/or caused by and/or contributed to by Rango’s breach of
                    contract. Kimly averred that the presence of the Pre-Existing Cracks was the
                    primary cause of the collapse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Rango then brought in TJP as a third party,
                    alleging breach of contract and negligence. Rango averred that TJP had breached
                    his obligation to ensure that: (a) the Tower Crane would be of good, proper
                    and/or satisfactory quality, reasonably fit for its purposes and/or safe for
                    use; and (b) all necessary tests were carried out. In particular, the
                    breaches alleged against TJP were the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     The first and primary breach was
                        said to be TJP’s failure to conduct NDTs on the mast anchors of the
                        Tower Crane. Given that the alleged cause of the Tower Crane’s
                        collapse was the Pre-Existing Cracks, Rango contended that if TJP had
                        conducted NDTs on the mast anchors, he would have detected the Pre-Existing
                        Cracks and could have avoided the collapse.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     The second breach was said to be
                        TJP’s complete failure to carry out the pre-erection inspection
                        required under cl 7.2 of the 2005 MOM Guidelines.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> (Here, we should
                        point out that under the 2005 MOM Guidelines, a third-party inspection of a
                        tower crane, such as that done by TJP on 15 August 2006 (see sub-para
                        (a) of <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above), and the
                        prescribed pre-erection inspection are “2 different inspections done
                        at 2 different times”.)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Notably, neither Rango nor TJP alleged that
                    the other had been contributorily negligent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     As mentioned earlier (at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above), TJP subsequently brought in Feng and
                    FES as fourth parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The trial was heard over 11 days. At the close
                    of Rango’s case, TJP, who was then represented by different counsel,
                    indicated to the Judge that he wished to make a submission of “no case to
                    answer” on the ground that Rango had not proved its case against him.
                    While TJP accepted that a submission of “no case to answer” meant
                    that he had to undertake not to call evidence against Rango, he asserted that he
                    remained entitled to call evidence against Feng and FES should his submission be
                    rejected. As all the other parties submitted otherwise, TJP sought a preliminary
                    ruling from the Judge on the issue of whether he could proceed with his case
                    against Feng and FES if his submission of “no case to answer”
                    failed (“the Preliminary Issue”). He reserved his right to decide
                    whether he would indeed make a submission of “no case to answer”
                    after hearing the Judge’s ruling on this issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     After hearing the parties’ arguments on
                    the Preliminary Issue, the Judge ruled as follows (see the Decision at [55]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     TJP had the right to make a
                        submission of “no case to answer”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     if TJP did indeed make this
                        submission, he had to give an absolute undertaking not to call any evidence
                        against any of the parties, and had to stand or fall by his
                        submission;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_c"></a>(c)     if
                        the court agreed with TJP’s submission of “no case to
                        answer”, Rango’s claim against TJP would be
                    dismissed;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_d"></a>(d)     if,
                        however, the court disagreed with TJP’s submission, judgment would be
                        entered for Rango against TJP (assuming judgment was given for Kimly against
                        Rango); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_e"></a>(e)     since TJP had to undertake not to call any evidence if he made a submission
                        of “no case to answer” (see sub-para (b) above), should
                        his submission fail, he could not proceed against Feng and FES and his claim
                        against them would be dismissed accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Judge gave TJP time to consider his ruling
                    on the Preliminary Issue and make a decision as to whether or not to proceed to
                    make a submission of “no case to answer”. TJP subsequently
                    informed the Judge that he elected to make this submission on the terms set out
                    by the Judge (see the Decision at [57]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Judge thereafter heard the parties’
                    closing submissions on the basis of TJP’s “no case to
                    answer” submission. Feng and FES did not make any closing submissions
                    because of TJP’s undertaking not to call any evidence against
                them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parallel criminal proceedings </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     For the sake of completeness, it should be
                    mentioned that the MOM has charged TJP with an offence under
                        reg 21(15)(<em>d</em>) of the WSH Regulations read
                    with reg 45 thereof for certifying that the Tower Crane was of sound
                    material and suitable for use without having first tested the mast

                    offence and, at least at the time of the hearing before us, the prosecution was
                    still ongoing. At the time of the hearing before us, Lee Tong Boon (the sole
                    proprietor of Rango) was also being prosecuted by the MOM for breaching his duty
                    under s 16(1)(<em>b</em>) of the WSHA in failing to
                    ensure that the Tower Crane’s parts, including the mast anchors, were
                    inspected and properly maintained prior to the erection of the Tower

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The cause of the Tower Crane’s collapse</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The Judge accepted that the cause of the Tower
                    Crane’s collapse was the presence of the Pre-Existing Cracks (see the
                    Decision at [19]). He rejected, on the
                    evidence, TJP’s argument that the collapse could have been due to the
                    Tower Crane being operated by an unauthorised person, and that the Tower Crane
                    could have been carrying some load at the material time (see the Decision at

                    really in issue at the trial because Rango did not seriously contest its
                    liability to Kimly. Rather, it merely sought an indemnity in its favour against
                    TJP. Accordingly, the Judge held (at [26] of the Decision) that Rango was liable to Kimly. He then
                    allowed Kimly’s various heads of damages as set out at sub-para
                    (d) of [4] of the Decision. These
                    amounted to $566,691.09 in total (computed as explained at [27]–[34] of the Decision). Interest on this sum at the rate of 5.33%
                    per annum was awarded from 3 November 2008 (the date on which Kimly
                    commenced its action against Rango) to the date of payment (see [35] of the Decision). Rango has not appealed
                    against the Judge’s finding of liability and thus remains bound by the
                    Judge’s finding that it is liable to pay Kimly $566,691.09 plus interest.
                    The Judge also ordered Rango to pay Kimly costs (to be taxed or agreed) on the
                    standard basis until 3 September 2010, and thereafter, on an indemnity
                    basis by virtue of an offer to settle from Kimly which was not accepted by
                    Rango.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Kimly and Rango adopted the same position with
                    regard to the cause of the Tower Crane’s collapse. Their expert witnesses
                    agreed that the mast anchors had not been inspected or tested prior to the
                    erection of the Tower Crane, and that it was TJP who was responsible for this
                    lapse. This leads to the next issue of liability, <em>ie</em>, as between Rango and TJP.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Liability as between Rango and TJP</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     As between Rango and TJP, the Judge found (at
                        [45] of the Decision) that there was
                    a case for TJP to answer as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he cause of the collapse was not due to a supervening event.
                        In the light of the matters set out earlier [at [24]–[25] and
                            [40]–[44] of the Decision], there was clearly a
                        case for [TJP] to answer. He had to rebut both [Kimly’s and
                        Rango’s] expert witnesses’ conclusion as to the cause of the
                        collapse and that he was negligent in his duty of inspection. He had failed
                        to discredit their findings or to make them change their mind in
                        cross-examination. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Judge then found that TJP was obliged to indemnify Rango in
                    respect of its liability to Kimly. His reasoning was as follows. First, the
                    Judge found that the evidence before him showed that the cause of the Tower
                    Crane’s collapse was the Pre-Existing Cracks, and that TJP was liable for
                    the failure to detect those cracks. Based on this evidence, there was a case for
                    TJP to answer. Second, since TJP had given an undertaking not to call any
                    evidence in (<em>inter alia</em>) his defence against Rango
                    should his submission of “no case to answer” fail, the Judge found
                    TJP liable to indemnify Rango in respect of its liability to Kimly. With
                    respect, we do not follow this reasoning as the second finding by the Judge
                        (<em>vis-à-vis</em> TJP’s liability to indemnify
                    Rango) does not flow from the first finding (<em>vis-à-vis</em> TJP’s failure to detect the Pre-Existing
                    Cracks). We observe that there was no legal analysis by the Judge as to why TJP
                    was obliged to “indemnify” Rango, nor was there any examination as
                    to the nature and content of this “indemnity”. In other words, the
                    key issue of the legal basis of TJP’s alleged obligation to indemnify
                    Rango was <em>not</em> considered by the Judge, who seemed
                    to implicitly accept that an obligation on TJP’s part to indemnify Rango
                    automatically sprung from TJP’s liability for the collapse of the Tower
                    Crane, which collapse occurred due to TJP’s breach of his statutory duties
                    as an AE.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Liability as between TJP and Feng and FES</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     By virtue of TJP’s undertaking not to
                    call any evidence against Feng and FES as well should his submission of
                    “no case to answer” fail, the Judge dismissed his claim against
                    them for an indemnity and/or contribution.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The overall result </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Overall, therefore, the Judge found TJP liable
                    to indemnify Rango in respect of all sums which Rango had to pay Kimly pursuant
                    to the Decision. TJP was also ordered to pay Rango costs (to be taxed or agreed)
                    on the standard basis until 6 September 2010, and thereafter, on an
                    indemnity basis by virtue of an offer to settle from Rango which was not
                    accepted by TJP.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     TJP was ordered to pay Feng costs (to be taxed
                    or agreed) on the standard basis up to 2 August 2010, and thereafter, on an
                    indemnity basis by virtue of an offer to settle from Feng which was not accepted
                    by TJP. TJP was also ordered to pay FES costs (to be taxed or agreed) on the
                    standard basis (FES did not make any offer to settle).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ arguments on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In the present appeal, TJP is challenging the
                    Decision on four main grounds, <em>viz</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     the expert evidence was problematic
                        on various grounds (and therefore presumably did not make out a <em>prima facie</em> case against TJP);<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     TJP owed no obligation to indemnify

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_c"></a>(c)     the losses claimed by Kimly were too
                            remote;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_d"></a>(d)     the losses
                        claimed by Kimly were not proved.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     For the sake of clarity, we should mention
                    that in the parties’ submissions for this appeal:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_a"></a>(a)     Kimly has responded to
                        grounds (a), (c) and (d);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_b"></a>(b)     Rango has responded primarily to
                            grounds (a)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> and

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_c"></a>(c)     Feng and FES have not addressed
                        TJP’s objections to the Decision, and have simply submitted that the
                        Judge was correct to find that TJP could not proceed against them in the
                        court below because of his undertaking not to call any evidence against them
                        should his submission of “no case to answer”
                    fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     As the parties raised many issues, both legal
                    and factual, before this court, we should explain why, in our view, this appeal
                    boils down to only one crucial issue. There are technically two broad issues
                    that arise in this appeal, namely: (a) whether the Judge erred in finding
                    that Rango had established a case for TJP to answer; and (b) assuming that
                    the Judge was correct in so ruling, whether he erred in finding that TJP could
                    not seek an indemnity and/or contribution from Feng and FES. However, issue
                    (b) is not a live issue because TJP is not challenging this part of the
                    Decision. In any case, since TJP explicitly gave an undertaking not to call any
                    evidence against (<em>inter alia</em>) Feng and FES
                    pursuant to the Judge’s ruling on the Preliminary Issue (which undertaking
                    was given after TJP had had time to consider his course of action in the light
                    of that ruling), it is clear that TJP has no basis to appeal as far as issue
                    (b) is concerned. <em>The only live issue before us is
                        therefore </em><em>issue (a)</em>, which
                    comprises the following questions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the evidence supports
                        Rango’s case that had TJP inspected the mast anchors prior to the
                        erection of the Tower Crane, the collapse of the Tower Crane could have been
                        avoided (referred to hereafter as “the Factual Question”);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether TJP
                        is under a legal obligation to indemnify Rango in respect of its liability
                        to Kimly (referred to hereafter as “the Legal
                        Question”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     It is important to note that <em>because TJP made a submission of “no case to answer”
                        in the court below, the threshold against which the above questions are to
                        be assessed is that of whether a</em> prima facie <em>case has been established </em><em>by Rango against
                        TJP, and not that of whether a case against TJP has been established on a
                        balance of probabilities</em>. This is because a submission of
                    “no case to answer” by a defendant succeeds if: (a) the
                    plaintiff’s evidence, <em>at face value</em>, does
                    not establish a case in law; or (b) the evidence led by the plaintiff is so
                    unsatisfactory or unreliable that his burden of proof has not been discharged
                    (see <em>Bansal Hemant Govindprasad and another v Central Bank of
                        India</em> [2003] 2 SLR(R) 33).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Counsel canvassed both the Factual Question
                    and the Legal Question before us, particularly the Factual Question. That
                    question goes to a determination of the cause of the Tower Crane’s
                    collapse, specifically, whether the cause was the Pre-Existing Cracks and
                    whether TJP could have discovered those cracks by carrying out the necessary
                    tests. With respect, we felt that counsel, in their enthusiasm to answer the
                    Factual Question, neglected to adequately address the Legal Question, which, in
                    our view, lies at the heart of this appeal. This is because <em>even if all the evidential issues are resolved against TJP where the
                        Factual Question is concerned</em>, Rango’s case against TJP
                    would still fail if there is no legal basis to find that TJP owes an obligation
                    to indemnify Rango in respect of its liability to Kimly. <em>This
                        appeal therefore ultimately depends on </em><em>one
                        narrow question</em>: taking Rango’s case at its highest,
                    assuming that all factual disputes are resolved in its favour where the Factual
                    Question is concerned, has Rango established a <em>prima
                        facie</em> legal basis for TJP to indemnify it in respect of its
                    liability to Kimly? In our view, Rango’s case, taken at its highest,
                    merely proves that TJP breached his duties under the WSH Regime by failing to
                    inspect the mast anchors before the erection of the Tower Crane. However, even
                    if this is accepted, <em>it is a separate and further question
                        whether this breach of statutory duty by TJP as an AE </em><em>necessarily results in his having </em><em>a
                        civil obligation to indemnify Rango in respect of its liability to
                        Kimly.</em> We will now explain why.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Overview</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Rango’s pleaded case against TJP, as set
                    out in its statement of claim against the latter in the third-party proceedings
                    (“Rango’s Statement of Claim against TJP”), rested on the
                    following alternative legal bases:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"></a>(a)     “an express or implied
                        contractual … right”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> to an indemnity from TJP in
                        respect of its (Rango’s) liability to Kimly;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_b"></a>(b)     “other
                            right”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> to such an indemnity;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_c"></a>(c)     contribution under s 15 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43,
                        1999 Rev Ed).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">Of
                    these three alternative legal bases, Rango actively pursued only the first two
                    at the trial. For the sake of completeness, we ought to also mention that in
                    addition to the aforesaid legal grounds, Rango further included in its pleadings
                    a claim for damages “under contract or alternatively under
                        tort”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> but likewise did not proceed
                    with this head of claim at the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     TJP’s counsel in the present appeal
                    rightly pointed out that the Judge did not state which of the above legal
                    grounds formed the basis of his decision that TJP was under a civil obligation
                    to indemnify Rango.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> Before us, it was s 15
                    of the Civil Law Act (“the s 15 ground”) that took centre
                    stage, and it will therefore be the primary focus of this judgment. Indeed, the
                    s 15 ground probably assumed primacy for good reason, <em>viz</em> – the other two grounds can be disposed of quite
                    quickly, as we will explain before we turn to analyse the issues arising under
                    the s 15 ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Before we embark on our analysis proper of the
                    various legal grounds pleaded by Rango, it is useful to highlight the
                    implications of Rango’s claim that it is entitled to be indemnified by
                    TJP. An unhappy feature of this case is that because of the way in which the
                    proceedings evolved during the trial, there were significant gaps in the facts
                    established in the court below. Even assuming the Judge was right to find, on
                    the evidence, that the Tower Crane’s collapse was caused by the
                    Pre-Existing Cracks, it is far from clear how and why the <em>Pre-Existing</em> Cracks were present in the first place. The precise
                    extent of liability which Rango should bear for the Tower Crane’s collapse
                    is therefore correspondingly unclear. Only after querying counsel did we learn
                    that there is no evidence on record as to the history of the Tower Crane’s
                    prior usage before its installation at the Project Site; neither is there
                    evidence as to when, during its previous usage, it had been inspected or
                    certified and by whom. These are all obvious matters that ought to have been
                    fleshed out in the course of the trial. Nevertheless, even though we do not know
                    the exact details, on the evidence before us, we can be certain that the
                    component parts of the Tower Crane, including the mast anchors, were not new and
                    did have a history of prior usage. As mentioned at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above, we also have it on record that Lee Tong Boon
                    (Rango’s sole proprietor) is, by Rango’s own admission, being
                    prosecuted by the MOM for breaching his duty under s 16(1)(<em>b</em>) of the WSHA<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> (s 16(1)(<em>b</em>) provides that a person who, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, supplies any machinery for use at work is under a duty to
                    ensure, so far as reasonably practicable, “that the machinery ... is
                    safe, and without risk to health, when properly used”). Further, it is
                    clear to us that TJP <em>certainly was not responsible for the
                        existence of </em><em>the Pre-Existing Cracks –
                        the wrong alleged on his part is his failure to detect the Pre-Existing
                        Cracks, which were present because another party had failed in its
                        responsibility to ensure </em><em>that those defects
                        </em><em>ought not to have been there in the first
                        place.</em> The necessary wider implication of Rango’s claim to
                    be entitled to an indemnity from TJP in this case (a point which may not have
                    been appreciated by the Judge) is that regardless of what the primary cause of a
                    defect in a tower crane is, once an AE breaches his statutory duty and fails to
                    detect that defect, all legal liability for any damage resulting from that
                    defect falls on the AE to the exclusion of any other party who might be
                    responsible (whether partly or wholly) for the presence of that defect.
                        <em>On this analysis, the outcome reached in the court below
                        is, tersely put, an astonishing result, particularly since the same outcome
                        would occur even if the person claiming an indemnity from the AE is himself
                        entirely responsible for the presence of the defect in question.</em>
                    We will bear this in mind as we examine the various legal bases pleaded by Rango
                    in support of its claim against TJP.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The legal bases pleaded by Rango against TJP</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Express or implied contractual right to an indemnity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     As mentioned at sub-para (a) of <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a> above, the first legal basis pleaded by Rango
                    in support of its claim against TJP was that of an express or implied
                    contractual right to an indemnity from TJP in respect of its (Rango’s)
                    liability to Kimly. It is undisputed that the oral contract between TJP and
                    Rango contained no express obligation of indemnity. Any express contractual
                    right to an indemnity can therefore be immediately dismissed. The only question
                    is whether a term as to indemnity can be implied into this oral contract. We
                    find that it cannot. It is trite that a term will be implied into a contract
                    only if it is so necessary that all the contracting parties must have intended
                    its inclusion in the contract. In the present case, as stated earlier (at
                        <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above), from the circumstances
                    surrounding the conclusion of the oral contract between TJP and Rango, we find
                    that neither party even remotely considered the issue of risk allocation between
                    themselves and non-parties to their contract in the event that TJP was found
                    wanting in the discharge of his professional obligations. It also cannot be said
                    that TJP was privy to or “knew or ought to have known”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> [emphasis in original omitted]
                    of Rango’s contract with Kimly (<em>viz</em>, the
                    Sub-Contract), in particular, of Rango’s obligation to indemnify Kimly in
                    respect of (<em>inter alia</em>) any damage suffered by
                    Kimly. This was a significant part of Rango’s case in the court below,
                    which does not seem to have been resurrected on appeal. In any case, as
                    TJP’s counsel has rightly pointed out, <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> this argument
                    is tenuous because TJP was engaged by Rango nearly two weeks <em>before</em> Kimly and Rango executed the Sub-Contract, which included
                    the term that imposed on Rango its obligation to indemnify Kimly. It would thus
                    not be within the reasonable contemplation of TJP that he was assuming liability
                    to indemnify Rango in respect of its liability to Kimly. We also observe that an
                    obligation to indemnify is an onerous one, and the courts will be slow to imply
                    such an obligation into a contract as it goes against commercial logic to have
                    an implied term on indemnity without laying down properly defined parameters for
                    the purported indemnity. While Rango pleaded an alternative claim for damages
                    “under contract or alternatively under tort”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> this claim was (as mentioned at
                        <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a> above) not pursued at the trial
                    (nor in this appeal), and we thus see no need to address it in this
                    judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">“Other” right to an indemnity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Other than either an express or an implied
                    contractual right to an indemnity from TJP, Rango also relied in the court below
                    on a so-called equitable “assumed promise” to
                        indemnify.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> To this end,
                    Rango cited the Privy Council case of <em>Eastern Shipping
                        Company, Limited v Quah Beng Kee</em> [1924] AC 177
                        (“<em>Eastern Shipping</em>”) and the
                    (Singapore) High Court case of <em>Hygeian Medical Supplies Pte
                        Ltd v Tri-Star Rotary Screen Engraving Works Pte Ltd (Seng Wing Engineering
                        Works Pte Ltd, third party)</em> [1993] 2 SLR(R) 411
                        (“<em>Hygeian</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The principles for determining when an
                    equitable “assumed promise” to indemnify may be found can be
                    gleaned from a brief examination of the aforesaid authorities. <em>Eastern Shipping</em> recognised (at 182–183) that
                    an obligation to indemnify, apart from arising from contract, could also arise
                    from statute or from an equitable duty to indemnify stemming from
                        “<em>an assumed promise by a person to do that which,
                        under the circumstances, he ought to do</em>” [emphasis added]
                    (see <em>Eastern Shippin</em>g at 182). This equitable
                    duty to indemnify may be found where the parties stand in a relationship of
                    trustee and <em>cestui que trust</em> to each other (see
                        <em>Birmingham and District Land Company v London and North
                        Western Railway Company</em> (1887) 34 Ch 261 at 271).
                    In such cases, the trustee may claim an indemnity from the <em>cestui que trust</em>, and <em>vice versa</em>
                    (see <em>Eastern Shipping</em> at 182–184). The
                    notion that such an equitable obligation can be imposed when one party stands in
                    a fiduciary relationship to another was expanded in <em>Checkpoint Fluidic Systems International Ltd v Marine Hub Pte Ltd and
                        Another Appeal</em> [2009] SGHC 134, which was an appeal to
                    the High Court against a district judge’s finding that an equitable right
                    to an indemnity had arisen in favour of the respondent against the appellant in
                    view of the fact that the transaction in question had been entered into by the
                    respondent for the appellant’s benefit. This finding was upheld by the
                    High Court. While <em>Hygeian</em> neither cited <em>Eastern Shipping</em> nor explicitly mentioned the doctrine
                    of the equitable “assumed promise” to indemnify, there is arguably
                    implicit recognition of this doctrine in the finding in that case that the third
                    party was to indemnify the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     We find that both <em>Eastern
                        Shipping</em> and <em>Hygeian</em> are readily
                    distinguishable from the present case. In both of those cases, the third
                    party’s acts were the primary – indeed, the <em>only</em> – cause of the respective defendants’ liability
                    to the respective plaintiffs. In <em>Eastern Shipping</em>,
                    it was the third party’s wrongful act in instructing a ship to berth at
                    the plaintiff’s wharf that caused the defendant to be liable to the
                    plaintiff. The defendant itself had not committed any wrongful act, and there
                    was no other cause leading to the defendant being liable to the plaintiff.
                    Similarly, in <em>Hygeian</em>, the defendant would not
                    have been liable to the plaintiff but for the wrongful act of the third party,
                    which caused the defendant’s premises to discharge water into the
                    plaintiff’s premises and flood them. By contrast, it would be a stretch to
                    say, in the present case, that TJP’s wrongful conduct was the sole reason
                    for Rango being placed in a position of liability <em>vis-à-vis</em> Kimly, and that it is therefore necessary in equity to
                    assume a promise on TJP’s part to indemnify Rango. TJP’s failure to
                        <em>detect</em> the Pre-Existing Cracks is hardly
                    analogous to the acts of the third parties in <em>Eastern
                        Shipping</em> and <em>Hygeian</em>, especially
                    since it is plausible that the Pre-Existing Cracks may have been the
                    consequences of Rango’s own wrongful acts or omissions. Further, another
                    distinguishing factor in <em>Eastern Shipping</em> is that
                    the third party in that case stood in a <em>fiduciary
                        relationship</em> to the defendant who incurred liability to the
                    plaintiff as a result of the third party’s actions (see <em>Eastern Shipping</em> at 183). While the third party in
                        <em>Eastern Shipping</em> was not a trustee in the full
                    sense of the word, he was a trustee of his powers such that he stood in a
                    fiduciary relationship to the defendant in respect of his exercise of those
                    powers. As noted in the preceding paragraph, the presence of a fiduciary
                    relationship is one of the touchstones for the imposition of an equitable
                    “assumed promise” to indemnify. This feature is missing in the
                    present case as it is difficult to see how TJP can be said to be in a fiduciary
                    relationship <em>vis-à-vis</em> Rango.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Section 15 of the Civil Law Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     We now turn to the s 15 ground, which is
                    the mainstay of Rango’s attempt to uphold the Judge’s decision that
                    it is entitled to be indemnified by TJP in respect of its liability to Kimly.
                    Section 15(1) of the Civil Law Act states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to subsections (2) to (5), any person liable in respect of
                        any damage suffered by another person may recover contribution from any

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In interpreting s 15(1) of the Civil Law
                    Act, we will consider the mischief that this section is intended to cure. In
                    this regard, it is helpful to examine the legislative history of s 1(1) of
                    the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978 (c 47) (UK) (“the 1978
                    UK Act”), upon which s 15(1) of our Civil Law Act (referred to
                    hereafter as “our s 15(1)” where appropriate to the context)
                    is based. Section 1(1) of the 1978 UK Act provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to the following provisions of this section, any person liable in
                        respect of any damage suffered by another person may recover contribution

                        with him or otherwise).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As can be seen, this provision is <em>in pari

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In the House of Lords case of <em>Royal Brompton Hospital NHS Trust v Hammond and others (Taylor
                        Woodrow Construction (Holdings) Ltd, Part 20 defendant)</em>
                    [2002] 1 WLR 1397 (“<em>Royal
                        Brompton</em>”), Lord Bingham of Cornhill discussed the
                    legislative history of s 1(1) of the 1978 UK Act. He noted (at [3]) that the Law Revision Committee, in its
                    Third Interim Report (Cmd 4637) of July 1934, had addressed the difficulty
                    faced by one tortfeasor in getting contribution from the other tortfeasor(s) at
                    common law. Lord Bingham then went on to note:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3    ... In
                            paragraph 7 of its report the committee said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“We think that the common law rule should be altered as
                            speedily as possible. The simplest way of altering the law would seem to
                            be to follow the lines of section 37(3) of the Companies Act [1929
                            (c 23) (UK)], and to give a right of contribution in the case of
                            wrongs as in cases of contract. If this were done, joint tortfeasors in
                            the strict sense would be given a right of contribution inter se. We
                            think, however, that such a right might with advantage also be conferred
                            where the tort is not joint ([<em>ie</em>], the
                            same act committed by several persons) but where the same damage is
                            caused to the plaintiff by the separate wrongful acts of several
                            persons. This is the position which frequently arises where the
                            plaintiff sustains a single damage from the combined negligence of two
                            motor car drivers, and recovers judgment against both ... We think
                            therefore that when two persons each contribute to the same damage
                            suffered by a third the one who pays more than his share should be
                            entitled to recover contribution from the other.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The committee included the following among its
                        recommendations:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“(II) Any person who is adjudged to be liable to make any
                            payment ... in respect of an actionable wrong may recover contribution
                            ... from any other person who has been made liable in respect of the
                            same wrong, or who, if sued separately, would have been so liable,
                            unless ... [<em>sic</em>] (III) Where two or
                            more persons have committed independent wrongful acts which have been
                            the cause of the same damage they shall have the same right to
                            contribution among themselves but subject to the same exception as in
                            the case of persons liable in respect of the same wrong.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Effect was given to these recommendations in section 6(1)(c) of the

                            of those who had committed tortious acts, whether jointly or
                            concurrently. This limited field of application came in time to be
                            recognised as a weakness, for section 6(1)(c) did not apply to

                            main aim of widening the jurisdiction given to the courts by the 1935
                            [UK] Act (paragraph 81) and specific recommendations were
                            made:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“(a) … that statutory rights of contribution should
                            not be confined, as at present, to cases where damage is suffered as a
                            result of a tort, but should cover cases where it is suffered as a
                            result of tort, breach of contract, breach of trust or other breach of
                            duty ... (d) ... that the statutory right to recover contribution
                            should be available to any person liable in respect of the damage, not
                            just persons liable in tort ...”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the draft bill appended to its report the Law Commission
                        proposed a subsection (in clause 3(1)) which differed from
                        section 1(1) of the 1978 [UK] Act quoted at the outset of this opinion
                        only in its reference to the time when the damage occurred, a reference
                        which has been omitted in the subsection as enacted. The words which I have
                        emphasised at the outset were included in the Law Commission draft.
                        Section 1(1) of the 1978 [UK] Act is supplemented by section 6(1)
                        [of the same Act]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“A person is liable in respect of any damage for the purposes
                            of this Act if the person who suffered it ... is entitled to recover
                            compensation from him in respect of that damage (whatever the legal
                            basis of his liability, whether tort, breach of contract, breach of
                            trust or otherwise).”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This differs more obviously, at least in wording, from the
                        interpretation clause proposed by the Law Commission:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“(1) For the purposes of this Act — (a) a
                            person is liable in respect of any damage if he is subject to a duty
                            enforceable by action to compensate for that damage, whether or not he
                            has in fact been held to be so liable in any action actually brought
                            against him; and (b) it is immaterial whether he is liable in
                            respect of a tort, breach of contract, breach of trust or on any other
                            ground whatsoever which gives rise to a cause of action against him in
                            respect of the damage in question.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5    It is plain beyond argument that one important
                            object of the 1978 [UK] Act was to widen the classes of person between
                            whom claims for contribution would lie and to enlarge the hitherto
                            restricted category of causes of action capable of giving rise to such a
                            claim. It is, however, as I understand, <em>a constant
                                theme of the law of contribution from the beginning that B’s
                                claim to share with others his liability to A rests upon the fact
                                that they (whether equally with B or not)</em> are <em>subject to a common liability </em><em>to A</em>. I find nothing in section 6(1)(c) of the 1935
                            [UK] Act or in section 1(1) of the 1978 [UK] Act, or in the reports
                            which preceded those Acts, which in any way weakens that requirement.
                            Indeed both sections, by using the words “<em>in
                                respect of the same damage</em>”, emphasise the need
                            for one loss to be apportioned among those liable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The crucial question</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     From this brief examination of the legislative
                    developments which gave rise to s 1(1) of the 1978 UK Act, it is clear that
                    the essence of that provision (and correspondingly, our s 15(1)) is whether
                    the person from whom contribution is sought and the person claiming contribution
                    are liable in respect of “the same damage”. The relevant test for
                    deciding whether TJP and Rango are liable for “the same damage” in
                    the present case is the three-step test established in <em>Royal
                        Brompton</em> at [6], which
                    may, for our purposes, be stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_a"></a>(a)     What damage was suffered by Kimly as
                        a result of the Tower Crane’s collapse?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_b"></a>(b)     Is Rango liable to Kimly in respect of that
                        damage?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_c"></a>(c)     Is TJP
                        also liable to Kimly in respect of that very “same damage” or
                        some of it?</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In order words, for the s 15 ground to
                    be made out, it must be established that TJP was liable not only to Rango
                    (whether in tort or in contract) for the damage caused by the Tower
                    Crane’s collapse, but also to <em>Kimly</em> for that
                    same damage, <em>ie</em>, Rango needs to show that TJP
                        <em>directly</em> owed Kimly a duty of care at common
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The crucial question (“the Crucial
                    Question”), therefore, is whether an AE, in the discharge of his
                    statutory duties <em>vis-à-vis</em> the use of a tower
                    crane at a factory and/or worksite (referred to hereafter as a
                    “workplace” for short), owes a duty of care at common law to the
                    main contractor who will ultimately be using the tower crane (in this case,
                    Kimly), <em>even though the AE is engaged not by the main
                        contractor but by the sub-contractor</em> renting out the tower crane
                    to the main contractor (in this case, Rango). After the hearing before us on
                    7 July 2011, we reserved judgment and directed the parties to file:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_a"></a>(a)     any information and/or materials
                        available in the record of proceedings and/or in the public record on the
                        background and/or policy of the 2005 MOM Guidelines; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_b"></a>(b)     authorities showing how the courts
                        have construed the duty of care imposed on inspectors in positions analogous
                        to the position of the AE under the WSH Regime.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The
                    parties submitted the aforesaid materials and their further submissions on these
                    materials on and around 4 August 2011. We turn now to consider the Crucial
                    Question in the light of these materials and submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   The general test for imposing a common law duty of
                care</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     As this court stated in <em>Animal Concerns Research &amp; Education Society v Tan Boon Kwee</em>
                    [2011] 2 SLR 146 (“<em>Animal
                        Concerns</em>”) at [22]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…
                        <em>A statutory duty does not</em> ipso facto <em>impose a concomitant duty of care at common law.</em> A
                        statutory duty may, of course, form the backdrop to and inform the existence
                        (or lack thereof) of a common law duty of care (see, for example, [<em>X (Minors) v Bedfordshire County Council</em> [1995]
                        2 AC 633] at 739), but that does not mean the statutory duty
                            <em>per se</em> is a duty of care, <em>even if it is phrased (as here) in terms of requiring the
                            taking of “reasonable steps” and “due
                            diligence”</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Rather, to establish a common law duty of
                    care, the general test set out in <em>Spandeck Engineering (S)
                        Pte Ltd v Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency</em> [2007]
                    4 SLR(R) 100 (“<em>Spandeck</em>”)
                    must be fulfilled. This test (“the <em>Spandeck</em>
                    test”) comprises two limbs (see <em>Spandeck</em> at
                        [73] and <em>Animal
                        Concerns</em> at [29]). First,
                    it must be shown that there is “sufficient <em>legal</em> proximity between the claimant and [the] defendant for a
                    duty of care to arise” [emphasis in original] (see <em>Spandeck</em> at [77]). If
                    such a relationship of proximity is established, a <em>prima
                        facie</em> duty of care arises. Second, the court will then apply
                    policy considerations to the factual matrix of the particular case at hand to
                    determine whether the <em>prima facie</em> duty of care is
                    negated (see <em>Spandeck</em> at [83]). In this regard, there must be no policy
                    considerations which negate, reduce or limit the scope of the duty or the class
                    of persons to whom it is owed or the damages recoverable for a breach of that
                    duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Under the first limb of the <em>Spandeck</em> test, one of the many factors taken into consideration
                    is the existence of a statutory duty. However, as amply clarified in <em>Animal Concerns</em>, the mere existence of a statutory duty
                    owed by the defendant to the relevant authorities is <em>not</em> in itself conclusive in establishing that the defendant owes
                    a common law duty of care to the plaintiff. As for the second limb of the
                        <em>Spandeck</em> test, one important policy
                    consideration that the courts will evaluate in determining whether a particular
                    statutory duty gives rise to a concomitant common law duty of care is that the
                    imposition of the alleged common law duty of care <em>should not
                        be inconsistent with the statutory scheme concerned and the statutory duties
                        owed under that scheme</em> (see <em>Harris v Evans and
                        Another</em> [1998] 1 WLR 1285 at 1297, applying
                        <em>X (Minors) v Bedfordshire County Council</em>
                    [1995] 2 AC 633).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Several general principles inform the law in
                    this area. First, the party seeking to establish that a private right of action
                    exists for a breach of statutory duty must show that Parliament, in imposing the
                    statutory duty in question to protect the members of a class, intended those
                    members to have such a right of action. Here, it must also be borne in mind that
                    such right is not immediately established just because a statute is intended to
                    protect a particular class of persons. Ordinarily, something more is required to
                    demonstrate a statutory intention to confer a private right of action. In
                    matters where the statute’s objective is to protect the public in general,
                    exceptionally clear language will be required before an intention to confer a
                    private remedy for a breach of statutory duty can be established. Second, a
                    concurrent common law duty of care may be found alongside a statutory duty
                    imposed by subsidiary legislation provided there are clear indications that the
                    primary legislation contemplates the creation of such a common law duty. Third,
                    while the existence of a statutory remedy for a breach of statutory duty is
                    relevant and may suggest the absence of a private right of action for such
                    breach, it is not in itself decisive (see <em>Charlesworth &amp;
                        Percy on Negligence</em> (Christopher Walton gen ed) (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2010) at paras 12-43–12-44). Similarly, the
                    existence of a statutory sanction for a breach of statutory duty neither
                    necessarily nor conclusively indicates that the Legislature intended to preclude
                    a private right of action for such breach (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Animal Concerns</em> at [81]). Fourth, we caution that in this complex
                    area of the law, formulas are not helpful. While the general principles stated
                    here may help in terms of setting out relevant factors for consideration, they
                    are mere guidelines and will not yield answers as to whether a common law duty
                    of care exists alongside a statutory duty <em>in a particular
                        case</em>. The variety of statutory duties and the different objects
                    which different statutes are directed at make it impossible to have a universal
                    formula. Each statute will have to be considered contextually, and precedents
                    will illuminate only infrequently the right legal path to be taken. Fifth, we
                    emphasise that the underlying statutory scheme and the parliamentary intention
                    behind the enactment of that scheme are not controlling factors in determining
                    whether an alleged common law duty of care exists concurrently with a statutory
                    duty, but rather go towards <em>negating</em> the alleged
                    common law duty of care (<em>ie</em>, these factors are
                    considered under the second limb of the <em>Spandeck</em>
                    test, rather than under the first limb).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Turning to the factual matrix before us, to
                    determine whether TJP owed a common law duty of care to Kimly, it is important
                    to first establish what exactly the office of the AE entails. We are aware that
                    our decision on the existence or otherwise of concurrent civil liability is a
                    point of significance that goes far beyond the instant case, with implications
                    across the WSH Regime. We will thus consider the issue framed in broader terms,
                    specifically, in the form of the Crucial Question as defined at <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a> above. In essence, this question requires us
                    to determine whether an AE, in the discharge of his statutory functions, owes a
                    common law duty of care to a person to whom he owes no contractual obligation.
                    As the office of the AE is purely a statutory creation under the WSH Regime, we
                    will need to decide whether the imposition of such a common law duty of care is
                    consistent with the statutory scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   The office of the AE under the WSH Regime</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Pursuant to s 7(3) of the WSHA, the
                    Commissioner for Workplace Safety and Health (“the Commissioner”)
                    may appoint “such number of persons as inspectors, and such number of
                    other persons as authorised officers, as may be necessary to assist the
                    Commissioner in the administration of [the WSHA]”. Section 8 of the
                    WSHA provides (<em>inter alia</em>) that every inspector
                    and authorised officer appointed under s 7 shall be deemed to be a public
                    servant within the meaning of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).
                    The specific office of the AE is first mentioned in s 32 of the WSHA under
                    Pt VII (which is headed “Safety and Health Management
                    Arrangements”). Section 32 provides that no person shall act as

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     An examination of the WSH Regime reveals that
                    the office of the AE is an integral component of the statutory framework. Under
                    reg 21(1) of the WSH Regulations, no lifting appliance or lifting machine
                    (which includes a tower crane) shall be used unless an AE has both:
                    (a) tested and examined it; and (b) issued and signed a certificate of
                    test and examination specifying its safe working load. If the lifting appliance
                    or lifting machine in question has not been so examined and tested, the
                    Commissioner may serve a remedial order or a stop-work order under s 21 of
                    the WSHA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Before the MOM will grant approval for the use
                    of a tower crane at a workplace, the Use of Tower Crane Checklist (see sub-para
                    (a) of <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above) must be filled in
                    and submitted with eight other documents to the MOM’s Occupational Safety

                    AE is involved in the preparation of two of the eight documents that must be
                    submitted to the MOM, <em>viz</em>, the Third Party
                    Inspection Report (required only in cases where cll 3.1–3.3 of the
                    2005 MOM Guidelines apply),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> and layout plans
                    showing the zones of influence and affected areas.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> If the submission is in order,
                    the MOM will then endorse and return a copy of the layout plan to the occupier
                    or owner of the workplace (“the occupier/owner”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> Upon this
                    endorsement, the occupier/owner must again engage an AE to check the parts of
                    the tower crane according to the MOM’s “<font style="text-transform: uppercase;">Checklist for Inspection &amp; Testing of Tower Crane</font>”
                    (provided in Appendix 6 of the 2005 MOM Guidelines)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span><em>before</em> erecting the tower crane (referred to
                    hereafter as “the Pre-Erection Inspection”). The AE must also test
                    the tower crane another time <em>after</em> it has been
                    erected (referred to hereafter as “the Post-Erection
                    Inspection”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The scope of the AE’s statutory duties
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> the use of a tower crane at a
                    workplace can therefore be seen to span three distinct stages, namely:
                    (a) the stage where the occupier/owner applies for the MOM’s approval
                    to use the tower crane on the basis of the Use of Tower Crane Checklist and its
                    accompanying documents; (b) the Pre-Erection Inspection stage; and
                    (c) the Post-Erection Inspection stage. Therefore, in so far as TJP argues
                    that the statutory purpose behind an AE’s duties is merely to “give
                    assurance to [the] MOM that approval [can] be granted for the installation of
                    the [t]ower [c]rane”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> this is plainly wrong because this
                    touches on only the first of the three stages of an AE’s statutory duties.
                    The AE’s statutory duties are much broader than that. That said, the
                    breadth of these duties is not an indicator of the coexistence of a private
                    claim in the event of a breach by an AE of his statutory duties. Therefore, we
                    must examine what the WSH Regime has to say about the existence of a concurrent
                    private claim for a breach of statutory duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(5)   Statutory materials on the existence (or otherwise) of a
                concurrent civil claim for a breach of statutory duty under the WSH Regime </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     According to TJP, the WSHA contemplates that
                    an AE owes no civil liability for a breach of any of his statutory duties under
                    the WSH Regime. In support of this argument, TJP relies on s 60 of the
                    WSHA, which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">

                        liability</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

                                Act; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    as conferring a
                                defence to an action in any civil proceedings or as otherwise

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Subsection (1) shall not affect the extent
                            (if any) to which a breach of duty imposed under any written law is
                            actionable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     While s 60(1)(<em>a</em>) of the WSHA provides that the WSHA <em>does
                        not </em><em>confer</em> any right of action in
                    civil proceedings, s 60(1)(<em>b</em>) provides
                        (<em>inter alia</em>) that the WSHA also <em>does not </em><em>affect</em> any
                    (independent or pre-existing) right of action in civil proceedings. In other
                    words, s 60 of the WSHA neither confers nor takes away any right to bring a
                    private claim in respect of a breach of statutory duty under the WSH Regime.
                    More importantly for present purposes, s 60 does not answer the question of
                    whether there is an independent or a pre-existing private right of action for
                    such a breach. As noted above at <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a>, under
                    the <em>Spandeck</em> test, it is clear that the mere fact
                    that a particular statutory duty exists does not suffice to give rise to a
                    common law duty of care founded on that statutory duty. Indeed, the statutory
                    scheme may provide compelling policy reasons to negate such a common law duty of
                    care. In the present case, however, we find that s 60 of the WSHA does not
                    in itself provide compelling policy reasons to negate a common law duty of care
                    on the part of an AE, if such duty does exist.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     We now turn our attention to s 61 of the
                    WSHA, which protects certain officers under the WSH Regime against personal

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Section 61 does not apply in the instant
                    case because TJP’s alleged personal liability is not in respect of
                    physical damage done to an item in the course of carrying out a prescribed
                    examination. TJP is therefore not protected by s 61 against personal
                    liability in this case. We should add that we do not think s 61 implies
                    that personal liability is excluded <em>only</em> in the
                    instances enumerated in that section. Instead, it seems to us that the specific
                    instances where personal liability has been expressly negated by s 61 were
                    inserted <em>ex abundanti cautela</em> to protect those
                    involved in the statutory inspection scheme from liability for any physical
                    damage caused in the course of carrying out a prescribed inspection. Surely, it
                    cannot be argued that economic loss caused by (<em>eg</em>)
                    delays by an AE in carrying out a prescribed inspection is actionable because
                    liability for such loss has not been expressly excluded. In short, we do not
                    think that s 61 is a statutory indicator of whether an AE may be subject to
                    a private claim for a breach of any of his statutory duties. Section 61 is
                    wholly neutral on this issue. Therefore, we find that nothing in the WSH Regime
                    itself supports either the imposition or the negation of a concurrent common law
                    duty on the part of an AE.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Although the WSH Regime is itself silent on
                    the aforesaid matter, the parliamentary statements on the WSH Regime are
                    illuminating. During the second reading of the Workplace Safety and Health Bill
                    2005 (Bill 36 of 2005) (“the WSH Bill”), Dr Ng Eng Hen
                    (“Dr Ng”), the then Minister for Manpower, stated as follows
                    (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (17 January 2006) vol 80 (“<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em> vol 80”) at
                    cols 2206 and 2208–2210):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Three fundamental reforms in this Bill will improve safety at the
                        workplace. First, this Bill will strengthen proactive measures. Instead of
                        reacting to accidents after they have occurred, which is often too little
                        too late, we should reduce risks to prevent accidents. To achieve this, all
                        employers will be required to conduct comprehensive risk assessments for all
                        work processes and provide detailed plans to minimise or eliminate
                        risks.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Second, industry must take ownership of occupational safety and health
                        standards and outcomes to effect a cultural change of respect for life and
                        livelihoods at the workplace. Government cannot improve safety by fiat
                        alone. Industry must take responsibility for raising [occupational safety
                        and health] standards at a practical and reasonable pace.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Third, this Bill will better define persons who are accountable, their
                        responsibilities and institute penalties which reflect the true economic and
                        social cost of risks and accidents. Penalties should be sufficient to deter
                        risk-taking behaviour and ensure that companies are proactive in preventing
                        incidents. Appropriately, companies and persons that show poor safety
                        management should be penalised even if no accident has occurred.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Clause 14 covers principals who engage contractors for specialised
                        tasks or the services of workers from third-party labour suppliers. In such
                        situations, there is no contract of employment between the principal and the
                        contractor or the worker supplied. Traditionally, a principal who engages a
                        contractor would be engaging the specialist services of the contractor, and
                        would not be directing the contractor on how to do the work. However, today
                        the situation is different. Principals often engage
                        “contractors” and third-party labour not for their specialist
                        expertise, but precisely so that they can avoid entering into a direct
                        employment relationship, for organisational or other reasons. In such
                        situations, the principal, in terms of supervision, takes on the role of an
                        employer. The Bill thus places on him responsibility for the worker’s
                        safety and health as if he were the employer. If this were not the case,
                        then the duties under the Act could be simply circumvented by a careful
                        crafting of the legal relationship.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In our view, the above statements make it
                    clear that the objective of the WSH Bill (which was later enacted as the
                    Workplace Safety and Health Act 2006 (Act 7 of 2006)) was to protect
                    workers and members of the public present at a workplace from injury by
                    deterring risk-taking behaviour (through the imposition of liability for such
                    behaviour) on the part of persons who create and have control over safety risks
                    at workplaces. To achieve this objective, a “more direct liability
                    regime” (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary
                        Debates</em> vol 80 at col 2209) was put in place under
                    Pt IV of the WSH Bill to hold various groups of persons accountable for
                    workers’ safety and health according to their different capacities. We
                    observe that while an AE does not fall under any of the categories of persons
                    enumerated in Pt IV of the WSH Bill, a main contractor and a sub-contractor
                    may fall under one or more of those categories (<em>eg</em>, as an employer under cl 12 of the WSH Bill, or as a
                    manufacturer and supplier of machinery under cl 16). The structure of the
                    WSH Bill suggests that the liability of an AE under the WSH Regime is <em>secondary</em> to that of the persons specifically mentioned
                    in Pt IV of the WSH Bill (<em>inter alia</em>,
                    contractors and sub-contractors). Indeed, the specific office of the AE is first
                    mentioned only in Pt VII of the WSH Bill (specifically, in cl 32; in
                    this regard, see also <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a> above), and the
                    WSH Bill does not spell out the duties and liabilities of an AE (these were set
                    out only later via the 2005 MOM Guidelines and the WSH Regulations). The
                    Explanatory Statement to the WSH Bill confirms that this Bill had several
                    purposes, with the office of the AE fulfilling a different purpose from that of
                    imposing liability on the persons enumerated in Pt IV of the WSH Bill. Had
                    the office of the AE been mentioned under Pt IV, this would have made for a
                    stronger argument for the imposition of a common law duty of care on an AE.
                    Further, in assessing whether a common law duty of care coexists alongside an
                    AE’s statutory duties, it is not an unimportant consideration that all of
                    the AE’s statutory obligations have been set out in subsidiary legislation
                        (see <a href="#p1_58">[58]</a> above), supplemented by
                    the 2005 MOM Guidelines, with a regime of criminal enforcement in place to
                    remedy any breaches of these statutory duties (see <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a> and also <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a> above).
                    We will further elaborate on the significance of this distinction between AEs on
                    the one hand and contractors and sub-contractors on the other later at <a href="#p1_73">[73]</a> below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(6)   Analysis of the Crucial Question</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     We set out earlier the three distinct
                    inspections of the Tower Crane which TJP carried out in this case
                        (see <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above) and the breaches
                    alleged against him (see <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above).
                    Even if TJP is found to have breached his statutory duties, as we pointed out
                    above at <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a>–<a href="#p1_52">[52]</a>, a statutory duty imposes a concomitant duty of care at
                    common law only if the two limbs of the <em>Spandeck</em>
                    test are satisfied, <em>viz</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_a"></a>(a)     if there is a relationship of
                        sufficient legal proximity between the parties concerned;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_b"></a>(b)     (assuming the
                        requisite relationship of proximity exists) if there are no policy
                        considerations which negate, reduce or limit the scope of the duty or the
                        class of persons to whom it is owed or the damages recoverable for a breach
                        of that duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Pursuant to our direction of 7 July 2011
                    for the parties to submit on (<em>inter alia</em>) cases
                    involving statutory duties analogous to those of an AE (see sub-para (b) of
                        <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a> above), TJP has submitted that on
                    the basis of <em>Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman and
                        Others</em> [1990] 2 AC 605 (“<em>Caparo</em>”) and <em>Ikumene Singapore Pte Ltd
                        and another v Leong Chee Leng (trading as Elizabeth Leong &amp;
                        Co)</em> [1993] 2 SLR(R) 480 (“<em>Ikumene</em>”), he owes no common law duty of care in
                    discharging his statutory duties as an AE. Rango has submitted to the contrary
                    based on four cases, namely: <em>Swanson et al v The Queen in
                        right of Canada</em> (1991) 80 DLR (4th) 741 (“<em>Swanson</em>”), <em>Perrett v Collins
                        and Others</em> [1998] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 255 (“<em>Perrett</em>”), <em>Anns and Others v
                        Merton London Borough</em> Council [1978] AC 728 and
                        <em>Welton and Another v North Cornwall District
                        Council</em> [1997] 1 WLR 570.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     At one end of the tortious spectrum of
                    liability, <em>Caparo</em> and <em>Ikumene</em> demonstrate that the courts have in some cases declined
                    to impose a common law duty of care where liability may be indeterminate. In
                        <em>Caparo</em>, the plaintiffs relied on the defendant
                    auditors’ report on a public listed company’s accounts (which report
                    was required under ss 236 and 237 of the Companies Act 1985 (c 6) (UK)
                    (“the UK Companies Act”)) to make a takeover bid for the company.
                    The plaintiffs subsequently sued (<em>inter alia</em>) the
                    auditors for negligence in making the report. The House of Lords declined to
                    impose a common law duty of care on the auditors in respect of their statutory
                    duty to make the report. Their Lordships held that while it was reasonably
                    foreseeable that the accounts of a public listed company might be relied upon by
                    a range of persons for a number of purposes, an auditors’ report on such
                    accounts was required by the UK Companies Act for a specific statutory purpose
                    (see <em>Caparo</em> at 652D), and to find that a
                    public listed company’s auditors owed a common law duty of care towards
                    persons relying on their report on the company’s accounts <em>outside</em> its statutory purpose would be to
                        “<em>create a liability wholly indefinite in area,
                        duration and amount and … open up a limitless vista of uninsurable
                        risk for the professional man</em>” [emphasis added] (see
                        <em>Caparo</em> at 643C–643D). By a process
                    of similar reasoning, in <em>Ikumene</em>, this court
                    declined to impose a common law duty of care on a company’s auditor
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> a guarantor of the company’s
                    credit facilities on the basis that the imposition of such a duty of care would
                    fall outside the statutory purpose for which an auditor’s report on a
                    company’s accounts was required (see <em>Ikumene</em>
                    at <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In our view, <em>Caparo</em> and <em>Ikumene</em> can reasonably
                    bear one of two interpretations, which correspond to, respectively, the two
                    limbs of the <em>Spandeck</em> test. It can be said that no
                    common law duty of care was found to exist in these two cases: (a) on the
                    basis of a lack of sufficient legal proximity (<em>ie</em>,
                    there was insufficient legal proximity between the statutory actors and the
                    plaintiffs, who were individuals falling outside the class of people protected
                    by the relevant statutory purpose); or (b) on the basis of policy
                        (<em>ie</em>, the courts declined to impose a common
                    law duty of care that would expose the statutory actors to indeterminate
                    liability). Indeed, some commentators have expressed the view that policy
                    considerations are built into the element of proximity (see, <em>eg</em>, W V H Rogers, <em>Winfield and
                        Jolowicz on Tort</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 18th Ed, 2010) at
                    para 5-17). In <em>Caparo</em> itself,
                    Lord Oliver of Aylmerton opined (at 633C) that a finding of an absence
                    of proximity “[could] most rationally be attributed simply to the
                    court’s view that it would not be fair and reasonable to hold the
                    defendant responsible”. The same sentiment was echoed by
                    Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in the House of Lords case of <em>Stovin v Wise, Norfolk County Council (Third Party)</em>
                    [1996] AC 923, where his Lordship expressed the view
                    (at 932B–932C) that the concept of proximity was “convenient
                    shorthand for a relationship between two parties which [made] it fair and
                    reasonable [that] one should owe the other a duty of care”. As can be
                    seen, there is an established view that the elements of the <em>Spandeck</em> test are inter-related and overlapping. The effect of
                    this is that factors which are relevant to one limb of the <em>Spandeck</em> test may also be relevant to the other limb in the
                    conduct of the balancing exercise to determine whether a duty of care should be
                    imposed at common law (see <em>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on
                        Torts</em> (Michael A Jones gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    20th Ed, 2010) at para 8-15). This is uncontroversial, and, as
                    indicated earlier at <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a> above, the
                    applicable statutory scheme, in particular, may be relevant to both limbs
                        (<em>ie</em>, both the proximity and the policy limbs)
                    of the <em>Spandeck</em> test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Regardless of which of the two interpretations
                    of <em>Caparo</em> and <em>Ikumene</em> we adopt, we find that the concerns which were
                    determinative in those two cases also apply in our case. In so far as the first
                    interpretation (<em>viz</em>, insufficient legal proximity)
                    is adopted, we find that an argument based on a lack of sufficient legal
                    proximity succeeds in the present case. It is clear, in our view, that while the
                    office of the AE is an integral part of the WSH Regime’s overall statutory
                    purpose of ensuring workplace safety (see <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a>–<a href="#p1_61">[61]</a> above), the
                    statutory objective is not to protect contractors and/or sub-contractors as they
                    have primary responsibility for all aspects of safety at a workplace. Indeed,
                    Dr Ng’s statements in Parliament during the second reading of the WSH
                    Bill (see above at <a href="#p1_66">[66]</a>) suggest that the
                    objective of the WSH Regime is to guard against safety lapses at workplaces by
                    contractors and those to whom they have delegated operational control of their
                    work. In our view, the office of the AE is designed as a safety net, as an
                    additional layer of protection to catch any safety hazards present in tower
                    cranes used at workplaces that may have slipped past the notice of contractors
                    and/or that may arise if contractors cut corners. The creation of this office
                    amounts to statutory recognition that there may be occasions where safety lapses
                    by contractors and/or their sub-contractors occur, and is designed to protect
                    those working or present at workplaces from injury caused by such lapses. As
                    such, the office of the AE is not intended to protect either the contractor
                    and/or the sub-contractor from risk, but is instead intended to protect workers
                    and members of the public present at workplaces. Therefore, Kimly, as the
                    ultimate user of the Tower Crane and the occupier of the Project Site, is
                    clearly <em>not</em> within the class of people intended to
                    be protected by the statutory purpose behind an AE’s duties. In other
                    words, the first limb of the <em>Spandeck</em> test is
                        <em>not</em> satisfied in the present case and, thus,
                    TJP did not owe Kimly any <em>prima facie</em> duty of care
                    at common law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     We should add that a striking feature of the
                    instant case is that contributory negligence was not pleaded as between Rango
                    and TJP (see <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above), and a finding
                    that TJP owed a common law duty of care to Kimly would produce the extraordinary
                    result of TJP being liable for the <em>entire</em> damage
                    ensuing from the collapse of the Tower Crane regardless of whether or not he was
                    responsible for the cause of the collapse (see above at <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a>). Such a result goes against the spirit, if not the letter,
                    of the WSHA and also against common sense. Nothing in the WSHA contemplates the
                    apportionment of liability, not to mention the imposition of a common law duty
                    of care, between the various persons on whom statutory duties are imposed under
                    Pt IV of the WSHA. Section 10 of the WSHA (which falls under that
                    Part) expressly provides that the same duty or liability can be imposed on two
                    or more persons, and that the duty or liability imposed on a person will not be
                    diminished or affected simply because it is concurrently imposed on another
                    person. Of course, this position is with regard to the persons who owe statutory
                    duties under Pt IV of the WSHA, and, as we alluded to earlier (at <a href="#p1_68">[68]</a> above), an AE is not one of the persons
                    enumerated in that Part. Be that as it may, we find that Pt IV of the WSHA
                    stands for the broader proposition that under the WSH Regime, persons who create
                    or have control over safety risks at workplaces will not be allowed to shelter
                    behind each other or others to avoid liability when those risks materialise.
                    This does not, however, exclude the possibility that in appropriate cases,
                    persons who are individually liable for breaching their statutory duties under
                    the WSHA may also be found to have been contributorily negligent towards each
                    other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Assuming, for argument’s sake, that
                    there is a relationship of sufficient legal proximity between TJP and Kimly
                        (<em>contra</em> our finding at <a href="#p1_73">[73]</a> above), we now go on to discuss the second
                    limb of the <em>Spandeck</em> test, which corresponds to
                    the second interpretation of <em>Caparo</em> and <em>Ikumene</em>, <em>viz</em>, that no
                    common law duty of care was found in those two cases because of policy reasons
                    (see above at <a href="#p1_72">[72]</a>). In so far as the second
                    interpretation is concerned, we find that there could plausibly be what may be
                    broadly described as indeterminate liability to an indeterminate class in the
                    present case if the Crucial Question is answered in Rango’s favour. While
                    an AE’s statutory duties are specific to the installation of a particular
                    tower crane at a particular workplace for a particular period of time, in the
                    event of a breach of these duties, the cascading effects of consequential
                    economic loss can be enormous, particularly if there are work stoppages. All
                    affected parties as well as their suppliers and other actors further down the
                    chain may have some sort of consequential claim against an AE for his statutory
                    lapse(s) if a private cause of action were coexistent. That said, we recognise
                    that the fear of indeterminacy is not the key policy consideration in the
                    present case as this concern might be better addressed at the stage of assessing
                    remoteness of damage. Even so, for the reasons given below (at <a href="#p1_84">[84]</a>–<a href="#p1_89">[89]</a>), we find that the second limb of the <em>Spandeck</em> test is not satisfied in the present case as there are
                    other policy factors which militate against finding that TJP owed a common law
                    duty of care to Kimly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Before we set out these policy factors, we
                    wish to first discuss two of the cases cited by Rango, <em>viz</em>, <em>Swanson</em> and <em>Perrett</em>, both of which lie at the other end of the
                    spectrum of tortious liability from <em>Caparo</em> and
                        <em>Ikumene</em>. In both <em>Swanson</em> and <em>Perrett</em>, a common law
                    duty of care was quite readily imposed. Both cases involved airplane crashes
                    which were the result of the negligence of the relevant statutory inspectors in
                    failing to prevent certain flight operations. In <em>Swanson</em>, the estates of the deceased passengers sued (<em>inter alia</em>) the relevant government agency which,
                    through its inspectors, had allowed the flight operations of a small commercial
                    airline to continue despite the presence of many safety irregularities. In
                        <em>Perrett</em>, an injured passenger sued, <em>inter alia</em>, the inspector who had negligently provided a
                    certificate of fitness for the airplane in question to fly. In both cases, the
                    courts quite easily found that the inspector (in <em>Perrett</em>) and the Department of Transport (the relevant
                    government agency in <em>Swanson</em>) owed a duty of care
                    to the passengers of the respective airplanes. In particular, in <em>Swanson</em>, the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal expressed
                    its agreement with the trial judge’s ruling that (see <em>Swanson</em> at 750):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The <em>Aeronautics Act</em> [RSC 1985, c A-2
                        (Canada)] and [the] Regulations made thereunder if not explicitly imposing a
                        duty of care of the general public, at least do so by implication in that
                        this is the very reason for their existence. The flying public has no
                        protection against avaricious airlines, irresponsible or inadequately
                        trained pilots, and defective aircraft if not [for] the Department of
                        Transport and must rely on it for enforcement of the law and regulations in
                        the interest of public safety. … While there may be no contractual
                        duty of care owed to the public, as [the] plaintiff suggests, this does not
                        of itself protect [the] defendant from liability in tort. [emphasis in
                        original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Similar reasoning was echoed by the English
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Perrett</em> (at 272) as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The regulatory framework recognizes the dangers that are inherent in
                        flying. That is the very purpose lying behind the prohibition on taking
                        aeroplanes into the air without a certificate of airworthiness and a permit
                        to fly, and the appointment of the [Civil Aviation Authority] or those
                        authorized by them to issue such certificates. The whole purpose is one of
                        air safety. In my judgment, any reasonably well informed member of the
                        public, although not in possession of the detailed framework, would expect
                        there to be such a regulatory framework in force to ensure his safety when
                        flying and would rely upon it. Furthermore, a member of the public would
                        expect that a person who is appointed to carry out these functions of
                        inspecting aircraft and issuing permits would exercise reasonable care in
                        doing so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     While it <em>ex
                        facie</em> appears that the reasoning in <em>Swanson</em> and <em>Perrett</em> resonates
                    strongly with the instant case, where the regulatory framework of the WSHA is
                    aimed at ensuring safety at workplaces, with the AE playing an integral role in
                    this framework, we would be hesitant to uncritically transplant the result in
                        <em>Swanson</em> and <em>Perrett</em> to our case. This is because both the Canadian Federal
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Swanson</em> and the English Court
                    of Appeal in <em>Perrett</em> seemed to take it for granted
                    that a duty of care would exist if certain specific issues were resolved in the
                    respective plaintiffs’ favour (<em>viz</em>, in
                        <em>Swanson</em>, the issue of whether s 8 of the
                    Crown Liability Act 1985, c C-50 (Canada) shielded the relevant government
                    agency from liability, and in <em>Perrett</em>, the issue
                    of whether there was any difference between cases of physical damage and cases
                    of economic loss). With respect, it seems to us that the reasoning in these two
                    cases (as set out above at <a href="#p1_76">[76]</a>–<a href="#p1_77">[77]</a>) does not
                    involve a sufficient examination of whether the <em>Spandeck</em> test is satisfied, and is not particularly helpful in
                    ascertaining whether a common law duty of care exists alongside a statutory duty
                    in a particular case. In fact, the reasoning suffers from over-inclusion as it
                    would arguably point towards a concomitant common law duty of care existing
                    alongside <em>every</em> statutory duty – in that all
                    statutory frameworks arguably exist for the purpose of protecting some public
                    interest, and the public would expect those appointed to carry out functions
                    under these frameworks to carry out their functions competently and diligently.
                    We find that reference to the protective function of a statutory framework, in
                    itself, does not necessarily answer the question of whether the statutory actors
                    concerned owe a <em>legal</em> duty <em>directly</em> to the members of the public who are intended to be
                    protected by that statutory framework. As already stated above at <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a>–<a href="#p1_52">[52]</a>, not all statutory duties give rise to a concomitant common
                    law duty of care. It is equally plausible that the legislative intention that
                    statutory actors perform their functions competently and diligently is to be met
                    by only the criminal sanctions provided for within the relevant statutory
                    framework itself, without any coexistent common law duty of care.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     We emphasise that the question of whether a
                    statutory duty gives rise to a common law duty of care under the <em>Spandeck</em> test is highly –
                    <em>but not wholly</em> – dependent on the particular
                    statutory and/or regulatory framework in issue in each case. This can be seen
                    from <em>Animal Concerns</em>. In that case, the appellant
                    engaged a contractor (“A.n.A”) to construct an animal shelter;
                    A.n.A in turn appointed its director (the respondent) as the clerk of works to
                    supervise the construction project. In carrying out the backfilling of the
                    construction site, A.n.A used materials which were inferior to the
                    contractually-stipulated materials. As a result, the animal enclosures on some
                    portions of the site later had to be reconstructed. The appellant sued A.n.A for
                    breach of contract, and also sued the respondent for negligence in (<em>inter alia</em>) supervising the backfilling works. This
                    court held that although s 10(5)(<em>b</em>) of the
                    Building Control Act (Cap 29, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the BCA”)
                    did not impose any statutory duty on the respondent, as the clerk of works, to
                    supervise the backfilling works and although a breach of s 10 of the BCA
                    resulted in purely criminal sanctions under ss 10(7)–10(9), based on
                    the <em>Spandeck</em> test, the respondent nonetheless owed
                    the appellant a duty of care at common law to supervise the backfilling works
                    because of the very particular nature of a clerk of works’ function in
                    relation to the client commissioning a construction project (the
                    “client”). At [45] of
                        <em>Animal Concerns</em>, this court cited the English
                    High Court case of <em>Leicester Board of Guardians v
                        Trollope</em> (25 January 1911) (reported in Alfred
                    A Hudson, <em>The Law of Building, Engineering and Ship
                        Building Contracts and of the Duties and Liabilities of Engineers,
                        Architects, Surveyors, and Valuers; with Reports of Cases and
                        Precedents</em> vol 2 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4th Ed, 1914) at
                    p 419), where it was stated (at p 423): “[e]verybody knows that
                    an architect cannot be there all the time, and <em>everybody
                        knows that </em><em>the clerk of the</em>
                        [<em>sic</em>] <em>works is appointed to
                        protect the interests of the employer against the builder</em>, mainly
                    because the architect cannot be there” [emphasis in original omitted;
                    emphasis added in italics]. This court further elaborated at [44] and [51] of <em>Animal Concerns</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">44    It appears, therefore, that the industry practice
                            has been that clerks of works assist the architect by monitoring the
                            work of contractors on behalf of the person commissioning the
                            construction works (“the client”), in order to ensure that
                            work is carried out to <em>the client’s</em>
                            standards, specifications and schedule, that the correct materials are
                            used and that proper workmanship is observed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">51    This survey of authorities demonstrates that, both
                            as a matter of industry practice and judicial observation, a clerk of
                            works is regarded as being, by virtue of his functions and
                            responsibilities at the building site, in fairly close proximity to
                                <em>the client</em>, regardless of whether they
                            are in a formal employer-employee relationship. If, of course, the clerk
                            of works is in fact employed by the client, then there would also be a
                                <em>contractual relationship</em> (which would,
                            naturally, entail the corresponding legal obligations) between the
                            parties. The clerk of works protects the interests of the client against
                            the builder, by inspecting and supervising the works to ensure that they
                            conform to the client’s budget, standards and specifications, and
                            that the client is getting value for money and proper workmanship.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     As stated in the preceding paragraph, this
                    court’s finding of sufficient legal proximity between the respondent clerk
                    of works and the appellant client in <em>Animal
                        Concerns</em> was premised on the very particular function of a clerk
                    of works <em>vis-à-vis</em> a client. <em>Even given this unique relationship between a clerk of works and a client
                        in industry practice</em>, this court was careful to mention that not
                    all clerks of works would inexorably owe a common law duty of care to clients
                    – whether such a duty of care existed would depend on the <em>particular scope of duty</em> of the clerk of works in a
                    particular case (see <em>Animal Concerns</em> at [51]–[55]). This was because, this court explained, the
                    qualifications and functions of clerks of works could vary enormously from case
                    to case (see <em>Animal Concerns</em> at [53], citing vol 1, para 2-024 of
                    I N Duncan Wallace, <em>Hudson’s Building and
                        Engineering Contracts</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1995)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Clerks of works are usually employed for a specific project, in many cases
                        on the recommendation of the architect, though it is not unusual for
                        building owners with their own building departments or organisations to put
                        forward one of their own employees. They are almost invariably employed and
                        paid for by the building owner. ... Their use is more common in building
                        than in engineering contracts ... <em>Their qualifications

                            considerably inferior to that of a resident engineer, and the extent of
                            their authority much more rigorously circumscribed by the contract

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     This court therefore cautioned at [55]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [A]t a <em>threshold</em> level, <em>there might not even be a duty of care to begin with</em>
                        … We are, of course, assuming a situation in which there is <em>no contractual nexus</em> between the clerk of works
                        concerned and the client to begin with. Whilst, following from the analysis
                        above at <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a>–<a href="#p1_51">[51]</a>, it might be argued that, in such a
                        situation, there would, ordinarily, be a duty of care in <em>tort</em> owed by the clerk of works to the client (<em>cf</em> Stephen Furst and Sir Vivian Ramsey,
                            <em>Keating on Construction Contracts</em> (Sweet
                        &amp; Maxwell, 8th Ed, 2006) … at para 13-049), we are of
                        the view that, <em>in order for such a duty of care to exist,
                            there must first be demonstrated that, on the facts of the case
                            concerned, there had been legal proximity between the parties –
                            for example, that there had been an assumption of responsibility by the
                            clerk of works</em> vis-à-vis <em>the client.
                            </em><em>At this juncture, the universal and the
                            particular (necessarily and, indeed, inevitably) intersect, with the
                            focus tending towards the latter (as opposed to the former).</em>
                        This necessarily entails an application of the general legal principles to
                        the <em>facts</em> of the case itself. …

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     What <em>Animal
                        Concerns</em> illustrates is that the question of whether a statutory
                    actor owes a concurrent common law duty of care is highly, <em>but not wholly</em>, dependent on the particular features of the
                    statutory regime in question. The specific facts of the particular case at hand
                    are equally (and may even be more) important. In short, the <em>Spandeck</em> elements have to be established in every case. Care
                    must be taken not to apply cases from other jurisdictions – or, for that
                    matter, even Singapore cases involving different statutory regimes –
                    without a proper appreciation of their context, both legal and factual. In any
                    case, we do not think we can derive much assistance from the variable current of
                    English cases because they are premised on the distinction between physical
                    damage and economic loss. On the one hand, the inspector in <em>Perrett</em> was found to owe a duty of care because the loss
                    involved was physical damage; on the other hand, it was held in <em>Reeman and Another v Department of Transport and Others</em>
                    [1997] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 648 (“<em>Reeman</em>”) that the government department in question did
                    not owe a duty of care to the purchaser of a fishing boat who had relied on an
                    incorrect safety certificate in respect of the vessel because the loss suffered
                    by the purchaser was pure economic loss. Indeed, the court in <em>Perrett</em> took great pains to clarify that the requirement of
                    legal proximity was fulfilled in the case before it because that was not a case
                    of economic loss, but a case of physical damage (see <em>Perrett</em> at 260–261 and 263–265), and
                    specifically distinguished <em>Reeman</em> on that basis
                    (see <em>Perrett</em> at 265). Given this
                    court’s affirmation in <em>Spandeck</em> (at [115])
                    that “[a] <em>single</em> test to determine the
                    existence of a duty of care [at common law] should be applied regardless of the
                    nature of the damage caused (<em>ie</em>, [whether] pure
                    economic loss or physical damage)” [emphasis in original], the English
                    line of cases is not particularly helpful.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Reverting now to the policy considerations
                    alluded to at <a href="#p1_75">[75]</a> above <em>vis-à-vis</em> the second limb of the <em>Spandeck</em> test, we now go on to consider the WSH Regime in the
                    context of the specific facts of this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     As we pointed out above at <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a>, the necessary implication of Rango’s
                    claim against TJP for an <em>indemnity</em> in respect of
                    all damage caused to Kimly by the Tower Crane’s collapse is that
                    regardless of what the primary cause of a defect in a tower crane is and what
                    responsibility (if any) other persons bear for the defect, once an AE fails to
                    perform his statutory duties <em>vis-à-vis</em> the use of
                    that tower crane at a workplace, <em>all</em> legal
                    liability falls on the AE in respect of any damage arising from the said defect.
                    A finding that TJP is liable to indemnify Rango would be tantamount to <em>converting a statutory regime meant to ensure workplace safety into
                        an insurance regime for the other private parties involved in the
                        operational aspects of a workplace regardless of their individual
                        responsibility for any safety lapses.</em> This goes against
                    considerations of corrective justice, which includes an element of
                    “proportionality between the wrongdoing and the loss suffered
                    thereby” (see <em>McFarlane and Another v Tayside Health
                        Board</em> [2000] 2 AC 59 (“<em>McFarlane</em>”) <em>per</em>
                    Lord Clyde at 106A).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     For the following reasons, we find that the
                    imposition of a common law duty of care on TJP would also go against
                    considerations of distributive justice. While Lord Clyde arrived at his
                    decision in <em>McFarlane</em> based on considerations of
                    corrective justice, Lord Steyn arrived at the same result based on
                    considerations of distributive justice, which he recognised
                    (at 82A–83E) as a legitimate concern to be balanced against
                    corrective justice. One of the factors to be taken into account in the matrix of
                    distributive justice is that of risk allocation and the availability of
                    protection through insurance. In this regard, Lord Denning MR noted in
                        <em>Lamb and Another v Camden London Borough Council and
                        Another</em> [1981] QB 625 (at 637G–638B) apropos
                    the plaintiffs’ claim that the defendant local council owed them a duty of
                    care to prevent squatters from invading a property which they had left
                    unfurnished and unoccupied:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On broader grounds of policy, I would add this: <em>the
                            criminal acts here – malicious damage and theft – are
                            usually covered by insurance. </em><em>By this
                            means the risk of loss is spread throughout the community. It does not
                            fall too heavily on one pair of shoulders alone.</em> ... It is
                        commonplace nowadays for the courts, when considering policy, to take
                        insurance into account. It played a prominent part in <em>Photo Production Ltd. v. Securicor Transport Ltd.</em> [1980]
                        A.C. 827. The House of Lords clearly thought that the risk of fire should be
                        borne by the fire insurers who had received the full premium for fire risk
                        – and not by Securicor’s insurers, who had only received a tiny
                        premium. That, too, was a policy decision. … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     In <em>Morgan Crucible Co Plc v
                        Hill Samuel &amp; Co Ltd and Others</em> [1991] Ch 295
                        (“<em>Morgan Crucible</em>”),
                    Hoffmann J considered that the factor of insurance was what distinguished
                        <em>Smith v Eric S Bush</em> [1990]
                    1 AC 831 (“<em>Smith</em>”) from
                        <em>Caparo</em>. In <em>Smith</em>, a common law duty of care was imposed on the defendant
                    surveyor <em>vis-à-vis</em> the plaintiff client who sought
                    a survey report on a property which she intended to purchase, whereas in
                        <em>Caparo</em>, no common law duty of care was found
                    on the part of the defendant auditors <em>vis-à-vis</em>
                    the plaintiffs, who had relied on the auditors’ report on a public listed
                    company’s accounts to make a takeover bid for the company. Commenting on
                    these two cases, Hoffmann J stated (at 302G–303A of <em>Morgan Crucible</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he typical [house purchaser] in a <em>Smith</em>-type case is a person of modest means and making the
                        most expensive purchase of his or her life. He is very unlikely to be
                        insured against the manifestation of inherent defects. The surveyor can
                        protect himself relatively easily by insurance. The take-over bidder, on the
                        other hand, is an entrepreneur taking high risks for high rewards and while
                        some accountants may be able to take out sufficient insurance, others may
                        not. Furthermore, the take-over bidder [in the case of <em>Caparo</em>] is a limited liability company and the accountants
                        are individuals for whom, save so far as they are covered by insurance,
                        liability would mean personal ruin. … [T]he imposition of liability
                        upon surveyors would probably not greatly increase their insurance costs and
                        push up the cost of surveys because the typical buyer who relies on a
                        building society survey is buying a relatively modest house. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Hoffmann J went on to find that the case
                    before him, which was factually similar to <em>Caparo</em>,
                    fell on the <em>Caparo</em> side of the line, where no
                    common law duty of care was imposed (<em>Morgan
                        Crucible</em> was a case of a plaintiff, who had relied on a
                    company’s audited financial statements to make a takeover bid for the
                    company, suing (<em>inter alia</em>) the company’s
                    accountants for alleged negligent misstatements in those financial statements).
                    We note that Hoffmann J’s judgment was overturned on appeal on the
                    ground that, <em>inter alia</em>, it “would not [be]
                    right by reference to economic considerations to dismiss as unarguable an
                    otherwise arguable case” (see <em>Morgan
                        Crucible</em> at 321C). This statement, however, must be
                    understood in its context. The issue to be determined in <em>Morgan Crucible</em> was whether the plaintiff’s application to
                    amend its statement of claim should be allowed. (The plaintiff made this
                    application after the defendant indicated that it was considering applying to
                    strike out the plaintiff’s (original) statement of claim.) The applicable
                    test for whether the plaintiff’s application should be allowed was thus
                    whether the proposed amendments to the statement of claim would survive an
                    application to strike them out as disclosing no cause of action. While economic
                    considerations, including questions of risk allocation and insurance, were not
                    found (on appeal) to be determinative in <em>Morgan
                        Crucible</em>, the English Court of Appeal endorsed the continued
                        <em>relevancy</em> of these factors
                    (at 321B):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [S]o far as it is possible to do so, it will be right for the
                        court at the trial not to close its eyes to the possible economic
                        consequences of its decision as to the existence of a duty of care.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We share the view expressed by the English Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Morgan Crucible</em>, <em>viz</em>, that economic considerations, such as the availability of
                    insurance coverage, are relevant, although not determinative.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Turning to the facts of the instant case,
                    while Kimly and Rango had agreed in cl 3.6 of the Sub-Contract (see above
                    at <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>) that Kimly was to take out an
                    equipment all-risks policy to insure against the loss of or any damage to the
                    Tower Crane, there is no indication that TJP was covered by any sort of
                    professional insurance or had been requested to seek insurance coverage. Had
                    there been a similar allocation of risk between TJP and Rango as that which
                    existed between Rango and Kimly, it is likely that Rango would have made similar
                    arrangements with TJP for the latter to purchase insurance. In our view, the
                    imposition of a common law duty of care on TJP would cut across, and be
                    inconsistent with, the structure of the relationships created by the contracts
                    which Kimly, Rango and TJP entered into in the present case (<em>viz</em>, the Sub-Contract between Kimly and Rango, and the oral
                    contract between Rango and TJP).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Our view that a common law duty of care should
                    not be imposed on TJP is supported by our reading of the WSHA and what we
                    consider to be its primary objective – namely, ensuring the safety of
                    those present at workplaces (particularly workers), and attributing
                    responsibility for workplace safety to those having operational control of
                    workplaces. The role of the AE in the context of the WSH Regime is to provide an
                    additional layer of checks on contractors and sub-contractors so as to reduce
                    safety risks at workplaces and thereby avoid accidents (see <a href="#p1_73">[73]</a> above). Given that there is no particular
                    indication that the WSH Regime contemplates the coexistence of a common law duty
                    of care on the part of an AE in addition to his statutory duties (and the
                    criminal and regulatory sanctions expressly stipulated for breach of those
                    duties), we find nothing to demonstrate or support a finding that the WSH Regime
                    intended that AEs, when discharging their statutory function of <em>examining</em> whether private parties have complied with the
                    prescribed safety standards, should become exposed to a coextensive private
                    liability for breaches of their professional responsibilities to other
                    contractors with whom they have no direct contractual relationship. In short, we
                    do not think that the WSHA has made AEs insurers for such parties, and certainly
                    not to an <em>unlimited</em> degree. This is particularly
                    so given that: (a) insurance arrangements can be made by the parties; and
                    (b) the fee for TJP’s services was only $716 (see above at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>), which appears from the record before us to be
                    the going rate for similar services. <em>Given that the WSHA is
                        intended to protect persons present at workplaces from safety lapses by
                        contractors and their sub-contractors, we think it remarkably ironic that
                        Rango now seeks an indemnity from TJP when Rango was responsible for
                        supplying </em><em>Kimly with a tower crane without any
                        pre-existing defects such as the Pre-Existing Cracks in the Tower
                        Crane.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     For the above reasons, even if TJP did indeed
                    owe Kimly a <em>prima facie</em> duty of care at common law
                    under the first limb of the <em>Spandeck</em> test, we find
                    that policy considerations ought to negate this duty of care under the second
                    limb of that test. In short, we find that TJP did not owe Kimly a common law
                    duty of care in the discharge of his statutory functions. Therefore, s 15
                    of the Civil Law Act does not apply because TJP is not liable to Kimly for
                    “the same damage” as the damage for which Rango is liable to Kimly
                    (see the three-step test set out at <a href="#p1_49">[49]</a>
                    above). Rango’s reliance on s 15 as a basis for its claim against TJP
                    must therefore fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Further observations on the legal bases pleaded by Rango</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     In any case, even if we had found that the
                        <em>Spandeck</em> test was satisfied and that TJP owed
                    Kimly a common law duty of care, we would still hold that Rango did not make out
                    a case for TJP to answer in the court below. In the myriad of issues that have
                    arisen in this appeal, it is easy to lose sight of the basics. The fact is that
                    despite pleading various alternative legal bases in support of its claim against
                    TJP (see above at <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a>), Rango did <em>not</em>, as we have shown above, make out any of these legal
                    bases in the proceedings below. Tellingly, in Rango’s closing submissions
                    for the trial, there was only one paragraph (<em>viz</em>,
                    para 55) which alluded to any sort of legal basis for Rango’s claim
                    – the rest of Rango’s closing submissions pertained to factual
                    evidence indicating that TJP had discharged his statutory duties negligently,
                    which, as we have held (at, <em>inter alia</em>, <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a> above), is not the issue in this appeal. All
                    that para 55 of Rango’s closing submissions stated by way of the
                    legal basis of Rango’s claim against TJP was the following:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Defendant’s [<em>ie</em>, Rango’s]
                        claim against the Third Party [<em>ie</em>, TJP] is
                        based on contract (alternatively in tort) in that the Third Party had
                        breached his contract with the Defendant by failing to exercise due
                        diligence in the discharge of his duties as [an AE]; in particular to
                        undertake or to ensure that the mast anchors were subjected to the MOM
                        mandated tests …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     In our view, this cryptic submission is
                    patently inadequate as it fails to explain why TJP is obliged to indemnify Rango
                    completely in respect of its liability to Kimly. The “express or implied
                    contractual or other right to [an] indemnity”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> pleaded by TJP is also untenable for
                    the reasons stated at <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a> and <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a> above. As for s 15 of the Civil Law Act,
                    this ground, although pleaded in Rango’s Statement of Claim against TJP
                    and although constituting the centrepiece of Rango’s submissions in this
                    appeal, was <em>not</em> part of the case which Rango
                    eventually actively pursued against TJP in the court below. Therefore, even if
                    we had found that s 15 of the Civil Law Act applied, this would be of no
                    avail to Rango in the present appeal. It must be borne in mind that this appeal
                    relates to a particular procedure adopted at the trial, <em>viz</em>, the submission of “no case to answer” made by
                    TJP. <em>Whether TJP had a case to answer in the court below
                        </em><em>must be assessed against the case which Rango
                        </em><em>eventually actively advanced
                        </em><em>against TJP in that court, and not against the
                        case which could have been </em><em>advanced (in view
                        of Rango’s Statement of Claim against TJP) – but which was not
                        eventually taken up – by Rango.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Even more crucially, even if we had taken
                    Rango’s submissions on s 15 of the Civil Law Act on board, this still
                    would not make out a case for the <em>indemnity</em>
                    awarded by the Judge in Rango’s favour. Based on its plain language,
                    s 15 of the Civil Law Act would allow Rango to claim only <em>contribution</em> from TJP. Under the usual principles of
                    tort law, any contribution payable by one tortfeasor to another tortfeasor would
                    be in proportion to their respective degrees of contributory negligence. As we
                    noted above at <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> and <a href="#p1_74">[74]</a>, contributory negligence was not pleaded by
                    either Rango or TJP. Even if it had been pleaded, there would, in our view,
                    still be no legal basis for Rango to claim that TJP’s breach of his common
                    law duty of care (assuming we had found such duty existed) resulted in his being
                    under an <em>unlimited</em> obligation to <em>indemnify</em> any other party who might have been
                    contributorily liable for the damage suffered by Kimly, as opposed to being
                    under only a <em>limited</em> obligation to <em>contribute</em> to the extent of his negligence. Indeed, even
                    in the cases referred to above where the courts imposed a common law duty of
                    care on the statutory actors concerned (<em>viz</em>,
                        <em>Perrett</em>, <em>Swanson</em>
                    and <em>Animal Concerns</em>), <em>this was
                        only to the extent to which they were contributorily negligent for the loss
                        or damage in question</em>. In <em>Perrett</em>,
                    liability was apportioned between the inspector and, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the individual who had assembled and piloted the airplane;
                    in <em>Swanson</em>, liability was apportioned between the
                    government agency which had appointed the inspector as well as the pilot and the
                    airline; and in <em>Animal Concerns</em>, both the
                    respondent clerk of works and the contractor (<em>viz</em>,
                    A.n.A) were found liable to the appellant client who had engaged the contractor
                    to carry out the construction works. There was no question of the respondent
                    clerk of works in <em>Animal Concerns</em> being legally
                    obliged to indemnify the contractor just because of his negligence in failing to
                    detect that the contractor had not used the contractually-stipulated materials
                    to carry out the backfilling works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     In conclusion, therefore, Rango’s case
                    in the court below was fatally flawed as it was based on two cumulative leaps of
                    logic: the first was the leap from TJP’s breach of his statutory duties
                    under the WSH Regime to his concurrently owing a common law duty of care in the
                    discharge of those duties; the second was the leap from TJP’s owing a
                    common law duty of care to Kimly (assuming such duty did exist) to his being
                    under an obligation to indemnify Rango for the entirety of the damage suffered
                    by Kimly, rather than being under merely an obligation to contribute to the
                    extent of his breach of duty (if any). In the result, we find that TJP was
                    entitled and correct to make a submission of “no case to answer”
                    in the court below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     For the sake of completeness, we should
                    mention that since we have found that TJP is not liable to indemnify Rango in
                    respect of the latter’s liability to Kimly, it is not necessary for us to
                    deal with the remaining grounds of appeal raised by TJP (<em>ie</em>, that the losses claimed by Kimly are too remote, and that
                    those losses have not been proved (see sub-paras (c) and (d) of
                        <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> above)).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     For all of the above reasons, we allow this
                    appeal, with TJP’s costs here and below to be borne entirely by Rango. As
                    a consequence of our decision, some of the other costs orders made by the Judge
                    (including his order that TJP is to bear the costs of Feng and FES for the
                    proceedings below) may have to be varied. All the parties to the proceedings
                    below have seven days from the date of this judgment to make written submissions
                    on the further consequential orders that we ought to make.</p>
