On the one hand, there is the public policy embodied in (here, foreign) legislation intended to relieve the financial hardship that results despite the fact that a matrimonial order has been handed down in a foreign jurisdiction whilst there is, on the other, the (here, local) public policy in ensuring that finality is maintained in court decisions (in this case, in the context of the division of matrimonial assets). In this last-mentioned regard, there is an especial concern with regard to preventing court decisions being attacked and/or subverted by what is (in substance and effect) re-litigation of issues that have already been determined by the court itself. Indeed, this particular issue is, as we shall see, at the centre of the present appeal. Given, in particular, the aforementioned tension (and the technical as well as policy complexities as well as detail in analysis that they entail), it might conduce towards clarity if we summarise our reasons and decision right at the outset of the present judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In essence, the matrimonial assets in the present case had been divided by the Singapore court between the parties following their divorce. However, one particular asset – real property (the “Property”) located in London (and which constituted the most valuable asset) – was held <span class="font-italic">not</span> to be a matrimonial asset and was therefore not part of the pool of matrimonial assets that was divided between the parties by the Singapore court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The appellant wife (the “appellant”) subsequently brought a claim pursuant to Part III of the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984 (c 42) (UK) (the “MFPA”) for <span class="font-italic">financial relief</span> centring on the Property after an <span class="font-italic">overseas</span> (here, Singapore) divorce. The <span class="font-italic">purpose</span> of this claim provided for by the MFPA was to furnish financial relief in situations of need <span class="font-italic">notwithstanding</span> the fact that financial provision might have been provided pursuant to a <span class="font-italic">prior overseas</span> divorce by the relevant court in that particular jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 At first blush, the subsequent claim for <span class="font-italic">financial relief </span>in the <span class="font-italic">English </span>court appears <span class="font-italic">separate and distinct</span> from the earlier proceedings related to <span class="font-italic">the division of matrimonial assets </span>in the <span class="font-italic">Singapore </span>court. However, it should be noted that <span class="font-italic">the Property</span> was – literally at least – involved in <span class="font-italic">both</span> sets of proceedings. The respondent husband (the “respondent”) sought an <span class="font-italic">anti-suit injunction</span> (“ASI”) to prevent the appellant from continuing with the English proceedings, arguing, amongst other things, that there would be a <span class="font-italic">re-litigation</span> of matters that had already been decided by the Singapore court. The issue that arises is whether or not <span class="font-italic">re-litigation</span> would in fact take place were the proceedings in the English court permitted to continue, given that both sets of proceedings had (as just mentioned) <span class="font-italic">different</span> purposes – the application in the English court being one for financial relief following a divorce in Singapore, and the proceedings in Singapore being for the division of matrimonial assets in the aforementioned divorce.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 At this juncture, it is of the first importance to note that the answer to the issue just set out must surely be one of <span class="font-italic">substance and not merely form </span><span class="font-italic">– literal or descriptive </span>similarities and/or differences ought not to be <span class="font-italic">legally or normatively determinative</span> in and of themselves. Hence, for example, notwithstanding the fact that an application for financial relief in the English court might appear to have a different purpose from the previous matrimonial proceedings in the Singapore court, if the former is, in <span class="font-italic">substance</span>, a <span class="font-italic">re-litigation</span> of the latter, then that would, in our view, be impermissible as it would undermine or subvert the public policy relating to the finality as well as integrity of the Singapore courts’ decisions in relation to matrimonial proceedings. In <span class="font-italic">that</span> event, an <span class="font-italic">ASI</span> <span class="font-italic">might </span>indeed be granted by the Singapore court in order to restrain proceedings that are initiated in England. What would constitute re-litigation would depend on the precise facts and circumstances of the case. <span class="font-italic">However</span>, in the <span class="font-italic">present case</span>, we are of the view that there has been <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">no</span> <span class="font-italic">re-litigation</span> inasmuch as the claim initiated by the appellant for financial relief pursuant to Part III did <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not</span> engage <span class="font-italic">the distribution of the Property in relation to matrimonial proceedings simply because the Property was not considered part of the pool of matrimonial assets in the first place.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 What, then, of the argument that the Singapore courts, by holding that the Property was not part of the pool of matrimonial assets, had in fact rendered a decision with respect to the matrimonial proceedings and that, therefore, the claim initiated by the plaintiff for financial relief pursuant to Part III <span class="font-italic">did </span>constitute a <span class="font-italic">re-litigation</span> of this particular decision? Whilst a not unattractive argument, it is our view that the fact that the Property had not been considered part of the pool of matrimonial assets meant that <span class="font-italic">not a single iota </span>of the Property could, <span class="font-italic">ex hypothesi</span>, have been <span class="font-italic">the subject matter of distribution</span> to one or both of the parties <span class="font-italic">pursuant to </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the matrimonial proceedings</span>. Looked at in that light, the subsequent claim initiated by the appellant for financial relief pursuant to Part III and which centred on the Property could <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not</span> be construed as a <span class="font-italic">re-litigation</span> of a matter that, <span class="font-italic">ex hypothesi</span>, was <span class="font-italic">never before the Singapore court hearing the matrimonial proceedings in the first place</span>. It is important to emphasise once again that the inquiry is one of substance and not form. As importantly, it is an inquiry that should not be preoccupied with fine distinctions. As we pointed out to the parties during oral submissions before us, had the appellant accepted – without argument – that the Property did not form part of the pool of matrimonial assets, she would clearly not have been precluded from initiating a claim pursuant to Part III simply because the Property <span class="font-italic">would clearly not have been the subject of the matrimonial proceedings in the Singapore court</span>. The fact that she <span class="font-italic">did</span> argue – albeit unsuccessfully – that the Property ought to form part of the pool of matrimonial assets should not, in our view, make a difference. Indeed, to insist on drawing such a difference would be to engage in an overly technical inquiry that would produce rather <span class="font-italic">arbitrary </span>results. Such flexibility as well as the eschewing of an overly technical approach towards the concept of re-litigation is also needful in light of the fact that by their <span class="font-italic">very nature</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>both Part III and Chapter 4A of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (the “Women’s Charter”) would – <span class="font-italic">literally</span> speaking – often involve a consideration of the same facts that were before the court concerned in respect of the foreign divorce proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 More importantly, the court should – as far as it is possible – attempt to give effect to the underlying policy and spirit of these statutory provisions that <span class="font-italic">do </span>presuppose that there have been prior foreign matrimonial proceedings and whose purpose is nevertheless to provide financial relief where it is necessary to do so. In the context of the present appeal, the fact that the Property had <span class="font-italic">not</span> been the subject of any division by the Singapore courts as it was considered not to be within the pool of matrimonial assets that was to be divided between the parties renders it less likely – if at all – that the public policy of Singapore in relation to the division of matrimonial assets would be contravened, whilst simultaneously rendering it an eminently appropriate resource from which the financial hardship of the appellant could be alleviated <span class="font-italic">provided that the appellant can make good her claim pursuant to the letter as well as spirit of </span><span class="font-italic">Part III</span>, thus giving effect to the policy and spirit underlying Part III.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 In the circumstances, as there has been no re-litigation of any kind, we think that an ASI should not have been issued in the present case. The appeal is therefore allowed and the ASI is set aside. It is therefore not necessary for us to elaborate on the possible examples of situations where there has, in fact, been a re-litigation that might justify the grant of an ASI. It suffices for the present to note that we prefer the test that focuses on whether or not the party against whom an ASI is granted had acted in a vexatious or oppressive manner (as opposed to having acted in an unconscionable manner), and we do not accept the appellant’s counsel’s submission that the former test may be subsumed within the latter (see [69] below). We endorse the test laid down in the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">AQN v AQO </span>[2015] 2 SLR 523 (“<span class="font-italic">AQN v AQO</span>”) (which counsel for the respondent had cited to us). Indeed, in addition to the fact that the concept of unconscionability is a specific legal term of art in the sphere of equity, it also manifests itself in different concepts and may itself be too vague and general in specific contexts even within that particular sphere (see, in particular, this court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">BOM v BOK</span><span class="font-italic"> and another appeal </span>[2019] 1 SLR 349 (“<span class="font-italic">BOM v BOK</span>”)). It bears emphasising that given our finding in the present appeal that there has been no re-litigation of any kind to begin with (the reasons for which we will elaborate upon below), there has, <span class="font-italic">ex hypothesi</span>, been no conduct that could be considered vexatious or oppressive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 As already mentioned, the above is a summary as well as overview of our reasons and decision. For completeness, we note that following the hearing before us on 18 January 2022, counsel for the appellant sent a letter to the court on 20 January 2022 (the “20 January 2022 Letter”) to address us on some of the questions raised during the hearing. In the court’s reply to counsel on 21 January 2022, it was noted that counsel had not sought leave to make further submissions to the court, that the 20 January 2022 Letter was a discourtesy to the court, and that the court would not consider the contents of the 20 January 2022 Letter. For the avoidance of doubt, we reiterate here that we did <span class="font-italic">not</span> consider the contents of the 20 January 2022 Letter in reaching our decision. We turn now to elaborate on the reasons set out above, commencing with a summary of the events leading up to the present appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The appellant and respondent met in England in 2008 and moved into the Property, which is solely owned by the respondent, in March 2009. They married in Italy in July 2011 and moved to Singapore in February 2012. The parties are both Singapore permanent residents; the appellant has dual citizenship in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, while the respondent has dual citizenship in the UK and Australia.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 On 26 June 2018, the appellant filed for divorce in England. On 9 July 2018, the respondent filed for divorce in Singapore. The appellant then applied for a stay of the divorce proceedings in Singapore. Her application was dismissed on 28 January 2019, and she proceeded to file a defence in the Singapore divorce proceedings in February 2019. The divorce was eventually granted in Singapore on an uncontested basis. The Interim Judgment of Divorce was granted on 5 March 2019, and the Certificate of Final Judgment of Divorce was granted on 23 December 2019. In the meantime, the parties’ dispute over the ancillary matters had been heard by a District Judge (the “DJ”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 On 8 October 2019, the DJ gave her orders on the ancillary matters (the “AM orders”). This included an order pertaining to the Property, which stated: “There shall be no division of the [Property] which shall belong to the [respondent] solely”. In her Grounds of Decision in <span class="font-italic">VEV v VEW </span>[2020] SGFC 6 (at [63]–[64]), the DJ stated that she agreed with the respondent’s written submissions and had excluded the Property from the pool of matrimonial assets. The appellant did not file an appeal against the AM orders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 On 10 February 2020, the appellant applied to the English courts for leave to apply for financial relief under Part III of the MFPA. Deputy District Judge (“DDJ”) Hodson granted the appellant leave on 21 August 2020. The leave order stated, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Leave to make an application for financial relief – s.15(1)(c)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7. The applicant shall have leave to make an application for financial relief limited to orders against the respondent’s interest in the [Property], pursuant to s. 15(1)(c) and as restricted by s.20.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Section 15(1)(c) of the MFPA confers jurisdiction on the English courts to entertain an application for an order for financial relief if either or both parties to the marriage had, at the date of the application, a beneficial interest in possession in a dwelling-house situated in England or Wales which was at some time during the marriage a matrimonial home of the parties to the marriage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The appellant filed an application under Part III of the MFPA in the English courts on 3 September 2020. The respondent filed FC/SUM 2619/2020 (“SUM 2619”) on 7 September 2020 in Singapore for an ASI against the appellant’s Part III application. On 11 September 2020, the English Central Family Court ordered that the appellant’s application be stayed generally, with permission to either party to restore on seven days’ written notice to the other party (the “Part III Stay Order”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 SUM 2619 was granted by the DJ on 26 October 2020. The appellant’s appeal to the High Court in HCF/RAS 27/2020 (“RAS 27”) was dismissed by the High Court judge (the “Judge”) on 11 March 2021. The appellant was subsequently granted leave to appeal to the Appellate Division of the High Court (the “Appellate Division”) against the Judge’s decision in RAS 27. In granting the appellant leave to appeal in AD/OS 14/2021 (“OS 14”), the Appellate Division observed:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2 There is a question of general importance to be decided for the first time as the Singapore courts have not dealt with the principles to be applied in an application for an anti-suit injunction in the context of foreign English proceedings brought under Part III of the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984 (c 42) (UK) (“MFPA”). This is particularly the case as Singapore has equivalent provisions in Chapter 4A, Part X of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“Chapter 4A”), which was modelled after the MFPA. Although the Singapore court has an interest in preventing collateral attacks on its judgments, the English statutory provisions expressly recognise that the English court is entitled to make financial provisions in relation to a Singapore divorce which is also recognised in the English court, <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span>, where the proceedings involve real property situated in England.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The costs of OS 14 were reserved to the appeal court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 On 24 June 2021, the English Central Family Court varied the Part III Stay Order by staying the appellant’s Part III application until the Appellate Division had determined her appeal. On 15 July 2021, the appellant filed her Notice of Appeal to the Appellate Division. On 14 September 2021, CA 52 was transferred from the Appellate Division to the Court of Appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Subsequently, on 15 October 2021, the appellant filed CA/SUM 80/2021 (“SUM 80”), an application for leave to adduce further evidence in CA 52. The further evidence was the official transcript of the oral judgment (the “Transcript”) delivered by DDJ Hodson in the English Central Family Court on 21 August 2020. We allowed SUM 80 on 17 November 2021, with costs reserved to this court in CA 52.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary of the decisions below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In SUM 2619, the DJ referred to and applied the principles set out in this court’s decision in<span class="font-italic"> Lakshmi Anil Salgaocar v Jhaveri Dars</span><span class="font-italic">an Jitendra </span>[2019] 2 SLR 372 (“<span class="font-italic">Lakshmi</span>”) at [50]. The DJ noted, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that Singapore was the natural forum of the parties’ dispute, and that the appellant was seeking a “second bite at the cherry” by commencing Part III proceedings in the UK. Having not filed an appeal against the AM orders, bringing duplicative proceedings in the UK was clearly vexatious conduct. Further, the appellant would be raising the same arguments and using the same factual matrix for her claim in respect of the Property in the UK, and she should not be permitted to do so as this would involve re-litigation of matters already the subject of judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In RAS 27, the Judge dismissed the appellant’s appeal and upheld the DJ’s grant of the ASI:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Having read the reasons of the DJ, I disagree with the Wife’s position that the DJ was in error. The DJ has considered all the relevant principles under Singapore law and applied them correctly in her decision. From the position taken by the Wife in the Singapore proceedings, her application under Part III of the [MFPA] would result in parties having to relitigate the division of the matrimonial assets in London. This is because the [Property] was excluded from the pool when the matrimonial assets were divided here. Once it is considered under Part III of the [MFPA], whether the share of her matrimonial assets decided by the DJ is adequate will necessarily have to be reviewed in its entirety, even though the Wife says that the English Court will accept the findings of the Singapore Court and deal only with her application based on the value of [the] [Property] alone. The relitigating of the entire division of the matrimonial assets can result in the possibility of the English Court coming to a different finding from the DJ, and I do not think that the Wife should be permitted to do so. Even though Part III of the [MFPA] is available for the Wife to seek reliefs in England after her divorce in Singapore, given the positions she has taken in the Singapore proceedings, I do not think that she should be allowed to avail herself to that jurisdiction <span class="font-italic">in this particular case</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases on appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 We now summarise the key points of the parties’ cases in the present appeal (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, CA 52) as follows.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appellant’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 First, the appellant argues that the Judge had erred in upholding the grant of the ASI on the basis that there will be re-litigation of the entire division of matrimonial assets before the English court. Further, instituting the Part III proceedings is, in itself, not vexatious, oppressive or unconscionable conduct justifying the grant of the ASI – the whole basis of Part III is that it is appropriate for two jurisdictions to be involved.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Second, the Part III regime is designed to weed out unmeritorious cases, and due weight should be given to the decision of the English court in granting leave for Part III to proceed. Singapore’s own Chapter 4A was modelled after the Part III regime, and the Law Reform Committee of the Singapore Academy of Law had recognised that the requirement to seek leave from the English court – which is reproduced in Chapter 4A – was an effective filtering mechanism in Part III.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Finally, the respondent is not entitled to the ASI as he is before this court with “unclean hands”, given his delay in applying for an ASI, and the fact he seeks to rely on this application to circumvent the decision of DDJ Hodson.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The respondent’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The respondent’s arguments are as follows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 First, the Judge did not err in upholding the grant of the ASI on the ground that there would be re-litigation of the entire division of matrimonial assets before the English court. The AM orders expressly include an order that the Property was to belong to the respondent solely and there would be no division thereof. The case the appellant intends to run in England, which includes the Property, will involve re-litigation of substantial matters contested and determined in Singapore. Re-litigation of a concluded matter in Part III proceedings is vexatious conduct justifying the grant of an ASI.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Second, it is important for the Singapore court to protect its own jurisdiction, particularly in the context of Part III proceedings. The appellant appears to be advocating an “ill-founded” view that the Singapore courts ought to defer completely and unquestioningly to the foreign court and the filtering system of the foreign court to decide if a Part III proceeding is an attack on Singapore court orders. However, the grant of leave by the foreign court cannot be determinative of the merits of an application for an ASI, nor does it give rise to an issue estoppel in respect of a subsequent ASI application in the competing forum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Finally, the doctrine of unclean hands does not apply in this case. The respondent filed his ASI application on 7 September 2020, shortly after the appellant was granted leave on 21 August 2020 to pursue Part III proceedings in the UK. The respondent only took part in the UK proceedings under protest and subject to his strict reservations as to jurisdiction. Further, the UK proceedings have not progressed to an advanced stage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Before we turn to the specific issues in the present appeal, it would be useful to set out the background to Part III of the MFPA and Chapter 4A of the Women’s Charter, as well as the general principles concerning the grant of an ASI.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Part III of the MFPA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Part III of the MFPA allows a party to apply for financial relief in England and Wales after an overseas divorce. The UK Supreme Court has explained the background to Part III of the MFPA in <span class="font-italic">Agbaje v Agbaje </span>[2010] UKSC 13 (“<span class="font-italic">Agbaje</span>”) as follows (at [4]–[5]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4. The background to Part III [of the MFPA] was concern at the hardship to wives and children caused by the effect of a combination of the liberality of the rules relating to recognition of foreign divorces and the restrictive approach of some foreign jurisdictions to financial provision. The problem became apparent in a series of cases in the 1970s in which there had been a foreign divorce in proceedings (both judicial and extra-judicial) instituted by the husband in which no financial provision had been made for the wife.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5. In those cases the divorce was entitled to recognition in England, e.g. because of a “real and substantial connection” with the foreign country … As a result the parties were regarded as no longer married, and the court was not able to make an order in her favour for financial relief … As a result of these cases there were calls for legislation to give the English court jurisdiction to grant ancillary relief after a foreign divorce. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The matter was subsequently referred to the Law Commission for England and Wales and the Scottish Law Commission (the “Law Commissions”). The Law Commission for England and Wales published a report in 1982 recommending that the law be reformed to allow financial provision to be ordered after a foreign divorce, not only in cases where <span class="font-italic">no</span> financial provision had been made or could have been made in the country where the divorce was granted, but also where the provision was <span class="font-italic">inadequate</span> (see <span class="font-italic">Family Law: Financial Relief after Foreign Divorce </span>(Law Com No 117, 1982)). The Law Commission for England and Wales also recommended a “filter mechanism” requiring leave of the court to make an application to the English court. As a result of the work of the Law Commissions, Part III of the MFPA was enacted in 1984 (see <span class="font-italic">Agbaje </span>at [7]–[8]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Under s 13 of the MFPA, an applicant must first be granted leave to commence proceedings under Part III of the MFPA (see <span class="font-italic">Agbaje </span>at [9]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">13 Leave of the court required for applications for financial relief.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) No application for an order for financial relief shall be made under this Part of this Act unless the leave of the court has been obtained in accordance with rules of court;

the threshold is “not high, but is higher than ‘serious issue to be tried’ or ‘good arguable case’ found in other contexts” (see <span class="font-italic">Agbaje </span>at [33]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Section 15(1) of the MFPA sets out the jurisdictional requirements for the English court to entertain the Part III application, as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">15  Jurisdiction of the court.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) Subject to subsection (1A) below, the court shall have jurisdiction to entertain an application for an order for financial relief if any of the following jurisdictional requirements are satisfied, that is to say—</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) either of the parties to the marriage was domiciled in England and Wales on the date of the application for leave under section 13 above or was so domiciled on the date on which the divorce, annulment or legal separation obtained in the overseas country took effect in that country;

In 2009, the Law Reform Committee (“LRC”) published a proposal to amend the Women’s Charter to address this issue (see Law Reform Committee, Singapore Academy of Law, <span class="font-italic">Report of the Law Reform Committee on Ancillary Orders after Foreign Divorce or Annulment </span>(July 2009) (the “LRC Report”)). The Women’s Charter (Amendment) Act 2011 (Act 2 of 2011) plugged this particular lacuna in the law by enacting Chapter 4A of the Women’s Charter (see Debbie Ong, <span class="font-italic">International Issues in Family Law in Singapore</span> (Academy Publishing, 2015) at para 6.61). We pause here to note that, as of 31 December 2021, the 2020 Revised Edition of the Women’s Charter has come into effect, but Chapter 4A of the Women’s Charter (2020 Rev Ed) does not materially differ from the older version referred to in this judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Chapter 4A of the Women’s Charter was modelled after Part III of the MFPA (see the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">UFN v UFM and another matter </span>[2019] 2 SLR 650 (“<span class="font-italic">UFN v UFM (CA)</span>”) at [23]). Like Part III, Chapter 4A allows the Singapore court to grant financial relief to an applicant where (i) there was no relief available in the foreign court or (ii) the relief granted by the foreign court was inadequate or not a fair one (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Harjit Kaur d/o Kulwant Singh v Saroop Singh a/l Amar Singh </span>[2015] 4 SLR 1216 (“<span class="font-italic">Harjit Kaur</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [10]). As with applications under Part III of the MFPA, an application under Chapter 4A comprises two stages – an applicant must first obtain the leave of the court, before making a substantive application for financial relief at the second stage (see <span class="font-italic">UFN v UFM</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA) </span>at [17]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 At the initial stage of obtaining leave under s 121D of the Women’s Charter, the applicant must first show that there is a foreign divorce/annulment/judicial separation that is entitled to be recognised as valid in Singapore, and that the Singapore court has jurisdiction over the matter as required by s 121C (see <span class="font-italic">UFN v UFM</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA) </span>at [18], [20]). Next, the applicant must show a “substantial ground” for the making of an application for an order for financial relief. This court has clarified that at this stage the applicant need only show that it is <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>appropriate for a Singapore court to grant relief – the purpose of the leave mechanism is only to sift out plainly unmeritorious cases or those which amount to an abuse of process (see <span class="font-italic">UFN v UFM</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA) </span>at [29], citing <span class="font-italic">Agbaje </span>at [33]). The factors in s 121F (which are the <span class="font-italic">same</span> factors as in s 16(2) of the MFPA) must also be considered by the Singapore court when deciding whether to grant leave under s 121D, though not every factor in s 121F needs to be considered in the way that a court hearing the substantive application might do so (see <span class="font-italic">UFN v UFM</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA) </span>at [31]).

Before making an order for financial relief, the Singapore court has a duty to consider, like the English court must, whether it would be appropriate for a Singapore court to grant the relief sought, taking into account the factors under s 121F. This is different from the determination at the leave stage, where the applicant only needs to show it would be <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>appropriate to do so (see <span class="font-italic">UFN v UFM</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA) </span>at [33]).

This is the ground on which the appellant was granted leave to commence Part III proceedings in the English court (see [13] above). In the LRC Report, the LRC explained (at [62]) that this was “thought to be too tenuous a connection for the Singapore court to assume jurisdiction where the parties have otherwise no other connection with Singapore, even if the resulting orders are only in relation to that property”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Principles concerning the grant of an ASI</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Finally, we turn to the principles concerning the grant of an ASI.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 An ASI is an order of the court compelling the party subject to the order to refrain from instituting or continuing with proceedings abroad<span class="font-italic"> </span>(see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">PT</span><span class="font-italic"> Sandipala Arthaputra v STMicroelectronics Asia Pacific Pte Ltd and others </span>[2015] 5 SLR 873 (“<span class="font-italic">PT</span><span class="font-italic"> Sandipala</span>”) at [71]). The general principles governing the issuance of ASIs are well-established in Singapore. First, the jurisdiction is to be exercised when the “ends of justice” require it; second, where the court decides to grant an injunction restraining proceedings in a foreign court, its order is directed not against the foreign court but against the parties so proceeding or threatening to proceed; third, an injunction will only be issued restraining a party who is amenable to the jurisdiction of the court; fourth, since such an order indirectly affects the foreign court, the jurisdiction is one which must be exercised with caution (see the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Sun Travels</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Tours Pvt Ltd v Hilton International Manage (Maldives) Pvt Ltd </span>[2019] 1 SLR 732 (“<span class="font-italic">Sun Travels</span>”) at [65]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 This court has also identified five factors (as stated in <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi </span>at [50]) that have to be considered when deciding whether to grant an ASI (see the decisions of this court in <span class="font-italic">VKC v VJZ and another </span>[2021] 2 SLR 753 (“<span class="font-italic">VKC</span>”) at [16]–[20]) and <span class="font-italic">Sun Travels </span>at [66]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the defendant is amenable to the jurisdiction of the Singapore court;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether Singapore is the natural forum for resolution of the dispute between the parties;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether the foreign proceedings would be vexatious or oppressive to the plaintiff if allowed to continue;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) whether the ASI would cause any injustice to the defendant by depriving the defendant of legitimate juridical advantages sought in the foreign proceedings; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) whether the institution of foreign proceedings was or would be in breach of any agreement between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Although these factors are to be considered in the round, a breach of an agreement has been regarded as a separate basis on which an ASI may be granted; one that is distinct from vexatious or oppressive conduct (see <span class="font-italic">Sun Travels </span>at [67]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Whether there has been vexatious conduct involves an assessment and evaluation of a number of factors. The list of factors is not closed. The inherent weakness of a claim sought to be pursued in the foreign proceedings when taken together with other factors may be a relevant factor in considering whether the foreign proceedings are vexatious (see <span class="font-italic">VKC </span>at [19]). Factual findings which have supported findings of vexation or oppression include where the foreign proceedings were instituted in bad faith or for no good reason, are bound to fail, will cause extreme inconvenience (see the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">John Reginald Stott Kirkham and others v Trane</span><span class="font-italic"> US Inc and others </span>[2009] 4 SLR(R) 428 (“<span class="font-italic">Kirkham</span>”) at [47]), amount to an unlawful attack on the plaintiff’s legal rights (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Evergreen International</span><span class="font-italic"> SA v Volkswagen Group Singapore Pte Ltd and others </span>[2004] 2 SLR(R) 457 at [46]–[64]), or are duplicative of Singapore proceedings (see <span class="font-italic">PT</span><span class="font-italic"> Sandipala </span>at [112]–[129]). In so far as this last category is concerned, however, there is no presumption that a multiplicity of proceedings is vexatious or oppressive <span class="font-italic">per</span><span class="font-italic"> se</span> – something additional is required to make the duplication vexatious. For example, the greater the positive and voluntary involvement of the injunction respondent in the local proceedings, and the longer the local suit has been allowed to proceed before the commencement of the parallel foreign proceedings, the stronger the case for an injunction (see <span class="font-italic">PT</span><span class="font-italic"> Sandipala </span>at [137] as well as Thomas Raphael QC, <span class="font-italic">The Anti-Suit Injunction</span> (Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2019) (“<span class="font-italic">The Anti-Suit Injunction</span>”) at paras 19.43–19.44).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Related to the question of whether or not the foreign proceedings are vexatious or oppressive would be the injustice that each party might suffer if the injunction were or were not granted. Consideration of a juridical advantage in the foreign forum would include the kind of remedy and its availability to the party bringing proceedings in the foreign jurisdiction based on the application of foreign law to the substance of the parties’ dispute, rather than the law of the competing forum (see <span class="font-italic">VKC </span>at [20]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Finally, we note the observation of the High Court in <span class="font-italic">PT Sandipala</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [71]) that, while an ASI is directed at the opposing party and not the foreign court, its indirect effect on the foreign court may nevertheless be an affront to comity.

In our view, this approach is, with respect, not appropriate in the context of <span class="font-italic">this</span> case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The “typical” case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 We begin by considering the context of a “typical” case where an ASI is sought based on allegations of vexatious or oppressive conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The respondent referred to the decision of the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Munib Masri v Consolidated Contractors International Company SAL</span><span class="font-italic"> and another </span>[2008] EWCA Civ 625 (“<span class="font-italic">Masri</span>”). Masri had obtained judgment in London against two companies, “CCIC” and “CCOG” (at [2], [4]). CCIC and CCOG subsequently brought an action in Yemen for a declaration that they were not liable to Masri, and Masri successfully obtained an ASI against CCIC and CCOG in England (at [5]), which was upheld on appeal by the English Court of Appeal. The English Court of Appeal observed that the fact that a respondent was seeking to re-litigate in a foreign jurisdiction matters which were already <span class="font-italic">res</span><span class="font-italic"> judicata </span>between himself and the applicant by reason of an English judgment could be a sufficient ground for the grant of an ASI (at [82]). CCIC and CCOG were seeking to re-litigate abroad the merits of a case which they had lost in England, and this was a “classic case” of vexation and oppression designed to interfere with the process of the English court in litigation to which they had submitted (at [95]). The ASI was therefore necessary to protect the jurisdiction of the English court, its process and its judgments (at [99]–[100]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 <span class="font-italic">Masri </span>has been cited with approval in the Singapore courts, for example,<span class="font-italic"> </span>by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Beckkett Pte Ltd v Deutsche Bank</span><span class="font-italic"> AG and another </span>[2011] 1 SLR 524 (“<span class="font-italic">Beckkett</span>”) (at [34], [42]), and by the Singapore International Commercial Court (“SICC”) in <span class="font-italic">Baker, Michael</span><span class="font-italic"> A (executor of the estate of Chantal Burnison, deceased) v BCS Business Consulting Services Pte Ltd and others </span>[2022] 3 SLR 103 (at [51]–[54]), where the SICC noted that <span class="font-italic">Masri </span>was a “paradigm example of a case involving consecutive proceedings”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The parties have also referred to the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Aliye Ayten Ahmed </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Mehmet Mustafa </span>[2014] EWCA Civ 277 (“<span class="font-italic">Ahmed</span>”). In this case, following the parties’ divorce proceedings, the English court made final orders apportioning ownership of various properties in England and in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (“TRNC”). The order expressly stated that neither party was entitled to make any further application in relation to their marriage in the jurisdiction of England and Wales or in any other jurisdiction (at [2]). The wife had also previously given the English court an undertaking not to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, take any further steps in earlier proceedings in TRNC or bring further proceedings in North Cyprus in relation to the properties in North Cyprus owned by the parties save with the leave of the English court (at [8]). Following the conclusion of the divorce proceedings in England, the wife issued a petition for divorce and a claim for financial provision in TRNC, where she sought a greater share for herself than was awarded by the English court (at [3]). The husband was granted an ASI to prevent the wife from carrying on or commencing proceedings in any jurisdiction, and the grant of the ASI was upheld by the English Court of Appeal (at [5], [45(a)]). The English Court of Appeal noted that the subject matter of the proceedings did not, in itself, render an attempt at foreign re-litigation “unconscionable”, and <span class="font-italic">Agbaje </span>established that such a follow-on jurisdiction as represented by Part III of the MFPA was internationally acceptable. However, that did not rule out the existence of cases where, on the facts of the case concerned, it was indeed unconscionable to contemplate either party seeking to have the very same issues redetermined before a different court (at [21]). When considering whether the wife’s actions or proposed actions in the court of TRNC were vexatious and oppressive, the English Court of Appeal stated that the judge was entitled to hold that the wife’s actions were <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>of that quality, unless they could be justified – and in the circumstances of the case, no such justification was established (at [22]). The ASI was therefore proportionate and necessary when viewed in the light of the wife’s conduct, having given her one hundred per cent commitment to the English process (at [25]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Finally, we note that the <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi </span>factors have also been applied in the context of family proceedings. For example, in <span class="font-italic">AQN v AQO</span>, the wife commenced divorce proceedings in Singapore in January 2010, and the husband commenced proceedings in New York in May 2010 for an order that the wife be restrained from alleged breaches of the terms of the prenuptial agreement they had made in New York in 1999 (at [3]). In upholding the lower court’s grant of an ASI against the New York proceedings (at [32]), the High Court applied the <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi </span>factors (at [16]); it held that the foreign proceedings commenced by the husband were vexatious and oppressive (at [27]) and that there was no injustice to the husband inflicted by the grant of the ASI (at [28]–[31]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The present case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 However, unlike <span class="font-italic">Masri</span>, <span class="font-italic">Ahmed</span> and <span class="font-italic">AQN v AQO</span>, the present case concerns a situation where (i) the foreign proceedings are initiated under an <span class="font-italic">English statute</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">and </span>(ii) Singapore has enacted its <span class="font-italic">own</span> legislation modelled after Part III, in the form of Chapter 4A of the Women’s Charter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The implications of these two points distinguish this case from the “typical” case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Significance of proceedings under Part III of the MFPA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 First, Part III offers <span class="font-italic">a statutory</span><span class="font-italic"> right</span> of relief that is conferred upon a certain class of litigant. A Part III application is contingent upon there being a <span class="font-italic">foreign decree</span> of divorce, annulment or legal separation in an overseas country that is entitled to be recognised as valid in England and Wales (see s 12(1) of the MFPA), and an applicant may be granted leave to commence Part III proceedings <span class="font-italic">notwithstanding </span>that an order has been made by a court in a country outside England and Wales requiring the other party to the marriage to make any payment or transfer any property to the applicant or a child of the family (see s 13(2) of the MFPA). Part III therefore does not <span class="font-italic">foreclose</span> a grant of leave to an applicant <span class="font-italic">even if</span> a court outside the UK has already dealt with the financial issues in the divorce; it confers jurisdiction on an English court that is <span class="font-italic">additional to </span>the jurisdiction of a foreign court. On the face of it, there is therefore nothing <span class="font-italic">inherently</span> vexatious or oppressive in the conduct of a party who seeks financial relief under Part III after having received an order for financial relief from a court overseas.

The most difficult aspect of the problem is to provide workable rules for ensuring that relief is confined to those cases <span class="font-italic">in which it is appropriate for the English court to intervene</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2.2 …We have given further consideration to the procedural aspects of the matter in an attempt to ensure, not only that the court’s powers are only exercised in appropriate cases, but also that potential respondents are adequately protected. We believe that unless such protection is available, the mere fact of issuing proceedings could confront the respondent with an acute dilemma: he might well be satisfied that he had a strong defence to the application, yet to defend it would necessarily involve him in substantial expense – particularly if (as would often be the case) he was resident abroad. <span class="font-italic">We believe it to be right to provide some measure of protection against the possibility of applications under the proposed legislation being used to exert improper pressure on respondents to settle in order to avoid the expense of contesting an application</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2.3 Effect is given to this proposal … <span class="font-italic">by providing that no application for an order for financial relief shall be made … unless leave of the High Court has first been obtained</span>; and that the court shall not grant leave to make such an application unless it considers that there is substantial ground for the making of the application for financial relief. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In our view, this “filter mechanism” in the MFPA presupposes that the English court will indeed be diligent in sifting out unmeritorious cases, including those cases which are “being used to exert improper pressure on respondents to settle”. Indeed, the Singapore High Court has noted, citing the LRC Report, that the leave requirement has proven in practice “to be useful in sieving out unmeritorious applications” in the UK (see <span class="font-italic">Harjit Kaur </span>at [13]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Significance of Singapore enacting Chapter 4A</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 We now turn to the implications of Singapore having enacted legislation modelled after Part III of the MFPA, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Chapter 4A.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 First, Chapter 4A is part of Singapore’s public policy under the Women’s Charter. This is significant because, in deciding whether considerations of comity should inhibit (or even proscribe) the grant of an ASI, the court must weigh those considerations against the public policy of the Singapore legal system (see <span class="font-italic">Beckkett </span>at [44]–[46]). In this appeal, therefore, this court must consider whether allowing the Part III proceedings to continue would offend the public policy underpinning Chapter 4A.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Second, Singapore’s interpretation of Part III (on which Chapter 4A is modelled) may also affect other foreign courts’ interpretation of Chapter 4A, and their willingness to grant an ASI (or similar relief) against the commencement of Chapter 4A proceedings in Singapore. The present appeal therefore has potential ramifications for how foreign jurisdictions deal with Chapter 4A.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 With these differences in mind, we now consider whether it was appropriate to apply the <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi </span>factors to this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The applicability of the Lakshmi factors</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Amenability to the jurisdiction</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 First, we note that the party against whom the ASI is sought must be amenable to the jurisdiction of the Singapore court. In our view, it is uncontroversial that this is a requirement both in the present case and in the “typical” case. Amenability means that the court has <span class="font-italic">in personam </span>jurisdiction over the party that the injunction seeks to bind, and the court must have <span class="font-italic">in personam </span>jurisdiction over that party since the ASI is addressed to the party who is ordered to exercise self-restraint or suffer the consequences prescribed by law (see <span class="font-italic">PT</span><span class="font-italic"> Sandipala </span>at [75]). In the present case, the appellant rightly did not dispute in the proceedings below (or before us) that she is amenable to the jurisdiction of the Singapore court. The appellant voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts by choosing to bring her claims for financial relief in Singapore, after an uncontested divorce in Singapore (see <span class="font-italic">PT</span><span class="font-italic"> Sandipala </span>at [79]; see also [11] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Natural forum for the resolution of the dispute</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 We now turn to the second <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi </span>factor of whether Singapore is the natural forum for the resolution of the dispute between the parties. The DJ said there was no dispute that Singapore “is clearly the more appropriate forum”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In our view, however, unlike cases such as <span class="font-italic">AQN v AQO</span>, the question of whether Singapore is the “natural forum” is <span class="font-italic">not</span> relevant in this particular context. We agree with the appellant that the whole basis of Part III (and Chapter 4A) is that it may be appropriate for more than one jurisdiction to be involved (see <span class="font-italic">UFN v UFM (CA)</span> at [47] and <span class="font-italic">Agbaje </span>at [49]).

The whole basis of </span><span class="font-italic">Part III is that it may be appropriate for two jurisdictions to be involved, one for the divorce and one for ancillary relief.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">50. <span class="font-italic">Many of the factors in section</span><span class="font-italic"> 16(2) have much in common with those which would be relevant in a forum non conveniens enquiry, but they are not directed to the question of which of two jurisdictions is appropriate.</span> They are directed to the question whether it would be appropriate (which is the meaning of the word <span class="font-italic">conveniens </span>in <span class="font-italic">forum conveniens</span>) for an order to be made by a court in England and Wales when <span class="font-italic">ex hypothesi </span>there have already been proceedings in a foreign country (including proceedings in which financial provision has been made). Little assistance can therefore be obtained from the stay cases (and still less from the anti-suit injunction cases) in the Part III exercise. <span class="font-italic">The task for the judge under </span><span class="font-italic">Part III is to determine whether it would be appropriate for an order to be made in England, taking account in particular of the factors in section 16(2), notwithstanding that the divorce proceedings were in a foreign country which may well have been the more appropriate forum for the divorce.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Similarly, the High Court in <span class="font-italic">UFM v UFN </span>[2018] 3 SLR 450 (“<span class="font-italic">UFM v UFN</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>”) has observed (at [35]–[36]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">35 <span class="font-italic">It is equally clear, on the other hand, </span><span class="font-italic">that the LRC did not intend for the doctrine of natural forum to apply as a free-standing principle in the Chapter 4A exercise</span>. … it is clear from the plain text of s 121F(2) [of the Women’s Charter] that the concerns of natural forum are, if anything, held in the balance with policy considerations specific to the context of granting financial relief consequent on a foreign divorce. <span class="font-italic">Those </span><span class="font-italic">considerations include ensuring finality of litigation, preventing any abuse of process, and correcting for unfairness in any ancillary financial provisions obtained in a foreign jurisdiction.</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">36 It is therefore clear from the text and history of Chapter 4A that its drafters recognised that <span class="font-italic">injustice may arise should only one forum, </span>ie<span class="font-italic">, the forum of divorce, be allowed to address any and all ancillary matters</span>.

The answer in this case would either be England and Wales, since that is the only place where Part III proceedings can be pursued, or Singapore, since that is where the parties divorced.

We highlight here that, as stated at [8] above, we do not agree with the appellant’s counsel’s submission that the test of “vexatious or oppressive” conduct may be subsumed within the test of “unconscionable” conduct. The High Court in <span class="font-italic">AQN v AQO</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [25]–[26] has explained that the former term was coined by Lord Goff of Chieveley in the Privy Council decision of <span class="font-italic">Soci</span><span class="font-italic">été Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale v Lee Kui Jak </span>[1987] AC 871, while the latter term was coined by Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough in the House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">Turner v Grovit</span> [2002] 1 WLR 107, and that the two terms are not synonymous. In this regard, Thomas Raphael has suggested that the test of “vexatious or oppressive” conduct is to be preferred (see <span class="font-italic">The Anti-Suit Injunction</span> at paras 4.57–4.59):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4.57 … The simplest approach would have been to stick with Lord Goff’s concepts of ‘the ends of justice’ and ‘vexation or oppression’ as formulated in <span class="font-italic">A</span><span class="font-italic">érospatiale</span>. This has been the approach taken in the subsequent House of Lords, Supreme Court, and Privy Council cases that have considered the test. … It is therefore arguable that Lord Goff’s tests should be viewed as established as being the law as a matter of precedent.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4.58 It is suggested that the language of ‘the ends of justice’ is also to be preferred as a matter of principle. Using unconscionability as the primary test brings with it the danger of excessive closeness to the historical equitable legacy of the common injunction. It is also arguably a legal fiction. In many cases where anti-suit injunctions are granted, there is no real sense in which the injunction defendant’s <span class="font-italic">conscience </span>is or should be engaged. ‘Unconscionable conduct’ fits particularly poorly as a way to describe situations where the injunction is granted to protect the jurisdiction of the English court, or English public policy. Further, the language of ‘the ends of justice’, or ‘vexation and oppression’ is a more appropriate way to frame those cases where features of the foreign litigation warrant the imposition of an injunction. The greater suitability of Lord Goff’s tests is illustrated by the fact that in a number of cases where the concept of unconscionable conduct has been formally applied, it has merely served as a redundant, higher-level conceptual shell for the application of the underlying test of vexatious or oppressive behaviour.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4.59 In addition, although Lord Hobhouse articulated the notion of ‘unconscionable conduct’ to focus attention on the ‘wrongful conduct of the individual’, it is submitted that this risks oversimplification. Anti-suit injunctions are not merely a matter of private law, but also inescapably involve public interests, because of the tensions with comity that they produce. Locating the concept of the ‘ends of justice’ at the heart of the relevant test compels the court to address not merely the conduct of the injunction defendant, but also the ends of justice as a whole.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">We find this analysis persuasive, and we endorse the test of “vexatious and oppressive” conduct as stated in <span class="font-italic">AQN v AQO</span>. We also reiterate here our observation (see [8] above) that the concept of unconscionability is a specific legal term of art in the sphere of equity, and may itself be too vague and general in specific contexts even within that particular sphere (see the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">BOM v BOK</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 We have noted earlier (at [44] above) that facts supporting a finding of vexation or oppression include the following factors: where the foreign proceedings were instituted in bad faith or for no good reason, are bound to fail, will cause extreme inconvenience, amount to an unlawful attack on the respondent’s legal rights or are duplicative of Singapore proceedings. In <span class="font-italic">AQN v AQO</span>, for example, the High Court found that the New York proceedings were vexatious and oppressive as the wife had not been receiving maintenance from the husband and her financial resources were strained from dealing with numerous applications filed by her husband both locally and in New York, whereas her wealthy husband had the resources to pursue litigation (at [27]). In <span class="font-italic">Masri</span>, the English Court of Appeal found that the judgment debtors were seeking to re-litigate abroad the merits of a case which they had lost in England, and that this was a “classic case of vexation and oppression”, designed to interfere with the process of the English court in litigation to which they had submitted (at [95]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 These same concerns are clearly relevant to Part III proceedings. First, as noted in <span class="font-italic">Agbaje</span>, there is a possibility that a party may pursue Part III proceedings to “oppress or blackmail a former spouse” (see [57] above), by embroiling the former spouse in a protracted dispute in England, causing the former spouse to incur further time and expenses in defending the Part III application, and thereby exert pressure on the former spouse to settle in the foreign court (see [58] above) – similar to the behaviour of the husband in <span class="font-italic">AQN v AQO</span>. Second, there is a possibility that an applicant will rely on Part III to take advantage of a “more generous approach” in English law that they may not have under foreign law (see <span class="font-italic">Agbaje </span>at [72]) and try to “get a second bite of the cherry” (see <span class="font-italic">UFN v UFM</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA) </span>at [48]) – similar to the judgment debtors in <span class="font-italic">Masri </span>who were trying to obtain a more favourable decision in Yemen than they had in England.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 That said, however, it <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">cannot</span> be the case that the commencement of Part III proceedings is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">always</span> vexatious and oppressive, justifying the grant of an ASI. First, this position would render Part III ineffectual, as parties who divorce in Singapore would then <span class="font-italic">never</span> be able to subsequently pursue Part III proceedings. That, in our view, would be an affront to comity, as the Singapore court would essentially be taking the position that Part III applications after a Singapore divorce are always an abuse of process.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Second, this position would sit uncomfortably with the fact that Singapore itself has modelled Chapter 4A after Part III. This would mean that foreign applicants who wish to apply in Singapore under Chapter 4A after a foreign divorce may similarly be prevented by an ASI (or equivalent relief) granted in the foreign country against commencing Chapter 4A proceedings, and hence similarly render Chapter 4A ineffectual. This militates against the whole point of enacting such legislation in the first place (see [36] above) and would, in our view, be contrary to the public policy behind Chapter 4A – which was to plug a lacuna in the law by allowing a Singapore court to order financial relief for an applicant consequent upon a foreign divorce.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Third, this position would also sit uncomfortably with the fact that the leave mechanism in Part III of the MFPA presumes that the UK court will be diligent in sifting out unmeritorious applications. The Singapore courts have acknowledged this function of the leave mechanism and its effectiveness in filtering out unmeritorious cases (see <span class="font-italic">UFN v UFM</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA) </span>at [29], [34]; <span class="font-italic">Harjit Kaur </span>at [13], [17]) – and the same mechanism has been adopted in Chapter 4A. Further, before making an order for financial relief under Part III, the English court has a duty to consider whether England and Wales is the appropriate venue for the application, having regard in particular to the matters in s 16(2) of the MFPA, which includes the connection the parties to the marriage have with England and Wales, and their connection with any country outside England and Wales (see [34] above). Finally, in deciding whether to make orders for financial provision and property adjustment under s 17, the English court is to have regard to factors in s 18 of the MFPA, including “all the circumstances of the case” and the extent to which any foreign order for the making of payments or the transfer of property by a party to the marriage has been complied with or is likely to be complied with (see ss 18(2), 18(6) of the MFPA; see also <span class="font-italic">Agbaje </span>at [44]). As noted by the UK Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Agbaje</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [52]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">52. ... There is nothing internationally objectionable in legislation which gives a court power to order financial provision notwithstanding a foreign decree of divorce, whether or not the foreign court has ordered financial provision, provided that the forum has an <span class="font-italic">appropriate connection</span> with the parties or their property. <span class="font-italic">The whole</span><span class="font-italic"> point of the factors in s 16(2) is to enable the court to weigh the connections of England against the connections with the foreign jurisdiction so as to ensure that there is no improper conflict with the foreign jurisdiction.</span> That is why in <span class="font-italic">Holmes v Holmes </span>[1989] Fam 47, at 53, Purchas LJ was right to note that <span class="font-italic">section</span><span class="font-italic"> 16 reflected the principles of comity as between competent courts.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In the light of the English court’s duty to ensure that there “is no improper conflict with the foreign jurisdiction”, we think that the English court’s considerations of whether to grant leave and order relief under sections 13 and 16(2) of the MFPA respectively <span class="font-italic">would </span><span class="font-italic">inevitably overlap</span> with the inquiry as to whether an ASI should be granted. For example, under s 16(2)(f) of the MFPA, the English court will consider any right which the applicant has, or has had, to apply for financial relief from the other party to the marriage under the law of any country outside England and Wales, and if the applicant has omitted to exercise that right, the reason for that omission. This overlaps with the question as to whether the applicant’s conduct is vexatious or oppressive, depending on the applicant’s reasons for not exercising his or her rights in that foreign country. For example,<span class="font-italic"> </span>if the applicant had chosen not to apply for relief in the foreign court in the hope of obtaining a more favourable award in the English court, this could constitute forum shopping (see<span class="font-italic"> Harjit Kaur </span>at [21]), and could be a factor in favour of granting an ASI.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In our view, therefore, these statutory provisions in the MFPA are useful “safety valves” against a foreign applicant taking advantage of the MFPA to undermine the Singapore court’s orders. Further, Singapore has itself adopted these same provisions in Chapter 4A. If a Singapore court were, <span class="font-italic">by default</span>, to grant an ASI against the commencement of Part III proceedings, this would <span class="font-italic">preclude</span> the English court from engaging in its own analysis, under its own law, of whether it is appropriate for England to grant leave or the relief sought. That would be contrary to the principle of comity as the Singapore court would effectively be taking the position that the UK’s legislation (and, likewise, Singapore’s Chapter 4A) does not provide sufficient safeguards against abuse of process. In our view, therefore, a Singapore court should <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">generally be</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> slow to grant an ASI</span> against the commencement of Part III proceedings in the UK.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 This, however, does not mean that a Singapore court can <span class="font-italic">never </span>grant an ASI against Part III proceedings. We think that these “safety valves” in Part III of the MFPA are useful as <span class="font-italic">supplementary aids</span>, and weight should certainly be placed on the grant of leave by an English court (again, bearing in mind that Singapore has adopted similar legislation in the form of Chapter 4A). However, this should not be <span class="font-italic">conclusive</span> of whether an ASI should be granted against Part III proceedings, as the Singapore court must retain the ability to intervene to safeguard its own public policy, and the integrity of its court proceedings, where necessary. In our view, there would certainly be some cases where the commencement of Part III proceedings would result in unwarranted interference with Singapore’s judgments and court process (as noted in <span class="font-italic">Ahmed </span>at [21], while a follow-on jurisdiction under Part III of the MFPA is “internationally acceptable”, that does not rule out the existence of cases where, “on the facts of the case, it is indeed unconscionable to contemplate either party seeking to have the very same issues re-determined before a different court”). One example might be where the Singapore court has reserved judgment on the ancillary matters, and, while the court is deliberating, one party then applies for leave in England to commence Part III proceedings. This is similar to the conduct of the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Beckkett</span>, which had commenced an action in Indonesia just after its appeal had been heard by this court but before this court had delivered judgment (at [35], [42], [46]). There is a strong argument, in our view, that such conduct would be sufficient basis for granting an ASI. However, what exactly constitutes an unwarranted interference with Singapore’s public policy ought to be dealt with after full consideration of all the facts in each case, taking into account factors like whether the English court has granted or denied leave, the stage of the divorce proceedings in Singapore, and the nature of the parties’ claims in the Part III proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 For completeness, we observe that the fourth <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi </span>factor – whether the ASI would cause any injustice by depriving the applicant of legitimate juridical advantages sought in the Part III proceedings – overlaps with the third factor. For example, a party who is found to be pursuing Part III proceedings in order to oppress or blackmail a former spouse would plainly not be deprived of any legitimate juridical advantage were an ASI to be granted. We also note that the fifth <span class="font-italic">Lakshmi </span>factor (whether the institution of foreign proceedings was or would be in breach of any agreement between the parties) is a <span class="font-italic">separate</span> ground from vexatious or oppressive conduct, as the basis for granting an ASI in such a case is <span class="font-italic">contractual</span> (see <span class="font-italic">VKC</span> at [16]). However, as the parties in this case have not made any such agreement in respect of the Part III proceedings, we say no more on this point. We reiterate that the <span class="font-italic">present</span> case really turns on whether the appellant’s conduct was <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">vexatious or oppressive</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 We now turn to the next question – whether an ASI should have been granted in this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Should an ASI have been granted in this case?</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether there will be re-litigation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The DJ reasoned that the appellant would be raising the same arguments and using the same factual matrix for her claim to the Property in the UK, and she “should not be permitted to relitigate this issue as the division of [the Property] was fully considered and concluded with orders made pertaining to its status”. On appeal, the Judge agreed with the DJ. He reasoned that once the Property was considered under Part III, the adequacy of the appellant’s share of the matrimonial assets, as decided by the DJ, would necessarily have to be reviewed in its entirety. This re-litigation could result in the possibility of the English court coming to a different finding from the DJ.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In one sense, the DJ and the Judge were correct that there would be “re-litigation” of the division of the Property in the UK. There would, literally, be another set of proceedings commenced in respect of the Property – such as how another set of proceedings was commenced in TRNC in <span class="font-italic">Ahmed</span> and in New York in <span class="font-italic">AQN v AQO</span> in respect of the parties’ divorce, and another action was commenced in Yemen in <span class="font-italic">Masri</span> in respect of the judgment debtors’ liability to Masri.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 However, while there may <span class="font-italic">literally </span>be “re-litigation” of the division of the Property, it does not automatically follow that an ASI should issue. As we have said earlier (at [69] above), the heart of the analysis is not whether there is, literally, “re-litigation”, but whether the Part III proceedings <span class="font-italic">amou</span><span class="font-italic">nt to vexatious or oppressive conduct</span> in the circumstances of the case. Even in the “typical” cases, there is no presumption that a multiplicity of proceedings, in and of itself, is vexatious and oppressive (see <span class="font-italic">PT</span><span class="font-italic"> Sandipala </span>at [112]). For example, in <span class="font-italic">Masri</span>, the attempted re-litigation by the judgment debtors was vexatious and oppressive because the matters in question were already <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>between them and the applicant by reason of an English judgment (at [82]). In <span class="font-italic">PT</span><span class="font-italic"> Sandipala</span>, the plaintiff’s conduct in commencing an action in Singapore against the defendants and subsequently commencing an action against them in Jakarta after failing to bring forward the trial dates in Singapore (at [29]) was held to be vexatious and oppressive (at [110]), as, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the claim in Jakarta was founded on the same wrongful acts that were the subject of the action in Singapore (at [121]), and there was a lack of a good explanation for the duplicative proceedings (at [142]) (For completeness, we note here that the High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">PT</span><span class="font-italic"> Sandipala </span>was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in Civil Appeal No 182 of 2015).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In our view, however, the present case is different since the Property is the subject of <span class="font-italic">Part III</span><span class="font-italic"> proceedings</span>. Unlike the situation in <span class="font-italic">PT</span><span class="font-italic"> Sandipala</span> (at [142]), there <span class="font-italic">is </span>a “good explanation” for the duplicative proceedings in the present case because there is <span class="font-italic">an English statute </span>which gives the appellant a right to commence proceedings in the UK in respect of the Property (see [56] above). In these circumstances, the <span class="font-italic">mere fact</span> that the appellant is commencing Part III proceedings in respect of the Property, and her reliance on the same arguments or the same factual matrix present in the Singapore proceedings for her claim in the UK, is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not</span> a sufficient justification for the grant of an ASI.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 What then of the possibility that the English court may come to <span class="font-italic">a different decision</span> from the Singapore court in respect of the division of the Property? The respondent’s counsel argues that the appellant’s conduct is vexatious and oppressive because the AM orders expressly include an order that the Property was to belong to the respondent solely and that there would be no division thereof – the appellant’s application for a share in the Property under Part III “clearly runs a serious risk of conflicting judgments”. In this case, the DJ had found that the Property was not a matrimonial asset and excluded it from the pool of matrimonial assets for division (at [12] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 As we stated earlier (at [6]), this is not an unattractive argument. The UK Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Agbaje </span>(at [54]) said that Part III “allows the [English] court to <span class="font-italic">supplement</span> the order of a foreign court” [emphasis added]. However, the line between <span class="font-italic">supplementing</span> and <span class="font-italic">supplanting </span>an order of a foreign court seems a rather fine one. For example, if a Singapore court had ordered that the wife should receive 5% of a matrimonial asset (“A”) while the husband received 95% of A, and the wife subsequently commenced Part III proceedings in the UK seeking a 15% share of A, it is not clear whether a UK court order granting the wife a 15% share of A would thereby <span class="font-italic">supplant </span>the Singapore order of 5% with the UK order of 15%, or <span class="font-italic">supplement </span>the Singapore order of 5% with an additional 10%. Much will obviously depend on the precise facts and circumstances concerned. We note here, for completeness, that the possibility of such a scenario arising under Chapter 4A, and the issue of how to balance the competing public policies underpinning Chapter 4A and the interests of finality in the division of matrimonial assets in the foreign jurisdiction, was not canvassed during the relevant Parliamentary debates – the then Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, only referred to the scenario where a foreign court “for some reason makes <span class="font-italic">no </span>financial provision” [emphasis added], but did not explain whether this meant no<span class="font-italic"> </span>financial provision <span class="font-italic">at all </span>or no financial provision <span class="font-italic">in respect of specific assets</span>, or what was the appropriate procedure in the event that the foreign court had made <span class="font-italic">some</span> financial provision (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore </span><span class="font-italic">Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(10 January 2011), vol 87 at cols 2048–2049). This issue may well have to be addressed by Parliament should such cases arise for decision in the future. We pause here to observe that, in our view, it may be possible to lower the incidence of such disputes in future similar cases involving Part III proceedings (or proceedings under similar foreign legislation) through active case management, for example,<span class="font-italic"> </span>by inviting parties to confirm from the start of their divorce proceedings in Singapore all possible jurisdictions in which they intend to litigate the ancillary matters pertaining to the divorce, so that the Singapore court (and the parties themselves) can consider whether certain assets should be left to be divided by the courts of that particular jurisdiction after the parties have been divorced in Singapore (or indeed, whether it would be more prudent to commence divorce proceedings in that foreign jurisdiction instead).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 We should, at this juncture, also highlight another issue that may arise in the context of Part III proceedings: there could arguably be an impact on Singapore’s public policy in ensuring the finality of its judgments, depending on the conditions that are attached to the grant of financial relief under Part III. In <span class="font-italic">Agbaje</span>, the wife received a lump sum equal to 65% of the gross sale proceeds of the Lytton Road property in the UK, <span class="font-italic">upon the condition that she agreed to relinquish her life interest in the Lagos property</span> (see <span class="font-italic">Agbaje </span>at [35]). <span class="font-italic">Agbaje </span>was cited in the Singapore case of <span class="font-italic">UFM v UFN</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>, where the parties divorced in Indonesia and the wife was granted sole custody of their children and an order for child maintenance. The wife did not first seek a division of matrimonial property in Indonesia, and instead applied under Chapter 4A seeking a division of a property in Singapore (the “Seaview Property”) which the parties jointly owned (see <span class="font-italic">UFM v UFN</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC) </span>at [1]). The wife was granted leave by the High Court, and the decision was upheld by this court on appeal in <span class="font-italic">UFN v UFM</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA)</span>. Before the High Court, the husband argued that the wife’s application for leave should not be granted because, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, by asking a Singapore court to deal with the Seaview Property in isolation, the wife was “cherry-picking or forum shopping for the best outcome in Singapore” (see <span class="font-italic">UFM v UFN</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC) </span>at [81]). The High Court noted that it had the power to grant financial relief only in respect of the Seaview Property, but expressed some concerns (at [84]–[85]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">84 While the court has such power, <span class="font-italic">there could be reason, nonetheless, to be cautious about dividing matrimonial assets in a piecemeal fashion, as the law pertaining to such division would be different in Singapore and Indonesia.</span> The district judge was quite rightly concerned that there were other properties in Indonesia.<span class="font-italic"> If the wife obtains a division of the Seaview Property separately from the remaining pool of matrimonial assets, she may in some way prejudice the success of a subsequent </span><span class="font-italic">application to the Indonesian courts for relief out of the parties’ Indonesian assets.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">85 In response to this concern, counsel for the wife says that the wife seeks to divide the Seaview Property in resolution of all the parties’ claims on their matrimonial assets both here and in Indonesia. Among these assets, the Seaview Property, the wife says, is the most valuable. She refers to <span class="font-italic">Agbaje </span>… where the judge ordered the husband in that case to pay his former wife a lump sum equal to 65% of the gross proceeds of the sale of their house in London, which was valued at £425,000, upon the wife’s undertaking to relinquish her interest in a house in Nigeria (where she was divorced), which was valued at £86,000. <span class="font-italic">In the present case, the wife has indicated her willingness to undertake to relinquish her claim to the matrimonial assets in Indonesia. In my view, this is a matter which the court charged with deciding the full merits of the division should consider, in the light of information subsequently adduced as to the entirety of the parties’ assets.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 In <span class="font-italic">Agbaje</span>, the wife commenced Part III proceedings <span class="font-italic">after</span> ancillary orders had been made in Nigeria in respect of the division of the matrimonial assets. In <span class="font-italic">UFM v UFN</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>, the wife commenced Chapter 4A proceedings without seeking any ancillary orders in Indonesia in respect of the division of the matrimonial assets. In both cases, however, the applicants’ willingness to relinquish their rights in respect of matrimonial assets in Nigeria and Indonesia respectively was either a <span class="font-italic">condition of </span>or a <span class="font-italic">relevant factor to</span> the court granting financial relief under Part III and Chapter 4A. Rather than merely supplementing the orders of a foreign court (see <span class="font-italic">Agbaje </span>at [54]), it seems that the English and Singapore courts were, <span class="font-italic">in substance</span>, either supplanting the foreign orders (in <span class="font-italic">Agbaje</span>) or <span class="font-italic">foreclosing</span> the possibility of such foreign orders (in <span class="font-italic">UFM v UFN</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span>). In the present case, it could be argued that there would be an impact on Singapore’s public policy <span class="font-italic">if</span>, as a condition of being granted financial relief under Part III in respect of the Property, the appellant is similarly required by the English court to relinquish her claim to the matrimonial assets in Singapore (like the wife in <span class="font-italic">Agbaje</span>), as this would, <span class="font-italic">in effect</span>, amount to setting aside the DJ’s AM orders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 We have in the foregoing paragraphs (see [84]–[87] above) sketched out some of the possible complexities that can arise in this context. This is compounded in situations where a decision made by the Singapore court to distribute the matrimonial assets in a particular way stands to be fundamentally affected or undermined by an English court making an order for financial relief under Part III (or by another court under legislation similar to Part III). We will have to weigh the considerations in the light of the observations we have set out here and with the benefit of further and fuller arguments in future cases. In our view, however, neither of the concerns we have raised at [84]–[87] above arises in the present case to justify granting an ASI.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 First, we do not think there will be any supplanting of the Singapore orders or a risk of “conflicting judgments” in the present case. In this case, the DJ found that the Property was <span class="font-italic">not</span> part of the pool of matrimonial assets. Thus, the Property could not<span class="font-italic"> </span>have been divided between the appellant and respondent pursuant to the divorce proceedings in Singapore – once the DJ found that it was not a matrimonial asset, <span class="font-italic">the </span><span class="font-italic">question of division did not even arise. </span>As DDJ Hodson described it in his reasons for granting leave:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">28. The consequence is [the Property] is an excluded asset. How, therefore, should the family Court treat it? This has been the heart of it. Mr [A] says, in contrast, on behalf of former wife “The Court has not dealt with it”. It was not brought into account in any way; therefore this English family court is free to deal with it. … This is looking at simply saying, did the Singapore court include this asset within its balance sheet?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">29. If I deal with that as a simple question, the answer is no, it did not. Mr [B] is absolutely right; it did decide to say, “Will we bring it into account or not?” However, then it decided it would not, under the local law, and therefore it was completely kept out. It appeared nowhere on the balance sheet and it is an excluded asset.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 We therefore think that the Part III proceedings initiated by the appellant <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">cannot</span> constitute a “re-litigation” of the division of the Property, since the question of division was never<span class="font-italic"> </span>before the Singapore court. That makes it less likely that there will be any conflict with Singapore’s public policy in relation to the division of matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 We add that we view this case as being similar to other cases concerning Part III where certain assets were simply <span class="font-italic">not </span>divided between the parties in other jurisdictions. For example, in <span class="font-italic">Agbaje </span>itself, the UK Supreme Court restored the order of the English High Court granting financial relief to a wife who had applied under Part III following a divorce in Nigeria. The parties’ assets comprised two houses in London in the husband’s sole name (which were the bulk of the assets), one being the “Lytton Road property”, and other properties in Nigeria (at [2], [15], [35]). The Nigerian court awarded the wife a life interest in a property in Lagos with a capital value of about £86,000 (the “Lagos property”) and a lump sum of about £21,000 for maintenance, but it dismissed the wife’s claims in respect of the properties in London (at [2], [20], [22]). The wife was subsequently granted leave to apply under Part III of the MFPA (at [24]), and the English High Court ordered that the wife should receive a lump sum equal to 65% of the gross sale proceeds of the Lytton Road property, on the condition that the wife agreed to relinquish her life interest in the Lagos property (at [35]). In our view, the appellant in the present case is in a similar position to the wife in <span class="font-italic">Agbaje</span> – the latter’s claim in respect of the Lytton Road property, which was in the husband’s sole name, was unsuccessful in Nigeria but allowed in the UK. Likewise, in the present case, the appellant’s claim in respect of the Property, which is in the respondent’s sole name, has been unsuccessful in Singapore – however, she should not be barred from pursuing financial relief in the UK in respect of the Property under Part III because of that.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Further, as we have stated earlier (at [6]), had the appellant <span class="font-italic">accepted</span> before the Singapore court that the Property did not form part of the pool of matrimonial assets, she would not have been precluded from initiating a claim pursuant to Part III in respect of the Property as the Property would not have been the subject of the matrimonial proceedings in the Singapore court. We do not see why the outcome should be different just because the appellant was <span class="font-italic">unsuccessful</span> in her claim in respect of the Property before the Singapore courts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Second, with respect to the possibility of the English court imposing certain conditions on the grant of financial relief, we do not think that this is a sufficient basis to justify the grant of an ASI in this case. In our view, it would be mere speculation to assume that the appellant would be required to relinquish her rights over the matrimonial assets in Singapore as a condition of being granted financial relief under Part III. There was no indication of such a condition being imposed when the appellant was granted leave to commence Part III proceedings, nor was there any intimation of this in DDJ Hodson’s judgment. Nonetheless, while the issue does not arise in the present appeal, we observe that such a question could <span class="font-italic">possibly</span> arise for determination in future cases, depending on the facts and circumstances of those cases.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The above analysis, in our view, suffices to dispose of the appeal before us. We set aside the ASI on the basis that there has been no re-litigation of any kind, nor has there been any vexatious or oppressive conduct on the appellant’s part.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 For completeness, however, we will briefly address the other points raised by the DJ and by the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Not filing an appeal in the Singapore court</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The DJ reasoned that not filing an appeal against the AM orders and bringing duplicative proceedings in the UK was clearly vexatious conduct on the appellant’s part. According to the DJ, the “correct thing” for the appellant was to appeal against the AM orders, “not re-litigate the issue in a different forum”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In our view, however, commencing Part III proceedings without first appealing against the AM orders does not <span class="font-italic">automatically</span> lead to the conclusion that the appellant’s conduct is vexatious and oppressive. There is no requirement for a foreign applicant to exhaust remedies in the foreign court before applying under Chapter 4A – rather, in deciding whether it is the appropriate venue to grant the relief sought, the Singapore court will, under s 121F(2)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the Women’s Charter, have regard to any right which the applicant has or has had to apply for financial relief in the foreign country, and if the applicant has omitted to exercise that right, the reason for that omission (see <span class="font-italic">UFN v UFM</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA) </span>at [49]). For example, if the applicant has chosen not to apply for relief in the foreign court in the hope of obtaining a more favourable award in the Singapore court, this could constitute forum shopping (see <span class="font-italic">Harjit Kaur </span>at [21]), and weigh against the Singapore court making an order under Chapter 4A.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Section 121F(2)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the Women’s Charter is <span class="font-italic">in pari materia </span>with s 16(2)(f) of the MFPA. The English court, in deciding whether it is the appropriate venue to grant relief, would thus similarly consider the applicant’s reasons for not pursuing an appeal against the AM orders and whether this is any indication of “forum shopping” or an attempt to “obtain some further advantage” by applying under Part III (see <span class="font-italic">Harjit Kaur </span>at [21]). In fact, in this case, we note that the respondent had made the argument that the appellant had failed to appeal against the AM orders in Singapore in his skeleton argument opposing the grant of leave under Part III. In any event, if the Singapore court’s position is that there is no requirement for a foreign party to exhaust foreign remedies before applying in Singapore under Chapter 4A, the Singapore court should similarly not require a party to exhaust remedies in Singapore before applying in the UK under Part III of the MFPA and <span class="font-italic">preclude</span> the applicant from seeking such relief by granting an ASI.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 This should not be taken to mean that pursuing Part III proceedings instead of filing an appeal in Singapore can <span class="font-italic">never </span>amount to vexatious or oppressive conduct justifying the grant of an ASI. In this case, however, given that the appellant was in fact granted leave under Part III, and given that her Part III application in the UK was confined to an asset which was <span class="font-italic">not subject to</span><span class="font-italic"> any division</span> before the Singapore court, we do not think it was vexatious or oppressive for the appellant to have commenced Part III proceedings rather than filing an appeal against this part of the DJ’s decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Other examples of the appellant’s alleged vexatious or oppressive conduct</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Finally, we address the respondent’s other arguments concerning the appellant’s alleged vexatious and oppressive conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 First, the respondent’s counsel submits that there would be “time, effort and expense” incurred in the English proceedings. While that is true, this does not <span class="font-italic">in itself</span> show that the appellant’s conduct is vexatious or oppressive, or that the appellant is using the Part III proceedings to exert improper pressure on the respondent (see [58] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Second, the respondent’s counsel submits that the appellant had made misleading statements in her Witness Statement in Support of her Application for Leave to Apply for Financial Relief dated 10 February 2020 (“Witness Statement”) and in her submissions for the hearing for the grant of leave under Part III –<span class="font-italic"> </span>the appellant had said that because the Property was not classified as a matrimonial asset, it was “left out of all account under Singapore law” and “excluded from any consideration”. The appellant had also allegedly misrepresented the AM orders by saying that the DJ ordered there was to be no division of the “matrimonial home”, when the Singapore court had not even characterised the Property as a matrimonial asset. Finally, the respondent’s counsel argues that the appellant’s description of the AM orders in her Witness Statement as leaving her with “an award of S$120,000 … as full and final settlement of [her] share of the matrimonial assets which amounts to 8.7% of the total assets available for division” is a “grave misrepresentation” of the DJ’s AM orders. The lump sum payment of $120,000 was only one part of the package of orders made, which included spousal and child maintenance and a housing allowance of $535,800; further, the appellant was in fact awarded 25% of the pool of matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In our view, if it is found that an applicant under Part III of the MFPA has made misrepresentations in the Part III proceedings, this could be a factor weighing in favour of granting an ASI, to the extent that these misrepresentations indicate that the Part III application was made in bad faith and/or suggest that the true purpose of the Part III proceedings was to harass the other party (see <span class="font-italic">PT</span><span class="font-italic"> Sandipala </span>at [130]). However, we do not think the appellant’s statements in the Part III proceedings in respect of the Property are indicative of any bad faith on the appellant’s part.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 First, we do not think the appellant had misrepresented the AM orders by saying there was to be no division of the “matrimonial home”. In her Witness Statement, the appellant explained that the Property was where she and the husband began pre-marriage co-habitation in March 2009, and she defined the Property as “the matrimonial home”. It was in this context that the appellant later referred to the DJ’s order that the “matrimonial home”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Property, would not be subject to division and would belong to the respondent solely. Second, the appellant also explained that the 6.5 months she had lived in the Property after<span class="font-italic"> </span>the parties’ marriage appeared to have been too short to persuade the Singapore court to classify it as a matrimonial asset, and that “the property was categorized as non-matrimonial and therefore excluded from the capital division”. We do not see anything misleading about this – the DJ had indeed excluded the Property from the pool of matrimonial assets and held that it was not amenable for division. Our view also applies to the appellant’s submissions for the hearing for the grant of leave under Part III, where the appellant explained that “no part of [the Property’s] value falls into the category of ‘matrimonial asset’ for the purpose of Singapore law”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 As for the appellant’s comment in her Witness Statement about being awarded a $120,000 lump sum, which amounted to “8.7% of the total assets available for division”, we note that the DJ had awarded the appellant <span class="font-italic">25% of the joint net assets</span> of $462,010.02, although the appellant was correct that she was awarded a $120,000 lump sum by the DJ. According to the respondent, the percentage of 8.7% “erroneously takes into account in its denominator numerous assets already classified as non-matrimonial and therefore not available for division, including [the Property]”, resulting in the “wildly exaggerated figure of 8.7% being presented to the English court”. However, we do not think that this is indicative of <span class="font-italic">bad faith</span> on the appellant’s part justifying the grant of an ASI. First, the appellant’s counsel in the UK explained in her skeleton argument for the hearing before DDJ Hodson concerning the grant of leave that the parties <span class="font-italic">disagreed</span> as to whether they should assess the outcome provided by the Singapore court “in terms of the asset base overall (both matrimonial and non-matrimonial) or simply by reference to those assets which the Singapore court considered matrimonial and therefore amenable to orders”. The proper interpretation of the AM orders was therefore a point in dispute between the parties. Second, the appellant did not actually say that she had gotten an 8.7% share of the <span class="font-italic">pool of </span><span class="font-italic">matrimonial assets as determined by the DJ</span> – rather, she said that her award of $120,000 amounted to 8.7% <span class="font-italic">of the total assets available for division</span>, which, in context, reads as a reference to <span class="font-italic">all</span> of the parties’ assets placed before the Singapore court for consideration. We further note, in any event, that this reference to the 8.7% figure did not appear to have an impact on the grant of leave – DDJ Hodson had referred <span class="font-italic">directly</span> to the DJ’s decision and specifically observed that the DJ had awarded the appellant a 25% share of the matrimonial assets. Finally, we also note that the appellant had in fact included the DJ’s orders as to spousal maintenance, child maintenance and the rental payments of $4,500 per month by the respondent till 7 March 2022 in her Witness Statement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 To sum up, we do not think the respondent’s other allegations concerning the appellant’s vexatious and oppressive conduct are made out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Has the respondent come before this court with unclean hands?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Finally, for completeness, we note the appellant’s argument that the doctrine of unclean hands applies in the present case, such that the respondent should not be entitled to the ASI. However, since we are setting aside the ASI in any event, we do not think it is necessary to address this argument.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 In conclusion, we allow the appeal in CA 52 and set aside the ASI.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 We award the costs of CA 52 and OS 14 to the appellant. As we have found the Transcript to be helpful in our consideration of CA 52, we also award the costs of SUM 80 to the appellant. The appellant submits that she is entitled to costs of $46,924.60, inclusive of GST and disbursements, consisting of $10,000 for costs and $1,403.60 for disbursements for SUM 80, and $32,000 for costs and $3,521.07 for disbursements for CA 52. The respondent submits that he is entitled to costs of $3,000 plus disbursements of $300.40 for SUM 80, and costs of $36,000 plus disbursements of $1,637.40 for CA 52. In our view, costs of $10,000 for SUM 80, with disbursements of $1,403.60, is a reasonable figure. As for CA 52, while it did involve a novel point of law, it was on a narrow issue, and we think $30,000 (all-in) will suffice. Finally, in respect of OS 14, we fix costs at $8,000 (all-in). The usual consequential orders will apply.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Sundaresh Menon<br/>Chief Justice</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Andrew Phang Boon Leong<br/>Justice of the Court of Appeal</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Judith Prakash<br/>Justice of the Court of Appeal</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Linda Joelle Ong and Chee Ying Li Cherilynn (Engelin Teh Practice LLC) for the appellant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Abraham Vergis SC and Bestlyn Loo (Providence Law Asia LLC) (instructed); Yap Teong Liang and Tan Hui Qing (T L Yap Law Chambers LLC) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and set aside the ASI.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background to the appeal</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2 The appellant wife (the “appellant”) and respondent husband (the “respondent”) met in England in 2008 and moved into a property in the UK (the “Property”), which was solely owned by the respondent, in March 2009. They married in Italy in July 2011 and moved to Singapore in February 2012. The parties divorced in Singapore in 2019: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">10]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[11]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The material facts</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 On 8 October 2019, the District Judge (the “DJ”) gave her orders on the ancillary matters (the “AM orders”). The DJ excluded the Property from the pool of matrimonial assets and ordered that the Property was to belong to the respondent solely. The appellant did not file an appeal against the AM orders: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[12]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 The appellant subsequently applied for and was granted leave to apply for financial relief under Part III of the MFPA, limited to orders against the respondent’s interest in the Property pursuant to s 15(1)(c) of the MFPA. The appellant then filed an application under Part III of the MFPA on 3 September 2020. On 7 September 2020, the respondent filed FC/SUM 2619/2020 (“SUM 2619”) in Singapore for an ASI against the appellant’s Part III application: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[13]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[14]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 SUM 2619 was granted by the DJ on 26 October 2020, and the appellant’s appeal to the High Court was dismissed by the Judge. The appellant was subsequently granted leave to appeal to the Appellate Division of the High Court (the “Appellate Division”) against the Judge’s decision, following which the appeal was transferred from the Appellate Division to the Court of Appeal: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[15]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[16]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision on appeal</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 The present case was different from a “typical” case where an ASI was sought based on allegations of vexatious or oppressive conduct, as it concerned a situation where (i) the foreign proceedings were initiated under an English statute and (ii) Singapore had enacted its own legislation modelled after Part III, in the form of Chapter 4A of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (the “Women’s Charter”): at <span class="font-weight-bold">[49]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[54]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 First, Part III offered a statutory right of relief that was conferred upon a certain class of litigant. On the face of it, there was nothing inherently vexatious or oppressive in the conduct of a party who sought financial relief under Part III after having received an order for financial relief from a court overseas. Further, the “filter mechanism” in the MFPA presupposed that the English court would indeed be diligent in sifting out unmeritorious cases: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[56]</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold">[59]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 Second, as Chapter 4A was part of Singapore’s public policy under the Women’s Charter, the court had to consider whether allowing the Part III proceedings to continue would offend the public policy underpinning Chapter 4A. The present appeal also had potential ramifications for how foreign jurisdictions dealt with Chapter 4A: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">60] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[62]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 It was uncontroversial that the party against whom the ASI was sought must be amenable to the jurisdiction of the Singapore court, both in the present case and in the “typical” case: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[64]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 However, the question of whether Singapore was the “natural forum” for the resolution of the dispute between the parties was not relevant in this particular context. The whole basis of Part III (and Chapter 4A) was that it may be appropriate for more than one jurisdiction to be involved: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[66]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[68]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 The heart of the analysis in the present context really rested on whether the Part III proceedings would be vexatious or oppressive to the respondent if allowed to continue. In this regard, the court preferred the test of “vexatious and oppressive” conduct to the test of “unconscionable” conduct: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[69]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 It could not be the case that the commencement of Part III proceedings was always vexatious and oppressive, justifying the grant of an ASI. This position would render Part III ineffectual and would be an affront to comity. It would also sit uncomfortably with the fact that Singapore itself had modelled Chapter 4A after Part III, and with the fact that the leave mechanism in Part III of the MFPA presumed that the UK court would be diligent in sifting out unmeritorious applications. The statutory provisions in the MFPA (where the English court would consider whether to grant leave and order relief) were useful “safety valves” against a foreign applicant taking advantage of the MFPA to undermine the Singapore court’s orders. Further, Singapore had itself adopted those same provisions in Chapter 4A. A Singapore court should therefore generally be slow to grant an ASI against the commencement of Part III proceedings in the UK: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[72] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">76]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">13 That, however, did not mean that a Singapore court could never grant an ASI against Part III proceedings. While the “safety valves” in Part III of the MFPA were useful as supplementary aids, and weight should certainly be placed on the grant of leave by an English court, that should not be conclusive of whether an ASI should be granted against Part III proceedings, as the Singapore court must retain the ability to intervene to safeguard its own public policy, and the integrity of its court proceedings, where necessary. However, what exactly constituted an unwarranted interference with Singapore’s public policy ought to be dealt with after full consideration of all the facts in each case, taking into account factors like whether the English court had granted or denied leave, the stage of the divorce proceedings in Singapore, and the nature of the parties’ claims in the Part III proceedings: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[77]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">14 In the present case, the mere fact that the appellant was commencing Part III proceedings in respect of the Property, and her reliance on the same arguments or the same factual matrix present in the Singapore proceedings for her claim in the UK, was not a sufficient justification for the grant of an ASI: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[83]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">15 As for the possibility that the English court might come to a different decision from the Singapore court in respect of the division of the Property, this was not an unattractive argument. The issue might well have to be addressed by Parliament should such cases arise for decision in the future. However, it might be possible to lower the incidence of such disputes in future similar cases involving Part III proceedings (or proceedings under similar foreign legislation) through active case management, for example, by inviting parties to confirm from the start of their divorce proceedings in Singapore all possible jurisdictions in which they intended to litigate the ancillary matters pertaining to the divorce, so that the Singapore court (and the parties themselves) could consider whether certain assets should be left to be divided by the courts of that particular jurisdiction after the parties had been divorced in Singapore (or indeed, whether it would be more prudent to commence divorce proceedings in that foreign jurisdiction instead): at <span class="font-weight-bold">[84] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[85]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">16 In the context of Part III proceedings, there could arguably be an impact on Singapore’s public policy in ensuring the finality of its judgments, depending on the conditions that were attached to the grant of financial relief under Part III. In previous cases, it seemed that the English and Singapore courts had, in substance, either supplanted the foreign orders or foreclosed the possibility of such foreign orders. It could be argued that there would be an impact on Singapore’s public policy in the present case if, as a condition of being granted financial relief under Part III in respect of the Property, the appellant was similarly required by the English court to relinquish her claim to the matrimonial assets in Singapore, as this would, in effect, amount to setting aside the DJ’s AM orders: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[86]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[87]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">17 However, neither of those concerns applied in the present case to justify granting an ASI. First, the DJ found that the Property was not part of the pool of matrimonial assets. Thus, the Property could not have been divided between the appellant and respondent pursuant to the divorce proceedings in Singapore, and the Part III proceedings initiated by the appellant could not constitute a re-litigation of the division of the Property, which made it less likely that there would be any conflict with Singapore’s public policy in relation to the division of matrimonial assets. Further, had the appellant accepted before the Singapore court that the Property did not form part of the pool of matrimonial assets, she would not have been precluded from initiating a claim pursuant to Part III in respect of the Property as the Property would not have been the subject of the matrimonial proceedings in the Singapore court. The outcome should not be different just because the appellant was unsuccessful in her claim in respect of the Property before the Singapore courts: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">89] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">92]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">18 Second, it would be mere speculation to assume that the appellant would be required to relinquish her rights over the matrimonial assets in Singapore as a condition of being granted financial relief under Part III. There was no indication of such a condition being imposed when the appellant was granted leave to commence Part III proceedings. Nonetheless, such a question could possibly arise for determination in future cases, depending on the facts and circumstances of those cases: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[93]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">19 The court therefore set aside the ASI on the basis that there had been no re-litigation of any kind, nor had there been any vexatious or oppressive conduct on the appellant’s part: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[94]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">20 For completeness, commencing Part III proceedings without first appealing against the AM orders did not automatically lead to the conclusion that the appellant’s conduct was vexatious and oppressive. If the Singapore court’s position was that there was no requirement for a foreign party to exhaust foreign remedies before applying in Singapore under Chapter 4A, the Singapore court should similarly not require a party to exhaust remedies in Singapore before applying in the UK under Part III of the MFPA and preclude the applicant from seeking such relief by granting an ASI. In this case, given that the appellant was in fact granted leave under Part III, and given that her Part III application in the UK was confined to an asset which was not subject to any division before the Singapore court, it was not vexatious or oppressive for the appellant to have commenced Part III proceedings rather than filing an appeal against that part of the DJ’s decision: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[97]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[99]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">21 Just because there would be time, effort and expense incurred in the English proceedings did not in itself show that the appellant’s conduct was vexatious or oppressive: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[101]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">22 If it was found that an applicant under Part III of the MFPA had made misrepresentations in the Part III proceedings, that could be a factor weighing in favour of granting an ASI, to the extent that those misrepresentations indicated that the Part III application was made in bad faith and/or suggested that the true purpose of the Part III proceedings was to harass the other party. However, the appellant’s statements in the Part III proceedings in respect of the Property were not indicative of any bad faith on the appellant’s part. The appellant had not misrepresented the AM orders: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[103]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">105]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">23 The appellant had argued that the doctrine of unclean hands applied in the present case, such that the respondent should not be entitled to the ASI. However, the court did not think it was necessary to address this argument as the court was setting aside the ASI in any event: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[107]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s judgment.
