<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff in these divorce proceedings was
                    the husband. He and the defendant wife were married in Singapore on 3 February
                    1994. They subsequently had two daughters who were born, respectively, in
                    December 1994 and February 1996. In January 2009, the husband confronted
                    the wife with evidence of her association with another man. The wife admitted
                    improper behaviour and the marriage subsequently broke down.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The parties subsequently entered a deed of
                    settlement which was dated 16 February 2009 (“the Deed”). The
                    recitals of the Deed recorded the husband’s intention to commence
                    proceedings against the wife for divorce because of her improper association
                    with another man and also the wife’s admission of such association. In the
                    body of the Deed, the parties agreed that the husband would have sole custody of
                    both daughters with reasonable access to the wife and that the wife would,
                    within three months after the grant of final judgment in the divorce action,
                    transfer all her right, title and interest in and to the matrimonial home to the
                    husband without the need for him to refund to her the contributions made from
                    her Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) account for the purchase of the
                    home. The husband was to bear the costs incurred in relation to the transfer and
                    upon the transfer, he would have to be responsible for the outstanding loan and
                    other moneys due to the Housing Development Board. The wife further agreed to
                    provide for herself and waive all her rights to claim maintenance from the
                    husband. There was a specific provision that upon the hearing of the divorce
                    proceedings, the parties would consent to ancillary orders which reflected the
                    terms of the Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The husband started these proceedings on 17
                    February 2009. The wife did not contest the proceedings and, on 5 May 2009,
                    interim judgment was entered dissolving the marriage. The wife did not attend
                    the subsequent hearing of the ancillary matters. The husband sought a resolution
                    of the ancillary matters in accordance with the terms agreed on in the Deed.
                    Reflecting this, on 7 October 2009 the following orders were made in relation to
                    the ancillary matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    ... [T]he Plaintiff
                            [shall] have sole custody and control of the two (2) children of the

                            Defendant;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    ... [T]he
                            Defendant shall, within three (3) months from the grant of the Final

                            Board where required, transfer all her share and interest in the
                            matrimonial flat at and known as [address redacted] (“the
                            matrimonial flat”) together with all furniture, fixtures and
                            fittings and decorations therein to the Plaintiff with no CPF refund to
                            be made to the Defendant’s CPF account(s) and the Plaintiff shall
                            henceforth bear:-</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    the outstanding Housing and Development
                                Board’s loan;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    all moneys, if any, due to the Housing &amp;

                                administrative fees relating to the said transfer;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    This Order be made subject to the Central
                            Provident Fund Act, Chapter 36 (“the CPF Act”) and the
                            subsidiary legislation made thereunder and the CPF Board shall give
                            effect to the terms of this Order in accordance with the provisions of
                            the CPF Act and the subsidiary legislation made
                        thereunder;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)    [T]hat the Registrar or Deputy Registrar of the
                            Subordinate Courts under Section 45 of the Subordinate Courts Act,
                            Chapter 321, be empowered to execute sign or indorse all documents
                            necessary to effect the transfer of the matrimonial flat on behalf of
                            the Defendant should the Defendant fail to do so within seven (7) days
                            of a written request being made to her;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5)    ... [T]he parties, including CPF Board, be at
                            liberty to apply for further direction(s) generally; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(6)    ... [T]here be no order on costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thereafter matters proceeded in the normal way, and the
                    Certificate of Making Interim Judgment Final was issued on 10 November
                    2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 8 March 2010 the wife filed an
                    application to set aside the Interim Judgment, the Order of Court of
                    7 October 2009 (“the Ancillary Order”) and the Final
                    Judgment. This application was heard on 10 June 2010 by a District Judge
                    (“the DJ”) and it was granted to the extent that the Ancillary
                    Order was set aside. The court refused to set aside the Interim Judgment and the
                    Final Judgment.The wife was satisfied with the outcome of the hearing but the
                    husband appealed against the setting aside of the Ancillary Order. I allowed his
                    appeal on 7 October 2010 and restored the Ancillary Order. The wife now
                    seeks to have my decision reversed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Grounds and the Decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In the first affidavit filed in support of the
                    application, the wife stated that the grounds of her application were that the
                    husband had misled her as to the nature and effect of the proceedings and she
                    did not have independent legal advice throughout the proceedings. She emphasised
                    that the Ancillary Order did not give her anything at all on the ending of a 15
                    year marriage. She further stated that she had been asked to sign the Deed
                    without obtaining legal advice. She did not know the nature and effect of the
                    divorce proceedings until she received a letter dated 31 December 2009 from
                    the CPF Board and learnt that she had to transfer the matrimonial flat to the
                    husband without receiving a refund of her CPF contributions. She also averred
                    that her highest educational qualification was only the ‘O’ level
                    and that she did not speak English very well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In relation to the allegation that the husband
                    had misled her, the wife explained the background that the husband had been in
                    the travel business as a shareholder and director of a company known as [B] Pte
                    Ltd (“[B]”). [B] had experienced financial difficulties as a
                    result of which the husband had been made a bankrupt in 2003. He was discharged
                    from bankruptcy in August 2007. The wife had gone through difficult times with
                    the husband and during his bankruptcy the husband had incorporated and run a
                    company called [C] Pte Ltd (“[C]”) using her as the majority
                        <em>shareholder and director. Thus he had managed to continue
                        with his business despite his bankruptcy. Explaining her assertion that the
                        husband had misled her, the wife said in her first
                    affidavit</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17.    This is how the Plaintiff misled me:- he told me
                            that [C] Pte Ltd was in financial difficulties and asked me to just
                            listen to him so as to avoid re-living the difficult times when [B] Pte
                            Ltd was in the same trouble.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18.    The Plaintiff asked me to resign as a Director of
                            [C] Pte Ltd on 12th January 2009. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19.    Contrary to what the Plaintiff’s [<em>sic</em>] claim, [C] Pte Ltd was in fact doing well
                            and has business interests in Vietnam and Thailand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20.    I do not know what had happened to my shareholding
                            in [C] Pte Ltd ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21.    I was similarly asked to sign the
                        [Deed].</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Those few paragraphs were all that the wife said on the most
                    important allegation of her case and paragraph 21 was the only paragraph in the
                    affidavit which dealt with the signing of the Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The husband filed an affidavit refuting the
                    wife’s allegations. I will not detail it at this stage. He also adduced an
                    affidavit from one Mr Chua Keng Loy, an advocate and solicitor, who had
                    witnessed the wife’s execution of the Deed. Mr Chua attested that
                    before the wife executed the Deed he had asked her whether she had read,
                    understood and was agreeable to its contents. She replied in the affirmative.
                    Mr Chua also stated that he was purely a witness and that he had not
                    rendered any legal advice to the wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In her grounds of decision , the DJ accepted
                    that all the orders challenged had been regularly obtained but noted that the
                    court had the power to rescind an order even if there had been procedural
                    regularity in service if circumstances existed which justified the rescission of
                    the order. She stated that the test was whether there was a real prospect of
                    success for the party seeking to set aside the order. The DJ considered that the
                    husband had capitalised on the wife’s sense of guilt when she was
                    confronted with her infidelity and that the wife had a real prospect of success
                    in obtaining a share in the matrimonial assets and/or maintenance since she had
                    been married for 15 years and there were two children from the marriage whom she
                    had cared for. The Ancillary Order which had given her nothing at all had,
                    therefore, to be set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The first question which I had to consider was
                    as to the proper approach to the original setting aside application. The DJ had
                    cited the case of <em>Chng Yock Eng v Kwa Teck Meng</em>
                    [2004] SGDC 268 (“<em>Chng Yock</em>
                    Eng”), a decision of District Judge Lim Hui Min (“DJ Lim”),
                    as authority for the proposition that a court could set aside an order on
                    ancillary matters notwithstanding that it had been properly obtained if the
                    applicant could show that she had a real prospect of success in the case if the
                    order was set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In <em>Chng Yock Eng</em>
                    the respondent husband had applied to set aside a substituted service order, the
                    Decree Nisi, the Decree Absolute and the ancillary matters order which the
                    petitioner wife had obtained in divorce proceedings against him. The proceedings
                    had been conducted and completed in the absence of the husband and, according to
                    his evidence, he had only learnt about them about five months after the
                    ancillary matters order had been made. The court first considered whether the
                    orders could be set aside on the grounds of procedural irregularity <em>ie</em> on the basis that proper service had not been
                    effected. Having held that in all the circumstances the substituted service
                    order was good because the wife had no means of contacting the husband, and
                    therefore the orders could not be set aside on the basis of bad service of the
                    petition, the judge went on to consider the possibility of setting aside on the
                    merits. The case was clearly one that involved the setting aside of a default
                    judgment since the husband had had no knowledge of the proceedings and had not
                    participated in them in any way.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     DJ Lim noted that in <em>Low
                        Choon Kung v Tham Chan Kum</em> (<em>m.w.)</em>
                    [2004] SGDC 139 it was held that a Decree Nisi obtained by the husband
                    there against the wife there was essentially a judgment in default of appearance
                    and, following the test laid down in the case of <em>Alpine Bukit
                        Transport Co Inc v Saudi Eagle Shipping Co Inc (The Saudi Eagle)</em>
                    [1986] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 221 (“the Saudi Eagle test”),
                    if the wife was able to show that she had a defence which had a real prospect of
                    success and carried some degree of conviction, the wife would be able to have
                    the Decree Nisi set aside even if service of the divorce petition had been good.
                    DJ Lim, however, declined to follow the Saudi Eagle test in relation to the
                    setting aside of a Decree Nisi because she considered, correctly in my
                    respectful view, that this test was inapplicable to the setting aside of
                    judgments which have the effect of ending marriages. This was because
                    s 99(2) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed)
                    specifically deals with the latter situation. The section states that a Decree
                    Nisi may be rescinded if it is shown that material facts have not been brought
                    before the court. The implication is that the only way to obtain such a
                    rescission is to prove that the decree was issued because material facts which
                    should have been disclosed were not. That is a stricter test than the Saudi
                    Eagle test and is warranted when the consequence of the judgment sought to be
                    set aside is to change the status of a married person. In relation to orders for
                    ancillary matters, however, DJ Lim opined that the Saudi Eagle test would be
                    appropriate because such an order would only affect a person’s money or
                    property or other ancillary rights and would not affect his status. DJ Lim went
                    on to apply the material facts test to the situation in <em>Chng
                        Yock Eng</em> and then set aside both Decree Nisi and the Decree
                    Absolute on the basis that the wife in that case had not disclosed to the court
                    material facts which were incompatible with the ground on which she had
                    petitioned for divorce. The divorce should not, therefore, have been
                    granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The law in <em>Chng Yock
                        Eng</em> on the setting aside of judgments which end a marriage has
                    not been questioned in later judgments. However, subsequent to <em>Chng Yock Eng</em>, the Court of Appeal in <em>Mercurine Pte Ltd v Canberra Development Pte Ltd</em> [2008]
                    4 SLR(R) 907 has clarified that in assessing whether a regular default
                    judgment should be set aside, the appropriate test is that which was laid down
                    in <em>Evans v Bartlam</em> [1937] AC 473,
                        <em>ie</em>, whether the defendant could establish a
                        <em>prima facie</em> defence in the sense of showing
                    that there were triable or arguable issues, and not the Saudi Eagle test. This
                    is a less stringent test than the Saudi Eagle test but, as the Court of Appeal
                    itself observed (at [61] of that judgment), its revival of the <em>Evans v Bartlam</em> test did not necessarily affect those
                    cases where the defendant’s conduct called for the court to be less than
                    ready to exercise its setting aside jurisdiction. For the reasons given below,
                    even if it was appropriate to consider the circumstances here as akin to a
                    default judgement situation, I would have held that the wife’s conduct
                    over the period of about a year precluded the court from readily exercising its
                    setting aside jurisdiction in her favour. This was not a case of a one-off
                    failure to take an action like enter an appearance or file a defence. Instead
                    the wife repeatedly failed to avail herself of opportunities to take part in
                    various stages of the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     I was, however, of the view that this case
                    could not be looked at in the same light as a standard application to set aside
                    a default judgment. This was because I considered the case to be more akin to a
                    consent judgment case rather than a default judgment case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In a case where ancillary orders have been
                    made by consent, the correct approach to a subsequent application by one of the
                    parties to set aside the order is that set out by Choo Han Teck J in the case of
                        <em>Lee Min Jai v Chua Cheow Koon</em> [2005]
                    1 SLR(R) 548 (“<em>Lee Min
                    Jai</em>”). There, the petitioner wife had appealed against the
                    district judge’s dismissal of her application to rescind part of a consent
                    order in the Decree Nisi and to substitute a fresh order in its place. The
                    relevant part of the consent order stated that the wife would transfer her share
                    in the matrimonial flat to the husband upon payment of $50,000 by the husband.
                    The wife argued on appeal that when she agreed to this term she did not know she
                    was a joint owner of the flat though she knew she had a share in the flat. Had
                    she known she was possibly entitled to at least half the value of the flat she
                    would not have agreed to accept only $50,000 for her share. Her appeal was
                    dismissed. In the course of his judgment, Choo Han Teck J stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5    Under s 112(4)
                            of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed), the court
                            “may, at any time it thinks fit, extend, vary, revoke or
                            discharge any order made under this section, and may vary any term or
                            condition upon or subject to which any such order has been made”.
                            But this section, and the authorities referred by Mr Chia, should
                            not be construed as an invitation to revise the terms of a settlement
                            merely so that they appear more equitable or will be, in fact, more
                            equitable in the objective opinion of the court. Privately settled terms
                            in respect of the ancillary matters in a divorce may not always appear
                            to be fair. But divorce is a very personal matter, and each party would
                            have his own private reasons for demanding, or acquiescing to, any given
                            term or condition in the ultimate settlement. What the court should be
                            alert to, is that one party had not taken an unfair advantage over the
                            other in the course of negotiating and settling the terms. Hence, in
                                <em>Dean v Dean</em> [1978] 3 All
                            ER 758, the court held (as set out in the headnote)
                        that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[W]here an agreement between the parties had been reached at
                            arm’s length and the parties had been separately advised, the
                            agreement itself would be <em>prima facie</em>
                            evidence of the reasonableness of its terms, and formal discovery would
                            probably be unnecessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6    In the present case, the matrimonial flat was a gift
                            by the respondent’s grandmother to him as well as the petitioner.
                            The petitioner was aware that she had a share in that flat and told her
                            previous solicitor so. The terms of settlement were clearly reached at
                            arm’s length, and there was no question of the respondent
                            concealing any material fact from the petitioner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The reason that I thought that the Ancillary
                    Order here had to be considered in the same light as a consent order is that it
                    tracked the provisions of paras 5, 6.1, 6.2 and 7 of the Deed in relation to
                    custody, matrimonial property and maintenance. What the court had ordered in the
                    wife’s absence was only what she had agreed to in the Deed. As long as the
                    wife had freely consented to the Deed, the Ancillary Order, which reflected the
                    provisions of the Deed, should in my view be regarded as having essentially been
                    made by consent. The wife’s failure to participate in the divorce
                    proceedings was an indication of her consent and took the Ancillary Order out of
                    the category of orders obtained by default. After a detailed consideration of
                    the circumstances I considered that on the evidence the wife had, on the balance
                    of probabilities, freely agreed to the Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In his first affidavit, the husband gave an
                    account of how the Deed had come to be signed. He stated that he had confronted
                    the wife with her improper association on 15 January 2009 and had told her
                    that he could not bring himself to forgive her and would be divorcing her. He
                    then spoke to her on matters concerning the custody of the children, the
                    transfer of the flat and her maintenance. At that stage, the wife appeared to
                    accept the husband’s terms. He then consulted solicitors and on
                    23 January 2009, the solicitors sent him a draft of the Deed. That same
                    evening, the husband handed a copy of the draft to the wife and told her that if
                    she was agreeable to its contents, she would have to attend at this
                    solicitors’ office to sign the Deed but that if she was not agreeable or
                    wished to amend any part of it, she should get her own lawyer to communicate
                    with his lawyers. On 12 February 2009, the husband was informed by his
                    lawyers that the wife had signed the Deed in their office that day. The husband
                    in turn executed the Deed on 16 February 2009 and the duplicate copy of the
                    executed Deed was sent to the wife on 25 February 2009. The husband stated
                    in his affidavit that he had never at any time misled, tricked, coerced,
                    oppressed or induced the wife into agreeing to the terms of the Deed or into
                    executing it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The husband’s affidavit was filed on
                    1 April 2010. The wife filed a reply on 12 May 2010. She disputed the
                    husband’s assertion that she was a polytechnic graduate but she did not
                    dispute the husband’s account of what had transpired on 15 January
                    2009, 23 January 2009 or 12 February 2009. All she said in relation to
                    that account and his other assertions in relation to the conduct of the divorce
                    was contained in paras 8 and 9 of her second affidavit which read as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.    While the Plaintiff’s detailed account of
                            what transpired in this divorce proceedings may be true, I would like to
                            highlight to the Court that I already deposed to in paragraphs 17 to 21
                            of my first Affidavit on how the Plaintiff had misled me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    I totally ignored the proceedings as the Plaintiff
                            had asked to me listen to him and I did just that. It was clear to me
                            that I only had to sign the [Deed] and do nothing else.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Her admission that the husband’s detailed account of what
                    transpired in the divorce proceedings was true was significant. There was no
                    denial of the time lapse of eight days or so between the confrontation and time
                    the draft deed was given to her nor any denial that the husband had told her if
                    she did not agree to its contents she should get her lawyer to talk to his
                    lawyer. Further, the affidavit did not deny that she had had the draft Deed for
                    at least two weeks before she attended at the husband’s solicitor’s
                    office to sign the engrossment. During those two weeks the wife had more than
                    enough opportunity to seek independent advice. There was no evidence at all to
                    substantiate any holding that the husband had in any way prevented or dissuaded
                    the wife from getting independent legal advice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     It was also significant that the wife spent
                    more time in her second affidavit retracting certain insinuations she had made
                    about Mr Chua Keng Loy. In her first affidavit, she had stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My execution of the [Deed] was witnessed by a solicitor, Mr Chua Keng
                        Loy as shown on page 4 of the [Deed]. I did not know who he was until my
                        Solicitors, M/s Christopher Yap &amp; Co. made some queries. Mr Chua
                        Keng Loy was and is at all material times practices [<em>sic</em>] in the same firm as the Plaintiff’s
                        Solicitors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Mr Chua in his affidavit responded by stating that he was a consultant
                    in M/s Chua Hay &amp; Partners at the time when the wife executed the Deed and
                    that he had not joined the firm of solicitors acting for the husband until 1
                    September 2009, some seven months later. Prior to the wife’s execution of
                    the Deed, he had expressly informed her that he was merely witnessing her
                    signing and was not rendering any legal advice. He had also asked her whether
                    she had read, understood and was agreeable to the terms of the Deed. She replied
                    in the affirmative. Mr Chua also stated that he and the wife had conversed
                    in the English language. Mr Chua noted that in January 2010, the
                    husband’s solicitors had informed the wife’s solicitors that when
                    the wife executed the Deed, Mr Chua was not a member of their firm. Despite
                    knowledge of that information, the wife had made a mischievous allegation in her
                    affidavit that he had at all material times, practised in the same firm as the
                    plaintiff’s solicitors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The wife in her second affidavit regretted
                    that sentence and asked the court to expunge it. She said that she was only
                    trying to highlight that her execution of the Deed having been witnessed by
                    Mr Chua could have given the false impression that Mr Chua was her
                    independent solicitor when in fact he was not. She also went on to say that it
                    could not be said that she had intended to show that Mr Chua has somehow
                    misled her when she had clearly stated in her first affidavit that Mr Chua
                    had written to confirm that he had rendered no legal advice to
                her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     It appeared to me that in her first affidavit,
                    the wife had tried to give a misleading impression of Mr Chua’s role
                    even though she had reproduced his confirmation that he had not given her any
                    legal advice. The wife’s affidavit contained insinuations which she had to
                    withdraw after Mr Chua went on oath to set the record
                straight.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The question was why the wife had made a point
                    of asserting in her first affidavit that Mr Chua was a member of the
                    husband’s firm of solicitors when she had failed to give an account of
                    exactly how she came to sign the Deed. This omission on her part in the first
                    affidavit was significant. It gained further significance when she did not make
                    use of the opportunity granted by her second affidavit to refute the
                    husband’s account of what had happened between 15 January 2009 and 12
                    February 2009. Whilst the wife made a rather vague assertion that the husband
                    had asked her to listen to him to avoid reliving the difficult times when [B]
                    was in financial trouble, that assertion seemed to relate to his request on
                    12 January 2009 (before the confrontation) that she resign as a director of
                    [C]. She did not explain how that request was related to the signing of the Deed
                    which took place a month later and after she had admitted her improper
                    association. It appeared to me that in casting aspersions, however indirect,
                    against Mr Chua, the wife was trying to build up her case for rescission of
                    the Ancillary Order as she must have realised that the allegation of having been
                    misled was not properly supported. It appeared to me that the DJ did not give
                    much credence to this allegation either as she preferred to rely on an
                    impression of the wife having been influenced by a feeling of guilt, something
                    the wife herself had never expressed in any of her affidavits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The wife’s admission that the
                    husband’s account of the divorce proceedings was true was also significant
                    because the husband’s account showed that the wife had been kept fully
                    informed of everything that occurred. In his affidavit, the husband gave the
                    following account of what had happened in the divorce proceedings:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the Writ for Divorce, Statement of Claim,

                            were all personally served on the wife at the matrimonial flat on 25

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It is clear from the above account that the
                    wife had many opportunities over a period of nearly ten months from 25 February
                    2009, when she was served with the divorce proceedings up to 7 October 2009 when
                    the ancillary matters were heard, to attend court and inform the court either
                    that she had been coerced or misled into signing the Deed or that she had simply
                    changed her mind about agreeing to its terms because on reconsideration they
                    were not fair to her. The wife did nothing of the sort. Her explanation for her
                    inaction was that she had simply obeyed the husband when he told her to do as he
                    said. This was an incredible explanation given that the wife was by her own
                    admission quite capable of acting on her own behalf to secure her own happiness.
                    The more probable explanation of her failure to take any action to obtain a
                    better settlement in the divorce proceedings was that she had freely agreed to
                    the terms of the Deed for her own reasons and had not changed her mind after the
                    divorce proceedings had started. In failing to attend any of the hearings and
                    letting matters proceed unchallenged she was simply giving concrete effect to
                    her agreement to the terms of the Deed. The wife would have been fully aware
                    from the various documents served on her that the husband was following the
                    terms of the Deed in relation to the ancillary matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     What <em>Lee Min Jai</em>
                    established was that where parties to a divorce have come to a private
                    settlement of the ancillary matters, the court cannot revise the terms of the
                    settlement simply because in the court’s view such revision would lead to
                    a more equitable result. The court has to respect the fact that the parties
                    would have had their own private reasons for agreeing to the settlement. It is
                    only where one party had taken an unfair advantage over the other in the course
                    of negotiating or settling the terms or where there had been some other
                    inequitable circumstance that the court should interfere.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The husband had stated in his affidavit that
                    he needed the wife to transfer the matrimonial flat to him without any refund so
                    that he could use it as a home for the children of whom he wished to have
                    custody. He had told her this and had also advised her as she was a polytechnic
                    graduate, in good health and had another man to support her, she could easily
                    provide for herself without maintenance from him since he would have to provide
                    for the children and service the outstanding housing loan. Whilst the wife
                    disputed the assertion that she had graduated from a polytechnic, she did not
                    dispute that the husband had told her his reasons for wanting the flat to be
                    transferred without refund and for not providing maintenance. The wife did not
                    assert that the husband had withheld any material facts from her. The wife knew
                    what her own educational status was and what her share in the matrimonial flat
                    was. It is worth noting at this stage that the wife had contributed slightly
                    less than $4,000 to the purchase of the matrimonial flat whilst the
                    husband’s contribution was in the region of $194,000 and there was an
                    outstanding loan of about $198,000. In terms of money alone therefore, the
                    wife’s contribution had not been significant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In all the circumstances it appeared to me
                    that the husband had not taken any unfair advantage over the wife in the course
                    of settling the terms of the Deed. Her only allegation was that he had told her
                    of financial troubles with [C] and asked her to resign as a director. Since her
                    resignation was dated 12 January 2009, it was not, apparently, connected
                    with the divorce and the confrontation that took place on 15 January 2009.
                    The wife said nothing directly about this confrontation. Her only reference to
                    it (implicit not direct) was her assertion that the husband’s allegations
                    regarding the breakdown of the marriage were not true and that he did not sleep
                    apart from her from 15 January 2009 onwards. She gave no details as to how
                    and when the draft Deed was given to her and did not dispute the husband’s
                    account of the same. All in all, her narrative of what happened was devoid of
                    detail and insufficient to support an allegation let alone a finding that the
                    husband had behaved unfairly or coercively or deceptively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In the final analysis, I was satisfied that
                    the wife had freely agreed to the terms of the Deed and, thus, to the terms of
                    the Ancillary Order. I found no evidence that she had been deceived or coerced
                    into entering the Deed. Despite having notice of the court proceedings, during a
                    substantial span of time she did nothing to indicate that she had had second
                    thoughts about the wisdom or fairness of the provisions of the Deed or that she
                    considered that she had been somehow duped into signing it. It was not until
                    March 2010 that her weak allegations of being misled were made. The husband had
                    engaged lawyers and had incurred expense during the course of the legal
                    proceedings which included five APTCs and at least two hearings. Only after the
                    whole process was completed did the wife attempt to participate and re-write the
                    terms of the settlement. In my view, this attempt was not justified and had to
                    be rejected.</p>
