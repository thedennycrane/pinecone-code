</b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1. At about 11.50pm on 25<sup>th</sup> March 1999, Koh Mew Chin

(‘the Deceased’) an unemployed Malaysian, was found and pronounced dead in a

rented room at apartment Blk 145 Pasir Ris Street 11 #05-75 (‘the said

apartment’).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2. On 26<sup>th</sup> March 1999 at about 4.25am, the Accused, also an

unemployed Malaysian, was arrested and subsequently charged for murdering the deceased

between 4.00pm and 11.00pm on 25<sup>th</sup> March 1999 in the said apartment.  At

the conclusion of the Prosecution case the time of the offence was amended to

‘between 3.00pm and 11.00pm’ on the application of the Prosecution and without

objection by the Defence.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns=""><u><b>
<p align="justify">Prosecution Case</p></b></u>
<p align="justify">Discovery of Deceased Body</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3. The relevant evidence adduced by the Prosecution in support of the

charge was that the Accused who had befriended the Deceased sometime in September/October

1998, invited the Deceased to come and reside with him in a room at the said apartment

which he was already sharing with another Malaysian worker, Lim Sew Foung, PW11,

(‘Seow Feng’). Seow Feng had rented the said room from its owner one Tan Puay

Chin (‘Ah Chin’) at a monthly rental of $150/-. Later a fourth Malaysian Goh Lee

Lee, PW17, (‘Lily’) also moved into the said room. Ah Chin also rented other

rooms in his flat to a few other Malaysian workers namely, Quah Chin Aun (‘Ah

Aun’), Lai Chee Choong (‘Ah Choong’) and Tan Yeap Shion (‘Ah

Seng’).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4. The Prosecution adduced evidence from Ah Aun that when he returned

to the flat on the 25<sup>th</sup> of March 1999 at about <b>11pm</b>, he noticed droplets

of blood on the floor outside the Accused’s bedroom and extending to the kitchen

sink. Ah Aun informed Ah Chin the owner of the flat about the droplets of blood. Ah Chin

then entered the Accused’s room and discovered the Deceased lying on a mattress. The

Accused lay next to her. The Deceased was "motionless".. He saw blood on the

Accused’s body and upon query by Ah Chin as to what had happened, the Accused

informed him that nothing had happened. He immediately called for an ambulance. He further

requested the Accused to wake the Deceased up. The Accused used his hands to wake the

Deceased but there was no response from her. An ambulance followed by the police arrived

soon afterwards.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<u xmlns=""><i><b>
<p align="justify">Medical Evidence</p></b></i>
<p align="justify">Ambulance Officer</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5. The ambulance officer Norbayah Bte Md Yasin on arrival pronounced

the Deceased as dead. She noted lacerations on each wrist of the Accused. The bleeding

from the lacerations had dried up. She found the Accused fully conscious in accordance

with the Glasgow-Coma Scale which she noted in <i>Exh. P94</i>. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Medical Officer, Changi Hospital</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6. The Accused was taken to the Changi General Hospital. Dr Gan Yu Unn,

Medical Officer, Accident and Emergency Department, Changi General Hospital, clinically

examined the Accused at 12.35am, confirmed the evidence of the ambulance officer that the

Accused was fully conscious. Dr Gan testified that the Accused had told him that the wrist

injuries he had were self-inflicted as he was feeling sad. However, the Accused did not

appear sad to him. He found the Accused somewhat reluctant to speak to him. Dr Gan’s

evidence was that the laceration to each wrist measured approximately 5cm in length. Both

lacerations were superficial and involved only skin and subcutaneous tissues but not the

deep arteries, veins or nerves. Both hands had full range of movement, full sensory

function and no evidence of tendon damage. Dr Gan’s further testimony was that the

bleeding of the lacerations would have stopped within an hour. It would have stopped

within half an hour if pressure had been applied on the wound soon thereafter. The

lacerations he said were consistent with having been caused by a knife such as Exh. P146

which the Prosecution had recovered from a drawer in the cupboard of the Accused’s

room where the Deceased and Accused were found.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Pathologist</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7. It was the evidence of Prof Chao Tzee Cheng, PW21 (‘Prof

Chao’), Senior Pathologist from the Department of Science and Forensic Medicine,

Ministry of Health that he tentatively examined the Deceased’s body in the area where

she was found at about 3.30am on 26<sup>th</sup> March 1999. Rigor Mortis was setting in.

He estimated death to have occurred between 8 to 10 hours before his arrival i.e.

effectively between 3 to 11pm on 25<sup>th</sup> March 1999 giving allowance for an error

of 2 to 4 hours. He later carried out a post mortem on the Deceased and certified the

cause of death in his Autopsy Report Exh. P87, to be: </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">‘Asphyxia from Strangulation’. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Prof Chao found the following external injuries:</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Neck</p>
</i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1. A thin linear abrasion 8 cm long in the centre of the neck at

thyroid region.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2. Roundish bruise 1.5cm at right side of chin.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3. Small bruises at right jaw.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4. Oval shaped bruise 3 cm with a 1cm abrasion in the centre on the

left side of neck below jaw.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5. Below that a crescentic abrasion 1 cm.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6. Abrasion 1.5cm on left side of neck.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7. Below that a crescentic abrasion 1 cm.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><i>Elbows</i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8. Bruise above left elbow 3 x 2cm</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9. Bruises around right elbow 2 x 2 cm and 5 x 2 cm.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Prof Chao also found petichae haemorrhages on the skin of the

Deceased’s face around the eyes as well as haemorrhages in the conjunctiva of the

Deceased’s eyes. These he said were signs of strangulation. In addition, there were

strangulation marks on the Deceased’s neck with a ligature and by fingertip marks.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">According to Prof Chao, injury 1 above was caused by pressure from a

string-like object pressed against the Deceased’s neck from the front. A dissection

of the neck in a bloodless field revealed the ligature injury to have caused haemorrhage

over the muscles in the centre of the neck.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">As for injuries 2, 3, 4 and 6, Prof Chao testified that these injuries

were made by fingertips of the assailant. It was Prof Chao’s evidence that the

assailant had also applied considerable amount of force manually by his hands as internal

underlying examination revealed injuries 2, 3, 4 and 6 had caused deep haemorrhages on the

underlying tissue of the neck as well as on the larynx and the food passage (oesophagus)

at the back of the neck.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Prof Chao was of the opinion that the ligature mark and the marks

caused by the finger tips under the neck structure either independently or collectively

were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death and that these injuries

had not been accidentally caused. Neither were they self-inflicted. The Deceased’s

death would have taken between 2 to 4 minutes with the oxygen cut off from the brain

resulting in brain death. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">As for injuries 5 and 7 above, i.e. the crescentic abrasions of 1cm,

Prof Chao stated that they were caused by the Deceased’s finger nails which left

scratch marks on her face. They resulted because she was attempting to pull off the

assailant’s hands to lift the stranglehold on her.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Prof Chao also found haemorrhages on the outside of both elbows of the

Deceased and he was of the opinion that the injuries were consistent with pressure having

been applied on the outside of the elbows by the assailant gripping the Deceased’s

elbows and body by his having straddled across the Deceased’s body in such a way that

the Deceased’s elbows were gripped by the assailant’s knees at some point during

the strangulation.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Prof Chao went on to testify that there was an absence of blood on the

Deceased’s neck and this made it unlikely that the assailant had cut his wrists

before strangling her. He further said that as considerable force had been applied on her

larynx and food passage, it was unlikely that the Deceased could have shouted out or

screamed. As for part of the Deceased’s clothes, thighs and legs being covered with

blood, his opinion was that she was not moving when the blood fell on her body. There were

no open wounds on the Deceased’s body and the blood was not hers. The blood he

suggested could have come from the assailant’s bleeding hands when he moved her body

or lay next to her later.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> <u>Scientific Officer</u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8. DNA profiles of all the blood stains and other exhibits in the room

matched that of the Accused including the knife <i>Exh. P146</i> according to Scientific

Officer Mrs Tan Wai Fun of the Department of Scientific Services. Semen stains were also

detected on the bedsheet and on the Deceased’s shorts which she wore. DNA profiles of

the semen stains on the said bedsheet and on the Deceased’s shorts matched the DNA

profile of the Accused.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<u xmlns=""><i><b>
<p align="justify">Other Prosecution Witnesses</p></b></i>
<p align="justify">Wendy, Lily, Seow Feng and Sam</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9. Prosecution witnesses, the Accused’s roommates Lily and Seow

Feng and one Lim Geok Mui (‘Wendy’) testified that the Accused had become

suspicious about the activities of the Deceased and he had been following the Deceased for

some days i.e. from about 18<sup>th</sup> March 1999 to 24<sup>th</sup> March 1999 in

places such as Tampines Central, Marina Square, East Coast Food Centre and City Plaza and

calling her on the mobile phone she carried. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Wendy</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9.1 It was Wendy’s evidence that she had seen the Accused and

talked to him at several of these places when she saw him following the Deceased. The

Accused had denied following the Deceased. Wendy went on to testify that she had

introduced the Deceased in early March to one Hooi Sau Ching ('Sam')’and they became

friends. Soon afterwards the Deceased, she and Sam met regularly three to four times a

week. On 20<sup>th</sup> March 1999 Wendy accompanied the Deceased to Johore Bahru in a

car driven by Sam to obtain a new Social Visit Pass by exiting Singapore. There the

Deceased informed her that she and Sam were going to Genting Highlands she invited Wendy

to come along with them as well. She did so. All 3 slept in Sam’s car that night

after arriving in Genting Highlands as there was no accommodation available there. They

returned home the next day on 21<sup>st</sup> March 1999 at about 7pm. Her evidence was

that the Deceased thereafter began looking for a job, attending one or two interviews but

was unsuccessful. They began going out daily.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Wendy testified that some time after 7 pm on 24 March 1999 the Deceased

received a phone call on Sam’s handphone [97948719] when the trio were together. The

caller was the Accused. Sam handed the mobile phone to the Deceased to speak. Wendy who

was in the car heard the Deceased telling the Accused, in Mandarin:-</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">"I have made it clear to you, it is impossible between us. I told

you clearly."</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">"A woman like me is not suitable for you".</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">"You better not accept a woman like me, I hope that you will find

a better one."</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">"You better not look for Ah Sam."</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">After the call ended, the telephone rang again and this time, the

Accused spoke to Sam and asked him to meet him. Wendy testified that her impression during

these several days was that the Accused appeared upset at the relationship of the Deceased

with Sam.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Wendy further stated that on the 25<sup>th</sup> March 1999 she had

lunch with the Deceased and Sam at about noon. Thereafter both she and the Deceased took a

bus to Jurong where the Deceased went for a job interview whilst Sam went back to work.

The Deceased was carrying Sam’s handphone. She received a call from the Accused on

Sam’s handphone. After the Deceased spoke to the Accused, Wendy said that the

Deceased had told her that the Accused had threatened her that if she did not return, he

would commit suicide and she was to watch the news that night on television. The Deceased

thereafter returned to the flat by taxi sometime between 2.00pm and 3.00pm.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Wendy went on to say that as soon as she returned home, she called the

Deceased at the flat. The Deceased answered the call and told her to meet her at the flat.

They intended to go out. Wendy then arrived at the void deck of the flat where the

Deceased lived and called the Deceased from there. However, the Accused answered the phone

this time. He informed her that the Deceased had left for dinner with her elder sister.

The Accused soon afterwards again spoke to Wendy after paging her. This time he told her

that the Deceased had left a message for Wendy that she should wait for the Deceased at

the bus stop at Bedok South. Subsequently, the Accused spoke to Wendy a third time, after

paging her and told her that the Deceased had gone to Johore Bahru to attend a wedding

dinner and would call her the following day. He then asked her to meet him at the void

deck of the flat as the Deceased had given him $50/- which the Deceased had requested him

to give to her to pay for her taxi fare back to Bedok South. He accordingly met her at the

void deck where she had been waiting and gave her $50/-. Wendy thereafter left.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Lily</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10. Lily testified that on 22<sup>nd</sup> March 1999, the Deceased

revealed to her that Sam had treated her very well and had also given her $250/-. She

realised that there were differences between the Deceased and the Accused. The Deceased

had further revealed to her that she had an argument with the Accused as he had kept

questioning her about Sam. Although the Deceased had told her not to tell the Accused

about the money given to her by Sam, Lily had however revealed to the Accused at his

insistence to confide in him that a sum of $250/- was given by Sam to the Deceased. The

Accused had checked the Deceased’s wallet in the room and seen that the sum of money

was inside. The Accused had remarked to her that the Deceased had lied to him that she had

returned the money to Sam. The Accused then told her that he had intended to go out with

the Deceased and suggest to her to end their relationship. Lily also testified that on 22<sup>nd</sup>

March 1999 at 11 pm when the Deceased had still not returned to the room, the Accused had

told her that Sam and she were only casual friends. The Accused had admitted following the

Deceased as he wanted to see what Sam looked like. He also spoke to her about the Deceased

having changed her feelings towards him. Lily said she advised the Accused to take things

easy. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">As to the events on the afternoon of 25<sup>th</sup> of March 1999 i.e.

the day of the incident, the Prosecution adduced evidence that the Accused had used the

telephone in the flat and had continuously paged for the Deceased prior to the

Accused'’ return to the flat. Lily testified that the Accused had also called her

several times earlier that afternoon telling her that the Deceased had not returned to the

flat and had requested her help to page for the Deceased. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Sam</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11. Sam testifying, confirmed the events as narrated earlier by Lily

and Wendy concerning his friendly relationship with the Deceased and the trip to Genting

Highlands and his giving the Deceased $250/-.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<u xmlns=""><i><b>
<p align="justify">Psychiatric Evidence</p></b></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12. Dr Stephen Phang, Psychiatric Consultant attached to the Institute

of Mental Health who examined the Accused on six occasions from 27<sup>th</sup> March to

12<sup>th</sup> April 1999 put up a Psychiatric Report dated 13<sup>th</sup> April 1999

Exh. P91. He also put up a supplementary report dated 4<sup>th</sup> January 2000 after he

had been requested to review the Accused at the Queenstown Remand Prison after he had

voluntarily given a further statement to the police as evidenced by Exh. P147. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In Exh. P91, Dr Stephen Phang stated that the Accused had told him that

he had strangled the Deceased to death. He denied strangling her as a result of anger or

of a third party in their relationship. He had also denied any intention on his part to

kill her.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Briefly, Dr Phang stated that the Accused had informed him that it was

the Deceased who requested him to end her life by strangling her. He denied any intention

on his part to kill her. The Accused had stated to him that the Deceased had even casually

mentioned committing suicide on several occasions in that week to him. He claimed that she

refused to divulge her problems to him even though he had queried her. He had denied that

they had any dispute or conflict prior to the killing taking place. He emphatically denied

strangling her in anger in the context of a quarrel, either as a result of a third party

in their relationship or any other reason. She had requested that they commit suicide

together after they had sexual intercourse. He succumbed to her request, obtained a fruit

knife in the kitchen and cut both his wrists whereupon she asked him to strangle her as

dying by the knife was too painful and he did so. Dr Phang noted in his report that

"at no time did he feel depressed or suicidal himself. He stated that he had felt

‘a little troubled and uneasy’ in the course of the week preceding the killing,

but explained that this was due to his awareness of the fact that his girlfriend was upset

and not confiding in him. Even so, he denied feeling depressed in his mood, and was able

to go about his daily activities without any apparent difficulty."</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">It was Dr Phang’s opinion that the Accused did not suffer from any

form of mental illness. He was neither depressed nor psychotic at or around the material

time of the killing, or in the week preceding, when he claimed he first noticed that the

deceased appeared miserable. The Accused also stated that he attempted to kill himself,

but was ‘rescued’ by the intervention of the flat owner. He said that he cut his

wrist as felt that he had ‘lived long enough’. However, he denied feeling

depressed at the time and described even tidying the area around the bed so that they

could "die in a neat surrounding". </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Dr Phang was also of the opinion that the Accused was fully aware of

the nature of his actions at and around the material time of the killing from the detailed

and consistent account of the events he gave. The Accused, Dr Phang stated, retained the

ability to differentiate between right and wrong, and is therefore not considered to have

been of unsound mind at the material time.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In Court Dr Phang added that the Accused did not come within any

criteria under DSM IV (DSM III previously) or any ICD and was not suffering from

diminished responsibility under S 300 Exception 7 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In his further report dated 4<sup>th</sup> January 2000, in an

interview, the Accused admitted to him that he changed his original statements and that he

had no wish to die. He had admitted to him (Dr Phang) that he was angry with the Deceased

for insulting him by communicating her desire to leave him for another man after they had

sex which was the reverse of what he had promised prior to their lovemaking. The Accused

stated that his reason for squeezing the neck of the Deceased was to prevent her from

verbalizing that she wanted to leave him. He admitted that his action was therefore

motivated by (and reactive to) what he perceived as a betrayal by the Deceased as well as

a desire to prevent her from being together with any other man. The Accused admitted to

him that he was still unaware of the nature of his actions at and around the material

time.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Dr Phang again concluded that the Accused had not suffered from any

mental illness at the time of the killing of the Deceased.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<u xmlns=""><i><b>
<p align="justify">The Police Statements of the Accused</p></b></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13. The Prosecution adduced evidence of seven statements made by the

Accused after his arrest. These were admitted in evidence as Counsel for the Accused

informed the Court that the Defence was not objecting to their admission as he was not

raising any issue as to the lack of their voluntariness. Nevertheless, on my direction,

the Prosecution adduced <i>prima facie</i> evidence that all the statements were

voluntarily made. The evidence was unchallenged. The Accused was also invited to testify

after <i>prima facie</i> evidence had been adduced showing that the statements were

  <p align="justify" xmlns="">……….</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Suddenly, in the midst of our conversation, ‘Ah May’ started

<p align="justify" xmlns="">After making love, ‘Ah May’ started to cry. She told me that

<p align="justify" xmlns="">I asked ‘Ah May’ what happened. She refused to tell me and

  suggested that both of us kill ourselves. I again asked her what happened and she still

  refused to tell me.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">As I was very confused and I waited for her the whole night. ‘Ah

  May’ suggested that I cut my wrists first, then I strangle her neck using my hands.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">I then leave the bedroom and went to the kitchen to take a knife

  (approximate 6 to 7 inches long) from the sink and cut my wrists.</p>

<p align="justify">18. Ten to fifteen minutes later, "Ah may" told me that she

  wanted to commit suicide. I asked her why she wanted to commit suicide and again she

  would still commit suicide when she moved out. She said that when that happened, I would

  sight of me cutting my wrists, "Ah May" indicated that she was afraid of the

  pain. She then asked me to strangle her.</p>
<p align="justify">20. After that time, "Ah May" was lying on a mattress. I was

  sitting beside her. I proceeded to put my hands around her neck and squeezed it. Shortly

<p align="justify" xmlns="">"33. At about 3:00 p.m., she arrived home in Pasir Ris. …</p>

pleading with her for a while. Subsequently, she agreed. We then made love.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35. 10 to 15 minutes after we have made love, ‘Ah May’ again

mentioned that she was going to leave me. She told me that she was more found of the other

person. I gathered that the person referred to was ‘Ah Sam’ because I have heard

from ‘Lily’ that ‘Ah May’ had got to know a guy named ‘Ah

Sam’. I was sad on hearing what ‘Ah May’ had said. I became furious and it

pained me to hear that she was leaving me because she was more found of another guy. At

that time the thought crossed my mind that I wanted to die with her because I could not

bear to have her leave me. I love her very much.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">36. During that time, ‘ah May’ kept saying that she had

fallen in love with another guy. I was fearful that she would leave me for the other guy.

I was in agony. While she kept saying that, I told her not to say anymore as I was not

going to listen to her further. I put my hands around her neck and squeezed it. As I was

squeezing her neck, I kept telling her not to leave me or we would die together. When I

was squeezing her neck, she clenched her fists and tried to struggle. I kept squeezing her

neck until she became still.</p>

a knife. Thereafter, I went back to the bedroom and cut my wrist. I cut both my wrists

Therefore, I cut both my wrists three times each on the same site.</p>

<u xmlns=""><i><b>
<p align="justify">Prima Facie Case</p>
</b></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14. It was evident from the Accused’s voluntary statements to the

police especially <i><b>Exh. P147</b></i> and inferences therefrom and the medical

evidence which I have narrated that the Accused killed the Deceased by strangling her. The

Pathologist’s evidence showed as has been narrated earlier that the assailant i.e.

the Accused had both strangled the Deceased with his hands by applying considerable amount

of manual force and also by a ligature causing her to die from asphyxiation as is evident

from the underlying internal injuries found on the neck. The Pathologist had also

categorically stated that the injuries to the Deceased’s neck were not accidental or

self-inflicted and that the injuries were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to

cause death.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Each element of the murder charge had been <i>prima facie</i> proved by

the primary evidence, the bodily injuries present on the neck, that the same were not

accidental or self-inflicted but intentionally inflicted. The Accused’s intention in

inflicting the fatal injuries were clear in view of the Pathologist’s evidence that a

considerable amount of manual force was used in pressing the neck of the Deceased as

evidenced by the Deceased’s haemorrhages in the underlying tissue of the neck, larynx

and food passage and also by a string-like object i.e. a ligature pressed against the

Deceased’s neck from the front resulting in the Deceased’s death from

asphyxiation. As the Accused’s intention was <i>prima facie</i> proved, the

sufficiency of the injuries was for the Court a purely objective inference to draw. I was <i>prima

facie</i> satisfied on all the evidence that the injuries caused by the manual

strangulation and those caused by ligature independently or collectively, were sufficient

in the ordinary course of nature to cause death and had caused the death of the Accused. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Psychiatric evidence further showed that the Deceased was not of

unsound mind at the time of the offence. It was for the Accused to establish any of the

exceptions to s 300 of the Penal Code which provide formal mitigation and reduce the

offence of murder to simple culpable homicide.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">I therefore called upon the Accused to enter upon his Defence.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The Accused elected to give evidence on oath. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> <u><i><b>Defence</b></i></u></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15. The Accused testified that he had come to know the Deceased some 9

months earlier. They became intimate lovers soon afterwards. Some time in early March, he

invited her to stay with him in a room which he was occupying with the two other Malaysian

females Seow Feng and Lily. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16. On the 22<sup>nd</sup> of March he learnt from Lily that the

Deceased had gone to Genting Highlands with another youth. He was angry when he heard the

news from Lily. He had earlier suspected her of having a new boyfriend and had been

following her. He said the Deceased had started coming home late at night and on the night

of the 24<sup>th</sup> March she had altogether failed to return to his room despite his

having paged for her and sought the assistance of Lily to do the same. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16.1 On the afternoon of the 25<sup>th</sup> of March 1999 he paged for

her repeatedly and finally spoke to her on the telephone a few times, eventually informing

her to come back to the flat and told her that if she refused to come back, she could read

from the newspapers and find out from the news on the television about his having

committed suicide. However when asked by his Counsel , <i>"Did you intend to do what

you said?"</i> his answer was "No". His purpose he said was to use the

‘suicide’ as a ‘pretext’ to make her return to the flat. Thereafter

the Deceased returned to the flat at 3pm. He was very happy. However, shortly later he

learnt from Wendy that both of them would be going out again. As he wanted to talk to the

Deceased, he asked her whether she was going out again but she did not answer his

question. He did not want her go go out as he wanted to talk to her about their

relationship which they started to do after she had a bath. He told her to think about the

matter carefully. He told her that he loved her genuinely and that it did not matter if

she had lied to him or had hidden things from him previously as long as she came back to

him. The Deceased began to cry. He wiped the tears off her eyes and she apologised to him.

She then nodded her head when he asked her if she would come back to him. They then had

sexual intercourse. He believed he ejaculated outside her body. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16.3 However, after the intercourse when he was about to go out and

take a bath, the Deceased said that she was fond of the other man whom he knew was Sam.

She told him that he had a more successful career than he did. Upon hearing that he

squeezed her neck with his hands to prevent her from speaking about the other man. He kept

asking her why she had wanted to lie to him. After some time, she became motionless. He

though she had fainted and he let her sleep covering her with a blanket and thereafter

lying beside her. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16.4 He got up a little later and went to the hall as he was very

troubled. He then entered the kitchen and saw a knife on the kitchen sink. He returned

with it to the room. He thought he had to prove his love to the Deceased. So he cut his

wrists pacing the room. He thought that if the Deceased knew what he did, she would come

back to him. He again stated that he had intended to kill himself by cutting his wrists.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Asked further by his Counsel as to whether the contents of his police

statements <i>Exhs. P99, P101-102</i> were true where he stated that the Deceased had

asked him to cut his wrists and then to kill her, he stated that the statements in that

version were untrue. He did not state the truth because he was afraid as he could not

accept the facts. Asked to elaborate by Prosecuting Counsel later as to what he meant by

"could not accept the facts" he stated that he could not accept the fact that he

had caused the death of the Deceased with his hands. When asked specifically by his

Counsel whether his further statement in <i>Exh. P104</i> was true that the Deceased had

let him strangle her, he again stated that the statement was not true. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16.5 The Accused also went on to state that the statements he had made

to the Psychiatrist and reported by the Psychiatrist in his report were not a true account

of what he had stated and he had made them because he was following his earlier police

statements.  The Accused thereafter revealed that the statements he made in <i>Exh.

P147</i> were the true and correct version of the events that had transpired leading to

his strangling the Deceased and the cutting of his own wrists. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17. In <i>Cross-Examination</i> by the Prosecution, the Accused stated

that after he had found that the Deceased had fainted from his strangulation it did not

occur to him to wake her up or call for help; that he was unaware that she was dead after

he had strangled her; that he had no intention to commit suicide when he cut his hands;

that he had not applied pressure on his wrists to stop them from bleeding; that he had not

felt as if he was losing consciousness; that he did not try to wake up the Deceased to

show her that he had cut his wrists which should have indicated to her that he loved her.

He did not do this because he was worried for her if she saw blood on his hands; that he

agreed that there was no suicide pact between the Deceased and himself and that the

Deceased did not consent to be strangled by him; that the Deceased had no knowledge that

he was cutting his wrists as she had already fainted; that he had strangled her because he

did not want to hear her affairs with the other man of whom he learnt she was found of and

he had to stop her from saying further; that the Deceased did struggle when he was

strangling her; that the injuries to the Deceased’s outer elbow were caused when he

squeezed at her elbows and her body when sitting or straddling over her; that he had

previously told Lily that he would break off his relationship with the Deceased because of

the other man; that he had not killed the Deceased in a fit of jealousy, but had done so

because he could not bear the Deceased’s lying to him on numerous occasions and also

wanted her to stop mentioning things about the other man; he disagreed that there was

nothing new the Deceased had told him which he did not already know just before he

strangled her; he disagreed that he had cut his wrists to support his version of a suicide

pact as narrated in his earlier police statements.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<u xmlns=""><i><b>
<p align="justify">Evaluation and Findings</p></b></i></u><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">18. I considered the entire history of the events from the intimate

relationship of the Deceased and the Accused over some 8 or 9 months to her attraction for

another boy known as Sam which attraction had fatal consequences for her at the hands of

the Accused. </p>
<p align="justify">19. After his arrest, the Accused had in his statements <i>Exhs. P99A,</i>
<i>P102 and P104</i> stated to the police to the effect that the Deceased had told him on

25 March 1999 that they should both end their lives although she did not say why. He said

she had asked the Accused to cut his wrists and then to strangle her neck. Accordingly, he

then cut his wrists and strangled. The clear impression from his statements was that it

was a suicide pact between lovers although he later survived. However, shortly before the

Preliminary Inquiry some months later, the Accused volunteered a new statement <i>Exh.

P147</i> retracting the earlier statements as to how the Deceased’s death resulted.

In the new statement he said she had told him that she was <i>fond</i> of the other person

and had fallen in love with him. This had made him angry and furious as he believed she

would leave him. He thereupon told her to say no more and that he was not going to listen

to her and had thereafter strangled her. In the new statement, he said he had neither

consented to being strangled nor had asked him to cut his wrists.</p>
<p align="justify">20. Essentially the Accused’s defence in Court was not very

different from that put forward in <i>Exh. P147</i>. He stated in Court that during a

discussion on 25 March 1999 to resolve their relationship the Deceased had agreed to

remain his girlfriend. They then had sexual intercourse. However, shortly afterwards, the

Deceased told him that:</p>
<p align="justify">(i) <i>she was fond of the other man (Sam) and did not want to hear

anymore about it; </i></p>
<p align="justify">(ii)<i> that the other man had better career prospects than him and </i></p>
<p align="justify">(iii)<i> further that he was angry as she had lied previously to him

which included her hiding many things from him.</i></p>
<p align="justify">. The Accused’s defence was that all this amounted to provocation

and he reacted to the provocation by squeezing her by the neck with his hands to prevent

her speaking about the other man. He had squeezed her neck until she became motionless. </p>
<p align="justify">21. I accepted as probable and true the version of events as narrated

by the Accused in Court and in the new statement <i>Exh. P147.</i> <i>Exh. P147</i> had

not been sought by the police but the Accused had taken the initiative and called for the

Investigating Officer when in remand to make the statement to him shortly before the

Preliminary Inquiry and when the investigations were long completed. It was admitted

without objection as being voluntarily made and thus substantially ensured its truth. </p>
<p align="justify">22. I found that the Accused had realised that his earlier accounts in <i>Exhs.

P99A, P102 and P104</i> did not fit in with the expert forensic evidence. Otherwise, there

was no reason for the Accused to recant his earlier statements and to admit that there was

no suicide pact and to go and admit that he had strangled her because she was in effect

dumping him for Sam whose qualities she preferred, all of which he could not bear to hear.

There was no reason for the Accused finally to make these admissions in <i>Exh. P147</i>

and in his evidence in Court unless they were true. The Accused was entitled to ground his

defence of provocation on these facts as he did. I shall now consider the law and the

evidence in its totality in assessing his defence on his evidence in Court and the

relevant facts narrated in <i>Exh. P147.</i></p>
<p align="justify">23. Under S 300, Exception 1 of the Penal Code, for the defence of

provocation to succeed so as to reduce an offence of murder to culpable homicide, an

offender’s power of self-control must be deprived by grave and sudden provocation.</p>
<p align="justify">24. I accepted the Accused’s account that the Deceased made the

utterances complained of by the Accused on the afternoon of the 25 March 1999 in view of

the corroborating evidence of the deteriorated relationship between the Accused and the

Deceased as expressed by Wendy, Lily and Seow Feng her roommates as set out earlier. The

Deceased’s utterances, however, constituted at the highest only a very a <i>mild </i>form

of provocation and not a <i>grave</i> provocation as envisaged by the Penal Code. Again

there was nothing <i>sudden</i> in the utterances made or intimations given to the

Accused. The Accused had already known that the Deceased had started to go out with Sam as

testified to by the Deceased’s roommates The Deceased had specifically told the

Accused about two days earlier over the phone as appears from the evidence of Wendy, which

fact the Accused admitted, that the Deceased had made it clear to him that their

relationship was impossible, that she was not suitable for him and not to accept her and

that he should find a better one and that he further had better not look for Sam. Further,

Lily a mutual friend, had testified that previously the Accused had told her he

contemplated suggesting to the Deceased that they end their relationship. This evidence

had not been challenged by the Accused. The Accused had therefore plenty of time to

reflect coolly over his relationship with the Deceased. Lily had also advised him earlier

to take things easy.</p></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25. The Accused had in my opinion therefore plainly overacted to the

words of the Deceased declaring her intention to leave him for Sam on that fateful

afternoon. In my opinion, he further failed to display the level of self-control expected

of an ordinary person when the Deceased made the utterances complained of. There was

nothing to suggest in the evidence that the Deceased had mocked the Accused or had

insulted him or otherwise subjected him to indignity by her conduct in making known to him

her fondness for Sam. The severity of degree of loss of self-control was simply not

commensurate with the mild provocation. The law is that the defence of provocation is not

available to those who over-react because they are exceptionally pugnacious, bad-tempered

or over-sensitive. I find the Deceased was over-sensitive and had grossly over-reacted out

of jealousy although he denied the same in intentionally injuring the Deceased fatally. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26. Finally, I would add that the Accused had also throughout his

evidence testified that the Deceased had only fainted as a result of his strangling her

and that she was only asleep. He admittedly did nothing to try to wake her up or seek help

if that was so. His explanation was that he did not do so as she would have been

frightened by the blood on his hands and on her body. This was a feeble explanation and I

rejected it. I was satisfied that the Accused knew he had strangled the Deceased to death.

The Accused not only applied considerable <i>manual</i> force but also went on to apply

pressure on her neck by a <i>ligature </i>thereby independently or collectively causing

serious injuries to the neck structure and causing her to die from asphyxiation. The

Accused’s denial that he had used a ligature to strangle her was a lie as it went

against the established evidence which showed such a ligature was used as can clearly be

discerned from the photographs taken during the post mortem (<i>Exhs. P57 –59, P61

and P62</i>) and the exposed underlying injury in <i>Exh. P73.</i> In his earlier version

of events as stated in his recanted statements he had tried to give a false impression

that there was a suicide pact between him and the Deceased to dupe the police in case he

was apprehended. His new version <i>Exh. P147</i> as amplified in Court that he had cut

his wrists as he wanted to die anyway after he found the Deceased motionless was totally

unconvincing and I rejected it.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27. Further, I accepted the evidence of the psychiatrist that the

Accused was fully aware of the nature of his actions all the time and was neither of

unsound mind nor suffering from diminished responsibility at or about the time he

committed the offence in as much as the defences were not raised.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>

<p align="justify">Conclusion</p></b></i></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28. In the circumstances, I found the Accused guilty on the amended

charge of murder, convicted him and sentenced him according to law. </p>
