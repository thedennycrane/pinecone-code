        Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Sim City Technology Ltd (“the
                    Respondent”), a shareholder of Singalab International Pte Ltd
                    (“Singalab International”), commenced Suit No 680 of 2009
                    (“the Suit”) against one Mr Ng Kek Wee (“the
                    Appellant”), who was both a shareholder and the managing director of
                    Singalab International. The Respondent sought personal remedies under s 216 of
                    the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Companies Act”) on
                    the grounds that the Appellant had conducted the affairs of Singalab
                    International and its subsidiaries in a manner that was commercially unfair to
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In <em>Sim City Technology Ltd v
                        Ng Kek Wee and others</em> [2013] SGHC 216 (“the
                    Judgment”), the High Court Judge (“the Judge”) allowed the
                    Respondent’s claim and among other things ordered that the Appellant buy
                    out the Respondent’s shares in the Company. The Appellant appeals against
                    the Judge’s decision on the grounds that the Respondent had not properly
                    pleaded its claim under s 216 of the Companies Act, and that the Judge had erred
                    in finding that there was commercial unfairness on the facts of the
                case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       For the reasons that follow, we allow the appeal
                    and set aside the orders made by the Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Appellant also argued that the wrongs
                    alleged by the Respondent were not wrongs suffered by the Respondent in its
                        <em>personal</em> capacity as a member of Singalab
                    International, and that the Respondent ought not to be entitled to use s 216 of
                    the Companies Act to circumvent the proper plaintiff rule and the reflective
                    loss principle. As will be apparent, we do not think that the determination of
                    this point is necessary to the disposal of the appeal but as the jurisprudence
                    in this area of law is somewhat involved we take the opportunity to clarify the
                    issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The full background to the dispute is set out in
                    the Judgment. Only the facts pertinent to the present appeal will be repeated
                    here.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The joint venture and formation of Singalab International</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In 2003, the Appellant was the managing director
                    and one of several shareholders of a company known as Beans Fusion Pte Ltd
                    (“Beans Fusion”). Beans Fusion was in the business of providing
                    software and consultancy services in Asia and had four subsidiaries:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     Beans
                        Factory Pte Ltd (“Beans Factory”), which owned the licensing
                        rights to “Beans Kernl”, a programming tool (“the
                        Licensing Rights”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_d"></a>(d)     Beans Factory Co Ltd (Beijing) (“Beans
                        China”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Appellant had plans for the expansion of the
                    business and to that end, in 2003, he asked Mr Lim Kok Eng (“Mr Lim
                    KE”), the Managing Director of the Respondent, if he was interested in
                    co-investing in the Beans Fusion business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Mr Lim KE
                    said he was keen. Accordingly, their joint venture was structured in this way.
                    First, in early 2004, the Appellant conducted a management buyout of Beans
                    Fusion and thereby became its sole shareholder. Next, on 31 August 2004,
                    Singalab International was incorporated as the parties’ joint venture
                    vehicle, along with two other investors as minority shareholders.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The shareholding of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>According to the Respondent, Atomic International was
                        actually the nominee of the Appellant. This was disputed by the
                        Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Respondent averred that there was an
                    understanding between these shareholders encapsulated in a Joint Venture
                    Arrangement (“the JVA”), which was for Singalab International to
                    purchase Beans Fusion’s subsidiaries, and with the aid of new investment
                    to expand their businesses with the ultimate goal of selling off or listing the
                    company. It was also agreed that the shareholders would have a personal interest
                    in the shares of each of Singalab International’s subsidiary companies in
                    the proportion set out at [7] above.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Pursuant to the
                    JVA, an executive committee (“the Exco”) was formed in or around
                    October 2004 consisting of the Appellant, two of the Respondent’s
                    representatives namely Mr Lim KE and one Mr Ng Han Kim (“Mr Ng
                    HK”), as well as a representative of Accord Investment, Mr Huang Jun Dar
                    (“Mr Huang”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 31 December 2004 and 13 May 2005, Beans
                    Fusion sold all its shares in Beans HK and SPL to Singalab International for a
                    total consideration of S$630,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Beans HK and SPL thus became
                    wholly owned subsidiaries of Singalab International. Subsequently, Beans Factory
                    assigned the Licensing Rights to SPL.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The management of Singalab International and its
                subsidiaries</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Appellant was appointed Group Chief
                    Executive Officer, Chief Technical Officer and Managing Director of Singalab
                    International and was put in charge of running its various businesses. Mr Ng HK
                    was also appointed as a director of Singalab International from 1 September 2004
                    to 30 June 2005.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Appellant was the Chairman of Beans HK
                    from 2004 until its sale on 14 April 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Appellant was appointed Managing Director
                    of SPL on 1 November 2002 and remained so even after Singalab International had
                    acquired the shares of SPL. Mr Ng HK and Mr Huang were initially also directors
                    of SPL but resigned in May and June 2005. In or around
                        28<sup>th</sup> October 2005, one Mr Chan Mun Kong
                    (“Mr Chan”) was appointed as a director of SPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Incorporation of Beans Malaysia and other related companies</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In June 2006, one Mr Lim Beng Cheang
                    (“Mr Lim BC”) was instructed by the Respondent to assist the
                    Appellant to expand Singalab International’s business to
                Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     According to the Respondent, Beans Factory
                    Solutions Sdn Bhd (“Beans Malaysia”) was incorporated as a
                    subsidiary of Singalab International.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Formally, however, Mr Lim
                    BC held one of the two subscriber shares in Beans Malaysia and the Appellant
                    held the other share; both of them were also the signatories of the bank account
                    of Beans Malaysia. Mr Lim BC and his sister, together with the Appellant, were
                    appointed as directors of Beans Malaysia. According to Mr Lim BC, the Appellant
                    made all the executive decisions for Beans Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Respondent also alleged that, pursuant to
                    the JVA, the Appellant had incorporated other entities in China and Taiwan
                    (henceforth known as “Beans China” and “Beans
                    Taiwan”). The Respondent claimed that although the Appellant was formally
                    the sole shareholder and managing director of these companies, he was holding
                    his shares in the two companies on trust for Singalab International and that
                    those companies were <em>in fact</em> its subsidiaries (see
                    above at [8]).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Events leading to the commencement of the Suit</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In February 2009, the Respondent discovered
                    that Beans Malaysia could not pay its staff their salaries. It further
                    discovered that from August 2006 to February 2009 the Appellant had authorised
                    the withdrawal of over RM1.4m in cash from Beans Malaysia, purportedly in order
                    to pay invoices issued by SPL in respect of labour and skills supplied by SPL
                    for Beans Malaysia’s projects in Malaysia (“the Malaysian Cash
                        Withdrawals”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> However, SPL’s
                    invoices were not reflected in SPL’s accounts,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> and the
                    Malaysian Cash Withdrawals were also unaccounted for in the management accounts
                    of SPL.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Respondent made frequent and repeated
                    offers to assist the Appellant in drawing up and auditing SPL’s accounts.
                    Finally, on 18 May 2009, the Appellant agreed to meet representatives of the
                        Respondent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> At this meeting, the representatives
                    of the Respondent learnt that the Appellant was holding all the issued share
                    capital of SPL following a transfer of SPL’s shares from Singalab
                    International to the Appellant on 28 July 2006 (“the SPL
                        Transfer”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> After this meeting, the Respondent made further
                    inquiries and discovered that the Appellant had, on or about 14 April 2008,
                    caused Singalab International’s interest in Beans HK to be transferred to
                    one Fong Ho Wan (“the Beans HK Transfer”), which interest was
                    subsequently on-sold by Fong Ho Wan to a third party.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     According to the Appellant, both the SPL
                    Transfer and the Beans HK Transfer (collectively “the Transfers”)
                    had been authorised at a meeting of the shareholders of Singalab International
                    on 12 June 2006 (“the 12 June 2006 Meeting”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>
                    The Appellant alleged that Singalab International’s entire holding of SPL
                    shares had been transferred to him as security pursuant to a shareholders’
                    agreement that he would obtain bank loans in the name of SPL and put up a
                    personal guarantee for those loans.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The Appellant also alleged that the
                    Beans HK Transfer had taken place as Beans HK had been running at a
                        loss.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> The
                    Respondent and Accord Investment disputed the Appellant’s version of
                    events. They claimed that the 12 June 2006 Meeting never took place and that
                    they never agreed to the Transfers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On 20 May 2009, the Appellant sent a letter of
                    apology to the Respondent’s representatives. He made certain admissions of
                    fault and offered to purchase the Respondent’s shares in Singalab
                    International for US$420,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> The Respondent did not
                    agree to the offer. Instead, it sought to review Singalab International’s
                    and SPL’s corporate documents and accounts so as to obtain a better
                    understanding of the state of the companies.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> On 29 May 2009,
                    the Appellant sent the Respondent copies of some, but not all, of those
                    documents sought. From these documents, the Respondent discovered even more
                    irregularities pertaining to SPL:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Appellant had authorised the
                        withdrawal of substantial funds from SPL’s account with DBS Bank, but
                        these withdrawals (“the SPL Withdrawals”) were never reflected
                        in SPL’s company accounts; neither were there any documents to show
                        what had happened to those funds and why they were taken out of the
                            company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Appellant had also authorised substantial
                        payments from SPL to himself and to third parties which were likewise
                        unaccounted for (“the SPL Payments”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Respondent tried to negotiate a suitable
                    buy-out of its interest in Singalab International and when these attempts
                    failed, it commenced the Suit on 4 August 2009.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> In addition to the
                    Appellant, Mr Chan was also joined as a defendant. Singalab International, its
                    other shareholders (<em>ie</em>, Accord Investments and
                    Atomic International) and SPL were joined but only as nominal defendants to the
                    Suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Events after the commencement of the Suit</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Two events occurred after the commencement of
                    the Suit that are in our view material. The first goes to the issue of whether
                    the Respondent was truly powerless to help itself and therefore entitled to
                    claim relief under s 216. An Extraordinary General Meeting (“EGM”)
                    of Singalab International was held on 28 August 2009 and two of the
                    Respondent’s representatives were appointed to its board of
                        directors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> The Respondent also filed a complaint
                    against the Appellant with the Commercial Affairs Department. We discuss this in
                    more detail later in this judgment at [55].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The second event was the incorporation of
                    Beans Group Pte Ltd (“Beans Group”) on 26 August 2009. Its sole
                    director and shareholder was the Appellant’s 71 year old mother, Mdm Swa
                    Soo Eng.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>
                    Beans Group also incorporated two related companies in Malaysia and Taiwan. The
                    Respondent alleged that the Appellant was a shadow director of Beans Group and
                    had wrongfully diverted the assets, business and talent of SPL to Beans Group in
                    breach of his fiduciary duties to SPL. These assets included the Licensing
                    Rights. In other words, Beans Group was the vehicle used by the Appellant to
                    hold his allegedly ill-gotten gains.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The business of Beans Group was subsequently
                    sold to HiSoft Singapore Pte Ltd (“HiSoft”) for an estimated total
                    purchase price of S$5,460,046.00 pursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement dated
                    17 January 2011 (“the HiSoft SPA”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> A Deed of
                        Assignment<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> was executed on the same day, wherein Beans
                    Group assigned to the Appellant all its “rights, entitlement, title and
                    interest whatsoever” that it had under the HiSoft SPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     On 13 February 2012, pursuant to a winding up
                    application brought by a creditor, Beans Group was ordered to be wound up with
                    the Official Receiver being appointed as its Liquidator. However, as at 9
                    January 2013, no Statement of Affairs had yet been filed for the
                company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     We will only summarise that part of the
                    Judgment which concerns the present appeal. The Judge made the following
                    findings of fact. First, the Judge accepted the Respondent’s case that the
                    Transfers had been made without the necessary approvals required under s 160 of
                    the Companies Act. In this regard, the Judge found that the 12 June 2006 Meeting
                    did not take place and that there was no evidence that the Respondent or Accord
                    Investment knew of, let alone authorised, the Transfers. Second, the Judge found
                    that the Appellant had misappropriated the funds of and mismanaged the accounts
                    of SPL, and he was accordingly in breach of his duty to SPL at common law as
                    well as his duty under s 157(1) of the Companies Act to act honestly in the
                    interests of SPL. Finally, the Judge found that the Appellant was the
                    controlling mind behind Beans Group and that the Appellant had diverted assets,
                    business and talents of SPL to Beans Group in breach of his duties to
                    SPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Judge also found that the Respondent had
                    made its case that it was the victim of commercial unfairness and was therefore
                    entitled to a remedy under s 216 of the Companies Act. Such commercial
                    unfairness would have been made out <em>solely</em> on the
                    basis that the Transfers were wrongful. However, the Judge also found that as a
                    matter of law she was entitled to take into account the Appellant’s
                    misconduct of the affairs of SPL in the assessment of whether the
                    Appellant’s conduct of the affairs of Singalab International was such as
                    to amount to commercial unfairness. On this alternative basis, the Judge found
                    that the Respondent was also entitled to a remedy under s 216.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     On the issue of the remedies that would be
                    available, the Judge considered that under s 216(2) of the Companies Act she had
                    ample discretion to tailor the relief to the facts before her and that she was
                    not bound by the relief pleaded for by the Respondent. Accordingly, she made the
                    following orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Deed of Assignment was to be set
                        aside and the Appellant was to hold all the monies and shares due from
                        Hisoft to Beans Group under the HiSoft SPA on trust for Beans Group and the
                        latter should in turn hold the same on trust for SPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Appellant should, within 30 days
                        of the Judgment, compensate SPL for the losses it suffered and was to make
                        good to SPL the following sums which the Judge found had been improperly
                        withdrawn:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_27-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       RM1,433,383.80, being the
                            Malaysian Cash Withdrawals;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_27-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       S$4,476,646.00, being the SPL
                            Withdrawals;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_27-p2_b-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       S$495, 836.40, being the SPL Payments;
                            and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_27-p2_b-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       the adjusted profits of S$94,599 made by SPL for the period between 1
                            April 2007 and 31 March 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_c"></a>(c)     The transfer of Singalab International’s
                        interest in SPL was to be set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_d"></a>(d)     Once the Appellant had complied with these orders, he was
                        further required to purchase the Respondent’s shares in Singalab
                        International within 30 days (“the Buyout Order”). The price
                        and other terms of the buyout was to be determined taking into account the
                        fact that the Appellant would, by this stage, have complied with the other
                        orders above.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_e"></a>(e)     In the event that the Appellant did not comply with the Buyout Order within
                        the 30-day period, the Respondent was entitled to apply for the winding up
                        for Singalab International, with the costs of the winding-up borne by the
                        Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_f"></a>(f)     Costs of the Suit were awarded to the Respondent to be agreed or taxed on a
                        standard basis with disbursements to be paid on an indemnity
                    basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues before this Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The Appellant does not challenge the
                    Judge’s findings that the Transfers were wrongful, that he had mismanaged
                    the accounts and misappropriated the funds of SPL, and that he had set up Beans
                    Group in breach of his fiduciary duties to SPL. Instead his main contentions are
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Respondent’s claim was
                        improperly pleaded because it had not expressly pleaded that it was bringing
                        a claim for relief under s 216 of the Companies Act;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Judge had erred in finding that
                        commercial unfairness had been made out on the facts;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Respondent’s claim could not
                        properly be characterised as being for a personal wrong;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Judge had
                        erred in purporting to exercise her discretion to grant unpleaded relief
                        under s 216(2) of the Companies Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was the oppression claim satisfactorily pleaded?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The Appellant contends that since the
                    Respondent did not expressly plead that its claim was for relief under s 216 of
                    the Companies Act, it was therefore not open to the court to grant relief under
                    that provision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     We disagree. We are not aware of any authority
                    whatsoever for that proposition. Neither the Companies Act nor the Rules of
                    Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the ROC”) states that relief
                    under s 216 may be granted only if that section is specifically invoked in the
                    pleadings. Order 88 r 2(4) of the ROC states that an application under s 216 of
                    the Companies Act “shall be made by writ”. That is the only
                    procedural requirement and it was undoubtedly fulfilled in this case. The
                    Appellant also could not cite a single case as authority for the proposition it
                    advanced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In any case, as a matter of principle, we
                    cannot see why there ought to be such a requirement. The general position with
                    regard to pleadings is that stated in O 18 r 7(1) of the ROC, which is that
                    “every pleading must contain, and contain only, a statement in a summary
                    form of <em>the material facts on which the party pleading relies
                        for his claim</em> or defence” (emphasis added). The objective
                    behind this general rule is to ensure that neither party is taken by surprise in
                    relation to the case that he must meet at trial. We are satisfied that in the
                    present case, there could have been no question of any surprise because, in our
                    judgment, the Respondent had adequately pleaded the material facts which it was
                    relying on for its claim. In its statement of claim (Amendment no 2)
                    (“SOC Amendment no 2”), the Respondent stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">39.    The [Respondent] further avers that the foregoing
                            demonstrates that the affairs of the Singalab/Beans Group are being
                            conducted in a manner oppressive to the [Respondent] and/or in disregard
                            of the [Respondent’s] interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">40.    The [Respondent] further avers that [the] conduct
                            of the [Appellant] was clearly designed to unfairly discriminate the
                            [Respondent] as a member of [Singalab International].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The above clearly sufficed to put the Appellant on notice that
                        the Respondent’s claim was one for relief under s 216 of the Companies
                        Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     We also find that the Respondent had, in any
                    event, validly amended its SOC to make express reference to ss 216(<em>a</em>) and (<em>b</em>) of the
                    Companies Act in the paragraphs quoted above,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> so that
                    even if the pleadings were originally defective, such defects were cured by the
                    amendments. The Respondent applied for and was granted leave to amend its
                    pleadings in this regard<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> following the
                    observation made in the course of the trial by the Judge that s 216 of the
                    Companies Act had not been expressly pleaded anywhere in the Respondent’s
                    SOC Amendment no 2.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> We do not take the
                    Judge’s observation as laying down any principle of law that s 216 must be
                    expressly pleaded in every claim mounted for relief from oppression. In any
                    case, Mr Lim Chee San (“Mr Lim”), counsel for the Appellant here
                    and below, did not raise any objections to the amendment and did not file an
                    appeal against the Judge’s decision to allow the amendment. It is trite
                    that a court has a wide power to allow amendments to pleadings at any stage of
                    the proceedings which would enable the real issues between the parties to be
                    ventilated, unless the amendment would cause injustice or injury to the opposing
                    party: <em>Wright Norman and another v Overseas-Chinese Banking

                    was in any way improperly exercised by the Judge in allowing the amendments;
                    neither can we see how that would cause the Appellant any injustice or injury.
                    Accordingly, we hold that the Respondent’s claim for relief under
                    s 216 of the Companies Act was adequately pleaded.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the Judge err in finding that commercial unfairness had been made
                out?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Section 216(1) reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Personal remedies in cases of
                            oppression or injustice</b>

                        section on the ground —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>a</em>) that the affairs of the company are

                            including himself or in disregard of his or their interests as members,

                            proposed which unfairly discriminates against or is otherwise
                            prejudicial to one or more of the members or holders of debentures
                            (including himself).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     On the words of the subsection there are a
                    number of limbs under which a claim for relief may be brought, but the common
                    thread between all of them is the element of commercial unfairness which would
                    justify the invocation of the court's jurisdiction under s 216: <em>Over &amp; Over Ltd v Bonvests Holdings Ltd and another</em>
                    [2009] 2 SLR(R) 111 at [68].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     On the question of whether there was
                    commercial unfairness in the present case such as to justify an order under s
                    216, two issues were raised for our decision. The first is the Appellant’s
                    argument that because the Respondent’s claim was brought <em>qua</em> its position as a member of Singalab International,
                    the Judge was not entitled, under s 216, to have any reference whatsoever to any
                    prejudicial manner in which the activities of Singalab International’s
                        <em>subsidiaries</em> were conducted, in particular,
                    SPL. The words “affairs of the company” in s 216(1)(<em>a</em>) ought to be read strictly to refer only to the
                    affairs of that company whose member or members were seeking relief under s 216,
                    and not to the affairs of that company’s subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The second issue is whether the Respondent is
                    disentitled from relief under s 216 because it is the majority shareholder of
                    Singalab International.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     We consider each in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Appellant’s conduct in relation to the affairs of the
                subsidiaries </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The Appellant contends that the Judge should
                    not have taken into account matters which pertained to the conduct of the
                    affairs of SPL and that by doing so, the Judge had deprived the Appellant of his
                    right to raise a defence or bring a counterclaim against SPL. We note here that
                    the Judge had held that <em>solely</em> on the basis of the
                    wrongful Transfers there was commercial unfairness in the conduct of the affairs
                    of Singalab International that was prejudicial to the Respondent. If the Judge
                    were correct in holding this, it would not have made a difference to the outcome
                    if the Judge had taken into account matters that pertained to the conduct of the
                    affairs of SPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In our judgment, the Appellant’s
                    contentions are off the mark. In the context of groups of companies, our courts
                    take a practical rather than narrow and legalistic approach in construing the
                    words “affairs of a company” in s 216. In <em>Kumagai Gumi Co Ltd v Zenecon Pte Ltd</em> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 304
                        (“<em>Kumagai</em>”), the appellant had
                    sought relief under s 216 of the Companies Act in respect of a joint venture
                    company (“KZ”), of which the appellant was a 49% shareholder and
                    the respondent was a 51% shareholder. KZ had a subsidiary company
                    (“KPM”). This court rejected the argument that the appellant had
                    to show that the oppressive conduct or unfair discriminatory acts complained of
                    were in respect of the affairs of KZ and not KPM and stated at [44] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… It seems to us that counsel has adopted a much too legalistic
                        approach relying on the separate legal personalities of KZ and KPM. KPM is a
                        subsidiary of KZ and the affairs of KPM were very much under the control of
                        KZ and both were managed and run by Low and his group.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     A similar approach was taken in the case of
                        <em>Low Peng Boon v Low Janie and others and other
                        appeals</em> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 337 (“<em>Low Peng
                        Boon</em>”). In that case, the respondent was the minority
                    shareholder of a company which was the holding company of profitable
                    subsidiaries in Malaysia and Hong Kong. She sought relief under s 216 of
                    the Companies Act, alleging amongst other things that the managing director of
                    the holding company had used the funds of the Hong Kong subsidiary to pay for
                    his personal travel expenses and had deliberately hoarded the profits of the
                    Hong Kong subsidiary (by refusing to declare dividends) so as to maximise his
                    own bonus. This court took into account the commercially unfair acts that took
                    place in respect of the affairs of the subsidiary as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Finally in <em>Lim Chee Twang v
                        Chan Shuk Kuen Helina and others</em> [2010] 2 SLR 209
                        (“<em>Lim Chee Twang</em>”), Quentin Loh
                    JC (as he was then) observed that the doctrine of separate legal personalities
                    could not to be invoked as a shield for clearly oppressive and commercially
                    unfair conduct in a group of companies, where this could lead to a serious gap
                    in the remedies available to an aggrieved minority shareholder (at [98]).
                    However, in the final analysis, the plaintiff had to be able to show, on the
                    facts, that the affairs of the subsidiary “actually affected or impacted
                    the holding company” (at [97]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     We think that the approach adopted in the
                    above cited cases is sound and we also agree that, in the final analysis, the
                    question that must be answered in this regard is whether the affairs of the
                    subsidiary affect or impact the holding company: <em>Lim Chee
                        Twang</em> at [97]. Legitimate claims for relief from oppression
                    should not be defeated by technical and legalistic objections relating to the
                    company’s shareholding structure; at the same time the doctrine of
                    separate legal personalities and the strict words of the statute (“the
                    affairs of <em>the company</em>” (emphasis added))
                    must be respected. In our view, the balance between these competing interests
                    would be properly drawn by a requirement that commercially unfair conduct in the
                    management of a subsidiary would be relevant so long and to the extent that such
                    conduct affected or impacted the holding company whose member was the party
                    claiming relief from oppression. The purpose and policy behind s 216 of the
                    Companies Act is, above all, to grant relief from the oppressive behaviour to
                    shareholders who would otherwise be unable to stop that abuse: see below at
                    [49]. If the affairs of the subsidiary do not affect or impact the holding
                    company, shareholders and members of the latter could hardly complain that their
                    interests were therefore prejudiced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Turning to the present case, Singalab
                    International had clearly been incorporated as a holding company and its
                        <em>sole</em> assets were shares in its wholly owned
                    subsidiary companies. The business of the holding company was therefore, in
                    practical terms, comprised wholly of the businesses of its subsidiaries. Thus
                    the way in which the Appellant conducted the business of the subsidiary SPL
                    would undoubtedly have impacted Singalab International. The evidence showed that
                    the parties did not intend or in fact treat Singalab International and its
                    subsidiaries as separate corporate entities. This is evinced by the
                    understanding between the various shareholders that the shareholding structure
                    in Singalab International was also to be applied to its subsidiaries and the
                    fact that the Appellant managed both Singalab International and its subsidiaries
                    (under the supervision of the Exco) (see above at [7]–[8]). Thus, we find
                    that the Judge did not err in taking into account the Appellant’s conduct
                    of the affairs of SPL, an operational arm of Singalab
                International.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The Appellant says that as a consequence of
                    the Judge’s error in taking into account the prejudicial manner in which
                    SPL’s affairs were conducted, the Appellant had been deprived of his right
                    to raise a defence or bring a counterclaim against SPL. As we have said above,
                    the first part of this proposition is erroneous; it follows that the
                    Appellant’s entire argument on this point must fail. But the second part
                    to the proposition is, in our judgment, wholly without merit as well. The
                    Appellant had been given ample opportunity to defend himself against the
                    allegations that he had acted in breach of his fiduciary duties to SPL and did
                    in fact avail himself of such opportunities. As we pointed out to Mr Lim during
                    the hearing, there was nothing to preclude the Appellant from pleading that in
                    the event he should be found to have acted oppressively or in an unfairly
                    prejudicial manner, there were amounts owing to him by SPL that ought to be set
                    off against any order made against him in favour of SPL. The Appellant was
                    clearly in the best position and had ample opportunity to put forward these
                    claims, yet he did not do so. A reasonable inference would be that there was no
                    such debt owing by SPL to the Appellant. In any event, we reiterate our
                    observation made during the hearing that if SPL were in fact a debtor of the
                    Appellant, the orders made in this proceeding would not preclude the Appellant
                    from bringing a fresh action against SPL for the sums owing to him. Plainly, the
                    Appellant has not been prejudiced in pursuing his alleged legal rights against
                    SPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The inescapable corollary to our finding at
                    [43] above that the assets of Singalab International were comprised wholly of
                    the businesses of its subsidiaries is that the effect of the Transfers was to
                    denude Singalab International of all its value and to reduce it into an empty
                    shell company. The Appellant thereby enriched himself at the expense of the
                    company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Control of Singalab International </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The second issue is whether the fact that the
                    Respondent is the majority shareholder in Singalab International would preclude
                    it from claiming relief under s 216 of the Companies Act. The Judge found that
                    it would not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     As a preliminary point, we note that the
                    Appellant does not appear to challenge this finding, but as this is a question
                    of law, we do not think we are constrained from considering this issue. The
                    Court of Appeal has broad powers to determine the real issues in the dispute
                    that is placed before it: see generally s 37 of the Supreme Court of Judicature
                    Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed). We would add that this issue of control is not a new
                    argument — the point was pleaded in the Appellant’s
                        defence<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> and the parties’ arguments on this
                    issue were fully canvassed with the relevant evidence led at the trial below. As
                    the point was not raised in the Appellant’s case, the Respondent did not
                    prepare written submissions addressing it, but in the course of the hearing
                    before us, we gave counsel for the Respondent Mr Chan an opportunity to
                    present oral submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In our judgment, the touchstone is not whether
                    the claimant is a minority shareholder of the company in question, but whether
                    he lacks the power to stop the allegedly oppressive acts. Section 216(1) of the
                    Companies Act states only that “any member…of a company”
                    may bring an action for relief under that provision; there is no further
                    requirement that only members who are minority shareholders are so entitled.
                    Having regard to the purpose underlying s 216, we think the correct position is
                    that where a member is able to remedy any prejudice or discrimination he has
                    suffered through the ordinary powers he possesses by virtue of his position, the
                    conduct of the defendant cannot be said to be unfair to him: see also the dicta
                    of Knox J in <em>Re Baltic Real Estate Ltd (No. 2)</em>
                    [1993] BCLC 503 at 507. Section 216 of the Companies Act is, save for a few
                    minor amendments, based on s 210 of the UK Companies Act 1948 (c 38) (UK)
                    (“the UK Companies Act 1948”) and s 186 of the Australian
                    Companies Act 1961 (which was also essentially identical to the English
                    provision): see clause 181 of the Companies Bill 1966, which became our
                    Companies Act (Act 42 of 1967). Section 210 of the UK Companies Act 1948 came
                    about following a recommendation made by the Cohen Committee of 1945 that the
                    position of <em>minority shareholders</em> of a private
                    company in resisting oppression by the majority shareholders or the controllers
                    of a company should be strengthened: <em>Report of the Committee
                        on Company Law Amendment</em> (Cmnd 6059, 1945) at para 60. The
                    effective protection of minorities was again emphasised in the report of the
                    Jenkins Committee some years later in respect of possible amendments to the
                    section: <em>Report of the Company Law Committee</em> (Cmnd
                    1749, 1962) (“the Jenkins Report”) at para 200. In <em>Re Legal Costs Negotiators Ltd</em> [1999] BCC 547
                        (“<em>Re Legal Costs</em>”), Gibson LJ
                    examined these English oppression provisions, which, as we have shown above, are
                    directly relevant to our s 216, and concluded that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…there is academic and judicial consensus as to the meaning of the
                        section and as to the mischief which it was intended to cure, viz. the abuse
                        of power <em>to the prejudice of shareholders who lack the
                            power to stop that abuse</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     We think this is correct in principle. It
                    would be contrary to the purpose and intent of s 216 of the Companies Act to
                    permit a shareholder to seek relief where he possesses the power to exercise
                    self-help by taking control of the company and bringing to an end the
                    prejudicial state of affairs: see <em>Re Legal Costs</em>
                    at 552. As was observed by Margaret Chew in <em>Minority
                        Shareholders’ Rights and Remedies</em> (Lexis Nexis,
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Ed, 2007) (“<em>Chew</em>”) at pp 219–220:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The pertinent issue is to ascertain whether an applicant alleging
                        oppression under section 216 of the Companies Act has control over the
                        affairs of the company, for there is good sense in saying that an applicant
                        ought to lack such control. <em>Evidently, an applicant that
                            is in control of the affairs of the company cannot convincingly allege
                            to have been oppressed…</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>While the learned author used the narrower term
                        “oppression”, in our judgment, the principle stated in the
                        emphasised portion of the passage above is one that is of general
                        applicability whenever commercial unfairness is alleged in a claim for
                        relief under s 216 (see above at [34]; see also <em>Ng Sing
                            King and others v PSA International Pte Ltd and others</em> [2005]
                        2 SLR(R) 56 at [93] and <em>Lim Swee Khiang and another v
                            Borden Co (Pte) Ltd and others</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 745 at
                        [80]–[82]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     It is always a question of fact whether in a
                    particular case a shareholder claiming relief ought to be considered to lack
                    control over the affairs of the company. In ordinary cases where the shares
                    carry equal voting rights, a majority shareholder will generally have the power
                    to end the unfairly prejudicial conduct of the company’s affairs: see
                        <em>Re Legal Costs</em> at 553. However, this might not
                    be the case where, for example, there is a separate shareholder agreement
                    amongst the shareholders which confers managerial powers solely on the minority
                    shareholder. Thus in <em>Kumagai Gumi Co Ltd v Zenecon-Kumagai
                        Sdn Bhd &amp; Ors and another application</em> [1994] 2 MLJ 789 the
                    Malaysian High Court held that a claim for relief from oppression was (at p
                    808):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… available to majority shareholders who are not in control of the
                        management of the company and who, for any given reason, are unable to
                        control the board, <em>eg</em> because they have agreed
                        to a management power sharing formula in a separate agreement among the
                        shareholders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The position may differ where the company has
                    issued shares of different classes, some of which may carry voting rights and
                    some of which may not. For instance, in the case of <em>In re HR
                        Harmer Ltd</em> [1959] 1 WLR 62 (“<em>Harmer</em>”), the father and patriarch of the company, along
                    with his wife, controlled a preponderance of the class “B” shares,
                    which carried all the voting power, but only a minority of the class
                    “A” shares, which carried the right to divisible profits but no
                    voting power. Jenkins LJ held that the sons, who had the majority of the class
                    “A” shares, were not thereby barred from claiming relief from
                    their father’s oppressive behaviour. His Lordship also rejected the
                    father’s contention that the acts complained of might have been restrained
                    by an injunction, in so far as they were acts done without the authority of the
                    board. Having found that the father was in control of the company and that his
                    conduct amounted to oppression of the other shareholders, Jenkins LJ considered
                    that it did not lie in the mouth of the controlling party <em>ie</em>, the father, to argue that other causes of action were also
                    available to the oppressed parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The Judge cited <em>Chew</em> at p 219–220 (see [99] of the Judgment), which
                    passage relied on <em>Harmer</em>, as authority for the
                    proposition that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… majority shareholders cannot be considered to have
                        effective management control by the mere fact of being in the majority. In
                        particular, where wrongdoing by directors is concerned, it ought not to be a
                        defence by the wrongdoing directors that their wrongdoing could have been
                        restrained by injunction or addressed by an action for breach of duty by the
                        company, because by virtue of being the majority shareholders, the majority
                        could have moved the company to take action against the directors. Such an
                        argument by counsel for the wrongdoer in <em>Re H R Harmer
                            Ltd</em> was not well received by Jenkins LJ who said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[C]ounsel for the father said that the acts complained of might have
                            been restrained by injunction so far as they were acts done without the
                            authority of the board. As to this, I do not think that a wrongdoer in
                            this field can well complain that the person wronged might have chosen
                            another remedy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Applying this principle, the Judge found that
                    the fact that the Respondent had majority control of Singalab International
                    could not be held against it in a claim for relief under s 216.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     We disagree. In our judgment, this passage in
                        <em>Chew</em> and the construction placed on it by the
                    Judge are incorrect and clearly run counter to the intent and purpose of s 216
                    of the Companies Act. On the authority of <em>Harmer</em>,
                    it will not lie in the mouth of a defendant who is in control of the company
                        <em>and</em> who has been found guilty of oppressive
                    conduct to say that the claimant ought to have taken other remedies that might
                    have been available to him. But if, on the facts, the claimant was entitled, for
                    instance, to change the board of directors or otherwise to take control of the
                    company, then such a claimant would <em>not</em> be
                    entitled to relief under s 216. In such a case, the defendant <em>may</em> legitimately claim that the claimant ought to have exercised
                    his right to take control of the company instead of coming to court for relief
                    under s 216.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     That, in our view, is the crux of the present
                    case, and in our judgment, the fact that the Respondent has the majority voting
                    power and was able to use it to take control of the company disentitles it from
                    claiming relief under s 216. The Judge was correct in observing that as managing
                    director of Singalab International, the Appellant had effective day-to-day
                    control over the company. This, however, should not have been the end of the
                    analysis. As the Judge noted, the Respondent, being the majority shareholder of
                    Singalab International, could have voted its representatives onto its board of
                    directors and <em>did in fact do so after the commencement of the
                        Suit</em> (see above at [21]). Once it had effective control of the
                    Board and the affairs of Singalab International in its hands, it could have
                    removed the Appellant from the Board, or caused the company to claim against the
                    Appellant for the assets which had been improperly siphoned away.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     We note also that there is nothing in the
                    Memorandum or Articles of Association of Singalab International conferring
                    special powers of control on the Appellant as Managing Director or precluding
                    the participation of the Respondent in the Board. Table A of the
                        4<sup>th</sup> Schedule to the Companies Act was adopted
                    wholesale in the company’s constitutional documents.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> Under cross-examination, Mr Lim KE conceded
                    that the Respondent, by virtue of its position as majority shareholder, had
                    voting control of Singalab International and that it could have removed the
                    Appellant as a director of the company at any time, notwithstanding their
                    conscious decision to give the Appellant day-to-day control of the
                        company.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Apart from the formal arrangements evidenced
                    by the Articles and Memorandum of Singalab International, the Judge also found
                    that there was an understanding between the parties that the Appellant was to
                    run and manage Singalab International although he was to report to the Exco.
                    Whilst we concur with this finding, we do not think that this understanding had
                    the effect of precluding the Respondent from participating in the Board of
                    Singalab International. Apart from Mr Lim KE’s own evidence above at [56],
                    Mr Ng HK had been appointed as a director of the Singalab International from 1
                    September 2004 to 30 June 2005, which was <em>after</em>
                    the Exco had been formed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     To Mr Chan’s credit, he conceded at the
                    hearing before us that with the benefit of hindsight, the Respondent could have
                    commenced proceedings for a different kind of relief. We note in this regard
                    that Mr Chan and his firm were not involved in the trial below. He submitted,
                    however, that the issue of whether the Respondent had control over the company
                    was a “technicality” that did not cause any prejudice to the
                    Appellant. With respect, this submission was misconceived. The requirement that
                    the shareholder (here the Respondent) claiming relief under s 216 must be
                    otherwise powerless to change its fate by taking control of the company is a
                    substantive one that goes to the very heart of the s 216 process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     For the foregoing reasons, we find that the
                    Judge erred in holding that the Respondent had successfully made out its claim
                    under s 216 of the Companies Act. This finding would suffice to dispose of the
                    appeal. However, we would like to discuss briefly a further issue raised by the
                    Appellant which may be of general interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The distinction between wrong done to the company and a personal
                wrong suffered by a shareholder</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The Appellant submits that the wrongs alleged
                    here are wrongs done to Singalab International, <em>viz</em> its subsidiaries, and not a wrong suffered by the Respondent
                    in its <em>personal</em> capacity as a member of Singalab
                    International. He argues therefore that the Respondent should not be allowed to
                    use s 216 of the Companies Act to circumvent the proper plaintiff rule and
                    reflective loss principle and that a derivative action should have been pursued
                    by the Respondent instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The proper plaintiff rule in <em>Foss v Harbottle</em> (1843) 2 Hare 461 (“<em>Foss</em>”) provides that in an action for a wrong
                    alleged to have been done to a company (<em>ie</em> a
                    corporate wrong) the proper plaintiff is <em>prima
                        facie</em> the company itself. The reflective loss principle is a
                    variant of the proper plaintiff rule: <em>Townsing Henry George v
                        Jenton Overseas Investment Pte Ltd (in liquidation)</em> [2007] 2
                    SLR(R) 597 at [78]. Where the shareholder’s loss merely reflects the
                    company’s loss that would be made good if the company had enforced its
                    full rights, the proper party to recover the reflective loss is the company and
                    not the shareholder: <em>Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co (a
                        firm)</em> [2002] 2 AC 1 (“<em>Johnson</em>”), <em>per</em> Lord Bingham
                    at 35. Section 216 of the Companies Act, however, provides for a remedy for a
                    wrong suffered in the member’s <em>personal</em>
                    capacity. The individual member sues <em>in his own
                        right</em> to protect his interests as a member of the company: see
                        <em>Edwards v Halliwell</em> [1950] 2 All ER 1064.
                    Thus, s 216 of the Companies Act is not a true exception to the proper plaintiff
                    rule but rather a situation where the proper plaintiff rule does not apply: see
                    Tan Cheng Han ed, <em>Walter Woon on Company Law</em>
                        (3<sup>rd</sup> ed, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2005)
                        (“<em>Woon</em>”) (at paras
                    9.25–9.26).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In reality, the distinction between personal
                    and corporate wrongs is rarely clear. The lack of clarity is compounded in the
                    context of s 216 of the Companies Act because the concept of commercial
                    unfairness also appears to embrace wrongs done to the company. In this regard,
                    we think it pertinent to note that s 216(1)(<em>a</em>) of
                    the Companies Act is drafted in terms of the claimants’ “interests
                    as members, shareholders…” It is plain to us that a wrong done to
                    the company may affect the interests of its members. The Jenkins Report clearly
                    recognised this (at para 206):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In addition to these direct wrongs to the minority, there is the type of
                        case in which a wrong is done to the company itself and the control vested
                        in the majority is wrongfully used to prevent action being taken against the
                        wrongdoer. In such a case the minority is indirectly wronged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Thus, whilst not all complaints of oppression
                    will involve wrongs against the company, it is not uncommon to find a petition
                    founded upon facts which also disclose a concurrent wrong against the company,
                    which would usually be a breach of director’s duties. For example, in
                        <em>Kumagai</em>, the defendant’s breach of his
                    director’s duties to the said company was found also to amount to
                    oppressive conduct as against the claimant. In <em>Low Peng
                        Boon</em>, the factual allegations made to support the
                    claimant’s petition disclosed various breaches of director’s duties
                    mainly involving the misuse of corporate funds; these acts were found to
                    constitute oppressive conduct as against the petitioner. That being said, we
                    emphasise that this is quite separate and distinct from permitting s 216 of the
                    Companies Act to be used to vindicate essentially corporate
                wrongs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     We do not think the latter should be
                    permitted, for two broad reasons. First, an overly permissive interpretation of
                    s 216 of the Companies Act would run counter to our present legislative scheme
                    which provides for the commencement of a statutory derivative action pursuant to
                    s 216A of the Companies Act. In “A Reconsideration of the
                    Shareholder’s Remedy for Oppression in Singapore” (2013) CLWR 42 1
                    (61), Associate Professor Pearlie MC Koh observes that when the Companies Act
                    was amended to include s 216A, the marginal note to s 216 which then read
                    “Remedies in cases of oppression or injustice” was amended to read
                        “<em>Personal</em> remedies in cases of
                    oppression or injustice”. We agree with her that this was indicative of
                    the legislative intention to clarify the distinction between the action for
                        <em>personal</em> relief under s 216 of the Companies
                    Act and the action for <em>corporate</em> relief under s
                    216A of the Companies Act. The distinction between the two is further
                    highlighted by the inclusion of s 216(2)(<em>c</em>) of the
                    Companies Act which provides that the court may, as a remedy in a <em>personal</em> action, “authorise civil proceedings to
                    be brought in the name of or on behalf of the company by such person or persons
                    and on such terms as the Court may direct”, <em>ie</em>, a derivative action. Were it permissible for s 216 of the
                    Companies Act to be used to vindicate essentially corporate claims, s
                        216(2)(<em>c</em>) of the Companies Act would be
                    rendered nugatory. It is further pertinent to note that there are standing
                    requirements under s 216A(3) of the Companies Act that must be satisfied before
                    a complainant can apply to court for leave to commence a statutory derivative
                    action. These requirements are important built-in safeguards that ensure that
                    any litigation brought by a shareholder to pursue corporate claims is guided by
                    the legitimate interests of the company and would result in an increase in the
                    corporate value. In our judgment, Parliament could not have intended for
                    shareholders to sidestep these requirements by characterising a claim for
                    corporate relief as a personal claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Further, and related to the above, allowing an
                    essentially corporate claim to be pursued under s 216 of the Companies Act would
                    be an abuse of process as it amounts to an improper circumvention of the proper
                    plaintiff principle which, far from being a legalistic procedural obstacle, is
                    the consequence of the fundamental doctrine of separation of legal personality
                    that underpins company law. Where a wrong has been done to the company, the
                    interests of other shareholders of the company as well as the company’s
                    creditors will have been similarly affected. The claimant shareholder should not
                    be allowed to proceed by way of a <em>personal</em> action
                    and recover at the expense of these other similarly affected parties. Related to
                    this is the danger that defendant may face a multiplicity of suits from
                    different claimants for essentially the same wrong done to the company. This is
                    evidently problematic and economically inefficient.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Where then should the court draw the line? We
                    acknowledge that there will always be grey areas that do not lend themselves to
                    easy categorisation. Much will depend on the facts of each case and we do not
                    think it useful to formulate a fast and hard rule. Nevertheless, we think it may
                    be of some assistance to set out an analytical framework.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In the English case of <em>Re
                        Charnley Davies Ltd (No 2)</em> [1990] BCLC 760 (“<em>Charnley</em>”), Millett J (as he then was)
                    perceptively articulated the distinction between unlawful conduct and conduct
                    that is unfairly prejudicial (their equivalent to our notion of commercial
                    unfairness) to the petitioner’s interest (at 783):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An allegation that the acts complained of are unlawful or infringe the
                        petitioner's legal rights is not a necessary averment in a s 27 petition
                        [the equivalent of our s 216]. In my judgment it is not a sufficient
                        averment either. The petitioner must allege and prove that they are evidence
                        or instances of the management of the company’s affairs by the
                        administrator in a manner which is unfairly prejudicial <em>to the petitioner's interests</em>. Unlawful conduct may be
                        relied on for this purpose, and its unlawfulness may have a significant
                        probative value, but it is not the essential factor on which the
                        petitioner's cause of action depends. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     At 784, Millet J further discussed the
                    application of this principle to the issue of distinguishing between an action
                    for relief from oppression and a derivative action:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The very same facts may well found either a derivative action or a s 459
                        petition [<em>ie</em> equivalent to our s 216]. But
                        that should not disguise the fact that the nature of the complaint and the
                        appropriate relief is different in the two cases. Had the petitioners’
                        true complaint been of the unlawfulness of the respondent's conduct, so that
                        it would be met by an order for restitution, then a derivative action would
                        have been appropriate and a s 459 petition would not. But that was not the
                        true nature of the petitioners’ complaint. They did not rely on the
                        unlawfulness of the respondent's conduct to found their cause of action; and
                        they would not have been content with an order that the respondent make
                        restitution to the company. They relied on the respondent’s unlawful
                        conduct as evidence of the manner in which he had conducted the company's
                        affairs for his own benefit and <em>in disregard of their
                            interests as minority shareholders</em>; and they wanted to be
                        bought out. They wanted relief from mismanagement, not a remedy for
                        misconduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Hence, an action for s 216 is appropriately
                    brought where the complainant is relying on the unlawfulness of the
                    wrongdoer’s conduct as <em>evidence</em> of the
                    manner in which the wrongdoer had conducted the company’s affairs in
                    disregard of the complainant’s interest as a minority shareholder and
                    where the complaint cannot be adequately addressed by the remedy provided by law
                    for that wrong. We agree with these views.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     We turn next to a Canadian case, <em>Pappan v Acan Windows Inc</em> (1991) 2 BLR (2d) 180. There,
                    the Newfoundland Supreme Court adopted the following analytical framework set
                    out in Michael St P Baxter “The Derivative Action under the Ontario
                    Business Corporations Act: A Review of Section 97” (1982) 27 McGill LJ
                    453 at p 457 to determine whether the complaint was of an essentially personal
                    nature:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The concept of incidental injury serves a useful purpose in the resolution
                        of the threshold question of whether the action is personal or derivative.
                        The answer involves two considerations. <em>First, is the
                            individual’s injury distinct from the corporation’s injury
                            in that it does not occur simply because the corporate injury exists?
                            Second, is the individual’s injury in an area where the
                            shareholders by their own representative actions are exercising a power
                            in bad faith, or the directors are abusing a duty owed to the minority
                            shareholders different from that owed to the
                        corporation?</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the answer to either consideration is affirmative, then a personal
                        cause of action will exist. Admittedly, there may, in some circumstances,
                        still be uncertainty as to the nature of the cause of action.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The suggestion in this passage, which is similar to that set
                        out by Millett J in <em>Charnley</em> (see above at
                        [67]), is that in order to succeed in a minority oppression action, the
                        minority shareholder has to show something more than the unlawfulness of the
                        defendant’s conduct and further that the shareholder’s injury
                        does not merely reflect that suffered by the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In the instant case, the Respondent’s
                    complaint was premised on three wrongs it alleged was committed by the
                    Appellant, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_a"></a>(a)     the illegal
                    Transfers;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        mismanagement of SPL’s accounts and moneys; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_71-p2_c"></a>(c)     the diversion of SPL’s business,
                        assets and talents to the Appellant’s own company, Beans
                    Group.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>We observe that these appear to be
                        corporate wrongs that could have been pursued by the Respondent by way of a
                        derivative action under s 216A of the Companies Act and the Respondent was,
                        in essence, seeking restitution of the amounts thereby siphoned off by the
                        Appellant from Singalab International. However, given that we have already
                        disposed of the appeal on another ground, there is no need for us to come to
                        a firm landing on this issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     For the reasons we have given at
                    [55]–[59] above, we allow the appeal and set aside the orders made by the
                    Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     On the question of costs, we depart from the
                    general principle that costs should follow the event, as we are well entitled to
                    do: see O 59 r 3(2) of the ROC and <em>Tullio Planeta v Maoro
                        Andrea G</em> [1994] 2 SLR(R) 501. In our judgment it is appropriate
                    to take into consideration the matters leading up to the present litigation that
                    in the circumstances of the case some other order should be made: <em>Ho Kon Kim v Lim Gek Kim Betsy and others and another
                        appeal</em> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 253 at [12]. In this regard, it is
                    apparent to us that the Appellant’s conduct was clearly dishonest and
                    reprehensible. In <em>Lee Seng Choon Ronnie v Singapore Island
                        Country Club</em> [1993] 1 SLR(R) 557, although the appellant
                    succeeded in his appeal and obtained the declaration he sought pertaining to the
                    retention of his club membership, the court nevertheless deprived him of the
                    costs of the appeal and the hearing below to record their disapprobation of his
                    conduct. The court observed that the appellant’s conduct was
                    “really inexcusable and show a cavalier attitude and disregard of the
                    club’s rules” (at [31]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     In the present case, we have no doubt that in
                    wantonly stripping Singalab International of its assets to enrich himself the
                    Appellant had breached almost every conceivable duty of fidelity to the
                    companies in question. We note also that the Judge below had awarded the
                    Respondent its disbursements on an indemnity basis due to the Appellant’s
                    “disregard for his disclosure obligations and his unreasonable and
                    dishonest conduct of his defence” (at [109] of the Judgment). In the
                    premises, we are of the view that the Appellant should not have his costs and we
                    therefore make no order as to costs here and below.</p>
