<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The appellant, Tang Hai Liang (“the
                    Appellant”), a 33-year-old Singaporean, was convicted in the High Court
                    of one charge of trafficking in a controlled drug and sentenced to the mandatory
                    death sentence under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185,
                    2008 Rev Ed) (“the Act”). The charge against him (“the
                    Charge”) stated that at the material time, he had 136 packets of granular
                    substance containing not less than 89.55g of diamorphine (a controlled drug
                    specified in Class A of the First Schedule to the Act) in his possession
                    for the purpose of trafficking, and that he had thereby committed the offence of
                    trafficking under s 5(1)(<em>a</em>) read with
                    s 5(2) of the Act.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Appellant appealed to this court against his
                    conviction and sentence. The main ground of appeal stated in the
                    Appellant’s petition of appeal dated 7 March 2011 was that the trial
                    judge (“the Judge”), whose grounds of decision are set out in
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Tang Hai Liang</em> [2011] SGHC
                    1 (“the High Court GD”), had misdirected his mind when he applied
                    the presumptions in ss 17(<em>c</em>) and 18(2) of the
                    Act (“the ss 17(<em>c</em>) and 18(2)
                    presumptions”) conjunctively and, thus, the Appellant’s conviction
                    was, in the circumstances, flawed. However, at the hearing of the appeal,
                    counsel for the Appellant stated that although the Judge had made a fundamental
                    error in his application of the ss 17(<em>c</em>) and
                    18(2) presumptions, he (counsel for the Appellant) had to concede on the
                    evidence that there was, nevertheless, no miscarriage of justice and that the
                    Appellant’s conviction ought to stand. This was because the Judge had
                    expressly stated that even without the aid of any of the presumptions in
                    ss 17 and 18 of the Act, there was ample evidence to prove that the
                    Appellant: (a) was in possession of the 136 packets of granular substance
                    referred to in the Charge (“the 136 Packets”); (b) knew the
                    nature of the granular substance in those packets; and (c) intended to sell
                    the granular substance. Counsel for the Appellant further confirmed that he made
                    this submission with the Appellant’s consent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       We appreciated the candour of counsel for the
                    Appellant. On our part, we had examined the High Court GD and the evidence
                    before the Judge, and were satisfied that the evidence was clear as to the
                    Appellant’s: (a) possession of the diamorphine contained in the 136
                    Packets; (b) knowledge of the diamorphine; and (c) intention to
                    traffic in the diamorphine. Thus, even without the aforesaid concession by the
                    Appellant’s counsel, we would have dismissed this appeal because there was
                    sufficient evidence to sustain the Appellant’s conviction beyond a
                    reasonable doubt. These grounds of decision are issued primarily to clarify some
                    parts of the High Court GD in so far as they relate to the application of the
                        ss 17(<em>c</em>) and 18(2) presumptions.
                    Specifically, we will address the issue of whether the Judge erred in his
                    application of these presumptions (“Issue 1”). For
                    completeness, we will also examine whether the Judge was right in finding that
                    the Prosecution had proved the Charge against the Appellant beyond a reasonable
                    doubt (“Issue 2”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       We should, at this juncture, explain that
                    “diamorphine” is also otherwise known as “heroin”,
                    and the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) officers involved in the
                    present case used the two terms interchangeably. We will do the same in these
                    grounds of decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Appellant’s arrest</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Judge accepted (at [2] of the High Court GD) that the
                    Prosecution’s closing submissions accurately encapsulated the facts
                    surrounding the Appellant’s arrest on 15 April 2009. Those facts were
                    not disputed because the testimonies of the CNB officers regarding the
                    circumstances of the Appellant’s arrest as well as the seizure of the 136
                    Packets and other drug paraphernalia from the Appellant’s residence were
                    not challenged by the Appellant at the trial. The Appellant elected to remain
                    silent at the close of the Prosecution’s case and did not call any
                    evidence in his defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The facts surrounding the Appellant’s
                    arrest are as follows. On 15 April 2009, at or about 1.05pm, a party of CNB
                    officers, acting on information received, set out on an operation that led to
                    the arrest of the Appellant and one Lim Kee Wan. The party of CNB officers
                    comprised:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Upon his arrest, the Appellant was searched by
                    SSgt Ong, who found five blue tablets (believed to be Dormicum) and one
                    bunch of keys on him. The Appellant was thereafter escorted by some of the
                    aforesaid CNB officers (namely, ASP Teng, Insp Eugene Tan,
                    W/SSgt Khoo, Sgt See, Sgt Derek, SSgt Desmond Tan and
                    SSgt Ong (collectively, “the Raid Party”)) to his residence
                    at Block 133 Lorong Ah Soo, #02-428 (“the Flat”). The Raid
                    Party gained access to the Flat by using one of the keys in the bunch of keys
                    found on the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The drugs found in the Flat</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Appellant’s bedroom</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Having entered the Flat, the Appellant, as
                    requested, led the Raid Party to his bedroom (“the Bedroom”). In
                    the presence of the Appellant, Sgt Derek searched the air-conditioner in
                    the Bedroom and found (<em>inter alia</em>): (a) one
                    Ziploc bag containing two packets of granular substance believed to be heroin;
                    (b) one Ziploc bag containing five packets of granular substance believed
                    to be heroin; and (c) one digital weighing scale.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Upon being
                    queried by Sgt Derek, the Appellant confirmed in Mandarin that the items
                    were his.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>
                    Sgt Derek then handed the items over to SSSgt Heng for safekeeping and
                    informed ASP Teng of what he had found.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The kitchen</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Shortly after, the Appellant was brought into
                    the kitchen of the Flat (“the Kitchen”). ASP Teng searched
                    the Kitchen in the presence of the Appellant and recovered a vacuum cleaner
                    stored in a kitchen cabinet.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> In
                    the vacuum cleaner, five big packets, each containing 20 smaller packets of
                    granular substance, and one big packet containing 19 smaller packets of granular
                    substance were found.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     At this point, SSgt Ong entered the
                    Kitchen and ASP Teng instructed him to take over the duty of escorting the
                    Appellant in the Kitchen.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> SSgt Ong then
                    asked the Appellant if he had anything else to surrender.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> After thinking for
                    a while, the Appellant told SSgt Ong that there was another packet and
                    pointed to the cooker hood in the Kitchen. SSgt Ong searched the cooker
                    hood and a packet fell onto the kitchen stove.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> This
                    packet contained ten smaller packets of granular substance.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In total, 136 packets of granular substance
                    suspected to contain heroin (<em>ie</em>, the 136 Packets
                    defined at <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above) were found in the Flat.
                    The 136 Packets were safeguarded by SSSgt Heng. At 4.10pm, the
                    investigation officer, Inspector Aaron Tang Zhixiong
                    (“I/O Aaron Tang”), assisted by Inspector Chee Tuck Seng
                    and Senior Staff Sergeant Stanley Tan Beng Guan (“SSSgt Stanley
                    Tan”), arrived at the Flat. SSSgt Heng handed the 136 Packets to
                    SSSgt Stanley Tan, who in turn safeguarded them until he handed them to
                    I/O Aaron Tang at the Police Cantonment Complex (“PCC”) at
                    about 7.25pm. At about 8.15pm, the Appellant was brought to the PCC Exhibit
                    Management Room. The 136 Packets were weighed in the Appellant’s presence
                    and then placed in a safe.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The analysis results from the Health Sciences Authority</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     All the 136 Packets were sent to the Health
                    Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis. Analyst Lim Jong Lee
                    Wendy (“Analyst Lim”) conducted the analysis and reported
                    (via a series of nine certificates issued under s 16 of the Act
                    (“Analyst Lim’s s 16 certificates”))<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> that the 136 Packets contained
                    not less than 89.55g of diamorphine (as reflected in the Charge). At the trial,
                    the Appellant did not contest the findings set out in Analyst Lim’s
                    s 16 certificates. Also adduced in evidence at the trial was another
                    certificate issued by Analyst Lim under s 16 of the Act stating that
                    the digital weighing scale found in the air-conditioner of the Bedroom was
                    stained with diamorphine.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     A blood sample taken from the Appellant and
                    various items seized from the Flat, including the 136 Packets, were sent for DNA
                    testing. Some of the items were found to contain the Appellant’s DNA, in
                    particular: (a) the Ziploc bag containing Exhibit P162 (one of the
                    five big packets, each containing 20 smaller packets of granular substance,
                    recovered from the vacuum cleaner in the Kitchen (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above)); (b) the grill of the cooker hood where
                    Exhibit P164 (the packet containing ten smaller packets of granular
                    substance mentioned at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above) was
                    hidden; and (c) the paper bag which contained Exhibits P77 and P78
                    (the two Ziploc bags found in the air-conditioner of the Bedroom (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above)).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> For
                    completeness, we ought to mention that the DNA tests carried out by HSA could
                    not confirm the presence of the Appellant’s DNA in many of the items
                    tested. However, in re-examination, Dr Christopher K C Syn
                    (“Dr Syn”), a senior forensic scientist at HSA, testified
                    that the lack of the Appellant’s DNA in those items was not conclusive
                    evidence that the Appellant did not have contact with those items.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Appellant’s statements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In total, six statements were taken from the
                    Appellant after his arrest. There was one relatively contemporaneous statement
                    taken by a CNB officer (<em>viz</em>, Insp Eugene Tan)
                    on the day of the arrest (<em>viz</em>, on 15 April
                    2009) itself. The other five statements were taken by I/O Aaron Tang
                    between 16 April 2009 and 30 October 2009. Of those five statements,
                    one was a “cautioned” statement recorded under s 122(6) of
                    the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the
                    CPC”), while the other four were what we will term “s 121(1)
                    long statements” (<em>ie</em>, statements recorded
                    under s 121(1) of the CPC). The table below tabulates the chronology of the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Having set out the material facts, we now turn
                    to discuss the two issues outlined at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a>
                    above, beginning with Issue 1 (<em>viz</em>, whether
                    the Judge erred in his application of the ss 17(<em>c</em>) and 18(2) presumptions).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 1: Did the Judge apply the ss 17(<em>c</em>) and 18(2) presumptions wrongly?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Appellant’s argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Appellant argued that the Judge, in coming
                    to his finding of guilt, applied the ss 17(<em>c</em>)
                    and 18(2) presumptions conjunctively and, thus, wrongly. Hence, the
                    Appellant’s conviction was improper in the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The relevant provisions of the Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The relevant parts of ss 17 and 18 of the
                    Act for the purposes of the present appeal read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">

<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Presumption of possession and
                            knowledge of controlled drugs</b>
</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">shall, unless the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that drug in
                        his possession.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Under s 17(<em>c</em>) of the Act, when a
                    person is proved to have had in his possession more than 2g of diamorphine, he
                    is presumed to have had that drug in his possession for the purpose of
                    trafficking unless he proves that his possession of the drug was not for that
                    purpose. Under s 18(2) of the Act, a person who is proved or presumed to
                    have had a controlled drug in his possession is presumed to have known the
                    nature of the drug unless the contrary is proved.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law on the constraints in applying the ss 17(c) and 18(2)
                presumptions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Appellant is correct to contend that
                        <em>in law</em>, the ss 17(<em>c</em>) and 18(2) presumptions <em>cannot</em>
                    be applied conjunctively. The position regarding the relationship between these
                    two presumptions was decisively and clearly stated by this court in <em>Mohd Halmi bin Hamid and another v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [2006] 1 SLR(R) 548 (“<em>Mohd
                    Halmi</em>”) at [8] (in
                    relation to ss 17 and 18 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185,
                    2001 Rev Ed) (“the 2001 MDA”), which are <em>in pari materia</em> with ss 17 and 18 of the Act) as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>The presumption in s 17 applies only in
                            situations where a person is, in the words of this court in</em></b>
                        Lim Lye Huat Benny v PP<b><em> [1995] 3 SLR(R) 689,
                            “proved” to be in possession of controlled drugs, but
                            apart from mere possession, had not done any of the acts constituting
                            trafficking as set out in s 2</em></b>. <em>It is
                            contrary to the principles of statutory interpretation, and even more
                            so, the interpretation of a criminal statute, especially one in which
                            the death penalty is involved, to combine presumptions from two sections
                            in an Act each serving a different function</em> – in this
                        case, shifting the burden of proof in one with regard to possession and the
                        other, in regard to trafficking. Possession and trafficking are distinct
                        offences under the [2001 MDA], although possession may lead to the more
                        serious charge of trafficking, while … trafficking itself might
                        conceivably be committed without actual possession. <em>The
                            danger of mixing the s 17 and s 18 presumptions was
                            anticipated by this court in some of its previous decisions which were
                            not brought to the attention of the trial judge below</em> because
                        this was not an issue before him. The decision of this court in <em>Lim Lye Huat Benny v PP</em> expressed the view that
                            <b><em>for the s 17 presumption to apply, it must
                            first be proved that the accused knew that he was in possession of the
                            drugs</em></b>. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Court of Appeal further stressed at
                        [10] of <em>Mohd
                        Halmi</em> that the presumption in s 17 of the 2001 MDA (the then
                    equivalent of s 17 of the Act):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… must be read strictly. It is a provision to facilitate the
                        application of s 5(2), whereas s 18 concern[s] presumptions in
                        respect of the possession of controlled drugs, which (possession) is another
                        principal (though not capital) offence under the [2001 MDA]. <em>The Legislature would have made it clear had it wanted
                            s 5(2) to be further reinforced by means of s 18(2). In the
                            absence of such an express intention, we think it best to keep the
                            presumptions under s 18 separate from that in s 17, as has
                            always been the case</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Therefore, to convict an accused of a charge of trafficking by
                    possessing a controlled drug for the purpose of trafficking (<em>ie</em>, a charge of trafficking under s 5(1)(<em>a</em>) read with s 5(2) of the Act), a trial judge can only
                    apply either the presumption under s 17(<em>c</em>) of
                    the Act (“the s 17(<em>c</em>)
                    presumption”) or the presumptions under s 18 thereof, but not both.
                    If the presumption under s 18(2) of the Act of knowledge of the nature of a
                    controlled drug (“the s 18(2) presumption”) is to be applied,
                    there must first be evidence sufficient to prove trafficking in the controlled
                    drug in question on the part of the accused within the meaning of s 2 of
                    the Act. Alternatively, if the presumption of trafficking under s 17 is to
                    be applied, there must first be evidence sufficient to <em>prove
                        possession and knowledge</em> on the part of the accused without
                    having to rely on the presumptions in, respectively, s 18(1) (<em>vis-à-vis</em> possession) and s 18(2) (<em>vis-à-vis</em> knowledge).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Assessment of the Judge’s approach</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Regarding the s 18(2) presumption, the
                    Judge stated at [8] of the High Court
                    GD:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There was no question that the [Appellant] was in possession of the
                        packets of drugs seized. <em>Pursuant to s 18(2) of the
                            [Act], the presumption therefore arose that he knew the nature of the
                            drug. In any event, the [Appellant] clearly knew the nature of the
                            controlled drug he was in possession of</em>. The [Appellant] had
                        admitted that the packets contained heroin when questioned by the CNB
                        officers. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Furthermore, regarding the s 17(<em>c</em>) presumption, the Judge held at [9] of the High Court GD:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As the packets seized [from the Flat] were found to contain far more than
                        2 grams of diamorphine, <em>the presumption under
                            s 17(c) of the [Act] would also arise</em> that the
                        [Appellant] had the drug in his possession for the purposes of trafficking
                        …
                        <em>Even in the absence of the presumption, I would find that
                            the [Appellant] was trafficking in diamorphine within the meaning of
                            s 2 of the [Act]</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In the above two passages of the High Court
                    GD, the Judge alluded to the ss 17(<em>c</em>) and
                    18(2) presumptions. But, he did not explicitly state that the two presumptions
                    were not to be applied conjunctively. This omission was the sole basis upon
                    which the Appellant sought to argue that the Judge erred in his application of
                    those two presumptions and, accordingly, the conviction recorded against the
                    Appellant was unsafe. While we recognised that the Judge could have been clearer
                    in his treatment of the ss 17(<em>c</em>) and 18(2)
                    presumptions, we were satisfied, reading the two aforesaid passages of the High
                    Court GD in their proper context, that the Judge <em>did
                        not</em> in fact rely on either the s 17(<em>c</em>) presumption or the s 18(2) presumption in finding the
                    Appellant guilty of the Charge. It would be noted that at [8] of the High Court GD, the Judge, after
                    alluding to s 18(2) of the Act, stated that “<em>[i]n
                        any event</em>, the [Appellant] clearly knew the nature of the
                    controlled drug he was in possession of” [emphasis added]. Similarly, at
                        [9] of the High Court GD, the Judge,
                    after referring to s 17(<em>c</em>) of the Act read
                    with s 2, stated that “<em>[e]ven in the absence of
                        the [s 17(</em>c<em>)] presumption</em>,
                    [he] would find that the [Appellant] was trafficking in diamorphine within the
                    meaning of s 2” [emphasis added]. Thereafter, the Judge referred to
                    various statements of the Appellant to show that the latter had intended to sell
                    the diamorphine found in his possession. All things considered, what the High
                    Court GD showed was that the Judge only recognised the applicability of the
                        ss 17(<em>c</em>) and 18(2) presumptions, but did
                    not actually apply them in convicting the Appellant of the Charge. From the High
                    Court GD, it was obvious to us that the Judge clearly found that the evidence
                    before him was strong enough to prove –
                    <em>without reliance on either the
                        s 17(</em>c<em>) presumption or the s 18(2)
                        presumption</em> – both the fact that the Appellant knew the
                    nature of the controlled drug in his possession, as well as the fact that the
                    Appellant intended to traffic in that drug within the meaning of s 2 of the
                    Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     By way of comparison, we would refer to the
                    case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Teo Yeow Chuah</em>
                    [2003] SGHC 306 (“<em>Teo Yeow
                    Chuah</em>”), where the trial judge dealt with the then equivalent
                    of ss 17 and 18 of the Act in this manner (at [152]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the circumstances, I found that <em>the accused had
                            failed to discharge the presumption under s 18 [of the 2001 MDA],
                            and the consequent presumption under s 17 applied</em>. I add
                        that, in my view, the prosecution would have proved its case beyond a
                        reasonable doubt even without the aid of the presumptions in the light of
                        the overwhelming evidence against the accused. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Unlike the present case, it is clear that in <em>Teo
                        Yeow Chuah</em>, the trial judge erroneously applied the then
                    equivalent of the ss 17(<em>c</em>) and 18(2)
                    presumptions conjunctively. Notwithstanding that error, this court, on hearing
                    the appeal against the trial judge’s decision, dismissed the appeal as
                    there was overwhelming evidence to conclude that the accused was in possession
                    of the drugs in question for the purpose of trafficking in them (see <em>Teo Yeow Chuah v Public Prosecutor</em> [2004]
                    2 SLR(R) 563 at [34]–[36]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     From our examination of the High Court GD, we
                    were satisfied that the Judge was conscious that he could not apply the
                        s 17(<em>c</em>) presumption in conjunction with
                    the s 18(2) presumption. Given that the Judge did not have to rely on
                    either of these presumptions at all, he might have thought it unnecessary to say
                    more. In this regard, this case illustrates the need for a trial judge to be
                    more explicit when he discusses the operation of ss 17(<em>c</em>) and 18(2) of the Act. We are of the view that in order to
                    avoid the unnecessary controversies which arose in the instant case, it would be
                    advisable for a trial judge, in discussing the ss 17(<em>c</em>) and 18(2) presumptions in his written judgment or grounds of
                    decision, to expressly refer to the principle established in <em>Mohd Halmi</em> that these two presumptions are not to be applied
                    conjunctively, or to at least use words to indicate that he is conscious of that
                    principle.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 2: Was the Judge correct in finding that the Prosecution
                had proved the Charge against the Appellant beyond a reasonable doubt?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     We now turn to Issue 2, <em>viz</em>, whether the Judge was right in finding that the
                    Prosecution had proved the Charge against the Appellant beyond a reasonable
                    doubt. For this question to be answered in the affirmative, the Prosecution must
                    have proved beyond a reasonable doubt the three main elements of the offence set
                    out in the Charge, namely: (a) the Appellant’s possession of the
                    diamorphine recovered from the Flat; (b) the Appellant’s knowledge of
                    the diamorphine; and (c) the Appellant’s possession of the
                    diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking. We were satisfied that the
                    Prosecution had discharged this burden in view of the following factors:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_a"></a>(a)     the statements taken from the
                        Appellant, as listed at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>
                        above;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        Defence’s cross-examination of the Prosecution’s witnesses at
                        the trial; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_c"></a>(c)     the Defence’s closing submissions at the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We
                    will now elaborate on each of these factors <em>seriatim</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Appellant’s statements</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Appellant’s “contemporaneous” statement taken
                by Insp Eugene Tan</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Appellant’s
                    “contemporaneous” statement mentioned at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above was recorded by a CNB officer (<em>viz</em>, Insp Eugene Tan) during the second half of the search
                    of the Flat at around 3.20pm on 15 April 2009. The questioning was carried
                    out in the Kitchen, with SSgt Ong acting as the escorting
                        officer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> In the court below, the
                    Appellant contested the admissibility of his “contemporaneous”
                    statement on the ground that CNB officers had no power in law to take statements
                    from him. The Judge rightly dismissed this argument (at [11] of the High Court GD) because a CNB
                    officer is clearly endowed, pursuant to s 32 of the Act, with all the
                    powers that a police officer has under the CPC in relation to an investigation
                    into a seizable offence. These powers include the power to take statements from
                    an accused person pursuant to s 121 of the CPC (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Azman bin Mohamed Sanwan and others</em>
                    [2010] SGHC 196 at [22]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The Appellant’s
                    “contemporaneous” statement was recorded in English even though
                    Insp Eugene Tan questioned the Appellant in Mandarin. We noted, however,
                    that the answers given by the Appellant were read over to him in Mandarin, and
                    he affirmed the contents of his “contemporaneous” statement to be
                    true. The substance of that statement was as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q1)    What are these? ([The Appellant] shown numerous
                            packets containing white granular substances and some tablets in red and
                            silver packaging)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A1)    The white granular substance in the packets is
                            Heroin and the tablets in silver and red packaging are
                        Erimin-5.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q2)    Who does it belong to?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A2)    They belong to me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q3)    How many packets of Heroin and Erimin-5 are
                            there?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A3)    I have roughly 137 packets of Heroin and 50 slabs
                            of Erimin-5.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q4)    What are they meant for?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A4)    They are meant for selling as well as for my own
                            consumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q5)    How much do you sell for each packet of Heroin and
                            each slab of Erimin-5?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A5)    I sell for S$220 per packet of Heroin and S$50 per
                            slab of Erimin-5.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It would be noted that in the “contemporaneous”
                    statement, the Appellant clearly admitted to the three main elements of
                    possession of the diamorphine found in the Flat, knowledge of the diamorphine
                    and possession of the diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking. In fact, the
                    Judge was particularly cognisant of the fact that the Appellant had
                    “estimated with accuracy the number of packets of drugs in the [Flat]
                    before these were discovered, seized and counted by the CNB officers”
                    (see [8] of the High Court GD).
                    Specifically, the Appellant had estimated that he had 137 packets of heroin in
                    the Flat, as compared to the actual total of 136 packets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     As Insp Eugene Tan did not inform the
                    Appellant about his right to remain silent (a requirement when recording a
                    statement under s 121(1) of the CPC), this could affect the weight that
                    should be accorded to the Appellant’s “contemporaneous”
                    statement. However, the reliability of that statement was corroborated by the
                    Appellant making the same admissions consistently in his subsequent
                    “cautioned” statement and s 121(1) long statements. The
                    Appellant also affirmed again the contents of his
                    “contemporaneous” statement in his third s 121(1) long
                    statement. Indeed, even if the Appellant’s “contemporaneous”
                    statement were disregarded altogether, the evidence from the Appellant’s
                    subsequent “cautioned” statement and s 121(1) long statements
                    was, as we will show below, more than sufficient to prove the Charge beyond a
                    reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Appellant’s “cautioned” statement and
                s 121(1) long statements taken by I/O Aaron Tang </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     We would first underscore the point that the
                    Appellant did not contest the voluntary nature of the “cautioned”
                    statement and the four s 121(1) long statements taken by I/O Aaron
                    Tang. All those statements were clearly admissible under s 122(5) of the
                    CPC. They were taken with the Appellant speaking in Hokkien through the
                    interpretation of an interpreter attached to the CNB, Wong Png Leong
                    (“Interpreter Wong”). Interpreter Wong’s statement
                    dated 23 June 2010 (“Interpreter Wong’s
                    statement”) described the process of how the aforesaid statements were
                    recorded, explained to and confirmed by the Appellant. Significantly, the
                    Appellant did not contest Interpreter Wong’s statement; neither did
                    he cross-examine Interpreter Wong at the trial.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In his “cautioned” statement and
                    s 121(1) long statements, the Appellant consistently admitted that:
                    (a) the packets of granular substance found in the air-conditioner in the
                    Bedroom as well as in the vacuum cleaner and the cooker hood in the Kitchen
                    belonged to him; (b) he knew that those packets of granular substance
                    contained heroin; and (c) he kept the packets of granular substance for the
                    purpose of selling them (<em>ie</em>, for the purpose of
                    trafficking as defined in s 2 of the Act). As the Judge noted at [9] of the High Court GD, the Appellant
                    “[gave] a detailed explanation as to how [the aforesaid air-conditioner,
                    cooker hood and vacuum cleaner] served different functions in his drug supply
                    chain and [stated] that he had some regular customers”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Furthermore, in its closing submissions at the
                    trial, the Prosecution quite rightly pointed out that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he [Appellant] <em>did not advance even a
                            single question</em> against either [I/O] Aaron Tang or
                        [Interpreter Wong] … that would, in any way, question or raise
                        any conceivable doubt as to the <em>weight</em> that
                        should be placed on the statements given [to I/O Aaron Tang]. [emphasis
                        in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Therefore, the Appellant’s “cautioned” statements
                    and s 121(1) long statements were sufficient (indeed, more than sufficient,
                    as we stated at <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> above) to prove the
                    Charge against the Appellant beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, the DNA test
                    results in respect of some of the items sent to HSA for DNA testing (such as the
                    cooker hood grill (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above)) and
                    Analyst Lim’s certificate confirming the presence of diamorphine on the
                    digital weighing scale (set <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above)
                    corroborated what the Appellant said in his statements. As the Appellant chose
                    not to call any evidence in his defence, the Prosecution’s case stood
                    unrebutted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Defence’s cross-examination of the Prosecution’s
                witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Turning now to the Defence’s
                    cross-examination of the Prosecution’s witnesses at the trial, although
                    defence counsel cross-examined 13 out of the Prosecution’s 28 witnesses,
                    the cross-examination of those witnesses was extremely brief – only around
                    three to ten questions were posed to each of the witnesses, and the questions
                    asked did not challenge the truth of their statements. The cross-examination of
                    the HSA officers involved in the present case – namely, Wong Hang
                        Yee<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> (the senior
                    forensic scientist who carried out the DNA test on the blood sample taken from
                    the Appellant (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above)),
                        Dr Syn<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> and Analyst Lim<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> – consisted
                    largely of questions that clarified the nature of the analysis which these
                    officers carried out and did not challenge the veracity of their findings at
                    all. For the cross-examination of the CNB officers who made up the Raid
                        Party,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> the questions posed similarly
                    did not challenge the truth of these officers’ testimonies. Strangely,
                    most of the questions centred on whether CNB officers had the power to take
                    statements from the Appellant, which were questions of law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     At [12] of the High Court GD, the Judge addressed one of the
                    sharper exchanges that took place during the Defence’s cross-examination
                    of the Prosecution’s witnesses. This related to the cross-examination of
                    I/O Aaron Tang in relation to his conditioned statement dated 20 June
                    2010 which contained his sworn evidence of his conduct of the
                        investigation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> In our view, the Judge rightly dismissed the
                    Defence’s suggestion that “it was crucial that [I/O] Aaron
                    Tang did not include in his own conditioned statement the weights of the [drug]
                    exhibits that he recorded in his investigation diary” (see [12] of the High Court GD). The Judge accepted
                    that I/O Aaron Tang’s explanation for this omission (namely, that the
                    weights of the drug exhibits recorded in his investigation diary were not as
                    accurate as the weights recorded in HSA’s reports) was reasonable. The
                    Judge also pointed out that in any event, I/O Aaron Tang had rectified the
                    omission by providing (during cross-examination) the weights of the drug
                    exhibits recorded in his investigation diary. In addition, the Judge noted
                    (likewise at [12] of the High Court GD)
                    that “[c]ounsel did not highlight any particular aspect of
                    [I/O] Aaron Tang’s evidence that ought to be given less weight as a
                    result of his omission”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In our view, there was a further reason why
                    the Judge was right to dismiss the aforesaid argument of the Defence. As this
                    court noted in <em>Nguyen Tuong Van v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 103 (“<em>Nguyen Tuong Van</em>”), there may be discrepancies
                    between the weight of drugs recorded by a CNB investigation officer and that
                    recorded by a HSA officer due to the difference in “the purpose of the
                    weighing by each officer and the different levels of their expertise” (at
                        [38]). For a CNB investigation
                    officer, scientifically acceptable accuracy is not required. Instead,
                    “what is crucially important is to ensure that there [is] no mixing of
                    the drug exhibits or … tampering of the contents” (see likewise
                        <em>Nguyen Tuong Van</em> at [38]). Significantly, in the present case, the
                    Appellant did not make any allegation that the 136 Packets had been tampered
                    with, and also did not challenge the CNB officers’ testimonies regarding
                    the chain of custody of those packets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Defence’s closing submissions at the trial</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Finally, we would highlight the fact that the
                    Defence, in its closing submissions at the trial, did not make any substantive
                    challenge to the Prosecution’s case against the Appellant. Quoted below
                    are the Defence’s written closing submissions in their
                        entirety:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This is a case where Defence Counsels [<em>sic</em>]
                        face great difficulty in preparing submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At the trial there were formal witnesses whose evidence [was] admitted (by
                        agreement) and whose attendance [was] dispensed with.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The members of the CNB raiding party [<em>ie</em>,
                        the Raid Party] gave evidence. The evidence was properly documented.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Statements were recorded from the [Appellant]. <em>The
                            [Appellant] did not challenge the voluntariness nor the truth of the
                            statements</em>. The quantity of the drugs found at the [Flat] was
                        also not challenged. (No instructions were ever given to Defence Counsels
                            [<em>sic</em>] to challenge despite several visits
                        to the [Appellant] at Changi [Prison].)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At the end of the Prosecution[’s] case the Court found [the
                        Appellant] had a case to answer and read him his rights. The [Appellant]
                        elected not to give evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The [Appellant] in his statements had admitted he was a heavy consumer of
                        drugs and that he only had a handful of clients to whom he sold
                        drugs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Defence Counsels [<em>sic</em>] would plead [with]
                        the Court [to] weigh this point and the fact that the [Appellant] is a young
                        person and consider exercising a discretion to give the [Appellant] a prison
                        term.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     While the Defence’s closing submissions
                    mentioned that the Appellant was “a heavy consumer of
                        drugs”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> there was no attempt by the Defence
                    to make out a case that all or most of the diamorphine in the 136 Packets was
                    for the Appellant’s own consumption. In fact, the picture which emerged
                    from the Appellant’s four s 121(1) long statements taken by
                    I/O Aaron Tang was that the Appellant would consume only a small portion of
                    the heroin stored in the Flat and would sell the bulk of the heroin. Moreover,
                    as mentioned earlier (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> and <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> above), the Appellant elected not to give
                    evidence when called upon to enter his defence at the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The Judge did not draw any adverse inference
                    against the Appellant for remaining silent at the trial. In our view, there was
                    hardly any need for the Judge to do so. The Prosecution’s evidence against
                    the Appellant effectively stood unchallenged and it amply proved the Charge
                    against him beyond any reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In conclusion, we would reiterate that our
                    examination of the High Court GD shows that the Judge did not apply the
                        ss 17(<em>c</em>) and 18(2) presumptions in
                    convicting the Appellant of the Charge. In any event, on the evidence, we found
                    that the Prosecution had proved the Charge against the Appellant beyond a
                    reasonable doubt without having to rely on either of the aforesaid presumptions.
                    We therefore dismissed this appeal.</p>
