        Lai Siu Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The present suit arose out of an aborted
                    voluntary conditional cash offer launched in 2008 by the first defendant, Asia
                    Pacific Links Ltd (“APLL”), to acquire at 22.5 cents per share
                    (“the Offer”), all the issued ordinary shares in Jade Technologies
                    Holdings Ltd (“Jade”) which it did not already own or control. The
                    second defendant Soh Guan Cheow Anthony (“Dr Soh”) was, at
                    the material time, the sole shareholder and one of two directors of APLL with
                    the other director being his wife. Dr Soh was also a director and the Group
                    President of Jade.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff, Oversea-Chinese Banking
                    Corporation Ltd (“OCBC”) is one of Singapore’s largest local
                    banks. OCBC was appointed as the financial adviser to APLL for the Offer. The
                    terms and conditions of OCBC’s appointment are set out in an agreement
                    dated 1 February 2008 (“the Mandate Letter”). Allen &amp;
                    Gledhill LLP (A&amp;G) was APLL’s legal adviser for the
                Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 18 February 2008, following several
                    email exchanges between the parties and also with A&amp;G, and after a meeting
                    on 14 February 2008 to settle the announcement of the Offer (the
                    “First Verification Meeting”), OCBC announced the Offer (the
                    “Offer Announcement”) to the Singapore Stock Exchange Ltd
                    (“SGX”). The Offer Announcement contained a statement that the
                    defendants held 451,172,504 shares representing 46.54% of Jade’s issued
                    capital and a confirmation from OCBC that sufficient financial resources were
                    available to APLL to satisfy full acceptance of the Offer. After the Offer was
                    announced, a verification meeting was held on 5 March 2008 to settle the
                    Offer Document (the “Second Verification Meeting”). On
                    6 March 2008, APLL and A&amp;G gave clearance for the Offer Document to be
                    printed and issued. OCBC despatched the Offer Document on 10 March 2008.
                    Under the terms of the Offer Document, the Offer would have closed on
                    7 April 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       As proof that APLL had sufficient financial
                    resources to satisfy full acceptance of the Offer, Dr Soh provided OCBC
                    with several documents. These documents (henceforth collectively referred to as
                    the “Documents Evidencing APLL’s Financial Resources”)
                    consisted of (i) a letter dated 18 February 2008 (“the First
                    Letter”), (ii) a fax dated 19 February 2008 which stated that
                    Standard Chartered Bank (“SCB”) Jakarta had indeed issued the
                    First Letter (“the Second Letter”), (iii) a letter dated
                    1 April 2008 which stated that SCB Jakarta would remit US$100m to OCBC that
                    day (“the Third Letter”) and copies of three SWIFTs of a Bank
                    Guarantee purportedly issued by SCB Jakarta (“the First SWIFT”,
                    “the Second SWIFT” and “the Third SWIFT”
                    respectively). The First and the Third Letters were purportedly signed by one Ng
                    Khok Pheng (“Mr Ng”) and one Lim Bun Tjaij
                    (“Mr Lim”) of SCB Jakarta. The Second Letter was purportedly
                    signed by Mr Ng.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       It subsequently transpired that APLL did not in
                    fact hold 46.54% of Jade’s issued capital. Whilst APLL had represented to
                    OCBC and A&amp;G that it retained beneficial ownership in the Jade shares which
                    it held, APLL had, pursuant to an executed document called Global Master Share
                    Lending Agreement (“the GMSLA”), transferred some of its Jade
                    shares to companies in the Merrill Lynch International Group (“Merrill
                    Lynch”) which held the same as custodian for an Australian company, Opes
                    Prime Stock Broking Ltd (“Opes Prime”); title to those shares had
                    in fact been transferred to Opes Prime. The Jade shares transferred pursuant to
                    the GMSLA totalled 300,050,000 shares, representing approximately 30.95% of
                    Jade’s issued capital. Upon Opes Prime’s receivership on
                    27 March 2008, Merrill Lynch seized some of the Jade shares and sold shares
                    representing approximately 9.82% of Jade’s issued capital on 1 April
                    2008. Additionally, in March 2008, doubts were cast on the authenticity of the
                    Documents Evidencing APLL’s Financial Resources and the defendants were
                    unable to satisfy OCBC that they had sufficient funds to meet full acceptance of
                    the Offer. On 29 March 2008, A&amp;G discharged itself as legal adviser to
                    APLL in relation to the Offer while OCBC resigned as its financial adviser on
                    2 April 2008. APLL eventually withdrew the Offer on 4 April
                    2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       As a result of the withdrawal of the Offer, the
                    Securities Industry Council (“the SIC”) conducted an inquiry into
                    the circumstances surrounding the Offer. The SIC found that Dr Soh and OCBC
                    had breached various provisions of the Singapore Code on Take-overs and Mergers
                    (“the Code”). All three parties involved in issuing the Offer
                    Document were censured by the SIC with Dr Soh receiving the heaviest
                    penalty – he was prohibited (for five years) from making any take-over
                    offer in Singapore and was denied facilities (for three years) to buy and sell
                    shares through SGX without the consent of the SIC. The SIC hearing committee
                    also considered Dr Soh unsuited to be a director of any listed company in
                    Singapore for a period of five years.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In its statement of claim, OCBC alleged that
                    APLL had breached the Mandate Letter. OCBC accused the defendants of committing
                    fraud, negligent misrepresentation and conspiracy. OCBC asserted that any
                    failure on its part to fully comply with the Code, and any inaccuracy or
                    omission in the Offer Announcement and Offer Document, was attributable to the
                    fraud and wrongdoing of the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       OCBC alleged that the defendants <em>inter alia</em> misrepresented to OCBC that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     The defendants collectively and
                        beneficially owned 451,172,504 shares representing 46.54% of the issued
                        capital of Jade (the “Shareholding
                    Representation”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     APLL had sufficient financial resources to satisfy full acceptances
                        of the Offer (the “Financial Resources
                        Representation”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c"></a>(c)     APLL intended, through the Offer, to develop and grow the
                        businesses of Jade and its subsidiaries and pursue opportunities for revenue
                        synergies, particularly in the energy sector (the “Rationale
                        Representation”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_d"></a>(d)     The directors of APLL had taken all reasonable care to
                        ensure that the facts stated and all opinions expressed in the Offer
                        Announcement and the Offer Document were fair and accurate and that no facts
                        had been omitted from the Offer Announcement and the Offer Document (the
                        “Responsibility Statements”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In reliance
                    on the above representations, OCBC said it issued the Offer Announcement,
                    despatched the Offer Document and continued acting as the financial adviser to
                    the Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       OCBC contended that the Offer was not genuine
                    and that the defendants, faced with rapidly declining prices in the shares and
                    the risk of forced sales of their Jade shares by their financiers, had
                    implemented a fraudulent and illegal scheme to support or ramp up the price of
                    Jade shares. OCBC alleged that the defendants had induced OCBC to act as the
                    financial adviser for the Offer by a web of deceit and forgery. OCBC alleged
                    that the defendants had concealed material facts from OCBC and, <em>inter alia</em>, provided OCBC with false information and
                    sham documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     OCBC claimed that it had suffered damage to
                    its reputation as a result of the eventual withdrawal of the Offer as well as
                    loss of take-over advisory work. OCBC had also incurred significant legal costs
                    and other associated expenses in relation to the SIC inquiry. OCBC claimed,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, the following reliefs against
                    APLL:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     $410,094.77 payable under the
                        Mandate Letter for work done in connection with the
                    Offer;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     A
                        declaration that OCBC was entitled to terminate the Mandate Letter and
                        discharge itself as the financial adviser to the Offer;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     A declaration pursuant to cl 4(b)(ii)
                        of the Mandate Letter that APLL was liable to indemnify and hold OCBC
                        harmless against all actions, claims, liabilities, costs etc. which OCBC may
                        suffer or incur or which may be made, brought or claimed against OCBC in
                        connection with its engagement as financial adviser; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_d"></a>(d)     Costs on an indemnity basis pursuant
                        to cl 4(b) of the Mandate Letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">as well as the
                    following reliefs against both APLL and Dr Soh:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_e"></a>(e)     A declaration that either or both
                        were liable to OCBC for fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation or
                        both;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_f"></a>(f)     A
                        declaration that either or both APLL and Dr Soh were liable to
                        indemnify and to hold OCBC harmless against all actions, claims,
                        liabilities, costs, etc. which OCBC may suffer or incur or which may be
                        made, brought or claimed against OCBC arising out of or in connection with
                        the Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The trial was bifurcated pursuant to an order
                    of court dated 12 January 2010 (made in Summons No 6437 of 2009). The trial
                    before this court was only to determine liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defence and counterclaim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The defendants denied OCBC’s claims and
                    alleged that the defendants were themselves victims of a third party’s
                    fraudulent acts. The defendants contended that they had acted in good faith in
                    their dealings with OCBC and had believed (and were reasonable in so believing)
                    in the authenticity of the Documents Evidencing APLL’s Financial Resources
                    which they had forwarded to OCBC, as well as in the veracity of the statements
                    made in those documents. Dr Soh claimed to have relied on one Dr Abdul
                    Rahman bin Maarip (“Dr Rahman”), who was his business
                    associate, to procure those documents. Dr Soh claimed that he had not been
                    able to contact Dr Rahman since October 2008. He joined Dr Rahman as a
                    third party to the present proceedings but was unable to serve the court papers
                    on Dr Rahman even up to the commencement of the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It was the defendants’ case that the
                    failure of the Offer was occasioned by OCBC’s gross neglect, breaches of
                    its contractual obligations to the defendants under the Mandate Letter and
                    breaches of the Code with regard to (i) OCBC’s verification of
                    APLL’s shareholding in Jade and (ii) its confirmation of the adequacy of
                    APLL’s financial resources to fund the Offer. The defendants contended
                    that OCBC should not have released the Offer Announcement on 18 February
                    2008. The defendants also asserted that OCBC’s termination of its
                    appointment as financial adviser on 2 April 2008 was
                wrongful.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The defendants alleged that OCBC was involved
                    in the process of ramping up the price of Jade shares, through OCBC Securities
                    Pte Ltd (“OCBC Securities”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of OCBC. It
                    was the defendants’ case that the increase in OCBC Securities’
                    shareholding in Jade in the period between 31 January 2008 and the
                    announcement of the Offer on 18 February 2008 was a breach by OCBC of Rule
                    11.1 of the Code relating to restrictions on dealings by a professional adviser
                    before an offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The defendants counterclaimed against OCBC for
                    loss and damage it allegedly suffered as a consequence of OCBC’s alleged
                    negligence, breach of contract and breaches of the Code in the discharge of its
                    duties as financial adviser for the Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It was not disputed that OCBC had committed
                    breaches of the Code as found by the SIC, particularly relating to (a) its
                    confirmation of APLL’s financial resources for the Offer; and (b) its
                    verification of APLL’s shareholdings in Jade. The key issue was whether
                    OCBC was responsible for the consequences of its breaches of the Code or whether
                    such breaches resulted from the conduct of APLL and Dr Soh, which conduct
                    OCBC contended was fraudulent and which it had no reason to suspect would be
                    committed by its own client and against which OCBC was not in a position to
                    easily detect or prevent.</p>

<b>The defendants’ initial acquisition of Jade
                    shares</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Apart from Jade and APLL, at the material
                    time, Dr Soh was the sole shareholder and director of another company
                    called Faitheagle Investments Ltd (“Faitheagle”) and was also a
                    director and shareholder of companies such as First Capital Growth Investment
                    Ltd (“FCGIL”), Asia Pacific Venture Capital Ltd
                    (“APVC”) and Asia Growth Capital Pte Ltd (“AGCPL”).
                    Dr Soh was appointed a non-executive director of Jade on 23 May 2007
                    and Group President of Jade on 8 June 2007. He resigned from these posts on
                    6 May 2008 and 28 April 2008 respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On 7 May 2007, APLL acquired shares
                    representing approximately 76.2% of the total issued capital of Jade via a
                    mandatory unconditional cash offer made by Daiwa Securities SMBC for and on
                    behalf of APLL. This was triggered by a sale and purchase agreement under which
                    APLL bought Jade shares at $0.015 per share for a total price of $9.7m.
                    Subsequent private placements of Jade shares resulted in APLL’s stake in
                    Jade falling to approximately 45.97% of Jade’s issued capital as at
                    September 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendants’ dealings in Jade shares before 30 January

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Faitheagle was incorporated on 12 May
                    2005. According to Dr Soh, its business includes, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the operation of fund managements for investments.
                    Dr Soh had/has a dual capacity in Faitheagle: he was/is its fund manager
                    and he also holds shares for himself under Faitheagle’s
                accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Between August and November 2007, Faitheagle
                    purchased 5.5 million shares in Jade. Those shares were subsequently sold in
                    four tranches between 12 February 2008 and 25 February 2008. On
                    12 February 2008, Faitheagle sold 1 million Jade shares at $0.215 per
                    share. Between 21 and 25 February 2008, Faitheagle sold 4.5 million Jade
                    shares for $0.22 per share. Dr Soh did not inform the market, OCBC or
                    A&amp;G of either the purchase or the disposal of those 5.5 million Jade
                    shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">APLL’s transfer of Jade shares to SBS Nominees Ltd</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On 11 September 2007, APLL transferred 34
                    million Jade shares to SBS Nominees Ltd, in respect of a loan of $4m granted to
                    APLL by Singapura Finance Ltd (“SFL”). A further transfer of 30
                    million Jade shares, for no consideration, was made to SBS Nominees Ltd on
                    25 January 2008 to meet a margin call by SFL. APLL retained beneficial
                    ownership in those shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Global Master Share Lending Agreement with Opes Prime</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In September 2007, Dr Soh began
                    negotiations with Opes Prime. On 26 September 2007, APLL entered into the
                    GMSLA with Opes Prime (see <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above). Laurie
                    Emini (“Emini”) the chief executive of Opes Prime subsequently
                    signed the GMSLA which was dated 12 October 2007. Between 26 September
                    and 18 October 2007, Dr Soh transferred a total of 145,050,000 Jade
                    shares to Merrill Lynch pursuant to the GMSLA, in exchange for a total loan from
                    Opes Prime of $29,698,308.09. The price of Jade shares was $0.37 on
                    26 September 2007. The loan was based on a 60% loan-to-security value
                    ratio. Accordingly, a margin call would be triggered once the price of Jade
                    shares fell below $0.34. Towards the end of 2007, the price of Jade shares
                    declined. By mid-December 2007, Jade shares were trading below $0.30 per share.
                    The falling prices of Jade shares triggered multiple margin calls from Opes
                    Prime which were settled in cash.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Clause 2.3 of the GMSLA provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Notwithstanding the use of expressions such as “borrow”,
                        “lend”, “Collateral”, “Margin”,
                        “redeliver” etc, which are used to reflect terminology used in
                        the market for transactions of the kind provided for in this Agreement,
                        title to Securities “borrowed” or “lent” and
                        “Collateral” provided in accordance with this Agreement
                            <em>shall pass from one Party to another</em> as
                        provided for in this Agreement, the party obtaining such title being obliged
                        to redeliver Equivalent Securities or Equivalent Collateral as the case may
                        be. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As such, APLL no longer held title to Jade shares transferred under
                    the GMSLA. However, APLL and Dr Soh did not disclose this fact to SGX or to
                    the market.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     On 21 January 2008, the price of Jade
                    shares had declined to $0.16 per share. Dr Soh received a call from a
                    representative of Opes Prime, demanding payment of $500,000 by noon that day to
                    meet a margin call of $1m. He did not make the payment. Since APLL failed to
                    meet the margin call, Opes Prime force-sold 4.6 million Jade shares on
                    21 January 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The price of Jade shares continued to slide to
                    $0.09 per share on 30 January 2008. On 25 January 2008, APLL
                    transferred a further 155,000,000 Jade shares to Opes Prime as further
                    collateral so as to stop margin calls.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     As at 25 January 2008, APLL had
                    transferred to Opes Prime a total of 300,050,000 Jade shares under the GMSLA, of
                    which 4.6 million were force-sold on 21 January 2008. No statutory
                    disclosure of the forced sale of 4.6 million Jade shares was made. Instead, on
                    21 January 2008, Dr Soh instructed Jade to announce on SGXNET that he
                    had purchased 5.5 million Jade shares in his own name at between $0.175 and
                    $0.225 per share although no such purchase had in fact taken place. In the
                    result, Dr Soh represented (incorrectly) to the market that APLL continued
                    to hold a 45.97% stake in Jade and that collectively, he and APLL held 46.54% of
                    the issued capital of Jade.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">APLL’s engagement of OCBC as financial adviser for the
                Offer</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The meeting on 31 January 2008 (the “First
                Meeting”)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     On 31 January 2008, Dr Soh met with
                    OCBC’s officers (“the OCBC team”) for the first time, where
                    he disclosed his intention to launch the Offer. The price of Jade shares as of
                    31 January 2008 was $0.10 per share. The Offer price was set at 22.5 cents
                    at the First Meeting as Dr Soh informed OCBC that 22.5 cents was the
                    highest price he had paid for Jade shares in the 3 months before 31 January
                    2008. Dr Soh also informed OCBC that the defendants held 46.54% of
                    Jade’s issued capital.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The parties disagreed on what was discussed at
                    the First Meeting. According to Dr Soh, the meeting was preceded by a
                    briefing on Jade’s activities. Dr Soh claimed that a presentation was
                    given on an oil deal involving FCGIL and one of Jade’s wholly-owned
                    subsidiaries. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”),
                    Dr Soh deposed that he had shown to the OCBC team some documents relating
                    to the oil deal (which funding was by way of a bank guarantee from FCGIL’s
                    account with SCB Jakarta to UBS Singapore) and had informed the OCBC team that
                    the FCGIL funds could not be remitted to Singapore but that a bank guarantee
                    could be issued against the funds to back borrowings from the receiving bank. In
                    Dr Soh’s version of events, he had also explained to the OCBC team
                    that the bank account was in the name of FCGIL rather than APLL and that
                    Dr Soh held one-third of the shares in FCGIL. Dr Soh claimed that it
                    was only after the briefing that Jade’s staff left the room and he then
                    disclosed to the OCBC team his intention to launch the Offer. According to
                    Dr Soh, the OCBC team confirmed to him that he could use a similar
                    arrangement as that used for the oil deal to prove that he had sufficient
                    financial resources for the Offer. Under this arrangement, SCB Jakarta would
                    issue a bank guarantee in favour of APLL and send it to OCBC. OCBC would,
                    however, require a letter from SCB Jakarta indicating funds had been earmarked
                    for the Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     OCBC disagreed that a briefing had taken place
                    before Dr Soh announced his intention to launch the Offer. OCBC denied that
                    Dr Soh had made any mention of FCGIL at the meeting. Whilst OCBC accepted
                    that Dr Soh had mentioned that APLL had pledged approximately 30 million
                    Jade shares, OCBC asserted that Dr Soh had not provided further details of
                    the same and that Dr Soh had assured the OCBC team that he still owned the
                    pledged shares. Moreover, Dr Soh had informed the OCBC team that, <em>in addition to</em> procuring a letter from another bank
                    confirming APLL’s access to the requisite funds to satisfy full acceptance
                    of the Offer, he would be procuring a banker’s guarantee from UBS AG as
                    proof that APLL had sufficient funds for the Offer. OCBC asserted that
                    Dr Soh did not request and OCBC did not provide any advice. According to
                    OCBC, it was never contemplated, or indicated to Dr Soh at the First
                    Meeting and throughout their dealings with him regarding the Offer, that OCBC
                    would be responsible for providing APLL with any financing for the
                Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     It appears from handwritten notes taken at the
                    First Meeting by Ang Suat Ching (“Ang”), a member of the OCBC
                    team, that some discussion had taken place regarding an oil/coal refinery but
                    there was no record of any mention having been made of FCGIL, SCB Jakarta, or
                    the manner in which an oil deal had been funded. There was also no record, in
                    the handwritten notes, that SCB Jakarta would issue a bank guarantee in favour
                    of APLL and send it to OCBC or that SCB Jakarta would issue a letter to OCBC to
                    indicate that funds had been earmarked for the Offer. The following notes were
                    also taken:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">There was no mention of any proposed arrangement by which OCBC would
                    finance the Offer. Moreover, the handwritten notes referred to a BG from
                        <em>UBS</em> as proof of funds. There was no mention of

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The preparation of the Offer Announcement</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The due diligence conducted by Tan</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     On 31 January 2008, Tan Wei Ping,
                    (“Tan”) another member of the OCBC team emailed Jocelyn Hoi
                    (“Hoi”), the relationship manager at OCBC’s Enterprise
                    Banking Department who was in charge of APLL’s account, to inquire if
                    there was any adverse information or issues relating to APLL’s account
                    with OCBC. Hoi replied to say that there was none. Tan (PW1) did not ascertain
                    the status of APLL’s account with OCBC as he saw no need to do so. On the
                    following day, Tan verified Dr Soh and APLL’s shareholdings in Jade
                    against the information in Jade’s annual report for the financial year
                    ending 30 September 2007 as well as Jade’s announcements on
                    18 July 2007 and 21 January 2008 on SGXNET. The annual report stated
                    that APLL was a substantial shareholder with a 45.97% direct interest in
                    Jade’s shares. Tan recognised that some of those shares could be
                    beneficially owned by APLL but held by nominees as APLL’s custodian.
                    However, he saw no need to verify who those nominees were. The announcement on
                    SGXNET stated that Dr Soh held direct and indirect shareholdings in Jade of
                    5,500,000 (0.57%) and 445,672,504 (45.97%) shares respectively. Tan also
                    conducted searches on OCBC’s internal anti-money laundering database and
                    found no adverse records on APLL. On 1 February 2008, Tan sent an
                    over-the-wall memorandum to officers at OCBC Securities to ensure that they
                    observed strict confidentiality with regard to information acquired in the
                    course of the preparation for the Offer. Tan also sent a “no
                    conflict” memorandum to the Head of OCBC’s Group Investment Unit
                    and OCBC’s General Counsel both of whom confirmed that they had no
                    objections to OCBC’s appointment as APLL’s financial adviser for the
                    Offer. Tan also carried out checks, on 31 January 2008, 14 February
                    2008 and 6 March 2008, on SGXNET for the shareholdings of APLL and
                    Dr Soh. The results were consistent with Dr Soh’s
                    representations to OCBC that the defendants held a total of 46.54% of Jade
                    shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     After the due diligence checks were conducted,
                    OCBC provided Dr Soh with the Mandate Letter dated 1 February 2008 for
                    OCBC’s appointment as APLL’s financial adviser which Dr Soh
                    signed and returned on 11 February 2008. On 1 February 2008, A&amp;G

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     A Kick-off Meeting was held on 4 February
                    2008 at which lawyers from A&amp;G were present. Tan and Ang (PW3) made
                    handwritten notes at this meeting. Tan’s notes recorded that Dr Soh
                    informed the meeting that he had purchased 5.5 million Jade shares at $0.225 per
                    share on 21 January 2008 (even though Dr Soh had not in fact made the
                    purchase) and that the defendants held 46.54% of Jade’s issued capital.
                    The notes taken by Tan and Ang also recorded that 140 million of APLL’s
                    Jade shares were pledged to Opes Prime or lent to them as custodian, in exchange
                    for a $20m loan to invest in E3 Holdings Ltd (“E3”) and
                    Netelusion, and that the collateral was cash. Contrary to the position taken by
                    OCBC that Dr Soh had informed the meeting that he had pledged 140 million
                    Jade shares under the GMSLA, Dr Soh claimed that he had told OCBC that APLL
                    had pledged 300,050,000 Jade shares to Opes Prime. However, it is not disputed
                    that Dr Soh did not tell OCBC about Opes Prime’s forced sale of 4.6
                    million Jade shares on 21 January 2008 or Faitheagle’s purchase of
                    5.5 million Jade shares in 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Whilst Tan agreed that Dr Soh had
                    mentioned that the pledge was pursuant to a “cash as collateral”
                    agreement, Tan admitted that it did not occur to him then that the shares (and
                    not the cash) would normally be held as collateral in a share pledge agreement.
                    Tan also stated that nobody at the meeting clarified what was meant by
                    “cash as collateral” nor did anyone in the OCBC team ask
                    Dr Soh about the terms of the GMSLA agreement. According to OCBC, A&amp;G
                    requested Dr Soh for a copy of the GMSLA agreement and OCBC left it to
                    A&amp;G to highlight any issues arising therefrom. Indeed, A&amp;G sent an email
                    request to Dr Soh on 5 February 2008 for documents including a copy of
                    the GMSLA, but the GMSLA was not forwarded to A&amp;G. Neither OCBC nor A&amp;G
                    saw the GMSLA until much later (on 29 March 2008).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     OCBC’s position was that at the meeting
                    and at all material times, it never made any representation to Dr Soh that
                    it would provide the requisite funding for the Offer. Instead, according to Ang,
                    at that meeting, OCBC had requested that Dr Soh provide a letter from a
                    financial institution in a specified format (“the Financial Resources
                    Confirmation Letter”) before OCBC would give its confirmation that APLL
                    had sufficient financial resources to satisfy full acceptance of the Offer and
                    Dr Soh had requested for a template of this letter. Ang deposed that she
                    had instructed Tan to send the requested template to Dr Soh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The template of the Financial Resources
                    Confirmation Letter was indeed provided by Tan to Dr Soh by email on
                    4 February 2008. The text of the template stated:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     On 12 February 2008, Tan sent an email to
                    Dr Soh’s assistant Norman Phua (“Norman”). The text of
                    Tan’s email sheds some light on the understanding between the parties as
                    to the manner in which the defendants would prove to OCBC that APLL had
                    sufficient funds to satisfy the Offer. It reads:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">According to Tan, he called Norman shortly after sending the email.
                    After the telephone conversation, Tan sent Norman another copy of the template
                    of the Financial Resources Confirmation Letter as an attachment to a second
                    email sent on 12 February 2008. This email stated:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Tan Wei Ping</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     It appeared from Tan’s two emails of
                    12 February 2008 that the understanding between the parties was that
                    Dr Soh would transfer to APLL a bank guarantee which had been granted to
                    one of his other companies. Moreover, APLL still had to liaise with its banker
                    to provide OCBC with a Financial Resources Confirmation Letter. There was no
                    mention that OCBC would finance the Offer as Dr Soh claimed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Emails between the parties with regard to preparing for the Offer
                Announcement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     On 5 February 2008(see <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a>), A&amp;G requested documents including the
                    GMSLA from Dr Soh. On the same day, A&amp;G emailed a draft Offer
                    Announcement to Dr Soh and OCBC (wherein it was stated at para 1.2 that
                    APLL and its concert parties held an aggregate of 46.54% of Jade’s issued
                    shares or 451,172,504 shares). On 6 February 2008, A&amp;G sent another
                    email to Dr Soh, copied to the OCBC team, attaching a draft
                    Directors’ Board Resolution to be signed by APLL’s directors
                    approving the release of the Offer Announcement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     OCBC emailed Dr Soh and A&amp;G with a
                    revised copy of the draft Offer Announcement (the “revised draft Offer
                    Announcement”) on 6 February 2008 but did not amend the figures
                    stated in the draft Offer Announcement relating to APLL and its concert
                    parties’ shareholdings in Jade.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     On 11 February 2008, Dr Soh sent an
                    email to OCBC acknowledging receipt of the revised draft Offer Announcement. In
                    the email, Dr Soh informed OCBC that Norman would assist him in the
                    preparation of the Offer. Dr Soh did not comment on or qualify the
                    information in the revised draft Offer Announcement relating to the
                    shareholdings in Jade of APLL and its concert parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     A&amp;G circulated a draft letter to the SIC
                    on the ring-fencing of concert parties on 12 February 2008. On
                    13 February 2008, the Assistant Vice-President of OCBC’s Group
                    Finance confirmed to Tan that as of 31 December 2007, OCBC and its group
                    companies did not hold any shares in Jade. OCBC made amendments to
                    A&amp;G’s draft letter, and the amended letter was sent to the SIC on
                    15 February 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Jade’s share price rose from $0.09 on
                    31 January 2008 to $0.20 just before 13 February 2008. Between 13 and
                    18 February 2008, Jade shares were suspended pending various announcements
                    by Jade which were unrelated to the Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The First Verification Meeting on 14 February 2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     On 14 February 2008, Dr Soh and
                    Norman met with OCBC’s team and A&amp;G to review the contents of the
                    draft Offer Announcement. At the meeting, A&amp;G went through the contents of
                    the draft Offer Announcement with the attendees to confirm the accuracy of the
                    statements made therein.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     At the First Verification Meeting, Dr Soh
                    confirmed to OCBC and A&amp;G that APLL and he collectively and beneficially
                    owned 451,172,504 shares representing 46.54% of the issued capital of Jade. He
                    then certified on the verification notes for the First Verification Meeting that
                    he accepted full responsibility for the accuracy of the information given in the
                    Offer Announcement, and confirmed that he had made all reasonable enquiries such
                    that to the best of his knowledge and belief, each statement of fact in the
                    Offer Announcement was true and that there were no other material facts the
                    omission of which would make any statement in the Offer Announcement
                    misleading.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     It was reflected in the minutes of the First
                    Verification Meeting, as recorded by A&amp;G, that OCBC had confirmed, at the
                    meeting, that sufficient financial resources were available to APLL to satisfy
                    full acceptance of the Offer. However, OCBC claimed that this was inaccurate and
                    that the OCBC team had informed A&amp;G that OCBC had yet to receive a Financial
                    Resources Confirmation Letter from APLL. As such, OCBC could not confirm that
                    sufficient financial resources were available to APLL to satisfy full acceptance
                    of the Offer. According to OCBC, Dr Soh had indicated that the Financial
                    Resources Confirmation Letter was pending and that he would provide OCBC with
                    the same once it arrived. Although OCBC’s officer, Tsai Ai Liang
                    (“Tsai”), had signed the notes of the meeting on 14 February
                    2008 to confirm its contents, it was OCBC’s position that no issue was
                    raised regarding this discrepancy because the minutes of the meeting were only
                    circulated on 24 March 2008, by which time OCBC had received the requisite
                    Financial Resources Confirmation Letter from APLL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Dr Soh on the other hand claimed that the
                    minutes of the meeting were accurate and that since OCBC had confirmed that APLL
                    had sufficient financial resources available to satisfy full acceptances of the
                    Offer, he was entitled to assume that OCBC had carried out its own independent
                    verification.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Demands by Opes Prime against APLL in February 2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     On 7 February 2008, Opes Prime made a
                    further margin call of $2,134,118 on Dr Soh. This margin call was
                    eventually cancelled on 12 February 2008 as the price of Jade shares had
                    risen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     On or about 15 February 2008, Dr Soh
                    became concerned when a statement issued by the Central Depository (Pte) Limited
                    showed that Merrill Lynch held 258,802,000 Jade shares (as nominee for Opes
                    Prime) while a statement issued by Opes Prime dated 5 February 2008 showed
                    that it held 295,450,000 Jade shares. He suspected that Opes Prime may have
                    force-sold more Jade shares after the first forced sale of 4.6 million Jade
                    shares on 21 January 2008. On or about 27 February 2008, Dr Soh
                    travelled to Australia to seek an explanation from Opes Prime. In an email to
                    Opes Prime dated 4 March 2008, Dr Soh (falsely) claimed that the SIC
                    was inquiring into APLL’s beneficial ownership of the Jade shares and
                    pressed Opes Prime to explain the discrepancies in the number of Jade shares
                    reflected in the two statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Dr Soh concealed from OCBC his
                    communications with Opes Prime and his concerns over the “missing”
                    Jade shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The First Letter from SCB Jakarta</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     On 18 February 2008, Dr Soh emailed
                    OCBC to say that the “proof of fund bank letter just arrived, original is
                    being mailed to your office”. This proof of fund bank letter appeared to
                    be the First Letter from SCB Jakarta (at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>
                    above). The First Letter was attached to Dr Soh’s email. However, as
                    OCBC was unable to open the soft copy of the document, Norman delivered a hard
                    copy of the First Letter to OCBC’s office that afternoon. Dr Soh had
                    certified, on that copy of the First Letter, that it was a true copy. OCBC
                    claimed that by presenting the copy of the First Letter to OCBC and certifying
                    that it was a true copy, Dr Soh and/or APLL had represented to OCBC that
                    APLL had sufficient financial resources to satisfy full acceptance of the Offer.
                    On the other hand, Dr Soh claimed that the First Letter was procured by
                    Dr Rahman, who was his business associate, and since the letter was
                    addressed to OCBC, OCBC should have known that certification by Dr Soh
                    could not have been of the original of the First Letter. Moreover, Dr Soh
                    added, OCBC should have ensured that the First Letter was received by means of a
                    secure system since the words “SWIFT: OCBCSGSG” appeared on the
                    same.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     When cross-examined if it had struck her that
                    the letter referred to US$100m as opposed to the S$100m that was required by
                    OCBC, Ang replied that she was not concerned as US$100m easily translated to
                    S$140m-S$150m which was still in excess of what was needed for the
                Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In the afternoon of 18 February 2008, Tan
                    called the telephone number stated on the First Letter and managed to speak to a
                    person who identified himself as “Mr Ng” and who orally
                    confirmed that SCB Jakarta had issued the First Letter.
                    “Mr Ng” undertook to send a written confirmation as well as
                    the original of the First Letter to OCBC. Tan then sent a message to an email
                    address that “Mr Ng” had given to him, in which Tan requested
                    confirmation that SCB Jakarta had earmarked US$100m from APLL’s current
                    account for the Offer. “Mr Ng” promised to send the letter
                    the following morning. A fax was indeed transmitted by
                    “Mr Ng” to OCBC on 19 February 2008 (see <a href="#p1_62">[62]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The release of the Offer Announcement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     After receiving approvals from Dr Soh and
                    A&amp;G, OCBC issued the Offer Announcement to SGX at 7.30pm on 18 February
                    2008. Up to 18 February 2008, neither Dr Soh nor Norman had made any
                    changes to the statements of shareholdings of APLL and Dr Soh in paras 1.2,
                    9.1 and Appendix 5 of the draft Offer Announcement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     I note that it was Dr Soh, in his reply
                    dated 18 February 2008 to Tan’s email of the same date (which merely
                    attached a revised draft Offer Announcement for Norman’s clearance but did
                    not state when the Offer Announcement would be released), who had asked for the
                    Offer Announcement to be released at 7.30 pm that day. Dr Soh’s email
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear Wei Ping,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please release the offer announcement tonight at 7.30 pm.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Co would release the PCIM announcement at 6.30 pm and will release the
                        offeree announcement before 9 pm!</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Regards</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dr Anthony Soh</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The Offer Announcement included the
                    Shareholding Representation, the Financial Resources Representation and the
                    Responsibility Statements (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above). It
                    further stated that the rationale for the Offer was for the Offeror to acquire
                    an increased stake in Jade as part of its strategic investment in companies with
                    growth potential Based on the information stated in the Offer Document regarding
                    the defendants’ shareholdings in Jade, APLL would require $116.7m to
                    satisfy full acceptance of the Offer at the Offer price of $0.225 per Jade
                    share.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Statements made by Dr Soh without prior consultation with OCBC
                or A&amp;G</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     On 18 February 2008, at 7.47 pm, A&amp;G
                    sent an email to Dr Soh to emphasise that neither Dr Soh nor APLL
                    should take any unilateral action in relation to the Offer without first
                    consulting OCBC or A&amp;G. According to Ang, she had also called Dr Soh
                    later that night to remind him not to make any unilateral comments on the Offer
                    without first seeking the advice of A&amp;G and OCBC. The catalyst for the
                    issuance of these reminders to Dr Soh was the discovery by OCBC and
                    A&amp;G, that Dr Soh had, on or before 16 February 2008 and without
                    prior consultation with either of them, issued a letter to Jade stating his
                    intention to make the Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     On 19 February 2008, an article appeared
                    in the Business Times newspaper stating that Dr Soh would be making a $117m
                    cash offer to acquire the remaining 53.46% of Jade’s shares. The article
                    quoted Dr Soh <em>in extenso</em> on the potential of
                    Jade’s businesses and his profit forecast in relation to Jade. Dr Soh
                    was also quoted as saying, with reference to an Indonesian coal mine project
                    undertaken by Jade, that Jade was sitting on a “gold mine”.
                    Dr Soh was further quoted as saying that he was making the Offer for Jade
                    as he believed that the coal mine project would increase the value of Jade
                    several-fold. The article was based on an interview that Dr Soh had given
                    to a Business Times journalist on the evening of 18 February 2008. In
                    response to this article, an announcement dated 20 February 2008 had to be
                    made by OCBC on behalf of APLL to clarify and withdraw the statements made by
                    Dr Soh in the article. This was subsequently published in the Business
                    Times and sent to Jade’s shareholders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Neither OCBC nor A&amp;G were informed, prior
                    to Dr Soh’s interview by the Business Times journalist, that he would
                    be giving the interview. Ang also testified that during her telephone
                    conversation with Dr Soh on the evening of 18 February 2008,
                    Dr Soh did not at any time mention or allude to his interview with any
                    reporter. When cross-examined on why he had given the interview despite
                    Ang’s telephone call to him, Dr Soh claimed that the interview had
                    been scheduled sometime earlier. However, when asked to confirm that he already
                    knew that he was going to be interviewed by the journalist when he spoke to Ang
                    over the telephone, Dr Soh claimed that the journalist had only contacted
                    him an hour after the Offer Announcement was made. In any event, Dr Soh did
                    not inform the journalist that he was not in a position to give the
                    interview.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In an email sent at 9.30 am on
                    19 February 2008, in reply to A&amp;G’s email to him the previous
                    evening, Dr Soh informed A&amp;G that he had spoken to Ang on
                    18 February 2008 and that “[he] wished that [he] had sought advice
                    prior to ... speaking to [the Business Times reporter] in [his] capacity as
                    Group President of Jade (not as offeror)”. In the email, Dr Soh also
                    stated that the Business Times had taken advantage of the information he had
                    given to its journalist in the interview by reporting the information together
                    with the takeover news. I note that Dr Soh’s statements in this email
                    were inconsistent with his conduct of giving the interview <em>after</em> he had read A&amp;G’s email earlier that evening
                    reminding him not to take any unilateral action relating to the Offer without
                    consulting A&amp;G or OCBC, and <em>after</em> his
                    telephone conversation with Ang.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Second Letter from SCB Jakarta</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     On 19 February 2008, OCBC received by fax
                    the Second Letter. The Second Letter purported to confirm that SCB Jakarta had
                    indeed issued the First Letter and the authenticity of the contents of the First
                    Letter. However, OCBC did not notice that the fax header displayed an incorrect
                    spelling of SCB Jakarta’s name as “STANDART CHARTERED BANK”
                    instead of “STANDARD CHARTERED BANK”. On 27 February 2008,
                    Tan called “Mr Ng” at the number stated in the Second Letter
                    as OCBC had not received the originals of the First and Second Letters.
                    “Mr Ng” told him that the letters had been sent. Tan then
                    called Norman who informed him that APLL had also not received the originals of
                    the letters but assured Tan that he would follow up on the matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In his email to OCBC on 18 February 2008
                    (see <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a> above), Dr Soh had, in
                    addition to attaching the First Letter, stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have also asked Standard Chartered Bank to arrange a Banker’s
                        Guarantee of USD 100 millions [sic] which will be swifted within a
                        week.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On 25 February 2008, Tan emailed Norman to check if the
                    banker’s guarantee referred to in Dr Soh’s email was ready.
                    Dr Soh replied on 27 February 2008 stating that, based on his
                    understanding of the Mandate Letter issued by APLL to OCBC, the First Letter was
                    all that was required to satisfy OCBC that there were sufficient funds for the
                    purposes of the Offer. He also expressed reluctance to obtain a banker’s
                    guarantee because of the additional expense which it would incur. In particular,
                    Dr Soh stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As I understand in the mandate letter that only a Bank Letter from SCB in
                        support of AP Links Ltd is <em>all that is
                            required</em>, since that bank letter was issued <em>and you have communicated twice with the SCB Banker</em>
                        who had confirmed that funds are available to AP Links for the Gen Offer,
                        that should be more than enough for proof of funds as a Banker’s
                        Guarantee or Swift <em>was never part of the requirement as I
                            understood right from the beginning</em>. ... [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Dr Soh sought to provide OCBC with
                    additional comfort by relying on the following attachments: a US$500m
                    banker’s guarantee that was issued by SCB Jakarta via SWIFT in favour of a
                    UBS AG bank account belonging to Faitheagle, a register of directors of
                    Faitheagle, and a share certificate of Faitheagle. Alternatively, he stated that
                    if it was absolutely necessary, he could request UBS to issue a separate bank
                    guarantee from his Faitheagle account at UBS to his APLL account at OCBC
                        <em>provided OCBC was willing to accept and give him a credit
                        line</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     According to Tan, as at 27 February 2008,
                    he had not informed Dr Soh or Norman of the telephone calls that he had
                    made to verify the contents of the First and the Second Letters. In fact,
                    Dr Soh was only told that Tan had made the calls to
                    “Mr Ng” to verify the contents of the First and the Second
                    Letters at a conference call between Dr Soh, OCBC and A&amp;G on
                    27 March 2008 (see <a href="#p1_77">[77]</a> below). The
                    relevant extract from a transcript of this conference call (at p 3) is as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Anthony Soh:    So I have just established that you spoke
                            to Mr Ng in the past right?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Tan Wei Ping:    That’s right.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Anthony Soh:    And he said that okay he confirms, did he
                            ever in the past confirm that he wrote those letters?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Tan Wei Ping:    Yes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     It is clear from Dr Soh’s email
                    dated 27 February 2008 that Dr Soh was aware that he had to provide
                    the Financial Resources Confirmation Letter to OCBC to prove that APLL had
                    sufficient funds for the Offer. Moreover, a bank guarantee was not the means by
                    which APLL would demonstrate to OCBC that it had sufficient funds to carry out
                    the Offer. OCBC’s team (Tan, Tsai and Ang) claimed that whilst they were
                    surprised by the contents of Dr Soh’s email as he had voluntarily
                    offered to provide a banker’s guarantee for the Offer at the initial
                    meeting on 31 January 2008 and again in his email of 18 February 2008,
                    they were not overly concerned with Dr Soh’s sudden change of mind
                    since the OCBC team was relying on the First Letter as satisfaction of the
                    Financial Resources Confirmation Letter requirement and a banker’s
                    guarantee was not required from an offeror for a takeover.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In the event, Dr Soh did not provide any
                    banker’s guarantee to OCBC as proof that APLL had sufficient funds to
                    satisfy full acceptance of the Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The preparation of the Offer Document</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     On 20 February 2008, A&amp;G circulated a
                    first draft of the Offer Document to OCBC, Dr Soh and Norman. Information
                    relating to APLL and Dr Soh’s shareholdings in Jade were left blank
                    in the draft. Revisions were made to the draft by Tan and A&amp;G and further
                    drafts were circulated amongst the parties. On 4 March 2008, A&amp;G sent a
                    revised draft of the Offer Document to Dr Soh and OCBC. Appendix 5 of the
                    draft set out APLL and Dr Soh’s direct shareholdings in Jade as
                    445,672,504 shares and 5.5 million shares respectively. It also reflected that
                    the only dealing in Jade shares by Dr Soh during the three month period
                    immediately preceding the Offer Announcement Date and ending on 4 March
                    2008 was an acquisition of 5.5 million Jade shares by Dr Soh on
                    21 January 2008. Dr Soh replied to A&amp;G’s email dated
                    4 March 2008 instructing that out of the 45.97% Jade shares owned by APLL,
                    8.42% were held by APLL as direct shareholder and that APLL’s deemed
                    interest in the remaining Jade shares was 37.55%. He further stated that 37.55%
                    of the Jade shareholding was held by nominees such as Merrill Lynch, Morgan
                    Stanley and SBS Nominees. However, he stated that the “total interest
                    [wa]s still the same as 445,672,504 (45.97%)”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Further, on 6 March 2008, Tan sent an
                    email to Dr Soh in which he drew Dr Soh’s attention to,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, Appendix 5 of the Offer Document.
                    Although the information set out in the Appendix was inaccurate, in his reply
                    email to OCBC and A&amp;G on 6 March 2008, Dr Soh did not point out
                    the inaccuracies to OCBC or A&amp;G.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Second Verification Meeting</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The Second Verification Meeting took place on
                    5 March 2008 and was attended by OCBC, A&amp;G, Dr Soh and Norman. In
                    the verification notes, Dr Soh certified, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, that he accepted full responsibility for the accuracy of
                    the information given in the Offer Document and that there were no material
                    omissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The despatch of the Offer Document</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The Offer Document was despatched by OCBC on

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     On 26 February 2008, A&amp;G sent
                    Dr Soh and Norman an email (copied to OCBC), annexing a copy of the
                    Guidelines on Dealing Restrictions, Reporting Obligations and Public Statements
                    (the “Guidelines”). A notice (marked “IMPORTANT
                    NOTICE”) on the first page of the Guidelines stated that Dr Soh was
                    under certain restrictions in respect of trading in Jade shares and went on to
                    emphasise that he was not to buy or sell Jade shares during the Offer period.
                    Paragraph 4 of the Guidelines expressly stated that no “Relevant
                    Person” (which would include Dr Soh) was to either purchase or
                    dispose of Jade shares for the duration of the Offer without the prior written
                    consent of an Authorised Person (which included OCBC). On 27 February 2008,
                    Tan called Norman to remind Dr Soh not to trade in Jade shares during the
                    offer period. In that telephone conversation, Norman confirmed that Dr Soh
                    had not traded in Jade shares since the Offer Announcement. This was despite the
                    fact that Dr Soh had disposed of 5.5 million Jade shares in Faitheagle
                    between 12 and 25 February 2008 (see <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above). The telephone conversation between Tan and Norman
                    was documented in an email from Tan to Ang on 27 February 2008 (see
                        <a href="#p1_197">[197]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The defendants admitted that on 7 March
                    2008, Dr Soh had transferred 50 million Jade shares from APLL to
                    Faitheagle. He subsequently disposed of 45.7 million of these 50 million shares
                    in the following manner:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     According to the defendants, this disposal of
                    Jade shares by Faitheagle after the Offer Document was despatched on
                    10 March 2008 was in consequence of an email that Dr Soh had received
                    from A&amp;G dated 11 March 2008 which stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please be informed that under Rule 12 of the Singapore Code on Take-overs
                        and Mergers, although the Offeror and its associates are free to deal in the
                        relevant securities during the Offer period (e.g. acquire Jade shares
                        through off-market or on-market purchases and acquisitions, sale and
                        purchase agreements, etc.), these dealings must be publicly disclosed on the
                        SGXNET no later than 12 noon on the dealing day following the relevant
                        transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, contrary to A&amp;G’s instructions, Dr Soh did not
                    disclose on SGXNET his transfer of Jade shares to Faitheagle and subsequent
                    disposal of most of those shares. It is also noteworthy that Tan had sent a
                    separate email to Dr Soh and Norman on 11 March 2008 to clarify
                    A&amp;G’s email above and to remind them that Dr Soh should consult
                    A&amp;G and OCBC prior to any dealings in Jade shares. Dr Soh had disposed
                    of 15 million Jade shares on the previous day prior to his receipt of
                    A&amp;G’s email.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Requests by OCBC for funding for the Offer</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Under the terms of the Offer Document, the
                    Offer would have closed on 7 April 2008. As such, OCBC started making
                    requests to APLL in mid-March 2008 for funds to be made available to settle
                    acceptances of the Offer. According to OCBC, APLL informed OCBC that the funds
                    would be in the form of a banker’s guarantee. On or about 19 March
                    2008, Dr Soh informed OCBC that APLL had procured a bank guarantee
                    (purportedly issued by SCB Jakarta) to pay for acceptances of the Offer
                    (“the Bank Guarantee”); that SCB Jakarta would be sending a funds
                    confirmation to OCBC via SWIFT for this purpose and that SCB Jakarta would issue
                    the Bank Guarantee (which was for US$50m) and a second bank guarantee (for
                    US$50m) to settle the Offer. However, from 19 March to 25 March 2008,
                    OCBC, despite making numerous attempts, was unable to locate the SWIFT for the
                    Bank Guarantee. On 26 March 2008, Dr Soh provided OCBC with a copy of
                    the SWIFT of the Bank Guarantee (the First SWIFT). However, OCBC was still
                    unable to locate the First SWIFT in its system. The OCBC team were subsequently
                    informed, on 27 March 2008, by OCBC’s SWIFT Operations Department
                    that there were several irregularities in the copy of the First SWIFT which
                    Dr Soh had provided to OCBC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The calls to SCB Jakarta</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     On 27 March 2008, Tan telephoned a person
                    who identified himself as “Mr Ng” using the “direct
                    dial” number on the First Letter. This person informed Tan that SCB
                    Jakarta’s SWIFT Operations Department would contact OCBC’s SWIFT
                    Operations Department. However, OCBC’s SWIFT Operations Department did not
                    receive any communication from SCB Jakarta. Tan also called the main line of SCB
                    Jakarta to enquire about the status of the Bank Guarantee and managed to speak
                    to one Mr Ng (one of the purported signatories of the First Letter).
                    According to Tan, this was a different person from the one who had identified
                    himself as “Mr Ng” when OCBC called the number on the First
                    Letter. This Mr Ng informed OCBC that he did not sign the First Letter and
                    that Mr Lim, the other purported signatory of the First Letter, had retired
                    from SCB Jakarta in January 2008. OCBC was then referred to Kuncahyo Bangun
                    (“Bangun”) of the trade services department of SCB Jakarta, who
                    handled bankers’ guarantees issued by SCB Jakarta. Bangun verbally
                    informed OCBC that SCB Jakarta had never issued the First or the Second Letters
                    or the Bank Guarantee. Subsequently, OCBC received two emails from Bangun (dated
                    27 March 2008 and 28 March 2008) which stated that SCB Jakarta had
                    never issued the First Letter, the Second Letter and the Bank
                Guarantee.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The telephone conference with Dr Soh on 27 March
                2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In the evening of 27 March 2008, OCBC and
                    A&amp;G conducted a telephone conference with Dr Soh and informed him of
                    the telephone call to the main line of SCB Jakarta. Dr Soh sounded alarmed
                    at the news and suggested that he may have been a victim of fraud. He assured
                    OCBC and A&amp;G that he would clarify the matter and agreed to meet OCBC and
                    A&amp;G to further discuss the matter the following day. This conference call on
                    27 March 2008 was recorded. From the transcript, it appeared that it was at
                    this telephone conference that Dr Soh mentioned Dr Rahman and FCGIL to
                    OCBC and A&amp;G for the first time. This is clear from the following extract (p
                    2) of the transcript of the telephone conference:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Ai Liang:    Can I. Doctor Soh <em>can I
                                just clarify who is Dr Rahman?</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Anthony Soh:    Doctor Rahman is a co-signatory. He is a
                            fund manager of a fund that we both manage sometime ag, few years back.
                            So we made quite some money from the fund and then the profit, we set
                            aside into a separate account and two of us are signatories. There are
                            two signatories of this account. <em>The account under
                                something called First Capital Growth Investment</em> and this
                            account handled by our lawyer, Ng Kim Tian. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">At the trial, Tsai (PW2) testified that she only heard about FCGIL and
                    its account in SCB Jakarta on 27 March 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     It is also apparent from the transcript of the
                    conference call that Dr Soh stated during this conference call that,
                        <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_78-p2_a"></a>(a)     He still held the original of the
                        Second Letter as well as the copy of the First SWIFT which he had provided
                        to OCBC;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_78-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        First SWIFT could still be held up at the office of JP Morgan or the
                        Monetary Authority of Singapore since it involved US dollars and that might
                        be the reason why the Plaintiff’s SWIFT operations was unable to
                        locate it;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_78-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        US$100m was held in the SCB Jakarta bank account of FCGIL which had a total
                        of approximately US$300m to which Dr Soh had a one-third
                    share;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_78-p2_d"></a>(d)     He might
                        have been a victim of fraud;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_78-p2_e"></a>(e)     He could arrange for the remittance of S$10m-S$20m from
                        his accounts with other banks to OCBC to satisfy acceptances of the Offer
                        once it turned conditional;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_78-p2_f"></a>(f)     He held 46% of Jade’s
                    shareholding;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_78-p2_g"></a>(g)     He
                        did not want OCBC to report the matter to the SIC immediately and needed
                        some time to resolve the issue;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_78-p2_h"></a>(h)     He would get Dr Rahman down to Singapore to meet
                        with all parties and clarify the matter;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_78-p2_i"></a>(i)     He wanted to meet OCBC and A&amp;G the next day
                        when he would then have the opportunity to verify whether there were indeed
                        two Mr Ngs and if so, to confront Dr Rahman about the different
                        versions of facts presented by the two Mr Ngs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The meeting in the morning on 28 March 2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     OCBC, A&amp;G and Dr Soh attended a
                    meeting in the morning on 28 March 2008. Dr Rahman was absent.
                    Dr Soh informed the parties at the meeting that Opes Prime had been placed
                    under receivership and that this would affect his shareholding in Jade as a
                    result of the arrangement he had with Opes Prime under the GMSLA. According to
                    OCBC, to the surprise of OCBC’s team, A&amp;G informed Dr Soh that it
                    had not yet received a copy of the GMSLA. OCBC claimed but which Dr Soh
                    denied, that at the meeting, Dr Soh had suggested to OCBC and A&amp;G that
                    APLL rely on Opes Prime’s receivership as a basis to withdraw the
                    Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     At the meeting, Dr Soh also claimed that
                    he was arranging for a credit facility from Deutsche Bank. However, OCBC was
                    unable to verify Dr Soh’s claim because the officer at Deutsche Bank
                    with whom OCBC’s team spoke (on the telephone) was unwilling to reveal any
                    details to OCBC on grounds of banking secrecy. Although Dr Soh was present
                    with OCBC when the call to Deutsche Bank was placed, he remained silent when
                    OCBC was on the telephone with Deutsche Bank’s officer. Subsequently, OCBC
                    requested for and Dr Soh agreed to provide, a list of assets which
                    Dr Soh owned that could be liquidated for cash to support full acceptances
                    of the Offer. This list was provided to OCBC the following morning. In the list,
                    Dr Soh declared that he had the following assets:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">a.</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">A bungalow, an office unit and a condominium unit
                            valued at $23m in total and on which loans amounting to $7.08m had been
                            taken out;</div>

                            list of assets, Dr Soh also informed OCBC that the asset pledged
                            for the Offer was based on a current account at SCB belonging to FCGIL
                            which had a deposit of US$625m and which was co-owned equally by three
                            shareholders – Dr Rahman, Dr Soh and one Isnin Rahim
                            (“Isnin”). Dr Soh claimed that US$200m of the monies
                            in the account belonged to him. Additionally, at the meeting on
                            28 March 2008, Dr Soh provided OCBC with a copy of a bank
                            statement dated 6 February 2008 which recorded that FCGIL had a
                            balance of $625,002,745.20 in an account with SCB. OCBC requested that
                            Dr Soh provide an updated bank statement.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Thereafter, OCBC made telephone calls, in
                    Dr Soh’s presence, to Mr Ng (using the SCB Jakarta main line)
                    and to the person who identified himself as “Mr Ng” (using
                    the telephone number indicated on the First letter). The latter
                    “Mr Ng” insisted that the funding from SCB Jakarta for the
                    Offer was still in place whilst the former denied having sent the First Letter
                    or the Second Letter. Dr Soh also called Dr Rahman on speaker phone to
                    inform him that OCBC had not received the First SWIFT and that Mr Ng, who
                    was contacted through the SCB Jakarta main line, denied that the First and
                    Second Letters and the First SWIFT were issued by SCB Jakarta. In this telephone
                    conversation, Dr Rahman told Dr Soh that he would check and follow up
                    accordingly. According to Dr Soh (but disputed by OCBC), Dr Rahman
                    also informed Dr Soh that someone had tried to “disturb the
                    deal”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     At around 11am, OCBC decided to send a SWIFT
                    message to SCB Jakarta through OCBC’s SWIFT system to seek confirmation
                    that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">SCB Jakarta had earmarked US$100m for APLL in
                            connection with the Offer;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">APLL had sufficient financial resources to
                            satisfy full acceptance of the Offer; and</div>

                            form of the First SWIFT.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Just before the meeting ended, Dr Soh
                    provided OCBC with the original of the Second Letter but stated that he had not
                    received the original of the First Letter from SCB Jakarta.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The meeting in the evening on 28 March 2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     A meeting, attended by OCBC, A&amp;G and
                    Dr Soh, was reconvened at 5pm on 28 March 2008. Halfway through this
                    meeting, a letter was received from Deutsche Bank stating that there was an
                    understanding that Dr Soh would be transferring US$50m – US$100m from
                    SCB Jakarta to APLL’s account with Deutsche Bank and, out of those funds,
                    US$10m would be used to satisfy acceptances of the Offer. It was emphasised in
                    the letter that the letter should not be construed as the grant of a credit
                    facility. OCBC was of the view that the letter was insufficient confirmation of
                    APLL’s financial resources.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     At this meeting, calls were made to the two
                    “Mr Ng”s again to check if they had received OCBC’s
                    SWIFT. The Mr Ng whom OCBC called using the number on the First Letter
                    claimed that he had not received any SWIFT from OCBC and that he would check
                    again with Dr Rahman on the SWIFT from OCBC. When he was asked about SCB
                    Jakarta’s address, this Mr Ng was unable to give a clear answer and
                    could only provide the street name of SCB Jakarta after a while. He then claimed
                    that he was at a meeting with clients and hung up abruptly. OCBC was unable to
                    contact the other Mr Ng through the main line of SCB Jakarta.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Towards the end of the meeting, A&amp;G
                    informed Dr Soh that they would be advising OCBC to inform the SIC of the
                    events that had transpired. Dr Soh asked for more time to resolve the issue
                    of his proof of funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Immediately after the meeting and after
                    Dr Soh had left, OCBC and A&amp;G called the SIC and informed it of the
                    events that had transpired.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     A&amp;G discharged themselves as legal
                    advisers to APLL on 29 March 2008 and, on 30 March 2008, APLL
                    appointed Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP (“Rodyk”) in place of
                    A&amp;G.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Dr Soh’s further attempts to show that he had the
                financial resources for the Offer</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     On 29 March 2008, Dr Soh had a
                    conference call with the OCBC team in which he claimed that he was arranging for
                    a US$80m credit line from Deutsche Bank on the backing of a US$100m
                    banker’s guarantee to be sent by SCB Jakarta to Deutsche Bank. Dr Soh
                    also said that as a back-up plan, he was concurrently arranging a US$100m
                    banker’s guarantee from HSBC London to Deutsche Bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     In the evening on 29 March 2008, OCBC
                    received an email from Dr Soh in which Dr Soh explained that
                    Dr Rahman had discussed the matter with the President of SCB Jakarta and
                    that the First SWIFT did not reach OCBC due to the use of an improper format. He
                    further stated that SCB Jakarta would resend the necessary SWIFT confirmation
                    using the correct format.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     On the morning of 31 March 2008, OCBC and
                    its newly appointed solicitors, Rajah &amp; Tann LLP (“R&amp;T”)
                    met with Dr Soh. According to OCBC, at the meeting, Dr Soh informed
                    OCBC that, in addition to the 140 million shares that had been pledged to Opes
                    Prime, a further (approximately) 155 million Jade shares had been pledged to
                    Opes Prime under the GMSLA. (Dr Soh disputed this point and asserted that
                    he had made full disclosure of the transfer of 300,050,000 Jade shares to Opes
                    Prime under the GMSLA as early as 31 January 2008). Further, Dr Soh
                    made the following statements at this meeting:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_91-p2_a"></a>(a)     The First SWIFT was not sent by SCB
                        Jakarta due to a “human factor”. Dr Rahman had made a
                        complaint to the President of SCB Jakarta and expected the SWIFT
                        Confirmation to reach OCBC by the end of the current or following
                        day;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_91-p2_b"></a>(b)     The most
                        realistic option for the provision of funds would be for APLL to obtain a
                        credit line from Deutsche Bank;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_91-p2_c"></a>(c)     Dr Soh expected his current financial resources to
                        be sufficient to settle acceptances should the Offer turn unconditional and
                        was not counting on OCBC to provide financing for the
                    Offer;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_91-p2_d"></a>(d)     Dr Soh
                        had reasons to believe that he owned 46% of the Jade shares up until Opes
                        Prime was placed into receivership and that he was currently in the process
                        of establishing whether he still retained beneficial interest in the 295
                        million Jade shares;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_91-p2_e"></a>(e)     Dr Soh planned to instruct his Australian lawyers to apply for
                        an injunction to restrain Merrill Lynch from selling the Jade shares. His
                        lawyers were going to submit representations to the Opes Prime receivers to
                        state that the shares belonged to him. Furthermore, Dr Soh said that he
                        planned to redeem the Jade shares and repay the outstanding loan of US$27m
                        through a financing facility with UBS Bank using the “pledged”
                        Jade shares as collateral.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     At the same meeting, Dr Soh gave OCBC a
                    copy of a letter apparently issued by SCB Jakarta on 10 August 2007 to FCGIL,
                    confirming that FCGIL had US$625m in an account with the London branch of SCB
                    and that Dr Soh and Dr Rahman were the authorised signatories of that
                    account. Dr Soh relied on the letter to claim that he had sufficient
                    financial resources to satisfy the Offer as he was a one-third shareholder of
                    FCGIL.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Second SWIFT</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     On 1 April 2008, Rodyk sent an email to
                    OCBC attaching a copy of a purported confirmation from SCB Jakarta that the
                    SWIFT remittance of US$100m would be effected that day (the Second SWIFT). By
                    the close of business on 1 April 2008, OCBC still had not received the
                    Second SWIFT. Dr Soh called Tan twice on 1 April 2008 to inform Tan
                    that SCB Jakarta had already sent the Second SWIFT to OCBC and that someone from
                    OCBC’s SWIFT Operations Department by the name of “Jessica Tan Wei
                    Sze” had acknowledged receipt of the Second SWIFT. Dr Soh also
                    promised Tan that he would provide OCBC with a copy of the Second SWIFT the next
                    morning. However, OCBC was unable to locate either the Second SWIFT or any
                    employee by the name of “Jessica Tan Wei Sze”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Third Letter from SCB Jakarta</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     On 2 April 2008, Dr Soh emailed to
                    Tan a copy of a letter dated 1 April 2008 purportedly issued by SCB Jakarta
                    to FCGIL enclosing a statement of account as of 31 March 2008 in respect of
                    FCGIL’s account with SCB Jakarta (the Third Letter). The purported
                    signatories of the Third Letter were “Mr Ng” and
                    “Mr Lim”. The Third Letter stated that SCB Jakarta was
                    “transmitting [FCGIL’s] instrument amounting to United States
                    Dollars One hundred (US$100) millions to OCBC Bank in Singapore today”.
                    Tan called OCBC’s SWIFT Operations Department to check if there were any
                    SWIFT messages received from SCB Jakarta in favour of APLL on 1 April 2008
                    but was informed that no such messages had been received as of 2 April
                    2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The resignation of OCBC and Rodyk and the withdrawal of the
                Offer</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     On 31 March 2008, Tsai flew to Jakarta
                    and met the president-director of OCBC’s subsidiary, PT Bank OCBC
                    Indonesia, Lo Nyen Khing (“Lo”). Lo informed Tsai that the
                    signatures of “Mr Ng” and “Mr Lim” on the
                    First Letter did not match the specimen signatures in the authorised signatories
                    book in PT Bank OCBC Indonesia, and that “Mr Lim” was no
                    longer with SCB Jakarta.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     On 1 April 2008, Dr Soh, through
                    Rodyk, provided OCBC with a circular dated 1 April 2008 from Deloitte
                    Touche Tohmatsu (the receivers and managers of Opes Prime) (the “Deloitte
                    Circular”). The Deloitte Circular explained that the title to the shares
                    “lent” to Opes Prime was in fact fully transferred to Opes Prime.
                    This meant that APLL only held 16% and not 46% of Jade’s shareholding. In
                    a telephone call at 7 pm on 1 April 2008, Rodyk informed OCBC that APLL
                    would not have sufficient funds to pay for full acceptance of the Offer if it
                    transpired that APLL did not own the 30% block of shares which were
                    “pledged” to Opes Prime. Later that evening, APLL wrote to the
                    Board of Jade informing that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A circular from the receivers and managers of [Opes Prime] appointed by
                        ANZ Banking Group, a creditor of [Opes Prime], dated 1 April 2008
                        … informed the clients of [Opes Prime] that where securities are
                        “lent” to [Opes Prime], absolute title to the securities
                        passes from the lender to [Opes Prime] (as borrower).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On the basis of APLL’s letter, Jade called for a trading halt
                    with immediate effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     As of 2 April 2008, OCBC was still unable
                    to locate any SWIFT messages received from SCB Jakarta in favour of APLL. In the
                    light of the developments, OCBC resigned as financial adviser to APLL. According
                    to Ang, she informed Dr Soh of this resignation which news Dr Soh
                    accepted without raising any objections. Tan then delivered a copy of
                    OCBC’s discharge letter to Dr Soh’s residence. At 7 pm, OCBC
                    sent an email to Dr Soh and Rodyk to inform them that OCBC was discharging
                    itself as financial adviser to APLL and to attach a copy of OCBC’s
                    discharge letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     On 3 April 2008, Rodyk also resigned as
                    legal adviser to APLL in relation to the Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The withdrawal of the Offer</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Although OCBC had resigned as
                    Dr Soh’s financial adviser, Dr Soh still contacted the OCBC team
                    on 3 April 2008 to inform OCBC that the SIC had requested that he provide
                    OCBC with a confirmation of his financial capacity to complete the Offer by noon
                    on 4 April 2008 via a SWIFT confirmation, failing which the SIC would
                    require APLL to withdraw the Offer. Dr Soh also informed OCBC that he had
                    cancelled the Second SWIFT and had instructed SCB Jakarta to send another SWIFT
                    confirmation to OCBC (the Third SWIFT). By the expiry of SIC’s deadline,
                    OCBC’s SWIFT Operations Department was still unable to locate the Third
                    SWIFT. At the suggestion of the SIC, Tan made another inquiry with SCB Jakarta
                    to confirm whether SCB Jakarta had issued any SWIFT messages to OCBC during the
                    relevant period of time. The bank officer that Tan spoke to confirmed that SCB
                    Jakarta had not issued any SWIFT messages to OCBC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    On 4 April 2008, APLL withdrew the
                    Offer with the consent of the SIC. Jade announced that the Offer was withdrawn
                    with immediate effect. On 9 April 2008, Jade announced on SGXNET that
                    Merrill Lynch had reduced its stake in Jade from 26.49% to 16.66% on
                    1 April 2008 and that the decrease was due to a sale of Jade shares
                    pursuant to Merrill Lynch’s rights under the GMSLA. On 7 April 2008,
                    16 April 2008 and 30 April 2008, SFL force-sold 8 million, 12 million
                    and 17 million Jade shares respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    On 17 April 2008, in response to a
                    query by R&amp;T, SCB Jakarta confirmed that various documents, including the
                    First, Second and Third Letters and the First, Second and Third SWIFTs were
                    never issued by them and that Mr Ng could not be reached at the
                    “direct dial” number displayed on the First Letter. This was
                    further confirmed by an exchange of SWIFT messages between OCBC and SCB Jakarta
                    on 22 and 29 April 2008.</p>

                    relation to the withdrawal of the Offer by APLL for Jade. The findings of the
                    SIC hearing committee were not disputed by either party.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(1) Findings in relation to Dr Soh</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    The SIC hearing committee found that
                    Dr Soh had committed multiple and serious breaches of the Code. In
                    particular, he had breached General Principle 6 and Rules 3.5(c), 8.2, 23.3(c)
                    and 11.2 of the Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    The SIC hearing committee found no
                    indication from OCBC that Dr Soh could reasonably have relied upon to
                    conclude that OCBC would provide Dr Soh with the necessary financing to
                    satisfy acceptances of the Offer. The SIC hearing committee further stated that
                    assuming arrangements were in place for a credit line to be available for
                    Dr Soh to draw upon to satisfy acceptances, it was still ultimately
                    dependent on receipt of an acceptable banker’s guarantee. The SIC hearing
                    committee found that ultimately, all the reasonable measures that Dr Soh
                    claimed to have taken to secure the necessary funding for the Offer boiled down
                    to a mere verbal agreement with Dr Rahman for the banker’s guarantee.
                    Further, it stated that Dr Soh had a separate and distinct obligation from
                    his advisers to satisfy himself that he could implement the Offer in full and he
                    was not relieved of this obligation by OCBC’s confirmation of APLL’s
                    financial resources.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    The SIC hearing committee found that
                    Dr Soh did not present the information on his shareholdings accurately and
                    fairly under Rule 8.2 of the Code by his bare statement that he had a deemed
                    interest in the shares affected by the GMSLA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    The SIC hearing committee found Dr Soh
                    to be in breach of Rules 3.5(c), 23.3(c) and 8.2 of the Code in failing to
                    disclose Faitheagle’s sales of Jade shares in February 2008 and Opes
                    Prime’s forced sale on 21 January 2008. As for the sale of 50.2
                    million Jade shares by Faitheagle during the Offer period between
                    21 February 2008 and 31 March 2008, the SIC hearing committee held
                    that this contravened Rule 11.2 of the Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(2) The findings in relation to OCBC </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    OCBC was found to have breached Rules 3.5
                    and 23.8 of the Code in respect of its financial resources confirmation and
                    Rules 3.5(c), 23.3(c) and 8.2 of the Code in respect of the disclosure of
                    shareholdings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    The SIC hearing committee held that OCBC
                    should have independently verified the contents of the First Letter by calling
                    the main line of SCB Jakarta.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    The SIC hearing committee noted that OCBC
                    never followed up with A&amp;G on whether A&amp;G had reviewed the GMSLA. OCBC
                    should have sought but failed to seek, clarification from A&amp;G on the
                    ownership status of the Jade shares under the GMSLA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    The SIC hearing committee accepted that
                    Dr Soh’s reticence and breaches of the Code deprived OCBC of the
                    opportunity to detect his failings and to advise him properly. It held that
                    OCBC’s breaches were relatively less culpable than Dr Soh’s
                    overall conduct. Although there might have been a deception on OCBC in respect
                    of the confirmation letters purportedly issued by SCB Jakarta, the SIC hearing
                    committee was unable to express an opinion as to whether Dr Soh was
                    complicit in this deception.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">OCBC’s witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    OCBC had seven factual witnesses and one
                    expert witness. Tan, Tsai and Ang were from the OCBC team who liaised with
                    Dr Soh regarding the Offer. At the material time, Tan was a manager in,
                    Tsai was the head of and Ang was the Vice President of, OCBC’s Corporate
                    Finance Department. Tsai left the daily management of the Offer to Tan and Ang.
                    Whilst Tan was not present at the meeting on 31 January 2008, he was
                    instructed by Ang to conduct due diligence checks on APLL, Dr Soh and Jade,
                    and to assist with the Offer thereafter. All three witnesses had consistent
                    testimonies of what had occurred throughout their dealings with Dr Soh and
                    APLL. More importantly, their accounts of what transpired at their meetings with
                    Dr Soh corresponded with the minutes taken by Ang at those meetings as well
                    as the transcripts of such meetings, where available.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_112-p2_a"></a>(a)     In particular, all three witnesses
                        were adamant that Dr Soh had never requested a loan and OCBC had never
                        offered to provide APLL with the requisite funding for the
                    Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_112-p2_b"></a>(b)     They also
                        consistently emphasised that during the First Meeting, Dr Soh never
                        mentioned FCGIL, Faitheagle or Dr Rahman and did not inform OCBC about
                        the margin calls by Opes Prime and SFL, the forced sale of Jade shares by
                        Opes Prime, and the provision of further collateral to those financiers,
                        even though the events took place just a few days prior to that
                        meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_112-p2_c"></a>(c)     All
                        three witnesses also took the position that Dr Soh never disclosed to
                        OCBC the various dealings in Jade shares by APLL and Faitheagle from January
                        to March 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_112-p2_d"></a>(d)     Additionally, Tan and Ang claimed that Dr Soh had stated at the
                        Kick-off Meeting that APLL had transferred 140,000,000 (and not 300,050,000)
                        Jade shares to Opes Prime and had retained full beneficial ownership over
                        those Jade shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_112-p2_e"></a>(e)     The witnesses also stated that there was no reason for OCBC to
                        disbelieve Dr Soh’s representations on shareholdings, financial
                        resources and the motivations for making the Offer, and they did not suspect
                        that any of those representations were untrue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Dina Artarini (“Artarini”) is
                    currently the Head of Legal and Head of Wholesale Banking Legal in SCB Jakarta.
                    At the trial, she testified that, having searched through SCB Jakarta’s
                    register of outgoing letters and list of authorised signatories and having
                    conducted checks on “Felix Berdhi Santoso”, she could confirm that
                    the Fourth Letter was never issued with the authority of SCB
                Jakarta.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Stephen Edward Clark (“Clark”)
                    was OCBC’s expert witness. He is, and has been since 1988, a managing
                    director of The Anglo Chinese Investment Company, Limited, a business based in
                    Hong Kong, which he jointly founded and which is active in a wide range of
                    corporate finance transactions. Since 1976, Clark (PW5) had worked continuously
                    in corporate finance. He was a member of the Committee on Takeovers and Mergers
                    in Hong Kong from 1984 until it was replaced in 1992 by the Hong Kong Takeovers
                    and Mergers Panel. He has been a member of the Hong Kong Takeovers and Mergers
                    Panel since its inception and its chairman since 1 April 2009, having
                    previously been its acting chairman and a deputy chairman. OCBC engaged Clark to
                    provide an independent expert report on OCBC’s conduct as the financial
                    adviser to APLL in connection with the Offer. Consistent with OCBC’s
                    position at the trial, Clark did not dispute the reasonableness of the
                    SIC’s decision in connection with OCBC’s conduct during the Offer
                    and while it was in preparation. In fact, he stated that it was not his place to
                    criticise the SIC’s decision and that he was not prepared to do so since
                    he chairs the equivalent committee in Hong Kong. Nevertheless, Clark was of the
                    opinion that <em>in the circumstances which OCBC found itself, it
                        was not possible for it to give proper advice on the conduct of the Offer
                        because it was so far from being properly and fully informed</em>.
                    Clark was also of the opinion that OCBC had adopted the approach of a reasonably
                    competent financial adviser during its engagement. The details of and reasons
                    for Clark’s expert opinion will be discussed below (at <a href="#p1_250">[250]</a>-<a href="#p1_256">[256]</a>), suffice it to say at this juncture, I found Clark’s
                    reasoning and conclusions persuasive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Hui Yew Ping (“Hui”) is
                    currently the managing director of OCBC Securities. Hui (PW6) deposed that, at
                    all material times, the addressees of an over-the-wall memorandum sent by Tan on
                    1 February 2008 (Mike Tan, Matilda Su and himself) (see <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> above) had complied with the terms of the
                    memorandum in that they had kept all information obtained from their involvement
                    in the exercise confidential and did not trade in the shares or other securities
                    of Jade. With regard to the defendants’ allegation that OCBC Securities
                    had increased its shareholding in Jade from 84,680,000 to 100,386,000 between
                    31 January 2008 and 15 February 2008, Hui emphasised that all the
                    transactions pertaining to Jade shares during that period were carried out
                    solely for and on the behalf of customers of OCBC Securities and that his
                    company did not hold any beneficial interest in such shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Felicia Goh (“Goh”) is an
                    officer in the SWIFT Operations Unit of OCBC’s Payment Operations
                    (Operations &amp; Technologies Division) Department (“the SWIFT
                    Operations Department”). Between 20 March 2008 and 6 April
                    2008, Goh (PW7) was tasked to check if OCBC had received any SWIFT message from
                    SCB Jakarta. In particular, Tan had requested that Goh locate the First, Second
                    and Third SWIFTs. Goh deposed that she had searched OCBC’s SWIFT system
                    but was unable to locate all three SWIFTs. She had since been given copies of
                    all three SWIFTs. Goh explained in detail why the copies of the three SWIFTs
                    were irregular and did not conform to the format of a typical SWIFT message. She
                    also confirmed that she had told Tan that there was no such person named
                    “Jessica Tan Wei Sze” working in OCBC’s SWIFT Operations
                    Department.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    Joice Tan (“Joice”) is the
                    Associate Director (Team Leader) of Emerging Businesses (EmB) at OCBC’s
                    Enterprise Banking Department (“the EB Department”) which is
                    responsible for opening and managing accounts for small and medium enterprises
                    and also offers credit facilities to such enterprises. The EB Department
                    operated/operates independently from OCBC’s Corporate Finance Department
                    and both departments had/have no access to one another’s confidential
                    customer information. As such, Joice (PW8) stated that the Corporate Finance
                    Department would not, at any point in time, have been apprised of the amount of
                    cash that APLL held in its bank account with OCBC that was managed by the EB
                    Department.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    According to Joice, the relationship between
                    the EB Department and Dr Soh concerned only the administration and
                    maintenance of the accounts of Jade and APLL with OCBC and no formal discussions
                    on the provision of funding by OCBC to Dr Soh, APLL or Jade had ever taken
                    place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Joice described her meeting with Dr Soh
                    in April 2007 as one where Dr Soh had informed Joice and her colleagues
                    that APLL wished to open a current account with OCBC and where he provided them
                    with particulars of APLL, including information relating to the nature of its
                    business and its background for the purposes of satisfying OCBC’s
                    “know-your-client” procedures. The account was subsequently opened
                    on 5 July 2007. Joice stated that at the April 2007 meeting and throughout
                    the period when OCBC was managing APLL’s account, Dr Soh never
                    requested a loan from OCBC to finance any take-over offer by APLL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    Joice described her second contact with
                    Dr Soh in November 2007, as one where he had called her to enquire if
                    OCBC’s EB Department would be interested in granting him a loan of about
                    S$100m. As this was an informal enquiry by telephone, Joice was unable to
                    confirm, when cross-examined, if the loan related to the <em>purchase of</em> an Indonesian oil <em>field</em> or if it was in respect of an <em>oil
                        deal</em>. Moreover, Joice stated that she was unaware that the oil
                    deal was for Jade and not for APLL. She disagreed with Dr Soh’s claim
                    that a meeting had taken place between herself, Hoi, Dr Soh and the head of
                    OCBC’s EB Department, where Dr Soh had showed the attendees a draft
                    bank guarantee from SCB Jakarta and where OCBC had expressed a keen interest to
                    do the deal on the back of the draft guarantee. Joice emphasised that
                    Dr Soh never made a formal request for financing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    With regard to an email from Hoi (an account
                    manager in Joice’s team) to Tan on 4 March 2008 wherein Hoi had
                    provided Tan with OCBC’s interest rates as requested by Tan and queried
                    Tan on what type of business proposal OCBC was granting to Dr Soh upon
                    receipt of a bank guarantee from him, Joice described this as “a general
                    sales question”. In his reply to Hoi’s email on 6 March 2008,
                    Tan had informed Hoi that his request for OCBC’s interest rates were for
                    reference only and that OCBC would not be granting any loans or guarantee to
                    Dr Soh or APLL for the Offer. After the exchange of emails in March 2008,
                    neither Tan nor Dr Soh approached OCBC’s EB Department to request for
                    funding to be provided to APLL for the Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendants’ witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Dr Soh (DW1) was the only factual
                    witness for the defendants. This was despite the fact that much of his evidence
                    referred to conversations with and/or the actions of other individuals such as
                    Dr Rahman, Isnin, Norman, William Chan and Cindy Goh.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Dr Soh’s testimony</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    Dr Soh has been in business since he
                    left medical practice in 1992. Despite his years of experience as a businessman
                    and the fact that, at the material time, Dr Soh was a director and
                    shareholder of several companies (see <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>
                    above), Dr Soh claimed that he had been the victim of a fraud perpetrated
                    by Dr Rahman whom Dr Soh had been unable to contact since October
                    2008. In his submissions at the SIC inquiry, in his AEIC and during his
                    cross-examination at this trial, Dr Soh proffered various (and sometimes
                    contradictory) explanations for the events that occurred in the lead-up to the
                    withdrawal of the Offer, particularly with regard to his undisclosed dealings in
                    Jade shares.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    According to Dr Soh, Dr Rahman was
                    first introduced to Dr Soh on 5 May 2006 as a “high net worth
                    Malaysian investor” by one Steven Ow, a Malaysian broker residing in
                    Singapore. When Dr Soh first met Dr Rahman, the latter was with Isnin
                    who was introduced to Dr Soh as a director of a listed Malaysian
                    construction company. Dr Soh later learnt that Isnin was
                    Dr Rahman’s business partner. At that meeting, Dr Rahman
                    informed Dr Soh that he was interested in investing with Dr Soh and
                    that he was the signatory of a bank account maintained with SCB Jakarta which
                    had the sum of US$500m belonging to a highly placed Malaysian personality.
                    Dr Rahman explained to Dr Soh that although he could not withdraw or
                    remit the money from the account, the fund could be used as a means of financing
                    transactions through the grant of bank guarantees or standby letters of credit
                    secured against those funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Dr Soh claimed that he had conducted
                    initial due diligence on Dr Rahman. However, this consisted only of
                    telephoning Steven Ow and Isnin to confirm Dr Rahman’s identity and
                    the source of funds in the SCB Jakarta and conducting an internet search on
                    Dr Rahman which yielded no useful results. This was despite the fact that
                    Dr Soh had only met Isnin once, Dr Rahman was present at that meeting
                    and Dr Soh was aware that Dr Rahman and Isnin were very close friends.
                    Dr Soh also claimed that he was assured of Dr Rahman’s
                    creditworthiness and the existence of the SCB Jakarta account because he
                    believed that Dr Rahman had successfully applied for a Privilege Banking
                    Account with United Overseas Bank (“UOB”) by 8 November 2006 using
                    copies of his SCB Jakarta account statements. Apart from the quantum leap in
                    logic in assuming a privilege banking customer of UOB Singapore was creditworthy
                    to the extent of US$500m, Dr Soh did not produce any evidence to support
                    his belief.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B) Dr Soh’s business dealings with
                Dr Rahman</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    In his AEIC, Dr Soh claimed that he
                    took on Dr Rahman as a client using APVC (see <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above) as the business vehicle whereby APVC would act as
                    Dr Rahman’s broker and procure investments for Dr Rahman (who
                    would finance the investments) with any profits generated to be shared <em>equally</em> between Dr Rahman and APVC. Dr Soh
                    prepared a Client Evaluation Summary, dated 6 May 2006, containing
                    information that would be supplied to banks or other financial institutions for
                    the purpose of verifying Dr Rahman’s identity and business
                    activities. Dr Soh also had Dr Rahman execute (1) a Letter of Intent
                    which confirmed that Dr Rahman was willing “to enter US$500m for
                    [his] participation into a Private Placement – Buy/Sell
                    Transaction” and which authorised Dr Soh to verify and confirm that
                    Dr Rahman had the funds to enter into the transaction; (2) a Bond Power of
                    Authorisation which authorised Dr Soh as Dr Rahman’s agent to
                    negotiate with financial partners and entities to develop Dr Rahman’s
                    monies in his SCB Jakarta account; and (3) a Fee Protection Agreement, under
                    which Dr Rahman agreed to pay transactional fees to APVC amounting to 5% of
                    all profits made on each successful transaction, to be divided in the following
                    manner: 2% each to Steven Ow and another person and 1% to FCGIL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    Dr Soh also prepared a Joint Venture
                    Agreement dated 6 May 2006, (“the JVA”). The terms of the JVA
                    obliged Dr Rahman to pledge the sum of US$500m in his SCB Jakarta bank
                    account to APVC for investment purposes for at least one year plus one day. Both
                    Dr Rahman and APVC were to have an equal share of the profits payable from
                    the Profit Disbursement Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    According to Dr Soh, he carried out two
                    to three transactions with Dr Rahman in the period up to 25 July 2006.
                    In those transactions, Dr Soh would help to broker agreements between third
                    parties for the sale and purchase of commodities. The funds in the SCB Jakarta
                    account would be used to secure bank guarantees in order to open credit lines
                    with financial institutions. APVC would be listed as the buyer of the
                    commodities from the vendor and would sell the commodities in turn to the
                    purchaser, thereby generating profits in those transactions as a middleman.
                    According to Dr Soh, Dr Rahman made the ultimate decision whether to
                    proceed with a transaction and Dr Rahman dealt with the European brokers
                    directly once Dr Soh had put them in touch with him. In his AEIC,
                    Dr Soh claimed that as per the terms of the JVA, any profits generated were
                    kept by Dr Rahman in the Profit Disbursement Account, in
                    Dr Rahman’s name, at SCB Jakarta to be shared <em>equally</em> between Dr Soh and Dr Rahman. Dr Soh
                    claimed that he understood from Dr Rahman that the profits generated by
                    deals introduced by Dr Soh between May and September 2006 amounted to
                    US$125m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    However, at the trial, Dr Soh claimed
                    that he only earned 1% of any fees derived from transactions involving
                    Dr Rahman and was not told exactly how much of the profits in the Profit
                    Disbursement Account were his or when he would receive such profits. Contrary to
                    what appeared on the face of the JVA, when cross-examined on his business
                    dealings with Dr Rahman, Dr Soh took the position that he had never
                    entered into any joint venture or partnership with Dr Rahman but had only
                    acted as Dr Rahman’s broker. Dr Soh insisted that he was merely
                    a middleman at all times and did not review the information provided to him by
                    Dr Rahman. According to Dr Soh, the “business” between
                    Dr Soh and Dr Rahman included business with European brokers under a
                    European Bank Investment Programme. Dr Soh claimed that 50% of the profits
                    of each transaction would go to Dr Rahman and the European Brokers
                    respectively, out of which Dr Rahman would only give Dr Soh 5% out of
                    his 50% share of the profits which Dr Soh would distribute in accordance
                    with the Fee Protection Agreement in <a href="#p1_126">[126]</a>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    Dr Soh claimed that although there was
                    no written agreement between APVC and the European brokers and the European
                    brokers were not mentioned in the JVA, the 50% share of profits which was to be
                    distributed to APVC under the JVA was actually deducted by the European brokers,
                    out of which APVC would then be paid 2-5% of the profits. Dr Soh claimed
                    that any reference to APVC in the agreements, Letter of Intent and other
                    documents mentioned above did <em>not</em> refer to APVC
                        <em>as principal</em> but to APVC acting as an
                        <em>agent</em> for European brokers, to receive the
                    documents. Only 1% of the profits earned from bank guarantees arranged by
                    Dr Rahman belonged to Dr Soh and would be channelled to the Profit
                    Disbursement Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    At the trial, Dr Soh claimed that he
                    did not really understand the purpose of the JVA and that all the documents and
                    agreements were based on templates that he had previously used for his
                    transactions with European brokers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    Contrary to what was stated in the Letter of
                    Intent and the Bond Power of Authorisation (at <a href="#p1_126">[126]</a> above), Dr Soh testified that Dr Rahman had
                    imposed the condition that Dr Soh was to have no direct contact with any
                    officers of SCB Jakarta including the manager of Dr Rahman’s account,
                    Mr Ng. Whenever Dr Soh needed a bank guarantee, he had to get approval
                    from Dr Rahman, who would earmark funds from the SCB Jakarta account for
                    the bank guarantee.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(c)   Dr Rahman’s involvement in FCGIL</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    Dr Soh claimed that sometime in July
                    2006, Dr Rahman telephoned Dr Soh and informed him that he was having
                    difficulties with the European transactions because the SCB Jakarta account was
                    in his personal name, which was a Muslim name. Dr Rahman also felt that it
                    was more appropriate to use a company for the European transactions. Dr Soh
                    suggested to Dr Rahman that he could use FCGIL, which was then a dormant
                    company, for this purpose. Dr Rahman, Isnin and Dr Soh then became
                    equal shareholders in FCGIL through a transfer of shares to Dr Rahman and
                    Isnin by Dr Soh. Dr Soh stated that he agreed to transfer the shares
                    without consideration because Dr Rahman was transferring US$500m into
                    FCGIL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    Dr Soh claimed that he was appointed a
                    signatory of FCGIL’s bank account with SCB Jakarta, albeit with limited
                    authority in that he was not permitted to drawdown on the account but could only
                    sign off on documents committing the funds as security for transactions.
                    Dr Soh also asserted that Dr Rahman had visited him accompanied by an
                    Indonesian man (who said he was a bank officer at SCB Jakarta), who witnessed
                    Dr Soh’s signing of the bank specimen signature card for the FCGIL
                    account with SCB Jakarta. According to Dr Soh, after he completed the legal
                    documentation regarding the share transfer and the opening of a bank account for
                    FCGIL with SCB Jakarta, Dr Rahman took away the documents and gave
                    Dr Soh a copy of a 28 July 2006 statement of the SCB Jakarta account
                    which reflected that it had a credit balance of US$500,002,745.20.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    Dr Soh admitted that he abided by
                    Dr Rahman’s instructions in <a href="#p1_132">[132]</a> at all times and never dealt directly with SCB Jakarta or
                    visited SCB Jakarta or spoke to SCB Jakarta bank officers. I note however that
                    the directors’ resolution in respect of the opening of FCGIL’s
                    account with SCB Jakarta provided that the account was to be operated by
                    Dr Soh’s signature <em>and either
                    Dr </em>Rahman’s <em>or</em> Isnin’s
                    signature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    According to Dr Soh, around September
                    2006, Dr Rahman transferred US$125m (which represented profits from the
                    Profit Disbursement Account) into FCGIL’s account, leaving it with a
                    balance of US$625m. This was reflected in a bank statement. The US$125m could be
                    withdrawn if all three shareholders agreed. Dr Soh claimed that
                    Dr Rahman had informed him that Dr Soh’s share of the monies in
                    the Profit Disbursement Account was US$10m DR Rahman’s transfer of the
                    US$125m into FCGIL meant that Dr Soh’s share of the monies
                    effectively increased to US$42m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    Although Dr Soh had provided OCBC with
                    statements of the FCGIL account with SCB Jakarta dated 28 July 2006,
                    29 September 2006, 6 February 2007 and 31 March 2008, those were
                    printed on the same SCB Jakarta letterhead as the First Letter. The signatories
                    verifying the authenticity of these statements of accounts were again
                    “Mr Ng” and “Mr Lim”, and their signatures
                    on those statements were similar to the signatures found on the First Letter. A
                    letter dated 8 October 2008 issued by one Felix Berdhi Santoso of SCB
                    Jakarta to the Securities Commission in Kuala Lumpur confirming the existence of
                    the account maintained by FCGIL with SCB Jakarta was further confirmed by
                    Artarini (PW4) to be forged (see <a href="#p1_113">[113]</a>
                    above). This meant that either the FCGIL account never existed or, that the
                    statements of the FCGIL account were forged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    I agreed with OCBC’s submission that
                    Dr Soh’s evidence on how his business dealings with Dr Rahman
                    were conducted was inherently incredible. Dr Soh explained that
                    FCGIL’s account with SCB Jakarta held US$625m, of which US$500m belonged
                    to a prominent political figure and the balance of US$125m belonged to
                    Dr Rahman, Isnin and himself. The US$500m could be used to procure the
                    issue of banker’s guarantees for the benefit of third parties who wished
                    to use such guarantees to obtain credit lines. However, the funds could not be
                    remitted out of FCGIL’s account. This made little commercial sense since
                    there would be no reason why SCB Jakarta would issue a banker’s guarantee
                    on the security of a cash deposit which could not be used. It would also render
                    the First Letter useless and inaccurate since the funds could never be taken out
                    to satisfy full acceptances of the Offer. Moreover, Dr Soh did not produce
                    any evidence of a single banker’s guarantee which had been issued by SCB
                    Jakarta based on the collateral of the funds in FCGIL’s
                account.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(D)   Dr Soh’s emails with Dr Rahman</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    OCBC argued that Dr Soh’s email
                    correspondence with Dr Rahman contained cryptic messages which are set out
                    in the following paragraphs (<a href="#p1_140">[140]</a> to

                    with counsel for the plaintiff that this was “some sort of code”

<p class="Judg-1">Dr Soh agreed with counsel for OCBC that the
                    “correspondence … from SCB Jakarta to UBS Bank Singapore”
                    enclosed by Dr Rahman did not appear to be a forwarded email. Instead, it
                    seemed to be part of the email message from Dr Rahman to Dr Soh.
                    Dr Soh was unable to provide the context for this email although he agreed
                    with counsel that the email seemed to suggest that UBS had, prior to
                    29 February 2008, sent some confirmation to SCB Jakarta and that UBS had
                    confirmed that they would proceed to Singapore Central Bank for credit
                    authorisation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    Dr Soh replied to

                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear Bro,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Since William suggested that UBS Zurich may be already using our BG while
                        “waiting” for MAS approval of credit line which will take a
                        long time, he suggested that we take the approach of
                        “threatening” to cancel the swift to make UBS respond swiftly.
                        So suggest you ask Mr Ng to send the following email:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    When cross-examined on the contents of the
                    draft message that Mr Ng was to send to UBS Bank which was enclosed in
                    Dr Soh’s email, Dr Soh’s evidence was that this message
                    was drafted by William Chan. Probed on the contents of his email which preceded
                    the draft message, Dr Soh claimed that he had written the email on William
                    Chan’s instructions and had not understood most of the message.
                    Dr Soh disagreed with counsel for OCBC that the email dated 5 March
                    2008 was drafted by him in order that Dr Rahman would be able to produce a
                    forged letter signed by Mr Ng to put pressure on UBS to give Dr Soh or
                    Faitheagle a credit line.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    William Chan was not copied in the message
                    and was also not called as the defendants’ witness. It is noteworthy that
                    William Chan was Dr Soh’s employee in Jade. Further, the draft
                    message to UBS Bank that was enclosed in Dr Soh’s email referred to
                    Faitheagle’s account with UBS and William Chan was not working for
                    Faitheagle. In fact, Faitheagle was Dr Soh’s company. Dr Soh
                    could not give any convincing explanation as to why William Chan would be
                    involved in drafting a banker’s guarantee for SCB Jakarta or why William
                    Chan himself was not sending the draft to Dr Rahman (or even copied on
                    Dr Soh’s email). Dr Soh’s explanation that William Chan
                    had worked in a SWIFT operations rooms when he was at Rothschild’s and had
                    also worked as a bank regulator for the United States government such that he
                    somehow had access to the SWIFT operations rooms of all banks defies
                    belief.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(iii)   Email correspondence regarding the SWIFT of the bank
                guarantee</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    Dr Soh did not dispute Tan’s
                    evidence that on 19 March 2008, he had informed Tan that APLL had procured
                    a US$50m banker’s guarantee. Tan subsequently called Norman to inform
                    Norman that he could not locate the SWIFT of the first US$50 million
                    banker’s guarantee. On 20 March 2008, Dr Rahman emailed
                    Dr Soh with the following message:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear Bro,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">SCB Jakarta has successfully transmitted our swift MT 760 to OCBC
                        yesterday. I have instructed SCB to transmit the document to the attention
                        of Mr. Tan Wei Peng [<em>sic</em>]. <em>Thereafter, I really appreciate to communicate with Mr.
                        Tan</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, I not able to abstract a copy as Indonesia is off for holiday,
                        today and tomorrow.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Regards,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A-Rahman.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Dr Soh was unable to explain what Dr Rahman meant when he
                    said that he would “really appreciate to communicate with Mr.
                    Tan”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    On 20 March 2008, Dr Soh replied
                    to Dr Rahman as such:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear Bro,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thanks for this info, I will inform Tan wei ping in ocbc to trace and
                        retrieve the swift. <em>Any idea what is the amount
                            transmitted?</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Regards,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A Soh</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Dr Soh’s (unconvincing) explanation for his query in the
                    email, of the amount transmitted, despite his evidence that Dr Rahman had
                    told him that the bank guarantee was for US$50m was that he was merely
                    clarifying to ensure that the bank guarantee was for US$50m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    On 29 March 2008, Dr Soh sent an
                    email to Dr Rahman which stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear Bro,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Draft MT760 as spoken.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please expedite a bank statement or a swift to OCBC asking them to
                        “resend” their MT299 in MT format?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Regards</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A Soh</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There was no expression of anger or shock at being cheated or indeed
                    any demand for explanations from Dr Rahman in this email. There was not
                    even a query as to why there were apparently two “Mr Ng”s.
                    This was despite the fact that the Offer was already in jeopardy by 27 or
                    28 March 2008 and the authenticity of the First Letter had been called into
                    question. Dr Soh had also claimed, during his telephone conference with
                    OCBC on 27 March 2008 (see <a href="#p1_78">[78]</a> above),
                    that he might have been a victim of Dr Rahman’s fraud. Moreover, OCBC
                    had sent a SWIFT message to SCB Jakarta on 28 March 2008 to seek
                    confirmation that APLL had sufficient resources to satisfy full acceptance of
                    the Offer and that SCB Jakarta had sent the First SWIFT. At Dr Soh’s
                    request, a copy of the SWIFT was sent to Dr Rahman on the same
                day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    Read against the above background, there are
                    grounds to suspect that Dr Soh’s email to Dr Rahman of
                    29 March 2008 was a request for assistance to prepare more forged documents
                    to induce OCBC to believe that SCB Jakarta had in fact received OCBC’s
                    SWIFT message but that it was not in the correct format. Further, attached to
                    Dr Soh’s email were two draft banker’s guarantees in SWIFT
                    format which were addressed to OCBC and Deutsche Bank. There seemed to be no
                    reason for William Chan’s involvement in these emails (see <a href="#p1_145">[145]</a> above). I agree with OCBC’s
                    submission that a more likely explanation is that the two draft banker’s
                    guarantees were forgeries in the making and Dr Soh was personally
                    responsible for, or had a hand in, making them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(iv)   Email correspondence after 6 April 2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    Dr Soh’s evidence was that, up to
                    6 April 2008, he did not confront Dr Rahman on all the latter’s
                    broken promises. He explained that it was because until then, he had not doubted
                    Dr Rahman. On 7 April 2008, Dr Rahman sent Dr Soh an email
                    attaching a copy of a SWIFT. On 9 April 2008, Dr Soh emailed
                    Dr Rahman with the following message:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear Bro,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thanks. I understand the authority is checking with SCB through OCBC to
                        verify if our account exists in SCB etc, while they deal with me on the
                        proof of funds and other issues. Formal charges not yet but if we can prove
                        that the fund exists and I was backed up by the US$100 million earmarked for
                        the General Offer of Jade, then I think the charges will be less
                        severe.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Regards</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A Soh</p>
<p class="Judg-1">At trial, Dr Soh’s explanation for this email was that he
                    wanted Dr Rahman to prove to him that everything that Dr Rahman had
                    told Dr Soh was true. Dr Soh’s continued correspondence with
                    Dr Rahman after the Offer had been withdrawn is difficult to comprehend if
                    it is indeed true that, as Dr Soh claimed, Dr Rahman had defrauded
                    him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    On 10 October 2008, about six months
                    after the Offer had collapsed, Dr Rahman emailed Dr Soh, attaching the
                    Fourth Letter (see <a href="#p1_102">[102]</a> above).
                    Dr Soh claimed that this letter was unsolicited. It is strange that
                    Dr Soh would continue to communicate with Dr Rahman if he had indeed
                    defrauded Dr Soh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    On 15 October 2008, Dr Soh sent an
                    email to Dr Rahman. In the email, Dr Soh stated that he had called
                    Dr Rahman many times since the previous week but to no avail. He also
                    requested that Dr Rahman take a look at the Business Times report of
                    15 October 2008. Dr Soh informed Dr Rahman that the situation was
                    getting very serious with OCBC making an accusation of forgery of documents.
                    Dr Soh told Dr Rahman that the proof of the bank guarantee, bank
                    letter and fax dated 18 February 2008 was very important as it would
                    counter OCBC’s allegation. Dr Soh referred to the SCB Jakarta letter
                    dated 8 October 2008 (see <a href="#p1_151">[151]</a> above)
                    and stated that it was very important that Dr Soh personally speak to the
                    bank officer in Jakarta that issued the letter, in the presence of a third party
                    witness to confirm that SCB Jakarta had issued the letter. Dr Soh also
                    mentioned that he would need to discuss the closure of the FCGIL account with
                    Dr Rahman when he met Dr Rahman in person. When he was cross-examined
                    on these emails, Dr Soh disagreed that he and Dr Rahman were working
                    together to come up with the SCB Jakarta documents and the bank guarantees to
                    deceive financial institutions. Dr Soh also disagreed that Dr Rahman
                    was in fact working for him and he was paying Dr Rahman, as evidenced by
                    his payment of US$100,000 in November 2007 and another payment of US$100,000 in
                    March 2008 to the latter.</p>

                GROUP PRESIDENT</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    Counsel for OCBC alleged that
                    Dr Soh’s game plan was really to push up the market price of the
                    penny stock through a series of announcements (set out in <a href="#p1_154">[154]</a> to <a href="#p1_161">[161]</a>) of projects that Dr Soh had introduced to Jade while
                    he was Group President.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(i)   The Nemogold oil deal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    On 5 July 2007, Jade announced that its
                    subsidiary, Jade Commodities &amp; Resources Pte Ltd (“JCR”) had
                    entered into a service contract with FCGIL to provide contract administration
                    services to FCGIL in connection with a purchase contract entered into by FCGIL
                    with a Russian oil company, Nemogold Ltd (“Nemogold”) for the
                    purchase of an aggregate of 2,400,000 metric tonnes of Russian Gas Oil D2 for
                    about US$1.3 billion over a term of 12 months. This deal between FCGIL and
                    Nemogold was eventually called off and no delivery of oil ever took place under
                    this contract. On 17 December 2007 Jade announced that JCR had taken over
                    the FCGIL contract. According to Dr Soh, this was because the price of Jade
                    shares had increased such that Jade was able to secure credit facilities from
                    banks. However, as of the date that Dr Soh resigned from Jade, no such
                    facilities had been granted. On 9 June 2008, after Dr Soh had left
                    Jade, Jade announced the termination of the oil contract.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    On 15 June 2007, Jade announced that it
                    had incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, Jade Real Estate Pte Ltd
                    (“JRE”). In an announcement dated 26 September 2007 and in
                    Jade’s September 2007 annual report, it was announced that JRE had
                    purchased a piece of land in Johor Bahru, Malaysia for S$17,350,000 and had
                    immediately on-sold the land to Win Divine Sdn Bhd (“Win Divine”)
                    for $27m giving rise to an estimated profit before tax of $8,824,000. In the
                    26 September 2007 announcement, there was a projected earnings per share of
                    Jade from a loss of 0.17 cents per share before the sale to a gain of 0.87 cents
                    after the sale. On 27 October 2007, Jade announced that for the
                    26 September 2007 announcement, waiver had been obtained from the
                    requirement of Rule 1014 of the Listing Manual. This announcement included a
                    table showing the beneficial impact that the purchase and sale of the land had
                    on Jade’s earnings per share, gearing and net tangible assets. On
                    10 March 2008, Jade announced that it was in negotiations to mutually
                    extend the timeline for completion of the purchase and sale of the land to a
                    date no later than 30 June 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    On 23 June 2008, it was announced that
                    Win Divine and Jade had, on 20 June 2008, mutually agreed to terminate with
                    immediate effect, the Sale and Purchase Agreement referred to in the
                    announcements made on 26 September 2007 and 27 October
                2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(iii)   The project manager services letter of intent with Maxwell
                Rainbow</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    On 28 June 2008, Jade announced that
                    JRE had entered into a non-binding letter of intent with Maxwell Rainbow Sdn Bhd
                    to provide project management services in connection with a proposed real estate
                    development project in Malaysia. This project never took off.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(iv)   The investment in Innovative Polymers </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    On 22 June 2007, it was announced that
                    Jade had entered into a term sheet dated 21 June 2007 with Innovative
                    Polymers Pte Ltd (“Innovative”) in relation to a proposed
                    investment in Innovative of S$7.2 million. This was terminated a month later on
                    26 July 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(v)   The notes issue with Pacific Capital Investment
                Management</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    On 17 October 2007, Jade announced that
                    it intended to undertake a notes issue to Pacific Capital Investment Management
                    Limited (“PCIM”) of unsecured non-interest bearing notes due 2012
                    in an aggregate principal amount of up to $150m. This deal ultimately did not go
                    through. In Jade’s 2008 annual report, its acting Chairman, Mr Chong
                    Hon Leong, stated that the withdrawal from the Offer by APLL seriously affected
                    funds available for Jade’s new business citing as a case in point
                    Jade’s agreement with PCIM for a notes issue. The notes issue was not
                    activated as APLL could not proceed with the required securities lending
                    agreement it had entered into with PCIM due to legal issues relating to the
                    Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(vi)   The Indonesian coal mine project</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    On 4 December 2007, it was announced
                    that JCR was in the process of incorporating two new subsidiaries in Indonesia
                    and would start negotiations for a coal mining service contract. On
                    10 March 2008, it was announced that JCR had incorporated two subsidiaries
                    in Indonesia and that a coal mining service agreement had been entered into
                    between one of the subsidiaries and PT Dasacita Pusaka Prima on 6 March
                    2008. An ”expert” report prepared on 26 February 2008 by
                    Russia’s National Geological Institute (known as Giproshaht) stated that
                    25 million tonnes of coal could be obtained from this coal mine. This turned out
                    to be completely inaccurate as it was later confirmed that only 64,525 tonnes of
                    coal could be mined which was also of poor quality and would be unattractive to
                    buyers. On 19 January 2009, Jade announced the termination of this
                    project.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(vii)   The collaboration with E3 to purchase an oil refinery in
                china</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    On 20 January 2008, Jade announced that
                    JCR and Englo Real Estate Development Pte Ltd, an E3 subsidiary, had entered
                    into agreements to co-invest and cooperate with each other to acquire a 49%
                    stake in an oil refinery and a 100% stake in a piece of land in China, with a
                    proposed extension of the refinery at a cost of RMB 20 billion or S$3.96
                    billion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    On 21 May 2008, it was announced that
                    the joint venture with Englo Real Estate Development Pte Ltd had been
                    terminated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(viii)   Conclusions to be drawn from the failure of all projects
                announced</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    Whilst Dr Soh agreed with counsel for
                    the plaintiff that all the above projects never saw fruition, he claimed that
                    the failure of the projects was caused by the fact that he had left APLL and the
                    projects had therefore lost their “driver”. It is difficult to
                    accept that all the projects proposed were ultimately unsuccessful because
                    Dr Soh was no longer in the driver’s seat. OCBC postulated (quite
                    accurately I believe) that the above projects were merely empty gestures on
                    Dr Soh’s part, public announcements of which were designed to arouse
                    interest in and improve the price of, Jade shares. I seriously doubt that
                    Dr Soh had any real intention to develop the businesses of Jade and its
                    subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;"> (B)   The rationale for the Offer</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    Dr Soh claimed that he wanted to launch
                    the Offer for Jade shares because he firmly believed that the price of $0.10 per
                    share on 30 January 2008 undervalued Jade’s potential. According to
                    Dr Soh, his belief was based on the potential development by JCR of the
                    coal mine project in Indonesia in <a href="#p1_160">[160]</a>.
                    Dr Soh claimed that a draft independent report undertaken by Giproshaht in
                    December 2007, which estimated that the coal reserves could be mined at 4
                    million tons had increased the estimate to 25 million tons in a final report
                    dated 26 February 2008; this demonstrated that Jade’s business
                    prospects had potential. However, Dr Soh did not produce a copy of the
                    draft report of Giproshaht. In any event, this coal mine project did not take
                    off as it was later confirmed that only 64,525 tonnes of poor quality coal could
                    be extracted from the coal mine.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(C)   The funding for the Offer</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    Dr Soh admitted that he did not have
                    sufficient funds to satisfy full acceptance of the Offer from the date of the
                    Offer Announcement until the date of withdrawal. In fact, his estimated net
                    worth when he started negotiating for the purchase of the majority stake in Jade
                    was only $5m-$10m, including his landed property. Dr Soh’s bank
                    accounts were examined at trial and he agreed that, as at 27 March 2008, he
                    had approximately $1.1m in cash and was able to raise additional financing
                    (through the liquidation of the non-cash assets in his bank accounts including
                    Faitheagle’s 3.3 million Jade shares which he subsequently sold on
                    31 March 2008) of close to $8m within a couple of days from 27 March
                    2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    Nevertheless, Dr Soh claimed that he
                    had informed OCBC from the outset that APLL did not have the necessary funds to
                    complete the Offer and that OCBC had only required a comfort letter from a bank
                    that US$100m had been earmarked from a bank account maintained by FCGIL with SCB
                    Jakarta against which funds a bank guarantee for US$100m would be issued.
                    Dr Soh also claimed that OCBC had, without knowledge of APLL and himself,
                    satisfied itself as to the financial resources of the Offeror on
                    14 February 2008, even before receiving a copy of the First Letter on
                    18 February 2008. Dr Soh further alleged that he had been the victim
                    of a major fraud perpetrated by Dr Rahman, who was responsible for
                    procuring the First Letter and the bank guarantee. I find Dr Soh’s
                    explanations with regard to his decision to launch the Offer despite his lack of
                    financial resources difficult to accept.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    First, Dr Soh’s written
                    submissions at the SIC inquiry stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">67.    On or about the end of January 2008 when he was
                            contemplating whether to make the VGO, Dr Soh had met with Jocelyn
                            Hoi from OCBC’s Enterprise Banking team to discuss funding for the
                            purposes of the contemplated VGO. The proposal discussed was that OCBC
                            would provide the credit line to APL for the monies for the acceptances
                            on the contemplated VGO but in turn, OCBC would require a banker’s
                            guarantee as security. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Yet, at the trial, Dr Soh claimed that the above statement
                    was wrong and that the meeting at the end of January 2008 was not with Hoi (with
                    whom he claimed that he had only had a telephone conversation) but with
                    OCBC’s corporate finance team, in particular, Tsai and Ang. Dr Soh
                    claimed that he had only called Hoi sometime after 12 February 2008 to
                    enquire if OCBC would grant APLL a credit facility against the security of a
                    bank guarantee. This telephone call was not mentioned in Dr Soh’s
                    AEIC and was only brought up at trial. In any event, Joice had testified that no
                    such meeting with Hoi had ever taken place (see <a href="#p1_120">[120]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    Second, Dr Soh’s claim that he
                    had informed OCBC at the First Meeting (on 31 January 2008) that APLL did
                    not have the cash for the Offer but that he had a company, FCGIL, which had an
                    account with SCB Jakarta and that <em>the money in that account
                        could not be remitted out but he could arrange for a bank guarantee to be
                        issued from FCGIL’s SCB Jakarta account for the purpose of the
                        Offer</em> goes against the weight of the evidence given by
                    OCBC’s witnesses (see <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a> above) and also appeared to be contrary
                    to what was stated in Dr Soh’s email to OCBC on 27 February 2008
                    (see <a href="#p1_63">[63]</a> and <a href="#p1_64">[64]</a> above). Moreover, it was clear from the queries raised by
                    Tsai during OCBC’s conference call with Dr Soh on 27 March 2008
                    (see <a href="#p1_77">[77]</a> above) that as at 28 March
                    2008, Dr Soh had not informed OCBC of the existence of Dr Rahman and
                    FCGIL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    Third, Dr Soh had no valid basis for
                    alleging that OCBC would fund the Offer. At paras 161 and 162 of
                    Dr Soh’s AEIC, he deposed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">161.  It was my understanding that if a bank guarantee
                            were to be provided by UBS or any other bank, a financial institution
                            would need to provide a loan to APLL for the VGO, which would be secured
                            by the bank guarantee. At no time during the meeting was I asked by the
                            OCBC team whether I had approached any other financial institution to
                            provide credit lines against such a bank guarantee, or whether the
                            approval of any credit lines had been obtained against such a bank
                            guarantee.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">162.  I concluded from this that if OCBC were willing
                            to accept a bank guarantee issued in favour of APLL’s account with
                            OCBC, then OCBC would be willing and able to fund the VGO by way of a
                            loan to APLL against the security of this guarantee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">At the trial, Dr Soh admitted that there was no legally
                    enforceable agreement that OCBC would provide financing for the take-over.
                    Rather, his case was that there was an understanding or expectation that OCBC
                    would grant him a credit facility based on a bank guarantee. Joice from
                    OCBC’s EB Department however had testified that no formal discussions on
                    the provision of funding by OCBC to Dr Soh had ever taken place (see
                        <a href="#p1_117">[117]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_121">[121]</a> above). The defendants were in a
                    better position than OCBC to know the state of APLL’s financial resources.
                    I reject the defendants’ contention that they were entitled to rely on
                    OCBC’s apparent confirmation of the defendants’ financial resources
                    in the notes of the First Verification Meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    Fourth, during his conference call with OCBC
                    on 27 March 2008 (see <a href="#p1_77">[77]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_78">[78]</a> above), Dr Soh had calculated
                    aloud that “since [he had] 46% of the shares, there [was] always a way
                    for [him] to pledge those shares to come out with the money even if [he
                    didn’t have] any other resources to pay for [the acceptances of the
                    Offer]”. Dr Soh had also commented that “common sense [told
                    him] that at most [they were] going to have … 30 million or 40 million
                    shares” and that “less than 10 million dollars [would] be required
                    to do [the Offer]”. Dr Soh accepted, at trial, that his
                    representation, during the conference call, that he had 46% of Jade’s
                    issued capital as at 27 March 2008 was not true and that he knew it was not
                    true. In fact, he had sold 35 million shares before 27 March 2008. As a
                    result, he would have required 30 to 40 million shares plus 35 million shares to
                    make up 50% of Jade’s issued capital.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    Fifth, there were problems with the First
                    Letter which Dr Soh should have noticed but did not raise with OCBC. The
                    First Letter stated that SCB Jakarta had granted a credit facility to APLL.
                    However, Dr Soh admitted that this was factually incorrect since APLL did
                    not have any account or credit facility with SCB Jakarta when the letter was
                    issued. Yet, Dr Soh did not inform OCBC. The First Letter also referred to
                    the earmarking of funds in an SCB Jakarta account for the purposes of satisfying
                    acceptances of the Offer. At the trial, Dr Soh agreed with OCBC’s
                    counsel that the earmarking of the funds was not for the purpose of making
                    payment pursuant to the Offer (since it was Dr Soh’s case that the
                    funds in the SCB Jakarta could not be utilised). However, Dr Soh did not
                    point out these factual inaccuracies to OCBC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    Sixth, Dr Soh stated that although he
                    had not been pressing OCBC in any way that the Offer Announcement should have
                    been released on an urgent basis, OCBC released the Offer Announcement at 7.30
                    pm on 18 February 2008. However, it appeared from the first email
                    correspondence between Dr Soh and OCBC on 18 February 2008 (see
                        <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a> above) that Dr Soh was most
                    anxious to release the Offer announcement on the night of 18 February 2008.
                    On the same day, Dr Soh repeated his request in his second email to Tan at
                    7.50 pm (when he appeared not to have known that the Offer Announcement had been
                    released by then) stating:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear Wei Ping,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have no comment on the final announcement, subject to comments from
                        others if any, please release at the scheduled time tonight.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    Seventh, on 27 February 2008,
                    Dr Soh had sent an email to OCBC in which he requested that OCBC waive the
                    requirement for a bank guarantee from SCB Jakarta since that would incur costs
                    of US$250,000 (see also <a href="#p1_63">[63]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_66">[66]</a> above). Dr Soh’s explanation
                    for sending this email to OCBC was that he had received an email attachment from
                    Dr Rahman on 27 February 2008 of a bank guarantee dated
                    20 February 2008 for US$500m issued by SCB Jakarta in favour of UBS for
                    further credit to the account of Faitheagle. This led him to decide that the SCB
                    Jakarta bank guarantee for US$100m to OCBC would not be necessary as he could
                    use the UBS bank guarantee to apply for a credit line for the issue of a bank
                    guarantee from UBS Singapore to OCBC for US$100m. Dr Soh’s email of
                    27 February 2008 stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As mentioned, to give OCBC additional comfort that financial resources are
                        more than amply provided for this exercise, please see the latest swift on
                        Feb 20<sup>th</sup> from SCB to my UBS Account under
                        Faitheagle Investments Ltd, in which I am the sole shareholder and sole
                        director (as you know I am also the sole shareholder in [APLL]). The swift
                        has been acknowledged receipt by UBS and is clearing the MAS right now,
                        after which a credit line of 90% of the US$500 million will be provided for
                        me to use for the GO, oil trading, mining or any investments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    When cross-examined on whether UBS had
                    indeed acknowledged receipt of the SWIFT dated 20 February 2008 from SCB
                    Jakarta to Faitheagle’s UBS account, Dr Soh responded that
                    Dr Rahman had sent him an email to say that UBS had acknowledged receipt.
                    Dr Soh’s excuse for not being able to find out from UBS directly was
                    that he “was told by both Dr Rahman and William Chan not to contact
                    UBS”. This defied commonsense as UBS was Faitheagle’s banker and
                    Dr Soh was, at the material time, the sole shareholder and director of
                    Faitheagle, as stated in his email above. Dr Soh also admitted that UBS had
                    not, contrary to the impression given in the email, agreed to grant him a credit
                    line of 90% of US$500m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    Moreover, Dr Soh had concluded the
                    27 February 2008 email as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If it is still absolutely necessary, I can request UBS to issue a separate
                        bank guarantee from my Faitheagle account at UBS to [APLL] account at OCBC
                            (<em>provided OCBC is willing to accept and give me a
                            credit line)</em> and for that I will have to pay 0.125% of US$100
                        millions or US$125,000, or alternatively I can apply for credit line of
                        US$100 millions [sic] to draw down (partial of 500 millions [sic]) on this
                        banker’s guarantee (in which case I will have to pay 5% interest
                        upfront … and I am wondering <em>if this is really
                            necessary</em> since I do not expect I need to use more than US$10
                        millions [sic] for this exercise as I do not expect large acceptances, since
                        UBS will provide me a line of credit up to 90% of this Banker Guarantee, or
                        up to US$450 millions [sic] after the MAS clearance, and I believe that is
                        more than enough for this VGO? [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is clear from the above paragraph that there was no existing
                    agreement between OCBC and Dr Soh that OCBC would grant Dr Soh a
                    credit line. In fact, Dr Soh was raising the provision of a credit line as
                    a suggestion to back his alternative plan to provide OCBC with a bank guarantee
                    and, at the same time, was hoping that this would not be
                necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;"> (D)   The misstatement of APLL’s shareholdings in
                Jade</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(i)   Dr Soh’s failure to disclose the 5.5 million Jade
                shares that Faitheagle had purchased in 2007</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    Dr Soh had purchased 5.5 million Jade
                    shares through Faitheagle sometime between August and November 2007 but had
                    failed to disclose the purchases at the First Meeting (see <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> and <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>
                    above). Had he disclosed the purchases, the minimum price for the Offer should
                    have been 26.86 cents, instead of the 22.5 cents at which it was
                    launched.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    Dr Soh claimed that he had forgotten
                    about Faitheagle’s purchase of 5.5 million Jade shares. He testified that
                    had he remembered, there would have been no need for him to purchase 5.5 million
                    Jade shares on 21 January 2008; all that he needed to do would have been to
                    announce the transfer of 5.5 million Jade shares from Faitheagle to APLL on
                    21 January 2008. Dr Soh claimed that it did not occur to him to
                    mention the trading in Jade shares by Faitheagle when A&amp;G circulated a draft
                    Memorandum of Compliance for the Draft Offer Document on 26 February 2008
                    because he had believed that the purchase of 5.5 million shares through
                    Faitheagle’s UBS Hong Kong account was in his name, as part of a swap of
                    accounts which he had intended. Dr Soh’s explanation for having
                    forgotten about Faitheagle’s purchases of Jade shares was that there were
                    several counters in which Faiheagle traded and that in 2007, Faitheagle was
                    essentially an investment account which was managed not only for Dr Soh
                    himself but for other investors as well. However, contrary to his evidence, the
                    statements of Faitheagle’s account revealed that Faitheagle had traded in
                    only three counters between August and November 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    Dr Soh was the sole shareholder of both
                    Faitheagle and APLL. Whilst he insisted that he behaved like a fund manager for
                    Faitheagle’s investors, Dr Soh claimed to be a shareholder of
                    Faitheagle’s Jade shares. In other words, Dr Soh claimed that he was
                    the fund manager managing the Jade shares in Faitheagle for the investor who was
                    also himself. I do not accept Dr Soh’s explanation that he was under
                    the impression that he need not disclose Faitheagle’s purchase of Jade
                    shares despite knowing that APLL had to disclose any dealings in Jade
                    shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(ii)   Dr Soh’s failure to disclose the nature of
                APLL’s shareholdings in Jade under the GMSLA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    It is undisputed that Dr Soh had
                    repeatedly assured OCBC that APLL held full beneficial ownership of the shares
                    transferred to Opes Prime under the GMSLA. Despite this, it was
                    Dr Soh’s position that OCBC and A&amp;G ought to have advised the
                    defendants on the effect of the GMSLA and that their failure to render this
                    advice led him to make the Offer which he would not have made had he known that
                    beneficial interest in the pledged shares had passed to Opes Prime under the
                    GMSLA. OCBC alleged that Dr Soh well knew (which he denied) that he had
                    transferred beneficial interest in the pledged shares under the
                GMSLA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    Dr Soh claimed in his AEIC that he had
                    asked Norman to deliver a copy of the GMSLA to A&amp;G’s office on
                    5 February 2008 and was not aware that A&amp;G had not received it since no
                    reminder or further request was made by OCBC or A&amp;G. This departed from
                    Dr Soh’s position at the SIC inquiry where he had submitted that he
                    had asked Norman to make a copy of the GMSLA available for collection but
                    understood only later that A&amp;G did not collect the copy. When questioned on
                    this discrepancy with his pleaded case, Dr Soh adopted the position in his
                    AEIC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    According to Dr Soh, he never doubted
                    that he had the beneficial interest in the shares pledged under the GMSLA.
                    Dr Soh pointed out that John Lindholm, the Liquidator and Scheme
                    Administrator of Opes Prime had confirmed in two letters, one addressed to the
                    SGX and SIC dated 24 July 2009 and the other to the Commercial Affairs
                    Department of Singapore (“CAD”) dated 10 December 2009
                    (collectively “John Lindholm’s Letters”), that APLL had
                    commenced proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia against Opes Prime and
                    certain Merrill Lynch entities in April 2008 on the basis that APLL had only
                    entered into the GMSLA because of representations made to it by Opes
                    Prime’s directors and officers to the effect that APLL would at all times
                    retain the beneficial ownership in the shares and that APLL could reverse the
                    transaction at any time. John Lindholm’s Letters stated that the Scheme
                    Administrators and Liquidators of Opes Prime had not seen any evidence to
                    contradict APLL’s allegations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    Dr Soh took the position, during
                    cross-examination, that the GMSLA was in reality a <em>share-lending</em> agreement and <em>not</em> a
                        <em>share pledge</em> agreement. According to
                    Dr Soh, Raj Maiden (“Maiden”), an employee of Opes
                    Prime’s local entity, Opes Prime Asset Management Pte Ltd (“Opes
                    Singapore”), had explained to Dr Soh that if APLL placed Jade shares
                    with Opes Prime, Opes Prime would place the shares with its custodian in
                    Singapore, Merrill Lynch Singapore Pte Ltd (“Merrill Lynch
                    Singapore”) and give APLL a cash loan on a loan-to-valuation ratio
                    (“LVR”) of 60%. According to Dr Soh, Maiden and Emini (the
                    CEO of Opes Prime) had both assured him orally and in an email dated
                    26 September 2007, that although APLL would have to transfer the shares to
                    Merrill Lynch Singapore, under the GMSLA, it would still remain the beneficial
                    owner of the shares. However, at trial, Dr Soh admitted that his purpose of
                    asking who had beneficial ownership of the shares was merely to ensure that he
                    would get his shares back once he repaid the loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    There is evidence that indicated that,
                    contrary to Dr Soh’s testimony, he was aware, at least as of
                    4 March 2008, that there was a problem with APLL’s ownership of Jade
                    shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    First, at para 136 of his AEIC,
                    Dr Soh claimed that, in February 2008, he “was actually considering
                    getting back all of the Jade shares pledged to Opes Prime by arranging for a 50%
                    revolving share-financing scheme from UBS Singapore to finance the
                    redemption” but did not do so because he “realised that it would
                    entail multiple announcements during the VGO”. If Dr Soh had thought
                    that he retained beneficial ownership of the pledged shares at that point in
                    time, there seemed to be no reason why he would need to make any announcements
                    for the transfer of shares under the share-financing scheme with UBS.
                    Dr Soh claimed that he did not know if he would have to announce the
                    transfer of shares from one custodian to another. Yet, he did not clarify this
                    with his legal or financial advisers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    Second, at the First Verification Meeting,
                    Dr Soh had confirmed that he and APLL held a total of 451,172,504 shares.
                    This was despite the fact that on 5 February 2008, Dr Soh had received
                    a summary positions statement from Opes Prime which indicated that he had
                    295,450,000 Jade shares pledged with Opes Prime. Summary positions statements
                    were also issued by Opes Prime to Dr Soh on 6 February 2008,
                    7 February 2008, 11 February 2008, 14 February 2008,
                    29 February 2008 and 7 March 2008, all of which stated that Opes Prime
                    was only holding 295,450,000 Jade shares. At para 131 of his AEIC, Dr Soh
                    admitted that he had seen the summary positions statement dated 5 February
                    2008 by 15 February 2008. The figure of 295,450,000 Jade shares reflected
                    in the summary positions statements is equivalent to 300,050,000 shares less 4.6
                    million shares. Dr Soh should have known, when he received the statements,
                    that the 4.6 million shares which Opes Prime had force-sold on 21 January
                    2008 (see <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> above) had not been
                    reinstated. Indeed, Dr Soh claimed to have travelled to Melbourne on
                    28 February 2008 to question Emini as to whether Opes Prime had sold Jade
                    shares without his knowledge or consent. Yet, Dr Soh did not alert OCBC of
                    the discrepancy in the summary positions statement. Even if Dr Soh had
                    doubted that, as he claimed, the figure stated by Opes Prime in the
                    5 February 2008 statement was inaccurate, he should have informed OCBC of
                    his suspicions and ought to have clarified with OCBC as to the exact number of
                    Jade shares that he and APLL held.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    Third, in Dr Soh’s email to Chris
                    Holly dated 4 March 2008 in response to an email from Chris Holly on the
                    same day requesting that Dr Soh progressively reduce his financing
                    arrangement with Opes Prime by repaying $5m every week commencing that week, he
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear Chris,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thanks for your email.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As we had discussed two weeks ago and you are aware, [Jade] is now
                        undergoing a General Offer by [APLL] which was announced on
                            18<sup>th</sup> Feb 08 <em>and the
                            regulatory authority – Securities Industry Council (a unit of

                            held</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[APLL] recently declared that it has a share financing arrangement with
                        Opes Prime and that 295,450,000 shares are held by Merrill Lynch Singapore
                        on behalf of Opes Prime, with which [APLL] had entered into a GIMSLA

                        supposed to be held by Merrill in the same arrangement, so there is a
                        shortage of 37,948,000 shares and if you take this other client’s 12
                        million shares into account, then there is a shortage of 49,948,000 shares
                        in Merrill’s account.</p>

<em>The authority is waiting for an answer from
                            me</em> for the following:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    Since I informed the authority that my “cash
                            collateral” is about S$28 millions and based on [APLL]’s
                            offer price of 22.5 cents per share, there should be 207,407,000 shares
                            held or pledged as collateral if based on 60% financing (207,407,000 x
                            22.5 cents/shareX 60%=S$28 millions) why did I state that 295+ million
                            shares were held and since I was asked to show proof, we had to request
                            the share registry to provide proof that Merrill indeed held this no. of
                            shares but unfortunately, it showed that only 257 millions shares were
                            held by Merrill.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    
              <em>I have to prove that [APLL] is
                                still the beneficiary of these shares</em> (notwithstanding
                            the fact that the discrepancy in numbers held) and that Merrill did not
                            sell these shares without its beneficiaries’ advice or
                            instructions. In so doing I have to show the latest statement from Opes
                            which showed my cash position and no of shares pledged which clearly
                            showed 295 millions plus as confirmed in your statement
                        today.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    Could you please assist to clarify if Merrill is
                            still holding all the 295+ million shares, if not who is the custodian
                            and where are the remaining shares held?</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    Dr Soh admitted that he was using this
                    letter to pressurise Opes Prime and that at the time when he wrote this email,
                    the SIC had not, in fact, scrutinised the shares that APLL held as at
                    4 March 2008 or asked Dr Soh about the three issues listed in the
                    passage quoted above. Neither had OCBC or A&amp;G. Given Dr Soh’s
                    admission that the SIC, OCBC and A&amp;G had not, at that point in time, asked
                    him about the beneficial ownership of the shares pledged under the GMSLA, this
                    attempt by Dr Soh to pressurise Opes Prime into providing him with proof of
                    his beneficial ownership of the pledged shares shows that Dr Soh knew, as
                    of 4 March 2008, that there was a problem with the issue of beneficial
                    ownership of the shares transferred under the GMSLA. Despite this, Dr Soh
                    sent an email to OCBC and A&amp;G that same day in which he pointed out that
                    APLL held 45.97% of Jade’s issued capital, amounting to 445,672,504
                    shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    Dr Soh agreed with counsel for OCBC
                    that the figure of 445,672,504 shares was incorrect but explained that he had
                    not informed A&amp;G or OCBC of this discrepancy as he had forgotten about
                    Faitheagle’s sale of 5.5 million Jade shares on 12 February 2008.
                    Dr Soh’s email of 4 March 2008 also did not refer to the shares
                    pledged under the GMSLA or the fact that 4.6 million Jade shares had been
                    force-sold by Opes Prime. Dr Soh’s explanation for this discrepancy
                    was that he had not known if the forced sale had taken place; his explanation is
                    not credible. In his email of 4 March 2008 to Chris Holly as set out above,
                    Dr Soh had stated that “[APLL] recently declared that it has a share
                    financing arrangement with Opes Prime and that <em>295,450,000</em> shares are held by Merrill Lynch Singapore on behalf
                    of Opes Prime...”. The figure of 295,450,000 stated in the email was the
                    figure of 300,050,000 minus the 4.6 million shares that had been
                    force-sold.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-6" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(iii)   Dr Soh’s failure to disclose Opes Prime’s
                forced sale of APLL’s Jade shares</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    Following a drop in the price of Jade shares
                    in January 2008, Dr Soh received a call from Maiden on the morning of
                    21 January 2008 demanding payment of S$500,000 to meet a margin call of
                    approximately S$1m. Although Maiden threatened to sell the Jade shares if
                    Dr Soh did not pay the sum of S$500,000 by noon that day, Dr Soh
                    claimed that he did not believe him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    Dr Soh deposed that he did not satisfy
                    the margin call although he had the necessary funds to do so. When questioned on
                    his available funding at that point in time, Dr Soh claimed that he had
                    S$1m in his UBS account. Dr Soh claimed that it did not occur to him that
                    the simpler course of action would be to pay down the loan by S$1m.
                    Dr Soh’s claim that he had S$1m in his UBS account was also not
                    supported by his UBS statements of account as of 31 January 2008 which
                    reflected that only S$213,745.81 was available in one of Faitheagle’s UBS
                    accounts whilst the other account had a negative balance of US$3,662.45. Whilst
                    the statement of account which reflected a negative balance also reflected that
                    the value of equities in the account was US$3,272,695.44, the bulk of this was
                    Cordlife shares, which were being held for Dr Soh’s investors (see
                        <a href="#p1_199">[199]</a> below). Dr Soh was unable to
                    produce any evidence to prove that he had S$1m in cash on 21 January
                    2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_191"></a>191    Instead of satisfying the 21 January
                    2008 margin call, Dr Soh claimed that he instructed his banker at UBS
                    Singapore to purchase 5 million shares in Jade on behalf of Faitheagle.
                    According to Dr Soh, owing to a misunderstanding, his instruction was not
                    carried out by UBS. There was a miscommunication as the bank officer at UBS
                    thought that Dr Soh merely wanted reassurance that there were at least 5
                    million Jade shares in Faitheagle’s account which there were. Faitheagle
                    had previously purchased 5.5 million Jade shares between August and November
                    2007. UBS Singapore therefore did not purchase any more Jade shares for
                    Dr Soh. Dr Soh claimed that due to this misunderstanding, he proceeded
                    to inform Jade that he had purchased 5.5 million Jade shares at the day’s
                    market prices of $0.16 to $0.225 <em>in his personal
                        name</em> and Jade had announced this to SGX on 21 January
                    2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    Although OCBC requested for copies of
                    Dr Soh’s telephone bills and all other documents that showed the
                    date, time and/or duration of all telephone conversations that were alleged to
                    have taken place, Dr Soh only produced the records for his mobile telephone
                    for the period 18 January 2008 to 17 March 2008. Even then,
                    Dr Soh was unable to identify, from the record for 21 January 2008,
                    the telephone call which he alleged had taken place between himself and Cindy
                    Goh of UBS. His explanation was that he did not make all calls using his mobile
                    telephone, especially when he was in the office. Ultimately, despite the
                    requests of counsel for OCBC at trial, no voice log recordings were produced by
                    Dr Soh in support of his claim that there had been a miscommunication
                    between himself and Cindy Goh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    Dr Soh’s explanation for making
                    the purchase of 5.5 million shares through Faitheagle instead of APLL was that
                    it was only a stand-by purchase and he was not sure if Opes Prime would really
                    sell his shares. In my opinion, even if the miscommunication with Cindy Goh had
                    taken place, there was no reason for Dr Soh to represent to OCBC or to
                    cause Jade to make a public announcement that he had personally purchased 5.5
                    million Jade shares. Rather, Faitheagle should have been identified as the
                    purchaser.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a>194    In the announcement made on 21 January
                    2008, it was stated that Dr Soh had paid S$1.1m for the 5.5 million Jade
                    shares. However, Dr Soh admitted at trial that he did not know the price at
                    which he thought Faitheagle had purchased the 5.5 million Jade shares, and he
                    did not check the price with Cindy Goh. Since the price for the Offer had been
                    set at 22.5 cents (which Dr Soh had informed OCBC was the highest price at
                    which Dr Soh had purchased the Jade shares on 21 January 2008), the
                    price at which the Jade shares had been purchased on 21 January 2008 would
                    have had a material impact on the Offer price. Even if Dr Soh’s
                    evidence that he had no time to find out the transacted prices for the shares on
                    21 January 2008 is to be believed, it is puzzling that ten days later when
                    the First Meeting with OCBC was held, Dr Soh still had not checked on the
                    prices at which he thought the 5.5 million Jade shares had been purchased by
                    Faitheagle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_195"></a>195    Since APLL failed to meet the margin call,
                    Opes Prime force sold 4.6 million Jade shares on the same day. Dr Soh
                    received an email from Maiden on 21 February 2008 informing him of this
                    forced sale. According to Dr Soh, he telephoned Opes Prime on
                    22 January 2008 to question Emini about the sale and to order Opes Prime to
                    restore the shares. Dr Soh claimed that as Emini had promised to repurchase
                    the 4.6 million shares to restore the same number of shares to APLL as those
                    which had been sold, Dr Soh proceeded to dispose of 5.5 million shares in
                    Faitheagle on 22 January 2008, thinking that he had acquired those shares
                    on 21 January 2008. However, Dr Soh did not produce any evidence to
                    prove that Opes Prime had assured him that the shares would be reinstated. He
                    also admitted that he never checked with Opes Prime on whether the shares were
                    in fact reinstated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196"></a>196    Dr Soh claimed that he had intended to
                    buy, and had announced the purchase of, 5.5 million Jade shares in order to
                    restore any shares that Opes Prime might force-sell to meet the margin call.
                    However (as pointed out by counsel for OCBC), that cannot be right because
                    whilst Dr Soh disclosed his purchase of the 5.5 million Jade shares, he did
                    not disclose the forced-sale of 4.6 million Jade shares by Opes Prime.
                    Dr Soh also did not announce his subsequent disposal of 5.5 million Jade
                    shares between 12 February 2008 and 25 February 2008. This was despite
                    the fact that he had disposed 1 million of the 5.5 million Jade shares on
                    12 February 2008, after engaging OCBC and A&amp;G as APLL’s advisers
                    for the Offer and just before the First Verification Meeting. Dr Soh had
                    also proceeded to confirm that the shareholding figures stated in the Offer
                    Announcement were correct four days later on 18 February 2008. Moreover,
                    after the Offer Announcement was released, Dr Soh sold another 1 million of
                    the 5.5 million Jade shares on 21 February 2008, 2 million of the 5.5
                    million Jade shares on 22 February 2008 and 1.5 million of the 5.5 million
                    Jade shares on 25 February 2008 but still confirmed, at the Second
                    Verification Meeting (on 5 March 2008) that the shareholding
                    representations in the draft Offer Document were correct. As such, Dr Soh
                    falsely represented to the market that APLL continued to hold a 45.97% stake in
                    Jade and that collectively, he and APLL held 46.54% of the issued capital of
                    Jade.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a>197    On 27 February 2008, Tan had sent an
                    email to Ang that said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Just spoke to Norman over the phone. He confirmed that Dr Soh has not
                        traded in Jade Shares since the announcement of the offer. He will also
                        remind Dr Soh not to trade in Jade Shares during the offer
                        period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Dr Soh claimed that Norman had asked him if he had <em>purchased</em> any Jade shares, to which question Dr Soh
                    had answered “No”. As such, Dr Soh contended, since he had
                    not been asked if he had <em>traded</em> in Jade shares, he
                    did not disclose his sales of Jade shares in February 2008. Dr Soh
                    persisted in his unconvincing explanation even though counsel for OCBC pointed
                    out to him that he had received the Guidelines from A&amp;G on 26 February
                    2008 (see <a href="#p1_72">[72]</a> above).</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a>198    Dr Soh’s explanation for his
                    undisclosed transfer of 50 million Jade shares to Faitheagle in March 2008 and
                    subsequent disposal of those shares between 10 and 31 March 2008 (see
                        <a href="#p1_73">[73]</a> above) was riddled with
                    inconsistencies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_199"></a>199    In his submissions to the SIC, Dr Soh
                    explained that under one fund management arrangement (the “Faitheagle
                    Agreement”), an investment fund of S$10m was paid to an Australian stock
                    broking account in exchange for Australian securities (namely, shares in
                    Cordlife Ltd) which were then credited to Faitheagle. According to Dr Soh,
                    the monies for the fund were contributed by one Liu Jun (a Chinese citizen) and
                    one Ian Hendy (an Australian) in equal beneficial proportions. The two investors
                    were introduced to Dr Soh by a broker Trevor Pettett. Dr Soh claimed
                    that he had agreed to manage these funds in exchange for a share of profits
                    generated from the funds and had further agreed to protect the principal value
                    of the S$10m invested and to make good any losses on that amount.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200"></a>200    At end-January 2008, the investment had
                    depreciated to about S$2m worth of shares in Australian securities and Trevor
                    Pettett instructed Dr Soh to top up the value of the initial investment. As
                    such, Dr Soh decided to do a share swap. On 27 February 2008,
                    Dr Soh instructed Norman to execute the share swap. In the result, 50
                    million of APLL’s Jade shares were transferred to Faitheagle on
                    7 March 2008 without consideration. Dr explained that he had done the
                    transfer out of goodwill, to top up Liu Jun’s and Ian Hendy’s
                    investment by way of a swap where he would give Faitheagle 50 million of Jade
                    shares in return for the depreciated S$2m worth of Australian securities. His
                    reason for not disclosing this transfer of shares was that since he was the sole
                    shareholder and director of Faitheagle and sole shareholder of APLL, he
                    believed, mistakenly, that it was not necessary to make any disclosure of this
                    transfer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201"></a>201    Dr Soh claimed that he had wanted to do
                    the share swap to support Ian Hendy’s newly-widowed wife as the former had
                    passed away in 2007. 45.7 million of the 50 million shares which were
                    transferred to Faitheagle were subsequently sold between 10 and 31 March
                    2008. At the trial, Dr Soh claimed that when he transferred the 50 million
                    shares from APLL to Faitheagle, he had not intended to sell the shares.
                    According to Dr Soh, it was only on or about 10 March that he decided
                    to sell the shares to give money to Ian Hendy’s wife as she was
                    hospitalised and needed the money. This testimony was inconsistent with
                    Dr Soh’s submissions at the SIC inquiry, where he had stated
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… it was <em>always intended</em> that these
                        Shares were to be sold off or liquidated at latest by end of March 2008 so
                        that the fund in Faitheagle would have cash for other investments. 45.7
                        million of these 50 million Shares were subsequently sold … [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">When he was cross-examined on his inconsistency, Dr Soh’s
                    evidence was that his submission to the SIC inquiry on this point was wrong.
                    However, he had no explanation as to why his position in the SIC submissions
                    differed from what he claimed (at trial) was the true situation. The total
                    amount for which the 45.7 million Jade Shares were sold was S$10,090,600. None
                    of the sales proceeds were in fact given to Mrs Hendy as (according to
                    Dr Soh) S$4m went into payment for his investment in Netelusion shares
                    while the balance remained frozen in Faitheagle’s UBS
                account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_202"></a>202    Dr Soh claimed that since both APLL and
                    Faitheagle were wholly owned by him and the concept of a “concert
                    party” had not been explained to him (even though he had received a
                    standard client briefing document from A&amp;G), he did not consider, in making
                    the transfer, that he was causing any change in ownership of the shares. This
                    was despite the fact that, as he admitted under cross-examination, Dr Soh
                    understood that as a matter of commercial reality, he and APLL would be parties
                    acting in concert. Dr Soh claimed that he did not know that APLL and
                    Faitheagle were his concert parties. Otherwise, he would have disclosed his
                    transfer of 50 million shares to Faitheagle. However, at the trial, Dr Soh
                    agreed with counsel for OCBC that disclosure was necessary whether or not one
                    dealt with a concert party. Moreover, the term “concert parties”
                    was clearly explained to Dr Soh in an email dated 27 April 2007 from
                    Dr Soh’s legal adviser in a previous take-over offer for Jade shares.
                    That email stated (at paragraphs 2 and 9):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[2]    Concert parties are individuals or companies who

                    to Daiwa Securities SMBC Singapore Ltd regarding a letter from Barclays Bank
                    plc, Dr Soh had stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have gone to the extreme to get this done for just a 3 millions POF, and
                        please Barclays would do no more and we better close the deal ASAP as I am
                        getting a bit impatient and frustrated with all these delay and technical
                        issues, our other deals in [APLL] cannot wait any longer and though we
                        simplified the deal by doing in one tranche, by delaying it longer will
                            <em>only create more concerted party issue because [APLL]
                            has to do other deals also</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_204"></a>204    In another email dated 6 May 2007 to
                    Dr Soh’s legal adviser in his previous take-over offer for Jade
                    shares, Dr Soh had stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    In view of above item 3 and <em>to

                            fair and open manner” that would not invite complaint from the
                            public or queries from SIC. …

                                that no one will be implicated as concert parties</em>?
                            [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_205"></a>205    It appeared from the above email
                    correspondence that Dr Soh understood the meaning of the term
                    “concert parties”. Incredibly, Dr Soh claimed that he made
                    the statements in his emails without fully understanding what “concert
                    parties” meant. However, it was crystal clear from the email dated
                    3 May 2007 that, at the very least, Dr Soh was aware that APLL was his
                    concert party in his first take-over offer for Jade shares. Since Dr Soh
                    was the sole shareholder of both APLL and Faitheagle, by extension, Dr Soh
                    should have known that Faitheagle was APLL’s concert party for the
                    purposes of the Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_206"></a>206    Dr Soh also claimed that he had sold
                    the shares after reading a letter from A&amp;G, dated 11 March 2008 (at
                        <a href="#p1_74">[74]</a> above) which stated that he was
                    free to deal in Jade shares during the Offer period albeit that the transaction
                    had to be disclosed on SGXNET by 12 noon on the following trading day. Whilst
                    Dr Soh admitted that he should have reported the transaction, he claimed
                    that the advice given by A&amp;G was incorrect and that he had acted upon this
                    advice in disposing of the Jade shares held by Faitheagle. He had taken the view
                    that since APLL was going to obtain a large number of Jade shares as a result of
                    the Offer, he could therefore dispose of the Jade shares held by Faitheagle.
                    When it was pointed out to him that he had sold Jade shares on 10 March
                    2008, prior to receipt of A&amp;G’s email on 11 March 2008,
                    Dr Soh conceded he had done so regardless of A&amp;G’s email.
                    However, he clarified that he was not blaming his professional advisers for his
                    sale of 5.5 million Jade shares in February 2008 and 45.7 million Jade shares in
                    March 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_207"></a>207    I note that A&amp;G’s email of
                    11 March 2008 was not the only or even the first time that A&amp;G had
                    advised the defendants that, generally, there should not be any sale of Jade
                    shares during the Offer period. A&amp;G had advised the defendants not to sell
                    Jade shares during the Offer period in an email on 5 February 2008
                    enclosing a draft letter entitled “disclosure of dealings of
                    directors” which stated in bold that Dr Soh and his immediate family
                    were prohibited from dealing in Jade shares from the date of the letter; in an
                    email dated 19 February 2008 attaching a memorandum on director’s
                    responsibilities which stated (at para 6.2) that if APLL and any person acting
                    in concert with it intended to dispose of Jade shares such disposal must not be
                    below the offer price and prior consent must be obtained from the SIC; and,
                    finally, in an email dated 26 February 2008 attaching the Guidelines (see
                        <a href="#p1_72">[72]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_208"></a>208    A total of 54.51 million shares were traded
                    on 31 March 2008, of which 15 million shares were sold by Dr Soh.
                    Dr Soh realised S$3.3m from the sale of the 15 million Jade shares. I note
                    that the sale of 15 million shares on 31 March 2008 was preceded by a
                    telephone conversation on 29 March 2008 in which Dr Soh had expressed
                    his fear to Ang that Jade’s shareholders would dump their shares on
                    31 March 2008. Dr Soh’s lame explanation for his sale of the 15
                    million shares on 31 March 2008 was that he had given instructions to sell
                    the shares from the second or third week of March onwards and he could not
                    revoke those instructions in time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_209"></a>209    I note too that despite his sale of 15
                    million shares on 31 March 2008, Dr Soh had written to OCBC on
                    1 April 2008 to inform that he had written, on behalf of APLL, to Jade to
                    request for a halt in the trading of Jade shares but that Jade had not agreed to
                    this. In the same email, Dr Soh stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You are also aware that, given the public information available on what is
                        happening to Opes in Australia, <em>I am not in a position to
                            control the disposal of the shares in Jade</em>. Therefore, any
                        false market is not generated by me nor is it within my control. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Paul Robin Monrad Smith’s testimony</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_210"></a>210    Paul Robin Monrad Smith
                    (“Smith”) was the defendant’s expert witness. He is the
                    senior managing director in the London Corporate Finance Team of FTI Consulting.
                    Smith (DW2) is a qualified Chartered Accountant who has worked in the Corporate
                    Finance department of an investment bank. The most recent transaction involving
                    the conduct of take-overs that Smith has been involved in took place in
                    2002.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_211"></a>211    On the duties of a financial adviser, Smith
                    felt that when dealing with entrepreneurs, a competent financial adviser should
                    be more careful, should not assume that the customer is familiar with anything,
                    and should check the information provided by the customer very carefully. In his
                    experience, entrepreneurial clients tended to have a fairly optimistic view of
                    the world and may not be aware of potential problems. Smith expressed the view
                    that the OCBC team had accepted whatever it was told by Dr Soh without
                    making any enquiries. He pointed out that the OCBC team had made no enquiries
                    about Dr Soh’s financial position. According to Smith, OCBC’s
                    conduct prior to and during the Offer fell short of the requirements of,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, General Principle 6 of the Code
                    that a financial adviser should be satisfied that an offer can be implemented in
                    full. However, Smith did not express any view on whether civil liability would
                    flow from OCBC’s alleged breaches of the Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The findings </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_212"></a>212    The evidence presented at trial revealed
                    that the Shareholding Representation, the Financial Resources Representation,
                    the Rational Representation and the Responsibility Statements were all false
                    documents and the defendants offered no credible explanation as to why they had
                    repeatedly made the false representations to OCBC throughout their dealings with
                    OCBC. I find that OCBC has proven its case that the defendants had intentionally
                    made false representations to deceive OCBC into agreeing to be appointed as the
                    financial adviser for the Offer and issuing the Offer Announcement and the Offer
                    Document on behalf of APLL. Those false representations led to the launch of the
                    Offer on a completely false basis which in turn led to an increase in the price
                    of Jade shares at a time when APLL was in financial difficulties. APLL benefited
                    from this increase in the price of Jade shares through its covert disposal of
                    51.2 million of the Jade shares that it owned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_213"></a>213    Even if the defendants’
                    misrepresentations to OCBC were the result of a fraud perpetrated on Dr Soh
                    and OCBC by Dr Rahman, APLL and Dr Soh would still be liable in
                    negligence to OCBC as the defendants did not exercise reasonable care in making
                    the various representations of their shareholdings in Jade and failed to make
                    inquiries on the authenticity of the documents purportedly emanating from SCB
                    Jakarta.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_214"></a>214    APLL is also liable for breach of its
                    warranty under the Mandate Letter that all information and materials provided by
                    APLL would be correct and accurate in all respects and that there were no
                    material omissions that would make its statements false or
                misleading.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Shareholding Representation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_215"></a>215    It is clear on the evidence that APLL and
                    Dr Soh consistently represented to OCBC and A&amp;G that they had
                    beneficial ownership of 445,672,504 and 5,500,000 Jade shares respectively,
                    representing a total of 46.54% of the issued capital of Jade. This
                    representation was made to OCBC:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_216"></a>216    The defendants knew that the Shareholding
                    Representation was false or were reckless as to its truth for at least the
                    following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_216-p2_a"></a>(a)     Dr Soh was aware that Opes
                        Prime had force-sold 4.6 million Jade shares on 21 January 2008. He
                        further suspected, on or around 15 February 2008, that Opes Prime may
                        have force sold more Jade shares after the first forced sale on
                        21 January 2008. Those events should have alerted Dr Soh, if he
                        did not already know, that APLL did not have beneficial ownership of the
                        shares under the GMSLA. Yet, Dr Soh concealed from OCBC his
                        communications with Opes Prime and his concerns over the
                        “missing” Jade shares. Moreover, a copy of the GMSLA was not
                        given to either OCBC or A&amp;G until 29 March 2008 despite their
                        earlier requests. Dr Soh must have or should have read cl 2.3 of
                        the GMSLA which clearly provided that title in the Jade shares
                        “pledged” to Opes Prime, had passed to Opes
                    Prime.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_216-p2_b"></a>(b)     Dr Soh
                        falsely informed the market that he had purchased 5.5 million shares in Jade
                        on 21 January 2008 when no such purchase had taken place (see <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_216-p2_c"></a>(c)     After the Offer was announced, between
                        21 February 2008 and 31 March 2008, Dr Soh sold 50.2 million
                        Jade shares (representing approximately a 10% stake in Jade) that he held
                        under APLL and Faitheagle but did not disclose this sale to OCBC and the
                        market generally.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Financial Resources Representation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_217"></a>217    The defendants knew that APLL did not have
                    sufficient financial resources to satisfy full acceptance of the Offer but
                    misled OCBC into thinking otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_218"></a>218    The defendants’ claim that OCBC knew
                    all along that APLL did not have the funds to satisfy full acceptance of the
                    Offer and needed financing for the Offer goes against the weight of the
                    evidence. On the contrary, the evidence showed that OCBC had never agreed to
                    finance the Offer (see <a href="#p1_166">[166]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_169">[169]</a> and <a href="#p1_175">[175]</a> above). Financing from OCBC was not required as the
                    defendants consistently represented through the First Letter and the other
                    documents purportedly emanating from SCB Jakarta, that APLL had the necessary
                    financial resources to satisfy full acceptance of the Offer. Even when
                    OCBC’s suspicions as to the availability of funding for the Offer were
                    aroused, Dr Soh had repeatedly represented to OCBC that the defendants had
                    sufficient resources to complete the Offer in his telephone conversations with
                    OCBC on 27 March and 29 March 2008 and in an email dated 29 March
                    2008 (see <a href="#p1_78">[78]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_80">[80]</a> above). He had also provided OCBC with
                    copies of several bankers’ guarantees in SWIFT format purportedly issued
                    by SCB Jakarta (see <a href="#p1_89">[89]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_94">[94]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_219"></a>219    In the light of Tan’s telephone calls
                    to the two “Mr Ngs” on 27 March 2008 (see <a href="#p1_76">[76]</a> above) and on 28 March 2008 (see
                        <a href="#p1_85">[85]</a> above) and Tsai’s
                    unchallenged evidence that, during her visit to Indonesia, she found that the
                    signatures on the First and Second Letters did not conform with the signatures
                    of Mr Ng and Mr Lim on the authorised signatory list of SCB Jakarta
                        (see<a href="#p1_95">[95]</a> above), there is every reason
                    to believe that the documents Dr Soh provided to OCBC as proof that he had
                    sufficient financial resources to satisfy full acceptance of the Offer were all
                    false.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_220"></a>220    Moreover, OCBC’s witnesses had
                    testified that OCBC never received the First SWIFT, the Second SWIFT or the
                    Third SWIFT that Dr Soh claimed were issued by SCB Jakarta. Goh had
                    testified why the copies of the SWIFTs were likely to be fake as their format
                    differed from the official SWIFT guidelines (see <a href="#p1_116">[116]</a> above). Artarini had also testified that a letter dated
                    10 October 2008 which appeared to be sent by SCB Jakarta to the Kuala
                    Lumpur Securities Commission had not, in fact, been sent by SCB Jakarta (see
                        <a href="#p1_113">[113]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_221"></a>221    Additionally, OCBC produced email
                    correspondence between Tan and Bangun of SCB Jakarta’s trade services
                    department which confirmed that SCB Jakarta never issued the First Letter, or
                    the Second Letter or the First SWIFT (see <a href="#p1_76">[76]</a> above). Further, in a letter dated 17 April 2008, SCB
                    Jakarta’s then Director of Legal Compliance (Chisca Mirawati), confirmed
                    that SCB Jakarta had never issued the SCB Jakarta Letters and the three
                    banker’s guarantees dated 19 March 2008, 1 April 2008 and
                    4 April 2008. Artarini had further stated that the real Mr Ng could
                    not be reached at the “direct dial” number stated on the First
                    Letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_222"></a>222    There was also a substantial amount of
                    incriminating email correspondence that gave grounds to suspect that Dr Soh
                    worked closely with Dr Rahman on the preparation and drafting of
                    bankers’ guarantees, SWIFTs and correspondence to be issued to OCBC,
                    purportedly by SCB Jakarta (see <a href="#p1_139">[139]</a>
                    –
                    <a href="#p1_152">[152]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_223"></a>223    Even if Dr Soh’s evidence as to
                    how the Offer was to have been funded is to be believed, this would mean that
                    there were problems with the First Letter which Dr Soh should have noticed
                    but did not raise with OCBC (see <a href="#p1_171">[171]</a>
                    above). In the defence and counterclaim, the defendants had conceded that at no
                    material time did APLL hold an account with SCB Jakarta. Yet, the First Letter
                    (see <a href="#p1_52">[52]</a> above) referred to the sum of
                    US$100m having been earmarked by SCB Jakarta from <em>APLL’s current account with SCB Jakarta</em>. The First Letter
                    stated a fact which Dr Soh must have known was untrue or could not be true.
                    Yet, he did not question Dr Rahman or SCB Jakarta or inform OCBC. Instead,
                    he certified the First Letter as a true copy of the original (although he
                    claimed that he never received the original) and submitted it to OCBC to confirm
                    that APLL had sufficient financial resources to complete the
                Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_224"></a>224    After the Offer was placed in jeopardy by
                    doubts cast on the authenticity of the First Letter, the defendants made further
                    representations to OCBC (at <a href="#p1_218">[218]</a> above) to
                    prove that APLL had sufficient funds to satisfy full acceptance of the Offer.
                    Dr Soh must have known that those representations were untrue at the time
                    he made them. First, in a telephone conference with OCBC on the morning of
                    28 March 2008, Dr Soh represented that APLL would obtain a credit
                    facility from Deutsche Bank. However, Dr Soh did not assist in OCBC’s
                    verification of this credit facility (see <a href="#p1_80">[80]</a> above). It was subsequently revealed in Deutsche
                    Bank’s letter to OCBC that Deutsche Bank had not, in fact, offered a
                    credit facility to Dr Soh (see <a href="#p1_84">[84]</a>
                    above). Second, Dr Soh informed OCBC (at the telephone conference and in
                    the list of his assets given to OCBC) that FCGIL maintained an account with SCB
                    Jakarta which had a balance of approximately US$625m of which approximately
                    US$200m belonged to him (see <a href="#p1_80">[80]</a> and
                        <a href="#p1_92">[92]</a> above). It was Dr Soh’s
                    evidence that he owned only one-third of US$125m in FCGIL’s SCB Jakarta
                    account (see <a href="#p1_136">[136]</a> above and <a href="#p1_225">[225]</a> below). Third, on 29 March 2008,
                    Dr Soh stated in a telephone conversation with OCBC that HSBC London would
                    be sending a US$100m banker’s guarantee to Deustche Bank to secure a
                    US$80m credit facility. The arrangement did not materialise. Dr Soh also
                    provided copies of documents purportedly issued by SCB Jakarta which confirmed
                    the financial resources of FCGIL. As noted above at <a href="#p1_219">[219]</a>, the documents appeared to be forged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_225"></a>225    At the SIC Inquiry, Dr Soh admitted
                    that the funding for the Offer would allegedly come in the form of the Bank
                    Guarantee, which in turn would be issued on the strength of the US$625m
                    allegedly sitting in FCGIL’s account with SCB Jakarta. Yet, it was
                    Dr Soh’s own admission both at the SIC Inquiry and at this trial,
                    that FCGIL only owned US$125m of the US$625m. As a one-third shareholder of
                    FCGIL, Dr Soh must have known that he had at best US$42m in the remaining
                    US$125m, which figure was far short of the US$100m required to satisfy full
                    acceptance of the Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Rational Representation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_226"></a>226    The defendants’ motivation for
                    launching the Offer was also suspect (see <a href="#p1_164">[164]</a>). Dr Soh produced no evidence to support his claim
                    that he had decided to launch the Offer on the basis of a Giproshaht report on a
                    coal mine in Indonesia. The defendants appeared to have had no financial
                    resources to carry through let alone complete the Offer. It is undisputed that
                    neither APLL nor Dr Soh had sufficient financial resources of their own to
                    complete the Offer. Apart from the claimed arrangement with Dr Rahman, APLL
                    had obtained no commitment whatsoever from any financial institution to provide
                    funding for the Offer. Even if the arrangement with Dr Rahman existed,
                    since the US$500m could not be removed from the SCB Jakarta account, the
                    defendants still had no financial resources to satisfy full acceptance of the
                    Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_227"></a>227    Instead, the evidence is overwhelming that
                    at the end of January 2008, APLL and Dr Soh were under severe financial
                    pressure. APLL had transferred 145,050,000 Jade shares to Opes Prime as
                    collateral for a loan of close to $30m based on a value of $0.34 per share (see
                        <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above). APLL had also pledged 30
                    million Jade shares with SFL for a loan of $4m. (see <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above). However, by mid-December 2007, Jade shares were
                    trading below $0.30 per share, and multiple margin calls were made by Opes Prime
                    from October 2007 onwards. The price of Jade shares continued to decline to a
                    low of $0.16 per share on 21 January 2008 and this triggered the forced
                    sale of Jade shares by Opes Prime (see <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a>
                    above). To meet margin calls by Opes Prime and SFL respectively, on
                    25 January 2008, APLL transferred a further 155 million Jade shares to Opes
                    Prime and pledged a further 30 million Jade shares to SFL (see <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> and <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>
                    above). On 31 January 2008, when the First Meeting with OCBC was held, the
                    price of Jade shares had fallen to $0.10 per share.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_228"></a>228    Between 12 February 2008 and
                    31 March 2008, APLL and Faitheagle had reduced their stakes in Jade by the
                    sale of 51.2 million shares (see <a href="#p1_72">[72]</a> and
                        <a href="#p1_73">[73]</a> above). The defendants had
                    deliberately concealed these disposals of Jade shares from OCBC and had not
                    announced the disposals to the market. Their conduct of disposing of such a
                    substantial number of Jade shares at prices below the Offer price was
                    inconsistent with that of an offeror with a genuine intention of launching a
                    take-over of Jade. Such conduct could only mean that APLL would have to pay even
                    more money to buy back those shares when the Offer was completed. It bears
                    repeating that Dr Soh’s testimony, that he had transferred the 50
                    million Jade shares to Faitheagle on 10 March 2008 to provide for the widow
                    of one of Faitheagle’s investors (Ian Hendy) was not only inconsistent
                    with his submissions to the SIC but was also untrue, as the cash from the sale
                    of Jade shares by Faitheagle was never given to Mrs Hendy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_229"></a>229    I note too that Faitheagle had disposed of
                    15 million Jade shares at $0.22 per share on 31 March 2008, when the
                    authenticity of the First Letter had been thrown in doubt and the Offer was in
                    jeopardy because of the receivership of Opes Prime. The sale of the 15 million
                    Jade shares constituted almost 40% of the entire volume of Jade shares traded on
                    31 March 2008. On the very same day, Dr Soh was pleading with OCBC to
                    give him more time to raise funds to complete the Offer and also told OCBC that
                    he was “worried” that people were dumping Jade shares on the
                    market that day. In an email dated 1 April 2008 to OCBC, Dr Soh even
                    stated that he was “not in the position to control the disposal of shares
                    in Jade” (at <a href="#p1_209">[209]</a>
                above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_230"></a>230    The defendants deliberately concealed their
                    financial difficulties and dealings in Jade shares from OCBC. Their actions were
                    inconsistent with those of an offeror with a genuine intention to make an Offer.
                    I accept OCBC’s hypothesis that the defendants saw the Offer as a means of
                    propping up the price of Jade shares (which it temporarily did) so as to prevent
                    more margin calls and provide a respite from APLL’s financial pressures.
                    In fact, the defendants benefited from the increase in the price of Jade shares
                    when APLL’s Jade shares were sold surreptitiously after the Offer
                    Announcement was made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_231"></a>231    Whilst it might seem incredible that the
                    defendants would launch the Offer on a completely false basis, OCBC had
                    suggested one possible escape route that the defendants might have been relying
                    on. The escape route was that there would not be many acceptances of the Offer
                    and APLL would not have had to pay more than S$10m–S$20m for acceptances.
                    That would explain why APLL was disposing of Jade shares during the Offer
                    period. Moreover, OCBC had pointed out that in Dr Soh’s email dated
                    27 February 2008 in which Dr Soh sought to dissuade OCBC from seeking
                    a banker’s guarantee from him, Dr Soh had stated his concern that a
                    banker’s guarantee might not really be necessary since he “d[id]
                    not expect he need[ed] to use more than US$10millions [sic] for [the Offer] as
                    [he did] not expect large acceptances”. In his telephone conversation
                    with OCBC on 27 March 2008, Dr Soh repeatedly said that he only
                    expected to purchase 30 million Jade shares under the Offer for approximately
                    US$6m.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Responsibility Statements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_232"></a>232    The defendants knew that the Responsibility
                    Statements in the Offer Announcement and the Offer Document were false or were
                    reckless as to the truth. This can be inferred from the fact that the defendants
                    had failed to disclose the forced sale of Jade shares by Opes Prime and the sale
                    of Jade shares by APLL and Faitheagle between 12 February 2008 and
                    31 March 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The claim for negligent misrepresentation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_233"></a>233    Even if the defendants’ claim that
                    they were innocent and a fraud had been perpetrated on them is true (which I do
                    not accept), I am of the view that the defendants are still liable to OCBC for
                    negligent misrepresentation. The defendants assumed a responsibility for the
                    truth of the Shareholding Representation, the Financial Resources
                    Representation, the Rationale Representation and the Responsibility Statement
                    and/or owed OCBC a duty to take care in ensuring that they were true. Moreover,
                    the defendants knew or ought to have known that OCBC would rely upon the
                    representations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_234"></a>234    Whilst Dr Soh claimed to have relied on
                    an alleged financing arrangement with FCGIL and Dr Rahman, I find that any
                    such reliance would have been grossly negligent. As noted earlier at <a href="#p1_125">[125]</a>, Dr Soh took few steps to verify
                    Dr Rahman’s identity and the veracity of the statements that
                    Dr Rahman had made to him as well as the documents which Dr Soh
                    alleged that Dr Rahman had prepared for the Offer. As the SIC hearing
                    committee observed in its grounds of decision (at para 3.14),
                    “[u]ltimately, all the reasonable measures that Dr Soh claimed to
                    have taken to secure the necessary financing for the Offer boiled down to a mere
                    verbal agreement with Dr Rahman for the banker’s guarantee”. I
                    adopt the views of the SIC that Dr Soh failed to take reasonable steps to
                    be satisfied that he could and would be able to implement the Offer in full and
                    had been far too casual in his approach to his obligations to satisfy himself
                    that (1) he had the necessary financial resources to satisfy full acceptance of
                    the Offer; and (2) he retained beneficial interest in the Jade shares lent to
                    Opes Prime under the GMSLA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The claim for breach of the Mandate Letter</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_235"></a>235    The Mandate Letter (in particular, clauses 2
                    and 4(b) of its Appendix), obliged APLL to provide OCBC with correct and
                    accurate information and materials, to indemnify OCBC for its legal expenses in
                    connection with any dispute arising in connection with any services or
                    arrangements that were the subject of the Mandate Letter, and to hold OCBC
                    harmless against all actions, losses, claims, liabilities (joint or several),
                    costs, etc. which OCBC may suffer in connection with its appointment as
                    APLL’s financial adviser. However, the indemnities did not apply if the
                    expenses incurred by OCBC had “arisen directly from the gross negligence
                    or wilful default of OCBC Bank, its employees, officers and/or its
                    agents” (Clause 4(a) of the Appendix to The Mandate
                Letter).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_236"></a>236    I find that OCBC had not been grossly
                    negligent. APLL is therefore liable to indemnify OCBC for its costs and damages
                    in connection with OCBC’s appointment as financial adviser for the Offer
                    arising from its failure, to provide OCBC with correct and accurate information
                    and materials. By reason of the fact that the defendants had made the
                    Shareholding Representation, the Financial Resources Representation, the
                    Rationale Representation and the Responsibility Statements when they knew those
                    representations were false or, at the very least, were inaccurate, APLL breached
                    its duties as stated in cll 2 and 4(b) of the Appendix to The Mandate
                    Letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_237"></a>237    Clause 6.2 of the Appendix to the Mandate
                    Letter further provided that OCBC would be entitled to terminate the Mandate
                    Letter if APLL breached any term and/or obligation under the Mandate Letter or
                    if there was any development, event or circumstance which, in the reasonable
                    opinion of OCBC, may affect or prejudice the matters contemplated in The Mandate
                    Letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_238"></a>238    In the light of my findings, I hold that
                    OCBC was entitled to terminate the Mandate Letter on 2 April 2008 and to
                    discharge itself as financial adviser to the Offer. APLL is further liable to
                    OCBC for fees earned under different stages of OCBC’s performance of the
                    Mandate Letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The counterclaim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_239"></a>239    The defendants contended that OCBC should
                    not have announced the Offer on 18 February 2008. They alleged that the
                    true cause of the collapse of the Offer was OCBC’s failure to fulfil its
                    obligation as financial adviser to APLL on two counts: (1) the verification of
                    APLL’s shareholding in Jade in the light of the GMSLA; and (2) the
                    confirmation of APLL’s financial resources to complete the
                Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_240"></a>240    In view of my earlier findings, the
                    defendants’ counterclaim against OCBC for negligence must fail. In any
                    event, I am of the opinion that the mere fact that OCBC had been found by the
                    SIC to have breached the Code does not inexorably lead to the conclusion that
                    OCBC is liable to APLL for a claim in negligence. Rather, the facts must be
                    examined to determine, as between OCBC and the defendants, whether it was
                    OCBC’s failure to comply with the provisions of the Code or the
                    defendants’ fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentations that were the
                    direct and proximate cause of the parties’ losses following the collapse
                    of the Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_241"></a>241    Whilst I concur with the SIC’s
                    findings that OCBC ought to have made further enquiries on the GMSLA and
                    APLL’s financial resources (see <a href="#p1_108">[108]</a>
                    –
                    <a href="#p1_111">[111]</a> above), OCBC’s breaches of the
                    Code in failing to verify the defendants’ shareholdings in Jade and to
                    verify APLL’s financial resources did not cause the collapse of the Offer.
                    Rather, it was Dr Soh’s repeated misrepresentations to OCBC that had
                    resulted in the collapse of the Offer and the consequential losses and damage
                    suffered by OCBC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The defendants cannot argue that OCBC was defrauded because it failed
                to exercise reasonable care.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_242"></a>242    A fraudulent party cannot argue that the
                    victim was defrauded because he failed to exercise reasonable care (<em>Panatron Pte Ltd and another v Lee Cheow Lee</em> [2001]
                    2 SLR(R) 435 at [24]). As the defendants had perpetrated a fraud
                    against OCBC, the defendants’ counterclaim against OCBC for negligence
                    must necessarily fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The mere fact that OCBC had breached the Code does not mean that it
                is liable in negligence to the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_243"></a>243    The defendants’ counterclaim against
                    OCBC was premised on the SIC’s findings on OCBC’s conduct in the
                    Offer. While it accepted the findings of the SIC that it had breached the Code,
                    OCBC cited the decision of <em>Chandran a/l Subbiah v Dockers
                        Marine Pte Ltd</em> [2010] 1 SLR 786 (“<em>Chandran a/l Subbiah</em>”) and relied on the evidence
                    of Clark to submit that the mere fact it had breached certain provisions of the
                    Code did not mean that it was liable in negligence to the defendants. I agree.
                    Even if the defendants were not fraudulent, they would not have been able to
                    claim in negligence against OCBC as it was the defendants’ own conduct
                    that was the direct and proximate cause of their loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_244"></a>244    The Code was introduced in January 1974 as a
                    non-statutory code modelled on the UK’s City Code on Take-overs and
                    Mergers. The Code is given recognition in s 139 of the Securities &amp; Futures
                    Act (Cap 289, 2006 Rev Ed) and is administered and enforced by the
                    SIC. It is explicitly stated in the Introduction to the Code that the
                    “duty of the [SIC] is the enforcement of good business standards and not
                    the enforcement of law”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_245"></a>245    In <em>Chandran a/l
                        Subbiah</em>, the Court of Appeal observed (at [52] of the judgment)
                    that it is settled law that industry codes of conduct are not invariably
                    reflective of the existing common law standards of care. In determining the
                    appropriate standard of care in each individual case, the court considered all
                    relevant factors, and the existence of a regulatory code of practice is but one
                    such factor. Whilst <em>Chandran a/l Subbiah</em> concerned
                    the relevance of the Ministry of Manpower Workplace Safety and Health Advisory
                    Committee’s Compliance Assistance Checklist (Working at Height), the
                    observation of the Court of Appeal was not confined to the relevance of that
                    particular industry code but referred to “the relevance of industry codes
                    of conduct promulgated by regulatory authorities in ascertaining common law
                    obligations”. The Introduction to the Code states that “the
                    primary objective of the Code is the fair and equal treatment of all
                    shareholders in a take-over or merger situation” and that the Code
                    “represents the collective public opinion on the standard of conduct to
                    be observed <em>in general</em>, and how fairness can be
                    achieved in particular, in a take-over or merger transaction” [emphasis
                    added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_246"></a>246    Whilst the mere finding by the SIC hearing
                    committee that OCBC had breached certain provisions of the Code may be relied
                    upon as tending to establish or negate liability, it is not determinative of
                    OCBC’s liability for breach of any duty of care to the defendants. The
                    facts of the case must be examined to determine if OCBC is indeed
                liable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_247"></a>247    At the trial, Dr Soh clarified that his
                    claim that OCBC had breached its duty to him to advise on the Offer revolved
                    around the fact that OCBC had <em>not</em> advised him that
                    he could wait until 21 April 2008 to launch the Offer if he did not want to
                    purchase the Jade shares at 22.5 cents. According to Dr Soh, he was merely
                    asked if he had bought any shares and had therefore informed OCBC of his
                    purchase of shares at 22.5 cents on 21 January 2008. Dr Soh’s
                    evidence was that if OCBC had told him that the time period for which the
                    highest price that he had paid for Jade shares would be considered was three
                    months, he would have been able to wait until 21 April 2008 to launch an
                    offer for Jade shares at 10 cents or less. However, Dr Soh admitted that no
                    loss resulted from this alleged breach OCBC since the Offer was ultimately
                    withdrawn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_248"></a>248    Dr Soh alleged that OCBC had a duty, in
                    addition to looking at the Financial Resources Confirmation Letter, to ensure
                    that the funds held by SCB Jakarta were remitted to Singapore. However, since it
                    was his position that he had told OCBC that the funds could not be remitted
                    over, his case was actually that OCBC had a duty to finance the Offer. As
                    pointed out earlier, the weight of the evidence militates against such a
                    finding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_249"></a>249    It bears noting that the SIC found that
                    Dr Soh had committed multiple and serious breaches of the Code. The SIC
                    hearing committee had further commented that Dr Soh’s reticence and
                    breaches of the Code deprived OCBC of the opportunity to detect his failings and
                    advise him properly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_250"></a>250    OCBC had engaged Clark (see <a href="#p1_114">[114]</a> above) to provide an independent expert
                    report on its conduct as the financial adviser to APLL in connection with the
                    Offer. In particular, OCBC had asked Clark to give his views on:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">OCBC’s conduct in ascertaining the
                            shareholdings of APLL and Dr Soh in Jade, in particular, whether
                            OCBC was entitled to rely on information relating to the shareholdings
                            in Jade of APLL and Dr Soh, as reflected in the public records;
                            and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Whether OCBC had taken sufficient steps in the
                            circumstances in ascertaining that APLL had sufficient resources to
                            satisfy full acceptance of the Offer.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_251"></a>251    Clark prepared his report on the basis that
                    the version of events put forth by OCBC’s witnesses was true to the extent
                    that it was supported by contemporaneous documents. He found no evidence that at
                    any stage OCBC had offered to finance the Offer in whole or in part or that any
                    document that it produced would have given rise to any realistic expectation
                    that OCBC was to provide financing. Clark also found that throughout the
                    duration of OCBC’s engagement, at no time was Dr Soh able to
                    demonstrate through documentary or other genuine evidence, that he had any money
                    at all. It was clear from the list of his assets that Dr Soh had given to
                    OCBC that the financing of the Offer was far beyond his means. In fact,
                    Dr Soh had difficulties keeping in place the securities financing
                    arrangements with Opes Prime under which he, through APLL, owed some S$27m or
                    more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_252"></a>252    Crucially, Clark concluded that in the
                    circumstances in which OCBC found itself, it was not possible for OCBC to give
                    proper advice on the conduct of the Offer. He explained that the verification
                    process normally adopted to check the accuracy and completeness of statements in
                    a document produced to the standard required of both the Preliminary
                    Announcement and the Offer Document was not designed for and was not
                    particularly effective in unearthing fraud since the production of a forgery is
                    designed to withstand the normal procedures adopted in a verification exercise.
                    Clark stated that “[v]erification is not an investigative or forensic
                    process and cannot be expected to act as one” and that “[i]t is
                    not generally an issue that those launching a voluntary general offer
                    misrepresent their shareholding interest because generally they have no
                    motivation to do so or, if they do, it is impossible to find this
                    out.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_253"></a>253    As for the GMSLA, Clark had opined that it
                    was reasonable for OCBC to have assumed that A&amp;G would have ensured that it
                    received a copy of the GMSLA as requested and would have regarded it as a
                    document necessary for A&amp;G to carry out its drafting and verification so
                    that A&amp;G would have read it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_254"></a>254    Clark stated that in all his years of
                    experience, he knew of no instance where an offeror had launched a voluntary
                    general offer:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_254-p2_a"></a>(a)     when it patently did not have any
                        of the resources to carry through to completion were the offer to become
                        unconditional;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_254-p2_b"></a>(b)     in circumstances when it may have transferred title to the greater part of
                        its shareholding to financiers, that shareholding being itself a controlling
                        shareholding; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_254-p2_c"></a>(c)     in the course of which it used the opportunity afforded by the offer
                        to dispose of a material portion of the balance of its
                    shareholdings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">He considered the situation “highly
                    unusual”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_255"></a>255    Clark also considered it unique that a
                    financial sufficiency statement had been supported by forged letters from an
                    offeror’s bank and by someone pretending to be an officer of the
                    offeror’s bank. In this regard, he placed the ultimate responsibility for
                    the production of accurate information on the directors of the offeror.
                    Moreover, Clark noted that due diligence and verification processes cannot be
                    relied upon to expose what was by design false, inaccurate or
                incomplete.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_256"></a>256    In Clark’s opinion, OCBC took a
                    disciplined approach from the outset. Dr Soh appeared credible and
                    convincing and there was nothing that would be expected to have put OCBC on its
                    guard. Clark summed up the relationship between the client and his financial
                    adviser as <em>not</em> one</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… where you find out the truth and I’m not going to help you
                        find it. It must be the other way. The client must be open with his
                        position, must be open with the information, must give information that is
                        complete, and then proper advice can be given.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">He concluded that the procedures that OCBC adopted were usual for the
                    transaction at hand and that there was no evidence to suggest that OCBC was
                    presented with information which would, or should, have caused it to be
                    suspicious of the information being provided to it, which it decided to
                    ignore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_257"></a>257    I am in broad agreement with Clark’s
                    observations set out above. Although I disagree with the observation of the
                    defendant’s expert witness, Smith, that OCBC’s officers had made no
                    enquiries about Dr Soh’s financial position and had accepted whatever
                    Dr Soh had told them without making enquiries, I do accept as valid
                    Smith’s criticism that OCBC had fallen short of the requirements of the
                    Code in its conduct of the Offer (see <a href="#p1_211">[211]</a>
                    above). Nevertheless, whilst OCBC ought to have complied with the provisions of
                    the Code in carrying out its verification of Dr Soh’s financial
                    resources and shareholdings in Jade, that does not mean that OCBC is liable in
                    negligence to Dr Soh for that reason. Dr Soh had concealed material
                    information from OCBC and provided OCBC with several forged Documents Evidencing
                    APLL’s Financial Resources the origin of which he was unable to
                    satisfactorily explain at trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">OCBC was not involved in the process of ramping up the price of Jade
                shares through OCBC Securities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_258"></a>258    The defendants’ allegation that OCBC
                    might be a concert party to the Offer by virtue of OCBC Securities’
                    holdings in Jade shares and that OCBC Securities was involved in ramping up the
                    price of Jade shares was baseless. Hui had testified that OCBC Securities is a
                    security brokerage firm that does not hold any proprietary interest in the
                    shares which are in its custody.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_259"></a>259    The defendants had approached OCBC to launch
                    the Offer despite knowing that they had no funds to satisfy full acceptance of
                    the Offer and that they did not have any financing arrangement in place.
                    Throughout their interactions with their legal and financial advisers, the
                    defendants repeatedly misrepresented APLL’s financial resources and level
                    of shareholdings in Jade. The defendants had also presented OCBC with forged
                    and/or false documents to prove that they had the financial resources to proceed
                    with the Offer. Although the defendants either knew or had been put on notice
                    that they and/or the persons related to them were not to carry out any
                    undisclosed transactions in Jade shares, the defendants sold a large portion of
                    APLL’s unencumbered Jade shares at prices below the Offer price, prior to
                    the conclusion of the Offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_260"></a>260    Consequently, OCBC succeeds in its claim
                    against the defendants. Accordingly, I award OCBC interlocutory judgment on its
                    claim and dismiss the defendants’ counterclaim. The damages suffered by
                    OCBC will be assessed at a later stage. Such assessment will determine whether
                    OCBC is entitled to $410,094.77 (inclusive of GST) or some other sum as its fees
                    under the Mandate Letter, whether OCBC should recover all or any part of the
                    $835,327.25 which it incurred as legal and associated expenses in relation to
                    the SIC inquiry and the opportunity cost it apparently lost when OCBC
                    voluntarily abstained from carrying out any financial advisory work for eleven
                    months after 11 April 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_261"></a>261    Clause 4(b) of the Mandate Letter reads
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.(b) if, in connection with any services, matters or
                        arrangements that are the subject of this mandate letter, OCBC Bank becomes
                        involved in any capacity in any dispute or claim or action or legal
                        proceeding, the Company unconditionally agree on demand to:-</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    reimburse OCBC Bank (whether or not OCBC Bank
                                is a formal party to any such action or legal proceeding) the legal
                                fees, disbursements of counsel and other expenses (including the
                                costs of travelling, investigation and preparation) incurred by OCBC
                                Bank on a full indemnity basis;...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">OCBC is entitled to and shall therefore have the costs
                    of its claim and the defendants’ counterclaim on an indemnity basis, which
                    costs are to be taxed unless otherwise agreed.</p>
