</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p></p></font>1.    This was an appeal against the decision of the High Court

dismissing the appellant’s defence that she was entitled to a strip of land which

adjoins the appellant’s property, located at No. 26 Leedon Road, and the

respondent’s neighbouring land at No. 24 Leedon Road, by way of adverse possession.

At the close of the hearing, we allowed the appeal and confirmed the appellant’s

claim that she had acquired ownership of the disputed strip by adverse possession. We now

give our reasons. For convenience we shall hereinafter refer to the two properties known

as 26 Leedon Road and 24 Leedon Road as "No. 26" and "No. 24"

respectively.

<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Background</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">2.    On No. 26 is a house with garden purchased by one Mr CF Sawyer in

1962. In 1970, the appellant married Mr Sawyer and moved in to live with him. She has been

living there ever since. Her two children, a boy aged 6 and a girl aged 8, also moved in

to live there. In 1974, Mr Sawyer transferred ownership of the property to the appellant.

Mr Sawyer passed away in January 1993.</p>
<p xmlns="">3.    No. 26 and No. 24 share a common boundary which is about 200 feet

long. In July 1999, the respondents, who are husband and wife, purchased No. 24 from the

previous owner (one Mr Tan) to build their new home. Towards that end, topographic surveys

were carried out and it was discovered that the fence separating the two properties did

not follow the boundary line as it curved in the middle section and encroached onto the

side of No. 24, and at the broadest point the encroachment was up to some 10 feet. The

fence deviated from the boundary line about 2/3 of the way. The encroached portion has an

area of approximately 800 sq feet.</p>
<p xmlns="">4.    It was not in dispute that the encroachment was not done

deliberately by the appellant. According to her, the fence had been in that position since

she moved into the property in 1970 and that the disputed strip had always been a part of

the compound of No. 26. She was told by her husband that the fence was erected by Reckitt

&amp; Colman Singapore Pte Ltd, the then owner of No. 24. In the eighties Reckitt &amp;

Colman erected a wooden fence along a part of the mesh wire fence to enhance privacy. </p>
<p xmlns="">5.    In 1994, a significant change in the law took place in Singapore.

By virtue of what is now s 50 of the Land Titles Act (Cap 147) no one may, after 1 March

1994, acquire any registered land by adverse possession. But the new law does not affect a

person who has been in adverse possession of registered land for 12 years or more before 1

March 1994. In other words, the new law does not affect title already acquired by adverse

possession: <i>Balwant Singh v Double L&amp;T Pte Ltd</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=10251&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1996] 2 SLR 726</a>.</p>
<p xmlns="">6.    As far as the respondents were concerned, they had no idea as to

the history of the fence. The previous owner, one Mr Tan, from whom the respondents bought

the property, had only owned it for some three years. The owner previous to Mr Tan was

Reckitt &amp; Colman. Nevertheless the respondents commenced the present action to recover

the disputed strip from the appellant on the ground that the later had not been in adverse

possession of it for the required 12 years as at 1 March 1994. They relied on a plan known

as Certified Plan No. CP 16587 (CP 16587) filed in the Chief Surveyor's Department. CP

16587 was based on a survey of No. 24 carried out in November/December 1983, at the

request of the then owner to refix boundary marks which were out of position and lost, and

the results of which survey were recorded in the Survey Department Field Book No. 22696.

The survey was carried out, and the recording made, by Field Assistant Mr Lee Siah Hing

(Mr Lee). The plan showed that in late 1983 the fence was running correctly along the full

length of the boundary line. No deviation was noted. However, the appellant said that the

plan did not correctly depict the position of the fence on site.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Evidence for the appellant</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">7.    It is clear that in law the burden of proving adverse possession

rests with the claimant: see ss 103 and 104 of the Evidence Act. According to the

appellant, the fence had been in that position since 1969 when she visited Mr Sawyer at

No. 26 before they were married. No change had been made to the fence. Shortly after she

moved into No. 26, she and her late husband planted and maintained a hedge alongside a

part of the fence and a portion of the hedge was on the disputed strip. The hedge was only

10-15 feet long. Later it was removed but the fence was left intact. She stated

categorically that in her thirty years of residence there, the fence had never been moved.</p>
<p xmlns="">8.    The appellant also said that she and her husband planted trees in

the garden. Among them were 14 clusters of MacArthur palms, a belimbing tree and a huge

wild cherry tree (also called Salam tree) which were planted on the disputed strip. The

Salam tree was cut down ten years ago and what remained was just a stump. Further, to

improve the landscape of the garden, they obtained and placed several rocks/boulders on

the disputed strip. A photograph taken in the seventies was produced by the appellant

showing the rocks and beside them was a stone lantern. A recent photograph taken of the

same location showed that the lantern was no longer there. The appellant could not recall

when it was removed.</p>
<p xmlns="">9.    The appellant’s daughter very much corroborated what the

mother told the court. She reiterated that the position of the fence had never been moved.

She lived there from 1970 to 1989 when she moved out on her marriage. Although from 1981

to 1986 she was in England for studies she had returned home every year during her

vacation. The disputed strip had always been a part of the garden of her house. She

remembered the rocks which were placed there. However, in cross-examination she admitted

that if the fence had moved a foot or two while she was away, she would not necessarily

have noticed the change upon her return.</p>
<p xmlns="">10.    The appellant’s son also lived at No. 26 from 1970 to 1987

before he moved to stay at a university hostel. He was there during the relevant period.

He also affirmed that the position of the fence had not been altered in all those years

and he gave some reasons why he remembered the fence to be there. But for the purposes of

this appeal we need not go into those reasons.</p>
<p xmlns="">11.    The appellant also called a retired professor of Botany from the

NUS, Prof Rao Nagaraja Adisheshappa (Prof Rao), to shed light on the age of various

trees/plants grown on the disputed strip. Of the 14 clusters of Macarthur palms grown

there alongside a part of the wire fence, except for one cluster, all the others showed

varying degrees of damage or of being disturbed. The one undamaged cluster had a full set

of young and mature stems and many of the stems were more than three times the height of

the wooden fence behind them, which was about seven feet. In his opinion, such a palm

would normally grow at approximately 10 to 12 inches per year and this meant that the palm

was over 20 years old.</p>
<p xmlns="">12.    The appellant’s last witness was a registered surveyor, Mr

Tang Tuck Kim, who had served a year in the Survey Department in the early seventies,

followed by five years as a surveyor in the Registry of Land Titles &amp; Deeds. The gist

of his evidence was that the purpose of a plan such as CP 16587 was to accurately depict

the boundary lines of a property and to verify and refix the boundary marks. It was not

intended to accurately depict non-permanent features such as a fence. His examination of

the Field Book No. 22696 confirmed that. Furthermore, from page 6 of the Field Book where

there was a plan (plan page) one could see that the surveyor only recorded the

measurements of the two extreme ends of the fence and nothing in between. In his view, the

surveyor merely made an assumption that the fence line was straight without actually

taking measurements to check it out. However, Mr Tang had to retract his assertion that

the surveyor who prepared CP16587 was not concerned with non-permanent features such as a

fence after he was shown the provisions of r 47(a) of the Land Surveyors’ Rules 1976.

But as will be seen later, the views of Mr Tang were consistent with a reply from the

Survey Department dated 9 May 2001 (see  29 and 30 below).</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Respondent’s evidence</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">13.    The respondents called a land survey technician, Mr Wong Tuck

Kheong, to give an account of what he found on the land when his company, Acemap Survey

Services Pte Ltd, was engaged to conduct a topographic survey of No. 24. He told the court

that in August 1999, he went down to the site following an earlier survey carried out by

another employee, one Haris Bin Ripin, which showed a crooked mesh wire fence. He climbed

over to the side of No. 26. What he found was set out in a statutory declaration affirmed

in January 2001 as follows:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"When I climbed over the mesh wire fence somewhere near to the

  swimming pool, I noticed that there was another damaged mesh wire fence (metallic in

  colour and rusty) amongst the dense vegetation that was at the area of the crooked

  boundary line was (sic). However, the metallic mesh wire fence was standing in part and

  broken in part. At the broken parts there were footings for a fence still on the ground. I

  surveyed this fence and I was able to ascertain that the boundary line was where the

  damaged fence was."</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">14.    However, on the day he appeared in court to testify, he made a

correction. He said there was,</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"no mesh wire fence standing on the footings. The footings were

  concrete debris found on the site. There were remnants of the mesh wire fence, one to two

  centimetres, stuck on what appeared to me as footings for a fence. The concrete on which

  the traces of mesh wire fence that were found were (sic) also sparsely spread out."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">He also said in cross-examination that he saw concrete debris with

traces of wire fencing at four points. But in view of the lapse of time, he could not

indicate where the four points were.</p>
<p xmlns="">15.    Another witness called by the respondents was a registered land

surveyor, Mr Anthony Lim, who had previously worked in the Survey Department (from

1963-1970), and the Jurong Town Corporation before commencing private practice in 1979. Mr

Lim, upon examining the plan page of the Field Book came to the conclusion that on 1

December 1983 there was, in fact, a mesh wire fence running along the legal boundary

between No. 24 and No. 26.</p>
<p xmlns="">16.    While Mr Lim admitted that the surveyor recording the plan page,

Mr Lee, did not take any further measurements along the boundary in relation to the

position of the fence, he was nevertheless of the view that Mr Lee did not make any

assumption when he drew a straight line between the two end points of the fence. He

further said, looking at page 10 of the Field Book, that it was clear that besides the two

end points, Mr Lee was also at an intermediate position, marked 19 on that page and which

had a circle around it (station 19), and from that position Mr Lee would have been able to

see that the fence between the two end points was a straight line. He said the surveyor

would have stood at station 19 and seen that the fence was a straight line between the two

ends although a person standing at one end of the fence would not be able to see the other

end. Relying on his own experience, he concluded that Mr Lee would have taken care to

ensure the accuracy of his depiction of the position of the fence.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Decision below</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">17.    The trial judge was not satisfied that the evidence adduced by

the appellant had rebutted the presumption arising under s 85 of the Evidence Act on

account of what was shown on CP 16587. She felt the appellant’s evidence lacked

objectivity and made the following observations:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"In cross-examination, the defendant came across as a person who

  was strongly attached to the disputed strip. She considered it to be, indisputably, her

  property and was resentful that what she called a ‘ridiculous case’ had come up

  and made her sit in the witness box in order to answer ‘silly questions’. She

  did not agree that the disputed strip did not fall within the description of No. 24 as

  contained in the certificate of title which had been issued for No. 24. She was next asked

  whether she agreed that the disputed strip fell within the certificate of title held by

  the plaintiffs and her answer was that she did not know. When she was asked whether she

  agreed that the disputed strip fell on the plaintiffs’ side of the boundary line, her

  answer was an emphatic ‘no’. The defendant’s lack of objectivity was

  revealed in these responses."</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">18.    The trial judge also found the memories of the appellant and her

daughter not to be entirely reliable. She referred to one aspect and here we would quote

her:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"Another difficulty with the defendant’s evidence was her

  statement that the cherry tree was well over 20 feet in height in 1970. Her daughter, Ms

  Teo, supported this testimony by stating that when she moved in as a child, the cherry

  tree had been ‘huge’ to her. The evidence of Professor Rao, the botanist, was

  that the stump of the cherry tree showed that it had been about 20 years old when it was

  cut down. According to the defendant, the tree had been cut down in about 1991. Taking

  these two facts together would mean that the cherry tree was either not yet in existence

  in 1970 or if it was that it was very young and not yet at a height that would allow it to

  be described as ‘huge’ even from the perspective of an eight year old child.

  This was one aspect at least, on which the memories of the defendant and her daughter were

  not reliable."</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">19.    Furthermore, the trial judge did not feel that she could place

much reliance on the evidence of the son and daughter because they had discussed the case

with their mother. She suggested that they could have been influenced by the assertions of

their mother.</p>
<p xmlns="">20.    As regards the evidence of Mr Tang, the trial judge was inclined

to think that his report could be less objective as it was finalised in consultation with

the appellant’s solicitors. Furthermore, the way Mr Tang presented the matter seemed

to be like someone putting forward a case rather than a person giving expert evidence. She

referred to, inter alia, an aspect of his evidence touching on the significance of a stone

marker laid by the then Singapore Telephone Board (predecessor of Singapore

Telecommunication Ltd) on site where he tried very hard to place some significance on the

marker when there was really no objective basis for him to do so.</p>
<p xmlns="">21.    The trial judge held that the appellant had failed, on the

balance of probabilities, to rebut the presumption laid down in s 85 of the Evidence Act

that the plan (CP 16587) was accurate. She noted that the plan was cited in the

certificate of title relating to No. 24 and it was a document on which any person having

dealings with the property would rely. She accepted the evidence of Mr Wong relating to

his discovery of concrete debris and footings of an old mesh wire fence at the boundary

proper, as well as the views offered by Mr Lim as to how Mr Lee would have gone about

carrying out the survey in late 1983.</p>
<p xmlns="">22.    The trial judge held the fact that the drains of the two

properties converged at the fenceline was neither here nor there, bearing in mind, inter

alia, that in the distant past the four properties, including the present two properties,

were owned by the same entity and there was no fencing between the properties.

Furthermore, there was evidence indicating that drains were laid to follow the terrain of

the land rather than the boundaries. As regards a wooden fence built by the then owner of

No. 24 which ran alongside the existing fence, she felt that that must have been erected

after the 1983 survey, otherwise it would have been reflected on CP 16587. Furthermore,

according to the son of the appellant, the wooden fence was erected during the period from

early to mid-eighties.</p>
<p xmlns="">23.    As regards the MacArthur palms, the judge felt that the problem

was in determining their age, bearing in mind Prof Rao’s opinion that growth of the

palms could be faster in the right condition.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

The appeal</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">24.    The central issue of this appeal was whether the trial judge

erred when she held that on the evidence before her the appellant had not rebutted the

presumption prescribed in s 85 of the Evidence Act that CP 16587 was accurate. The

appellant did not dispute that the presumption in s 85 did arise in relation to the plan.

However, she submitted that the trial judge was plainly wrong in the conclusion reached.</p>
<p xmlns="">25.    The thrust of the respondents’ argument was that what was

decided by the trial judge was a question of fact and on a question of that nature, an

appellate tribunal should be slow to reverse such a finding unless the judge had

misdirected himself or was plainly wrong on the evidence. All that the respondents need

show was that as on 1 March 1982 the curved fence was not there. CP 16587 was proof of

that. It was not for the respondents to show when, and by whom, the curved fence was

installed.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Accuracy of CP 16587 </p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">26.    We would observe that the entire case of the respondents rested

on CP 16587. The trial judge also found corroboration for what was depicted in CP 16587 in

the evidence of Mr Wong. It was therefore important to bear in mind which part of CP 16587

was being challenged. It would be recalled that CP 16587 was drawn based on the recording

in the Field Book. The appellant did not assert that the entire plan was incorrect but

only that part which depicted the common fence to be a straight line.</p>
<p xmlns="">27.    The accuracy of CP 16587 was questioned on the ground that the

surveyor, Mr Lee, had assumed that the fenceline was straight when it was, in fact,

curved. It could not be supported by the measurements recorded at the two extreme ends of

the fenceline which showed that the fence was off marginally at one end. Both ends were

not intervisible. Mr Lim placed importance on the notation of station 19 on page 10 of the

Field Book to say that Mr Lee, from that position, would be able to see that the fence

running from the two ends was a straight line. But the fact of the matter was that there

was nothing to indicate what Mr Lee did at station 19 in relation to the fenceline. His

task then was to ascertain the boundary markers. He did not even indicate what was the

closest distance between station 19 and the fence. We entertained serious doubts whether a

person standing at station 19, and not at a point along the fence nearest to station 19,

could accurately ascertain whether the fence throughout its whole length was a straight

line running along the legal boundary. Mr Lim asserted that to any person standing at

station 19, <u>any</u> curvature of the fence would have been abundantly obvious. This

must clearly be an over-statement or an exaggeration. Surely, much would depend on the

degree of the curvature and the contour of the land itself.</p>
<p xmlns="">28.    Surveying is a precise science and if Mr Lee had intended to

determine the exact position of the fenceline throughout its entire length, we would have

expected him to indicate how he went about doing it. There was nothing of that at all

except in relation to the two end points of the fence. The manner postulated by Mr Lim as

to how Mr Lee could have gone about undertaking the survey of the fenceline was, at best,

speculative. If indeed, that was the manner in which Mr Lee went about determining the

direction of the fenceline, then, in our view, it was a pretty shoddy piece of work. Here,

we would like to refer to rules 55 and 71 of the Land Surveyors Rules, 1976 which

prescribed how title surveys were to be carried out. Under rule 55 all surveys for title,

including relocations of boundaries, were required to be recorded in field books and

submitted to the Chief Surveyor. Rule 71 provided that:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"71. The computations required to be submitted with the field

  notes and plan of a title survey shall be such as will – </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) prove the accuracy and adequacy of the field work;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) determine the areas of the lots surveyed; and</p>
<p align="justify">(c) relate the positions of the lots surveyed to those of other

    existing surveyed lots in the neighbourhood."</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">It was therefore essential that there must be adequate field work to

justify whatever conclusion was drawn.</p>
<p xmlns="">29.    There was, in this regard, a very pertinent letter dated 9 May

2001 from the Survey Department in answer to certain queries raised by the

appellant’s solicitors. It reads:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"Field observations in Field Book No. 23696 pages 3, 5, 7 and 9,

  and diagram pages 8 and 10 were checked by staff of the Survey Department. Field Book No.

  22696 page 6 was not checked as it was a recording of the field details that were not

  permanent features, such as fences, wall, edge of metalled roads, coping of concrete

  drains, etc, in relation to the lot boundaries."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">It would be noted that page 6 of FB 22696 was, in fact, the plan page,

upon which CP 16587 was based and that page was not checked for the reasons given.</p>
<p xmlns="">30.    Mr Lim sought to explain this reply from the Survey Department,

in the light of his previous experience in the Survey Department, where he had worked as a

field assistant, draughtsman and chief draughtsman, that it only meant there was no

mathematical check in respect of the survey of the fencing. We would have thought that the

reply was clear enough: that the plan page was not checked. He also said CP 16587 would

have gone through the hands of the district surveyor, who would inspect Mr Lee’s work

at site, and would have been checked by a draughtsmen, a draughtsman checker and the chief

draughtsman. We did not think that was disputed. But the plain fact was that there was

nothing on record to indicate that any one had checked Mr Lee’s calculations or

drawings insofar as the non-permanent features were concerned, and this would include the

fence. In any case, there were insufficient data for any person to check on the accuracy

of the fencing. That probably explained why the Survey Department replied the way it did.</p>
<p xmlns="">31.    In our judgment, Mr Lim was merely speculating as to what Mr Lee

did in relation to the fence. He really had no idea what Mr Lee did. The experience which

he relied on was something that occurred thirteen years before the survey carried out by

Mr Lee in 1983. He seemed to suggest there was no change in the Department’s

practices between 1970 and 1983, without appreciating that the Land Surveyors Rules, 1976,

were introduced some six years after he left the Department. Even the 1976 rules were

subsequently replaced by new rules in 1991. Accordingly, his speculations could not stand

in the face of the letter from the Survey Department stating that non-permanent features

in CP 16587 (which included the fence) were not checked. There were no computations or

field notes for any check to be undertaken. The appellant pointed out that even Mr Lim,

who was engaged to survey No. 24 in relation to this dispute, got his facts wrong. In his

topographical survey map, as well as in his affidavit, he represented that the wooden

fence ran along the whole length of the mesh wire fence, which was not the case. </p>
<p xmlns="">32.    While it was true that Mr Lee spent some three days at No. 24 to

survey the site and had taken measurements on numerous locations around the site, it could

not be denied that as far as the fenceline was concerned, the measurements taken by Mr Lee

were only in relation to the two end points and nothing more. With respect to the trial

judge, we think she had given undue weight to the evidence of Mr Lim, which in the

material respects, were mere conjectures on his part, based on what seemed like out-dated

practices of the Survey Department. In the absence of objective evidence, like

measurements and computations recorded in the Field Book, which were required to be kept

under r 71, the probative value of the presumption in s 85 of the Evidence Act in relation

to CP 16587 had been reduced to almost nothing at all.</p>

Reliability of Mr Wong’s evidence</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">33.    We will at this juncture consider the evidence of Mr Wong, which

was relied upon by the trial judge in coming to her conclusion that the existing fence was

probably moved post 1983. In finding that Mr Wong was a credible witness, the trial judge

observed "it was to his credit that he modified his original statement by making it

clear that he had not found the fence still standing but simply concrete debris with small

remnants of fencing". She seemed to think that Mr Wong made the clarification on his

own volition.</p>
<p xmlns="">34.    In 13 above we have set out what Mr Wong stated in his

statutory declaration. Because the appellant could not understand this statement, in April

2001 her solicitors sought clarification on it and asked for the details as to the

"exact location of the alleged damaged mesh wire fence and the footings of the

fence". The clarification sought was not forthcoming.</p>
<p xmlns="">35.    It was only on the morning when Mr Wong came to be cross-examined

that the respondents’ solicitors filed a clarification statement by Mr Wong. The

material part of the statement is set out in 14 above. The respondents’ solicitors

had met Mr Wong to prepare the clarification statement. But, as mentioned above, two

months before this, the appellant’s solicitors had already sought clarification on

that precise point which request was simply ignored. In the circumstances, we seriously

doubted it could be said that Mr Wong gave the clarification of his own volition.</p>
<p xmlns="">36.    Be that as it may, what struck us was the following four points

made by the appellant which, in our opinion, gravely undermined the evidence of Mr Wong:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) Mr Wong said that the survey by his firm was first conducted by a

  colleague. The field data, which showed a crooked boundary, were no longer available as

  they were keyed into the computer directly. Mr Wong explained that he went to the site to

  inspect the fence on his own initiative because he thought boundary lines were seldom

  crooked. Yet following his investigations he made no report, prepared no field notes, took

  no photographs and was even unable to identify where along the boundary were the 4 points

  of concrete debris. He would have known the significance of his findings.</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) In the statutory declaration, made almost two years after his

  alleged investigation, Mr Wong asserted that in 1999 another metallic wire fence was

  standing in part and broken in part along the boundary. He made no mention of the 4 points

  and yet he could remember during his cross-examination that what he saw in 1999 was in

  fact not a metallic wire fence standing in part and broken in part but 4 points of

  concrete debris with 1 or 2 cm remnants of an old fence.</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) Prior to Mr Wong’s clarification statement, the appellant

  had specifically stated in her affidavit that there was never any such fence which was

  standing in part or broken in part and that she never removed any such metallic fence and

  its footings at any time after 1999. The appellant was not challenged on this in

  cross-examination. In fact, the alleged findings by Mr Wong either as described in the

  original statutory declaration or his clarification statement were never even put to the

  appellant in cross-examination.</p>
<p align="justify">(iv) If there were, in fact, 4 points of concrete debris with remnants

  of an old fence existing in 1999, they should still be there as the appellant clearly

  stated that she did not remove any such footings and she was not challenged on that. The

  trial judge, however, advanced an explanation in her judgment that the retained moisture

  would have contributed to the decay of the old fence. Not only was this explanation not

  advanced by the respondents in the court below, we had serious doubts that there was any

  scientific or objective basis for that proposition: could moisture disintegrate concrete

  debris? </p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">37.    It is trite law that an appellant court should be reluctant to

overturn findings made by the trial judge because they are in a less advantageous position

as compared to the trial judge who has had the benefit of hearing the evidence of the

witnesses and observing their demeanour: <i>Clark v Edinburgh &amp; District Tramways Co

Ltd</i> (1919) SC (HL) 35. But an appellate court is entitled to examine the evidence

against inherent probabilities or against uncontroverted facts: <i>Peh Eng Leng v Peh Eng

Leong</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=10060&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1996] 2 SLR 305</a>.</p>
<p xmlns="">38.    In relation to the evidence of Mr Wong, unlike the judge, we were

not able, testing his evidence against the objective facts, to conclude that he was a

reliable witness. We did not think just because a witness made a clarification that he was

thereby shown to be reliable. Obviously the circumstances under which the clarification

came about, including its timing, and the substance of the clarification were critical. In

his statutory declaration he stated, inter alia, there was a "damaged mesh wire fence

… standing in part and broken in part. At the broken parts there were footings for a

fence still on the ground." However, the so-called "clarification" he made

was drastic – there was no mesh wire fence standing on the footings. No explanation

was offered on how the mistake crept into the statutory declaration. Was he trying to

mislead, and faced with the prospect of being cross-examined, decided to come clean? If he

could not remember correctly at the time he made the statutory declaration what he found

at the investigation, it was less likely that he would be able to recall correctly, some

months later, what he had found. Accordingly, we were convinced, in the light of this and

the other reasons mentioned in 36 above, that the corrected version of Mr Wong’s

evidence should not be accepted on its face value.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Was the fence moved?</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">39.    We now turn to the question of the probabilities of the fence

being moved after 1 March 1982. On this, only one of two persons could have done it,

either the appellant or the previous owner of No. 24. Of course, the third possibility was

that the fence was always in that position since the appellant moved into No. 26.</p>
<p xmlns="">40.    The evidence of the appellant was abundantly clear. The fence was

in that position all the years she was there. She did not shift the fence. In none of the

respondents’ witnesses’ affidavit of evidence in chief was it stated that the

appellant shifted the fence post the 1983 survey. It was also not suggested to her in

cross-examination that she moved the fence. Having regard to the rule in <i>Browne v Dunn </i>[1893] 6 R 67 it was no longer open to the respondents to assert that the appellant moved the

fence. While we recognise that the rule in <i>Browne v Dunn</i> is not rigid, and it does

not mean that every point should be put to a witness, the point which the respondents

sought to make was at the very heart of the matter and it should have been put to the

appellant, so that she could further clarify why she could not have moved the fence.</p>
<p xmlns="">41.    Two other factors also militated against the appellant being the

person who moved the fence post 1983. There were plants/trees on the disputed strip. More

will be said about these plants/trees later. If the appellant had sought to move the fence

nearer to the other side, surely the occupiers of No. 24 would have known and protested.

Nothing of that happened. Another significant fact was that even the respondents

themselves said that the appellant was unaware of the encroachment until they brought it

to her attention. In the circumstances the only conclusion that could reasonably be drawn

was that the appellant did not move the fence post 1983.</p>
<p xmlns="">42.    Then could it be that it was the predecessor in title of the

respondents who moved the fence post 1983? Counsel for the respondents made such a

suggestion in his cross-examination of the appellant who denied it. Two points may be made

here. First, there was no evidence at all that any such predecessor in title moved the

fence. Second, why should the previous owner make such a move, thus losing the enjoyment

of a portion of the land amounting to some 800 sq feet? It is true that the previous

owners erected the wooden fence but the wooden fence was on their side of the wire fence

without affecting the position of the wire fence. The wooden fence only ran a third of the

way of the fenceline along that portion where the appellant’s patio was overlooking

the swimming pool of No. 24. It was erected to obtain privacy for the occupants using the

swimming pool.</p>
<p xmlns="">43.    The above aside, before us, the appellant relied in the main upon

three objective features to reinforce the point that the fence was never moved since the

early seventies. We will examine each of these features in turn.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Boulders/rocks</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">44.    As mentioned before, two photographs were tendered to the court

below which showed a part of the fence. One was taken in the seventies (photograph A) and

it showed some rocks/boulders with a stone lantern. Another (photograph B) was taken

shortly before the trial, and it showed the rocks but the stone lantern was no longer

there. Neither the appellant nor her children could tell when the stone lantern was

removed. The trial judge was not persuaded that a comparison of two photographs could

prove that the fence was never moved. She seemed to think that as the stone lantern had

been moved, the boulders could similarly have been moved.</p>
<p xmlns="">45.    It was the appellant’s evidence that the boulders as shown

in photograph B were on the disputed strip. This was not challenged by the respondents or

their witnesses. It was apparent to us on a close examination of the two photographs that

the boulders, which are non-symmetrical and not uniform in size or shape, were in exactly

the same position. In both photographs, the distance between the fence and the boulders

appears to be similar. The only thing missing was the stone lantern which the appellant

could not recall when that was moved. We did not think this mattered, although if the

lantern were still there, it would merely support the same point. It would be noted from

photograph A that the lantern stood very much on its own, although adjacent to the

boulders. It did not follow that just because the lantern had been removed, that the

boulders must also have been moved. It was not suggested by the respondents in

cross-examination that the fence was moved when the stone lantern was shifted. If the

boulders had been moved, we could not imagine that they would be placed relative to each

other in exactly the same formation. It must be borne in mind that the appellant then did

not know anything about adverse possession. The respondents could only make a general

allegation that there were differences in the positions of the boulders as shown in the

two photographs, but they could not be more specific.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Hedge</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">46.    The appellant’s unequivocal evidence was that she and her

husband planted and maintained a hedge from the early seventies till the early nineties.

It was only about 10-15 feet in length. It ran alongside a small part of the fenceline.

This evidence was unchallenged. One could see the hedge in photograph A. There was no

evidence or suggestions from the respondents that their predecessor-in-title planted the

hedge. But for the sake of argument, even if they did, the hedge had become a part of No.

26 from the seventies. In the light of our views expressed above as to what photograph A

and photograph B depicted, it must follow that the hedge was planted on the disputed

strip.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Plants/Trees: </p>
<p align="justify">(a) Belimbing Tree</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">47.    In a survey plan prepared by Mr Anthony Lim (the

respondents’ expert) a curry tree (also known as Belimbing tree, and its fruits are

used to make curry) was depicted to be growing on the disputed strip. The appellant said

she planted the tree. According to Professor Rao, this tree was about 20 years old when he

inspected it. This meant that the tree was there since 1980. Accordingly, the fence could

not have moved post 1983.</p>
<p xmlns="">48.    It was true that the age of the Belimbing tree, being 20 years

old, was only an estimate. Because it was an estimate, the trial judge could not accept

the evidence of Prof Rao. In law, while a judge is not obliged to accept the opinion of an

expert, even in a situation where there is no contrary expert evidence, such rejection

must be based on sound grounds: see <i>Saeng Un Udom v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=61521&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2001] 3 SLR 1</a> at 8-9. We

did not think just because the age given was an estimate, that that in itself was a good

ground to reject the expert opinion. In the realm of expert evidence, it invariably

involves a matter of judgment. This was a scientific issue outside the learning of a

judge.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

(b) MacArthur Palms</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">49.    In the view of the trial judge the problem here was in

determining the age of the palms and this could not be determined with any accuracy. Of

the 14 clusters of MacArthur palms, only one cluster was not damaged. Upon examination of

the cluster, which was 20 feet in height, Prof Rao concluded that it was well over 20

years old. He did also examine the other clusters, but because they were damaged or

disturbed, he offered no concluded views on them.</p>
<p xmlns="">50.    The trial judge could not accept this expert opinion of Prof Rao

as the latter also clarified that palms could grow 15 feet in 4 years "in good

condition". This was where an error had crept in due apparently to the closing

submission of the respondents. Probably counsel for the respondents had misunderstood the

answer given by Prof Rao. According to the official notes of evidence furnished by the

court, what Prof Rao said was this:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"Q: Is it possible for a MacArthur palm to attain the height of 15

  feet in 4 years?</p>
<p align="justify">A: It’s possible if you change the conditions."</p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">51.    This clarification did not introduce any uncertainty to the

opinion of Prof Rao that that palm was over 20 years old. Unless the conditions <i>changed</i>

there was no way the palm could have grown at such a rapid pace. It must be remembered

that Prof Rao was giving his opinion on the palm in relation to its actual condition at

No. 26.</p>
<p xmlns="">52.    Another reason which seemed to have affected the trial

judge’s perception of Prof Rao’s evidence on the MacArthur palms was that there

was no explanation from the appellant why the 13 clusters were damaged or disturbed. She

seemed to think that it was possible that the palms were damaged when the fence was being

removed. This was at best a speculation. There could be so many reasons why the thirteen

clusters were damaged or disturbed. It need not be because of the removal of the fence.

More importantly, the appellant was never asked why the 13 clusters were damaged. She

would have had an answer to that point if she was asked. Prof Rao did categorically state

that the one undamaged palm was at least 20 years old. It was the appellant’s clear

evidence (which the judge seemed to have accepted) that she and her husband planted all

the palms, and they were, at the time of the trial, along the fence (although 13 were

damaged). All these clearly militated against any suggestion that the fence had been moved

post 1983. And if there was such a movement of the fence, then surely there would be a gap

between the palms and the fence. But there was no such gap.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

(c) Salam tree</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">53.    We have earlier referred to a stump of a Salam tree. First, the

trial judge seemed to think that there was no clear evidence that the stump was on the

disputed strip. Furthermore, she felt the evidence of the children on this tree was

unsatisfactory. They seemed to recall that in the seventies, it was a huge tree. But on

the basis of Prof Rao’s testimony, the tree stump which Prof Rao saw on the disputed

strip could not have been a huge tree in the early seventies. Thus, the trial judge

concluded that this could only mean one of two possibilities:-</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(i) the huge tree which the children remembered as having existed in

  1970 was a different tree; or</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) there was no huge tree in 1970 and their memories of a huge tree

  related to a much later period.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The appellant also thought that in the early seventies, this tree was

about 20 feet high.</p>
<p xmlns="">54.    Perhaps the children had made a mistake as to the size of this

tree. So did the appellant as to its height. But the fact of the matter was that as at the

time of the trial, the stump of the Salam tree was there on the disputed strip near the

fence. It was the appellant’s evidence that this tree was cut down in about 1990 and

according to Prof Rao, having examined the stump, it was at least 20 years old at the time

it was cut down.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Judgment</p>
</b>
<p xmlns="">55.    In the light of the matters aforesaid, it was our view that the

trial judge erred in concluding that the presumption raised in s 85 had not been rebutted.

In our judgment, the evidence clearly established that the fence had not been moved

post-1983.</p>
<p xmlns="">56.    In the result, we allowed the appeal and declared that the

appellant had acquired ownership of the disputed strip by adverse possession. We also

ordered that a resurvey be carried out in line with the decision reached by us in this

appeal and that the cost of the resurvey be borne by the appellant. The security for

costs, together with any accrued interest, was ordered to be refunded to the

appellant’s solicitors. The appellant was awarded costs of this appeal and of the

action below.</p>
