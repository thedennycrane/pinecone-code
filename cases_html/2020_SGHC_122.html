</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The terms “demand bond”, “bank guarantee” and “performance guarantee” are almost used synonymously in practice. The bond here was described as an unconditional first demand bank guarantee. A valid call on such bond is not premised on any breach of contract, and payment would normally follow from a call. However, payment on the bond would trigger repayment by the account party to the bank or financial institution giving the bond, and the account party would want to stop payment if it felt it had grounds to do so.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law on injunctions against calls on bonds</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The general approach to the granting of injunctions to prevent a call has been comprehensively expounded on in several Court of Appeal cases. There are competing policy considerations in determining whether to grant an injunction: on one hand, there is a need to protect the beneficiary’s right to call on the bond to protect its liquidity; on the other hand, calls made in bad faith would result in the beneficiary receiving something he was not entitled to and damage the liquidity of the obligor, making the bond susceptible to usage as an instrument of oppression (<span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia</span> ([17] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [26] to [31]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In general, the court should be slow to disrupt the status quo by granting an injunction as parties should abide by the contractual bargain that they have struck (<span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia</span> at [25]). The provision of the bond by the obligor as security may have had influenced the terms of the contract and the court should be slow to upset this allocation of risk which the parties themselves have undertaken (<span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia</span> at [25]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Importantly, the court does not determine whether to grant an injunction based on the merits of the case (<span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia</span> at [45]).  However, an injunction may be granted on grounds of fraud or unconscionability (<span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia</span> at [18]); only the latter is relied on by the applicant in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Unconscionability</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The reason that the courts have allowed the exception of unconscionability apart from the fraud exception is to cater for situations where the conduct of the beneficiary was sufficiently reprehensible to justify an injunction, but where the conduct did not amount to fraud (<span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia</span> at [23]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia </span>at [20] noted that there is a high threshold for establishing unconscionability, and the applicant bears a burden of proof of showing a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of unconscionability. When determining if a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case has been made out, the entire context of the case must be thoroughly considered, and it is only if the entire context of the case is particularly malodorous that such an injunction should be granted; the courts’ discretion to grant such injunctions must be sparingly exercised and it should not be an easy thing for an applicant to establish a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case (<span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia</span> at [21]). This high threshold strikes the right balance between the competing policy interests highlighted at [27] above, and prevents unnecessary interference with the parties’ contractual arrangements (<span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia</span> at [39]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The Court of Appeal found that it was impossible to define unconscionability but gave some broad indications as to when conduct would be found to be unconscionable (<span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia</span> at [44]). According to the Court of Appeal, unconscionability involves conduct of a kind so reprehensible or lacking in good faith that a court of conscience would restrain the party (<span class="font-italic">Raymond Construction Pte Ltd v Low Yang Tong</span><span class="font-italic"> and Another</span> [1996] SGHC 136 at [5], cited in <span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia</span> at [42]). Unconscionability also refers to conduct so lacking in <span class="font-italic">bona fides </span>that an injunction is warranted (<span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia</span> at [45]).

This was fatal to the beneficiary’s claim as the bond was an indemnity performance bond that could only be called based on actual loss (at [30]). Nevertheless, even if the bond had been an on demand bond, the call would still have had been unconscionable as: the price for the rectification works was grossly inflated; the contractor for rectification works did not appear to have had any expertise in that area; the letter of award did not contain details as to the scope of rectification works; and other forms of abusive conduct on the part of the beneficiary circumstances (at [26] to [30]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In <span class="font-italic">Soon Li Heng </span><span class="font-italic">Civil Engineering Pte Ltd v Samsung C&amp;T Corp and another </span>[2019] SGHC 267, the court found that the beneficiary’s call on the bond was for the purposes of fulfilling claims which had already been rejected by an adjudicator, which would have the effect of undermining the temporary finality of the adjudication determination.

The applicant relied on <span class="font-italic">JBE </span>([19] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [10] for this proposition:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Singapore courts’ rationale in applying unconscionability as a separate and independent ground for restraining a call on a performance bond… is that a performance bond serves a different function from a letter of credit. The latter performs the role of payment by the obligor for goods shipped to it by the beneficiary (typically via sea or air from another country), and “has been the life blood of commerce in international trade for hundreds of years” (see <span class="font-italic">Chartered Electronics</span> at [36]). Interfering with payment under a letter of credit is tantamount to interfering with the <span class="font-italic">primary</span> obligation of the obligor to make payment under its contract with the beneficiary. Hence, payment under a letter of credit should not be disrupted or restrained by the court in the absence of fraud. In contrast, a performance bond is merely security for the <span class="font-italic">secondary</span> obligation of the obligor to pay damages <span class="font-italic">if</span> it breaches its primary contractual obligations to the beneficiary. A performance bond is not the lifeblood of commerce, whether generally or in the context of the construction industry specifically. Thus, a less stringent standard (as compared to the standard applicable <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> letters of credit) can justifiably be adopted for determining whether a call on a performance bond should be restrained. We should also add that where the wording of a performance bond is ambiguous, the court would be entitled to interpret the performance bond as being conditioned upon facts rather than upon documents or upon a mere demand, contrary to the dictum of Staughton LJ in <span class="font-italic">IE Contractors Ltd v Lloyds Bank Plc and Rafidain Bank</span> [1990] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 496 at 500. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 However, the passage relied on by the applicant has to be understood in its proper context. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">JBE </span>had been trying to establish unconscionability as a ground to grant an injunction restraining a call on a performance bond. In the UK, such injunctions were only allowed in circumstances where fraud was proven (<span class="font-italic">JBE</span> at [7] to [8]). This strict position taken in the UK was influenced by the similarly strict UK position taken in relation to letters of credit (<span class="font-italic">JBE</span> at [8]). The Court of Appeal, in trying to depart from the UK position and adopt a broader position allowing unconscionability as grounds for injunction, explained that a less stringent threshold should be imposed for performance bonds instead of letters of credit (<span class="font-italic">JBE</span> at [10]). Allowing unconscionability as grounds for injunction was in itself the lower threshold proposed by the Court of Appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Hence, the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">JBE </span>in no way contradicted the findings in <span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia </span>(above at [31]) that unconscionability requires a high threshold: the former dealt with whether unconscionability should even be allowed as grounds for injunction, while the latter dealt with the threshold (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case) required for proving unconscionability.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Second, the applicant also relied on <span class="font-italic">GHL</span> ([34(e)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) to argue for a lower threshold for the injunction.

</div>
</div>
</div> In my view, this case does not assist the applicant. <span class="font-italic">GHL</span> was a 1999 decision of a two-judge Court of Appeal which dealt with the issue of whether unconscionability was a separate ground from fraud for issuing an injunction to restrain a call on a bond (at [14] to [24]). The court found that it was, where a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of unconscionability could be proven (at [24]). This seems to be a lower standard as compared to the high threshold of a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case required in <span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia</span> (above at [31]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 However, <span class="font-italic">GHL </span>focused primarily on whether unconscionability should even be allowed as grounds for injunction, without discussing the standard of proof in much detail. It was also decided 13 years earlier than the Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia</span>, which was heard by a three-judge panel and specifically went into great detail discussing the requisite standard of proof for unconscionability. <span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia </span>considered the previous case law from the past 13 years and beyond, emphasising the policy reasons why the court should be slow to disturb the contractual status quo, and found that a high threshold of unconscionability was needed. The principles in <span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia </span>hence provide a more accurate, recent and comprehensive exposition of the approach to be taken towards injunctions for the restraint of calls on performance bonds, and should be applied herein.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Unfairness as a separate ground</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Next, the applicant argues that an injunction should be granted if it would be unfair for the beneficiary to realise his security pending the resolution of the substantive dispute (above at [20]). This argument seems to be establishing unfairness as a standalone ground for an injunction, or equating unfairness to unconscionability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 However, it is clear that unfairness is not a separate standalone ground for an injunction restraining a call on a performance bond. Nor is unfairness equal to unconscionability. To introduce unfairness as a standalone criterion would be to broaden the scope of these injunctions to such an extent that the bond’s role as security would be significantly undermined. Unfairness is only one factor amongst other factors, albeit an important one, in determining unconscionability. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia</span> at [43] cited the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Eltraco</span> ([17] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [30], stating:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The appellants would appear to suggest that based on this opinion, unfairness, <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, could constitute ‘unconscionability’. We do not think it necessarily follows. Lai Kew Chai J said the concept of ‘unconscionability’ involves unfairness. We agree. That would be so. In every instance of unconscionability there would be an element of unfairness. But the reverse is not necessarily true. It does not mean that in every instance where there is unfairness it would amount to ‘unconscionability’. That is a factor, an important factor no doubt in the consideration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 This passage makes it clear that unconscionability is not a free ranging inquiry of fairness in a loose sense; such a position would go against the strictures on protection of the sanctity of the agreement entered into the parties.  Also, as indicated above at [32], unconscionability refers to conduct lacking <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span>, and not unfairness in a loose sense as contended by the applicant.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Relevance of a genuine dispute</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The applicant also argues that where there is a genuine dispute, the court should grant an injunction to protect the obligor from unfairness.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 However, the mere existence of a dispute pending resolution of the substantive matter cannot <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> support an injunction on grounds of unfairness or unconscionability. Firstly, this would flip the settled approach to unconscionability on its head; the burden lies on the applicant to prove a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of unconscionability and if it fails to meet that burden, then the appropriate course is to lift the injunction (above at [31]). Further, it is well established that calling on the bond where there is a <span class="font-italic">genuine</span> dispute does not amount to unconscionability (<span class="font-italic">Eltraco</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [32]; <span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia </span>at [52])<span class="font-italic">.</span> Where such genuine disputes exist, a call on the bond cannot be described as abusive and the beneficiary is entitled to protect its own interests (<span class="font-italic">Eltraco </span>at [32]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 <span class="font-italic">Arab Banking</span> at [104], as cited by the applicant, does not support the applicant’s proposition that calling on the bond where there is a genuine dispute would be unconscionable. The paragraph states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Essentially, it seems to us that the unconscionability exception exists because we recognise that in certain circumstances, even where the account party cannot show that the beneficiary had been fraudulent in calling on the bond, it would nevertheless be unfair for the beneficiary to realise his security <span class="font-italic">pending resolution of the substantive dispute</span>. In other words, on one view, the unconscionability exception serves to protect the account party from unfair demands by the beneficiary to have the secured sum in hand in circumstances where there has not yet been a final determination as to whether he is actually entitled to that sum. On this view, it would be doubtful whether the unconscionability exception has any relevance where the substantive dispute under the primary contract has been finally resolved. In that situation, the account party’s liability (or lack thereof) to the beneficiary would already have been assessed. Therefore there would no longer be any question of whether it would be fair to allow the beneficiary to receive payment under the performance bond. The only question remaining is whether there is an entitlement to such payment. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The applicant seems to be relying on the phrase in the paragraph which states: “it would nevertheless be unfair for the beneficiary to realise his security pending resolution of the substantive dispute”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 However, this must be understood in context. This paragraph was part of a discussion on the issue of whether the unconscionability exception can still apply to restrain the call where the substantive dispute had been fully determined. The paragraph found that the unconscionability exception applies pending resolution of the substantive dispute, and that its relevance was doubtful where the dispute was resolved. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Arab Banking </span>did not find that unconscionability or unfairness would definitely be made out if the bond was called upon pending resolution of the substantive dispute. It merely recognised that this could be so “in certain circumstances”, which should be understood as referring to the requirement of a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of unconscionability as required by previous case law. Further, <span class="font-italic">Arab Banking </span>did not modify the previous approach, and does not stand for the proposition that unfairness, as distinct from unconscionability, is a separate ground for granting an injunction; it also did not purport to depart from the approach in previous cases on what unconscionability entails. The applicant’s reliance on <span class="font-italic">Arab banking</span> was hence misplaced.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 As stated at [44] above, the applicant also relied on <span class="font-italic">Min Thai</span> to argue that an injunction should be granted where there was a genuine dispute. <span class="font-italic">Min Thai </span>involved a three-party contractual arrangement where the seller of rice would sell the rice to an intermediary who would in turn sell the rice to the buyer; the contract between the intermediary and the buyer required the seller to give a performance bond to the buyer to guarantee the delivery of rice (at [5] to [17]). Problems with the delivery of rice arose due to flooding, and the buyer called on the bond (at [19] to [23]). The court noted that there were many genuine issues in dispute, such as: whether the International Chamber of Commerce’s <span class="font-italic">force majeure </span>conditions applied; whether performance of the contract was affected by <span class="font-italic">force majeure</span>; and whether the seller was even privy to the contract between the intermediary and the buyer, such that the seller could restrain payment under the bond (at [32] to [34]). Ultimately, the High Court held that the call was unconscionable and that the buyer should have waited for the dispute to be resolved.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Although <span class="font-italic">Min Thai </span>seems to support the applicant’s position, I am not sure that <span class="font-italic">Min</span><span class="font-italic"> Thai</span> would necessarily be decided the same way post-<span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia</span><span class="font-italic">. </span>It was a High Court decision made in 1998, 14 years before the Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia</span>. The court in <span class="font-italic">Min Thai </span>did not have the benefit of examining the detailed policy considerations set out in <span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia </span>and the high threshold for unconscionability established therein. To the extent that <span class="font-italic">Min Thai</span> suggests that calling on a bond where there is a genuine dispute amounts to unconscionability, it contradicts the Court of Appeal authorities at [45] above and should not be followed. I note that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Dauphin </span><span class="font-italic">Offshore Engineering &amp; Trading Pte Ltd v The Private Office of HRH Sheikh Sultan bin Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan </span>[2000] 1 SLR(R) 117 at [46] had referred to <span class="font-italic">Min Thai </span>as an example of unconscionability; however, the existence of the genuine dispute in <span class="font-italic">Min Thai </span>was not examined by the Court of Appeal there.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Relevance of restructuring proceedings</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The applicant argues that if there is any doubt about the existence of unconscionability, an injunction should be granted, considering the financial state of the first respondent.

Parties calling on bonds are not to be treated differently merely because they are in the midst of a restructuring. The fact that the obligor may be exposed to the financial constraints of the beneficiary is not good enough reason to bar the call if no other reason exists.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether unconscionability is made out</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I am satisfied that looking at the entire context of the case, the applicant has failed to meet its burden of showing a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of unconscionability (see [31] above). I accept that the evidence and arguments raised by the first respondent from [61] to [66] above sufficiently demonstrate that there is a genuine dispute between the parties, and that the call on the first demand bond did not lack <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span>. It is not necessary to weigh the strength of both sides’ arguments as it is not for the court to go into the merits of this dispute but it suffices for the court to determine that the dispute is genuine.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 As shown from the parties’ arguments above, there is a clear genuine dispute between the parties as to the root cause of the pump failures. This in turn affects whether the applicant had breached its warranty obligations. In essence, the applicant insists that the root cause was the first respondent’s improper use of the pumps outside the permitted ranges, while this is vehemently denied by the first respondent, who had sent the applicant several emails stating so. The first respondent asserts that the root cause was design flaws in the pumps. There is nothing to show that this dispute was contrived, minor, or fully resolved to everyone’s satisfaction. There is also no evidence that the first respondent did not genuinely believe that there is such a dispute, and/or did not genuine believe that the applicant had breached its warranty obligations. While the applicant pointed to the terms of the OM Manual to show that the first respondent accepted the pump design and the incompatibility of a slow ramp up, the first respondent denies this, arguing that the needed technical information was not conveyed to it, and also denies whether the slow ramp up was even the root cause of the failures in the first place (above at [57] and [62]). It may be that more evidence will be needed to fully substantiate and decide the substantive dispute, perhaps even through a trial, but the above suffices to show that these concerns and issues were genuinely in the mind of the first respondent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 There was also no delay which rendered the first respondent’s conduct unconscionable. While the applicant argues that the call was only made about two years after the pump failures began and about six months after the pumps were fixed (see [60] above), the first respondent explained that this was because it needed some time to verify if the pumps were fully fixed (see [66] above). I accept the first respondent’s arguments. Given the long period of pump failure, including repeated failure despite repeated attempts at remedial works, it was reasonable for the first respondent to monitor the pumps for some time to see how matters panned out. A six-month time lag does not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> show unconscionable conduct or bad faith, especially where the correspondence between the parties showed an ongoing genuine dispute. <span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia </span>([17] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) can be distinguished as in that case, the beneficiary made no allegations nor complaints to the obligor either in writing or otherwise about any alleged breach (at [48]). This was not the case here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 There is no bright line that will distinguish an unconscionable delay from the usual lapse of time that may arise in commercial matters; this must be determined on the circumstances of each case. A short dispute which was quickly resolved, followed by just a few months’ or possibly even a few weeks’ passage of time, may be enough to show lack of <span class="font-italic">bona fides </span>and that the beneficiary did not genuinely believe that he had a right to call on the bond. However, a long-drawn dispute may require longer time for the beneficiary to monitor the situation and decide whether to call on the bond. The nature of the dispute and the depth of disagreement may also be material. Here, the six months’ lapse did not render the dispute or controversy moot. Although the applicant claims that all matters were settled, that the first respondent had acquiesced that the pump failures were due to its improper use, and that the first respondent had signified this by paying for the remedial works (see [59] above), the first respondent’s arguments are sufficient to show that this might not be true (see [64] above). The fact that the call was made just prior to expiry also does not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto </span>indicate any untoward conduct, unless something more exists to prove such; no such evidence was adduced here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Finally, while the applicant argues that cl 10.8 of the General Terms and Conditions excludes other warranties such that a slow ramp up was not required, it is conceivable that arguments and evidence may be adduced to allow the first respondent to circumvent cl 10.8, such as by an implied term or some other means; that would be a matter for trial. There may be situations in which no reasonable argument can be put forward, but there would have to be a very clear case to preclude the existence of a genuine dispute. This was not such a case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on the substantive issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Due to the above, the applicant has failed to prove its burden of a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of unconscionability. The evidence and arguments raised by the respondent at the <span class="font-italic">inter partes </span>hearing significantly changes the one-sided picture painted by the applicant at the urgent <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>hearing, showing that there was a genuine dispute, and that there was no unconscionable delay. This is sufficient to discharge the injunction, but the first respondent raises the following jurisdictional issues in its supplementary submissions which will be briefly addressed for completeness.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Preliminary Jurisdictional Issues</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Underlying claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The first respondent argues that it is trite that an injunction cannot be free standing but must be based on an underlying cause of action; however, the applicant’s originating summons contained no underlying cause of action (see [10] above). The first respondent relied on <span class="font-italic">Fourie v Le Roux and others </span>[2007] 1 WLR 320 (“<span class="font-italic">Fourie</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Siskina (owners of cargo lately laden on board) and others v Distos Compania Naviera S.A</span><span class="font-italic">. </span>[1979] 1 A.C. 210 (“<span class="font-italic">Siskina</span>”) in support of this proposition.

</div>
</div><span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The first respondent’s contention is misplaced, and as will be shown below, these decisions do not assist the first respondent. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Nature and purpose of the present injunction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The present injunction is best characterised as a freestanding prohibitory injunction. It is a prohibitory injunction as it prohibits the first respondent from calling on the bond. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In addition, it is freestanding as it is not an interlocutory injunction. An injunction is not interlocutory if the sole and entire purpose of the originating process is to obtain the injunction, because once that application had been determined, the entire subject matter of that proceeding would have been spent (<span class="font-italic">Maldives Airport Co Ltd and another v GMR Mal</span><span class="font-italic">é International Airport Pte Ltd</span> [2013] 2 SLR 449 (“<span class="font-italic">Maldives Airport</span>”) at [15]). In contrast, the interlocutory nature of an interlocutory injunction is derived from the fact that it is sought not as the main or substantive claim in and of itself, but only as ancillary relief to a separate substantive claim; in such situations, the substantive claims should appear on the writ or originating process served on the other party (<span class="font-italic">Bi Xiaoqiong (in her personal capacity and as trustee of the Xiao Qiong Bi Trust and the Alisa Wu Irrevocable Trust) v China Medical Technologies, Inc (in liquidation) and another</span> [2019] 2 SLR 595 (“<span class="font-italic">Bi Xiaoqiong</span>”) at [118]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 This distinction is illustrated on the facts of <span class="font-italic">Maldives Airport</span>. There, the respondent argued that the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal as the injunction was an interlocutory one. The respondent argued that any injunction which sought to preserve the legal rights and obligations of the parties before the dispute was completely disposed of was an interlocutory order. This was rejected by the Court of Appeal (at [14] to [15]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14 The Respondent raised a preliminary objection to the jurisdiction of this court. Counsel for the Respondent… submitted that the Judge’s decision to grant the Injunction was a decision made on an interlocutory application and so, leave to appeal was required pursuant to s34(2)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“the SCJA”). As the Appellants had not sought leave from the High Court… the Court of Appeal therefore had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal. In support of the argument that the Judge’s decision was given pursuant to an interlocutory application, Mr Pillay referred to <span class="font-italic">PT Pukuafu Indah v Newmont Indonesia Ltd</span> [2012] 4 SLR 1157 (“<span class="font-italic">PT Pukuafu</span>”), where Lee Seiu Kin J observed (at [20]) that an interim order which sought to preserve the legal rights and obligations of the parties before the dispute was completely disposed of was an interlocutory order. Lee J defined (likewise at [20]) an interlocutory order as “an order that [did] not decide the substance of the dispute or an order under s12 of the IAA during the pendency of arbitration proceedings”. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15 The Respondent’s jurisdictional objection is without merit. First, it is incorrect to characterise the Judge’s decision as one made on an interlocutory application. The application for the Injunction was made by OS 1128; the sole purpose of OS 1128 was to seek the Injunction. It would be odd if OS 1128 were characterised as an interlocutory application when there was nothing further for the court to deal with once the Injunction had been either granted or refused. This was not a case where an interlocutory injunction was sought pending the resolution of a substantive dispute before the court. The sole and entire purpose of the originating process in this case was to obtain the Injunction. Once that application had been determined, the entire subject matter of that proceeding would have been spent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Similar to the originating summons in <span class="font-italic">Maldives Airport</span>, the sole object of HC/OS 1323/2019 is to seek the injunction; once this application is determined, the proceedings are spent. No cause of action was disclosed in the originating summons. This shows that the present injunction is not interlocutory.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In addition, the present injunction is not an interlocutory injunction as its purpose is not to preserve the rights of parties pending any substantive proceeding. The purpose of the present injunction is solely to prevent the injustice of the beneficiary calling on the bond without <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span>. Whether the beneficiary lacked <span class="font-italic">bona fides </span>is an issue that has to be decided by the judge issuing the injunction. The following example illustrates that injunctions restraining an unconscionable call on a bond can and should be issued despite the absence of an underlying cause of action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 A beneficiary calls on a bond issued by the obligor, although neither party had breached their contractual obligations to each other under the relevant contract. At this stage, neither party has any valid cause of action against each other. It is clear that the call was made in bad faith, since there is no breach and no dispute. The obligor applies to court to seek an injunction on grounds that the call was unconscionable. If the injunction was interlocutory in nature, the court would not be able to grant the injunction even though the call was clearly unconscionable, because the obligor has no cause of action against the beneficiary. This is clearly illogical. There is no reason to expect the obligor to lodge a cause of action against the beneficiary, where there is none. The court should not decline to issue an injunction preventing a clearly unconscionable call, just because the obligor has no cause of action against the beneficiary. Instead, in such cases, the cause of action was avoided precisely because of the injunction; if the injunction had not been granted and the call had been made, the obligor would then in that situation have a cause of action for restitution of the bond sum, since the beneficiary has no basis, contractual or otherwise, for calling on the sum. Indeed, the first respondent gave no authority to suggest that the obligor had a duty to file a substantive cause of action in order to seek an injunction against a call made unconscionably. The above explains that such injunction does not have to be based on a separate cause of action, but serves to protect pre-existing legal rights from an invasion, to prevent a potential<span class="font-italic"> </span>cause of action from arising. It is also not necessary to require the applicant to seek a negative declaration that the beneficiary has no right to call on the bond; such declaration is not a cause of action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 A case in point is <span class="font-italic">Ryobi Tactics </span>([34(d)] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). An injunction was granted even though the obligor did not have any substantive proceedings against the beneficiary under the relevant contract; it was sufficient for the court to find that there was no breach under the relevant contract, and that the beneficiary was acting unconscionably by making the call to cover losses for breaches under another contract. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the court has power to grant a freestanding injunction </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The first respondent argues that it is trite that an injunction cannot be freestanding. No local authority was cited to support this proposition. Indeed, the injunction at issue in <span class="font-italic">Maldives Airport </span>itself was a freestanding prohibitory injunction; it prohibited the appellant from interfering with the respondent’s performance of its obligations under the contract (at [8] to [9]), although it was not based on any pending resolution of substantive dispute before the court (at [15]). Although the injunction in <span class="font-italic">Maldives Airport </span>was eventually set aside on the basis that it did not satisfy the balance of convenience test (at [54]), the Court of Appeal did not hold that the injunction had to be discharged simply because of its freestanding character.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The first respondent’s reliance on the foreign cases was misplaced because they dealt only with interlocutory injunctions but not freestanding injunctions. In particular, the cases were dealing with Mareva injunctions, the purpose of which is to preserve the assets so that the final judgment sum can be enforced against the assets. <span class="font-italic">Siskina</span> ([73] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) stated at p 256:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… That the High Court has no power to grant an interlocutory injunction except in protection or assertion of some legal or equitable right which it has jurisdiction to enforce by final judgment, was first laid down in the classic judgment of Cotton L.J. in <span class="font-italic">North London Railway Co. v. Great Northern Railway Co.</span> (1883) 11 Q.B.D. 30, 39-40, which has been consistently followed ever since.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Lord Scott in <span class="font-italic">Fourie </span>([73] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) stated at [33]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Whenever an interlocutory injunction is applied for, the judge, if otherwise minded to make the order, should, as a matter of good practice, pay careful attention to the substantive relief that is, or will be, sought. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The above shows that the cases dealt only with interlocutory injunctions and did not deal with the separate question of whether the court has power to issue a freestanding injunction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 However, it is useful to note that Lord Scott in <span class="font-italic">Fourie</span>, sitting on the House of Lords,<span class="font-italic"> </span>found that the court had power to issue injunctions (even interlocutory injunctions) even if there were no substantive proceedings. He stated at [30]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">My Lords, these authorities show, in my opinion, that, provided the court has in personam jurisdiction over the person against whom an injunction, whether interlocutory or final, is sought, the court has jurisdiction, in the strict sense, to grant it. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 He found that the lower courts were wrong in finding that there was no power to grant such injunction (at [25]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The references to jurisdiction made both by Sir Andrew Morritt V-C and by the deputy judge… read as though they had in mind jurisdiction in the strict sense. If they did, then I think they were wrong. It seems to me clear that Park J had jurisdiction, in the strict sense, to grant an injunction against Mr Le Roux and Fintrade. Both were within the territorial jurisdiction of the court at the time the freezing order was made. Both were, shortly after the freezing order had been made, served with an originating summons in which relief in the form of the freezing order was sought. There is no challenge to the propriety or the efficacy of the service on them… The issue is, in my opinion, not whether Park J had jurisdiction, in the strict sense, to make the freezing order but whether it was proper, in the circumstances as they stood at the time he made the order, for him to make it. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 To the extent that <span class="font-italic">Siskina</span> laid down a general rule that the court only had power to issue injunctions derived from substantive proceedings, this was departed from by Lord Scott in <span class="font-italic">Fourie</span> at [30]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The practice regarding the grant of injunctions, as established by judicial precedent and rules of court, has not stood still since <span class="font-italic">The Siskina</span> [1979] AC 210 was decided and is unrecognisable from the practice to which Cotton LJ was referring in <span class="font-italic">North London Railway Co v Great Northern Railway Co</span> (1883) 11 QBD 30, 39–40 and to which Lord Diplock referred in <span class="font-italic">The Siskina</span>, at p 256. <span class="font-italic">Mareva </span>injunctions could not have been developed and become established if Cotton LJ's proposition still held good.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Lord Scott also explained that the court’s power to grant injunctions, regardless of whether it was based on any substantive proceeding, was derived from the powers of the Chancery courts to grant injunctions (at [25]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The power of a judge sitting in the High Court to grant an injunction against a party to proceedings properly served is confirmed by, but does not derive from, section 37 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 and its statutory predecessors. It derives from the pre-Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 (36 &amp; 37 Victc 66) powers of the Chancery courts, and other courts, to grant injunctions…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 This is consistent with the Court of Appeal’s dictum in <span class="font-italic">Eltraco </span>([17] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) at [36] which explained that an injunction to restrain an unconscionable call is based on the court’s exercise of its equitable jurisdiction, to achieve equity and justice:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It must be borne in mind that the court in restraining a beneficiary from calling on a bond on the ground of unconscionability is exercising an equitable jurisdiction… to ensure that there is no injustice or abuse… The object of this jurisdiction is not to punish the beneficiary for making an excessive call but to achieve equity and justice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Hence, it is clear that the court has the power to grant a freestanding injunction to prevent injustice, in exercise of its equitable jurisdiction. This power is confirmed by (albeit not derived from) O 92 r 4(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed), which allows the court to make any order as necessary to prevent injustice:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Inherent powers of Court (O. 92, r. 4) </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">4.</span> For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that nothing in these Rules shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent powers of the Court to make any order as may be necessary to prevent injustice or to prevent an abuse of the process of the Court.

This contradicts the House of Lords decision in <span class="font-italic">Fourie</span>, which held that the court has power, in the strict sense, to issue a Mareva injunction as long as there is <span class="font-italic">in personam</span> jurisdiction, even if there is no reasonable accrued cause of action ([86] above). Nevertheless, this finding in <span class="font-italic">Bi Xiaoqiong</span> was only in relation to Mareva injunctions, and did not deal with freestanding injunctions; <span class="font-italic">Fourie</span> remains useful to show that the court has equitable jurisdiction to issue freestanding injunctions even where there is no cause of action. Further, <span class="font-italic">Bi Xiaoqiong </span>relied on <span class="font-italic">Siskina</span> (at [64]), but did not consider <span class="font-italic">Fourie</span>, which was the more recent House of Lords decision which departed from <span class="font-italic">Siskina </span>([88] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Full and frank disclosure</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The first respondent also sought to discharge the injunction on grounds that there was no full and frank disclosure by the applicant at the <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>hearing (at [11] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The duty of full and frank disclosure to be met by the <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> applicant has been elaborated on in various Court of Appeal cases.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We pause to observe that although Mr Jeyaretnam SC was content to accept that the commencement of the BVI Action alone was not sufficient to amount to repudiation and put his case on the basis that the respondent had commenced and maintained the BVI Action without qualification, it is strongly arguable that the commencement of court proceedings is itself a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> repudiation of the arbitration agreement. This is because parties who enter into a contract containing an arbitration clause can reasonably expect that disputes arising out of the underlying contract would be resolved by arbitration and indeed have a contractual obligation to do so. Thus, where court proceedings are commenced without an accompanying explanation or qualification and the relief sought will resolve the dispute on the merits, the defending party in the court proceedings is entitled to take the view that the party who commenced those proceedings (“the claimant”) no longer intends to abide by the arbitration clause. It would, however, still be open to the claimant to displace this <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> conclusion by furnishing an explanation for commencement of the court proceedings, either on the face of the proceedings themselves or by reference to events and correspondence occurring before the proceedings started which showed objectively that it had no repudiatory intent in doing so. But in the absence of any explanation or qualification, the commencement of court proceedings in the face of an arbitration clause is, in our view, sufficient to constitute a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> repudiation of the arbitration agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 However, the paragraph cited by the first respondent shows precisely why there is no repudiatory breach in the present case. In <span class="font-italic">Marty</span>, the action brought in the BVI courts was a substantive cause of action which sought determination of the “dispute on the merits” (see also <span class="font-italic">Marty </span>at [14]). This was naturally found to be in breach of the arbitration clause which required disputes to be resolved through arbitration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 In contrast, the injunction sought in the present case does not deal with the merits of the dispute, and in fact, does not even require a dispute. The injunction is premised solely on whether the call was unconscionable. The lack of a dispute will support that the call is unconscionable, whereas the presence of a dispute is merely one supporting factor showing that the call could be <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span>. As the first respondent itself argues, the court is not entitled to decide on the merits in issuing the injunction. The first respondent raises no authority to show that the seeking of such injunction amounts to repudiation of an arbitration agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Further, cl 19.3 of the General Terms and Conditions of the contract provides that the arbitration is to be governed by the arbitration rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC Rules”), and Art 29(7) of the ICC Rules provides that an urgent application for a court order is not a breach of the arbitration agreement:
