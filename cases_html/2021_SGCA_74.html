This application is premised on the change of the law brought about by the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Gobi a/l Avedian v Public Prosecutor</span> [2021] 1 SLR 180 (“<span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>”) as regards the proper treatment of the concept of wilful blindness in the context of the presumption under s 18(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”) that any person who is proved or presumed to possess a controlled drug shall be presumed to have known the nature of the drug. In particular, the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Gobi </span>that the s 18(2) presumption cannot be invoked to presume wilful blindness. Thus, following <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>, the Prosecution cannot rely on the s 18(2) presumption to presume wilful blindness. In this application, Rahmat submits that the Prosecution’s case in the trial below and on appeal was “in substance” based on wilful blindness rather than on actual knowledge. Consequently, the Prosecution could not have relied on the s 18(2) presumption, and the trial judge’s (the “Judge”) and the Court of Appeal’s findings that Rahmat could not rebut the s 18(2) presumption thus cannot stand. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 This is not the first application for leave to review a concluded criminal appeal on the basis of the change of law in <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Datchinamurthy a/l Kataiah v Public Prosecutor</span> [2021] SGCA 30 (“<span class="font-italic">Datchinamurthy</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Khartik Jasudass and another v Public Prosecutor</span> [2021] SGCA 13 (“<span class="font-italic">Khartik</span>”), the applicants in those cases similarly brought leave applications on the basis that the s 18(2) presumption was not open to the Prosecution as the Prosecution’s case at the trial had purportedly been based on wilful blindness rather than on actual knowledge. Both of those leave applications failed because this court found in those cases that the Prosecution’s cases and the court’s decisions were in fact based on actual knowledge and not on wilful blindness.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 To succeed in a leave application under s 394H of the CPC, the application must disclose a legitimate basis for the exercise of this court’s power of review. The court hearing such a leave application would have to consider the requirements set out in s 394J of the CPC. In particular, under s 394J(2), there must be (a) “sufficient material on which the appellate court may conclude” that (b) there has been “a miscarriage of justice” (<span class="font-italic">Datchinamurthy</span> at [21]–[22]). These have come to be known as the “sufficiency” and “miscarriage of justice” requirements respectively, and I shall refer to them in this judgment as such. The present case presents a suitable opportunity for this court to examine and clarify the contours of these requirements and the respective roles they play in the leave application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Factual and procedural background</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Background facts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The factual background of <span class="font-italic">Rahmat (CA)</span> is relatively straightforward. At the material time, Rahmat was employed as a runner for one “Kanna Gila” (“Kanna”) who was in the business of illegal money-lending. Rahmat had known Kanna for a period of less than two months prior to his arrest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 On 27 May 2015, sometime before 6.51pm, Rahmat entered Singapore from Malaysia via the Woodlands Checkpoint in a car. He was with his wife and their three children. Pursuant to Kanna’s earlier instructions, after entering Singapore, Rahmat drove to Rochor Road where he met up with a male subject known as “Bai”, who instructed Rahmat to meet Zainal bin Hamad (“Zainal”) at the IKEA store located in Tampines, Singapore (“IKEA”). Rahmat was known to Zainal as “Abang” and Zainal was known to Rahmat as “26”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Rahmat and Zainal then met at the staircase on the second level of IKEA. At about 8.35pm, Zainal passed S$8,000 to Rahmat. After which, Rahmat placed a green bag (“Bag”) at the staircase landing in front of Zainal before leaving IKEA. Rahmat then met up with his wife and children and drove the car with his family to Woodlands Checkpoint. At the checkpoint, Rahmat and his wife were arrested by officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”). Rahmat’s wife was searched, and S$8,000 was found concealed in her brassiere. Rahmat had passed the S$8,000 he received from Zainal to his wife and had told her to conceal it in her brassiere whilst they were en route to Woodlands Checkpoint.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7  Zainal thereafter picked up the Bag and placed it in a warehouse located on the second floor of IKEA. At about 9.25pm, CNB officers entered the warehouse and arrested Zainal. The Bag was found to contain one red coloured plastic bag containing three plastic packets of 1381.7g of granular/powdery substance (the “Drugs”). The Drugs were subsequently found to contain not less than 53.64g of diamorphine, a controlled drug. Neither Rahmat nor Zainal were authorised under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to traffic or be in possession of a controlled drug.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The trial and the trial judge’s decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Rahmat was jointly tried with Zainal before the Judge. Zainal was charged with having not less than 53.64g of diamorphine in his possession for the purpose of trafficking under s 5(l)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with s 5(2) and punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA, while Rahmat was charged with trafficking in not less than 53.64g of diamorphine under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 At the trial, the Prosecution had run three arguments in its closing submissions: (a) Rahmat could not rebut the s 18(2) presumption of knowledge; alternatively, (b) Rahmat was either wilfully blind or (c) had actual knowledge that the Bag contained diamorphine. Rahmat’s defence was that he believed that he was carrying medicine. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The Judge convicted Zainal and Rahmat of their respective charges and imposed the mandatory sentence of death on them, as no certificate of substantive assistance was provided. The Judge’s decision is reported in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Rahmat bin Karimon and another</span> [2018] 5 SLR 641 (“<span class="font-italic">Rahmat (HC)</span>”). The Judge noted that the Prosecution’s primary case was that Rahmat could not rebut the s 18(2) presumption <span class="font-italic">of knowledge</span> (<span class="font-italic">Rahmat (HC)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [15]). The Judge also noted that the Prosecution had run an “<span class="font-italic">alternative</span>” case that Rahmat was “either wilfully blind or had actual knowledge of the nature of the Drugs” (<span class="font-italic">Rahmat (HC) </span>at [16]). The Judge found that Rahmat failed to rebut the s 18(2) presumption (<span class="font-italic">Rahmat (HC) </span>at [60]); and that actual knowledge and wilful blindness had been separately proven beyond a reasonable doubt (<span class="font-italic">Rahmat (HC) </span>at [61] and [65] respectively).  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The appeal and the Court of Appeal’s decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 On 11 September 2018, the Court of Appeal dismissed both Zainal’s and Rahmat’s appeals against conviction, and delivered its grounds of decision (“GD”) in <span class="font-italic">Rahmat (CA)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>on 3 October 2018. There is no suggestion in this application that the Court of Appeal’s GD in <span class="font-italic">Rahmat (CA)</span> had inaccurately recorded the parties’ respective cases. While Rahmat challenged all three aspects of the Judge’s findings in his written submissions, for the appeal hearing, he chose, as it was his prerogative, to focus on his <span class="font-italic">sole</span> defence that the s 18(2) presumption of knowledge had been rebutted. This was explicitly noted in <span class="font-italic">Rahmat (CA)</span> at [30]. On this basis, the Court of Appeal held that Rahmat had failed to rebut the s 18(2) presumption of knowledge (<span class="font-italic">Rahmat (CA) </span>at [36]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Subsequent events</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 On 21 January 2020, an order under s 313(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the CPC was issued by the President of the Republic of Singapore for the sentence of death pronounced on Rahmat to be carried into effect on 14 February 2020. Pursuant to s 313(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the CPC, a warrant was then issued by the Chief Justice authorising and requiring the Commissioner of Prisons to carry the sentence of death into execution. On 11 February 2020, the President of the Republic of Singapore, in accordance with Art 22P(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) and s 313(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the CPC, ordered a respite of the execution of the said warrant pending any further order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 On 20 February 2020, the Court of Appeal granted leave to the applicant in <span class="font-italic">Gobi </span>to make a criminal review application. On 19 October 2020, the Court of Appeal’s decision on the criminal review application in <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> was delivered. Following the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>, the Attorney-General’s Chambers wrote to Rahmat’s counsel, Mr Jason Chan SC (“Mr Chan”), on 2 December 2020, stating that, in view of <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>, the Prosecution was of the view that it would be “prudent” for Rahmat to “undertake [his] own review of the record of proceedings” to consider how, if at all, the decision in <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> could affect him. Rahmat then filed the present criminal motion on 21 April 2021. Under s 394H(6)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CPC, such a leave application is to be heard by a single Judge sitting in the Court of Appeal where the appellate court in question is the Court of Appeal. It is on this basis that I am determining this leave application. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Applicable law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 It first bears emphasis that the review process is directed at the earlier decision of the <span class="font-italic">appellate court,</span> <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Rahmat (CA)</span>: see ss 394F(1), 394G(1) and 394J(5) of the CPC. The focus of any application for leave to commence a review application should, thus, be on the relevant appellate court’s decision, which is the decision that must be shown to be demonstrably wrong to establish a miscarriage of justice (<span class="font-italic">Datchinamurthy</span> at [25]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Following the seminal decision in <span class="font-italic">Kreetharan s/o Kathireson v Public Prosecutor and other matters</span> [2020] 2 SLR 1175 at [17], it is now settled that an application for leave to commence a review application under s 394H of the CPC must disclose a “legitimate basis” for the exercise of the court’s power of review. This requires a consideration of the requirements set out in s 394J of the CPC, including the sufficiency and miscarriage of justice requirements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 For the material to be “sufficient”, it must satisfy all the requirements set out in ss 394J(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to 394J(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>): (a) before the filing of the application for leave to make the review application, the material has not been canvassed at any stage of the said criminal matter; (b) the material could not have been adduced in court earlier even with reasonable diligence; and (c) the material is compelling, in that it is reliable, substantial, powerfully probative <span class="font-italic">and capable of showing</span> almost conclusively that there has been a miscarriage of justice in the said criminal matter. Where the material consists of legal arguments, s 394J(4) imposes an additional requirement that it must be based on a change in the law that arose from any decision made by a court after the conclusion of all proceedings relating to the said criminal matter (see also <span class="font-italic">Datchinamurthy</span> at [21] to [22]). It is not disputed in this case that the decision in <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> was made after the conclusion of <span class="font-italic">Rahmat (CA</span><span class="font-italic">)</span> (see [11] and [13] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 It should, however, be highlighted that the mere fact that there has been a change in the law does not, in and of itself, justify the reopening of a concluded criminal appeal (<span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> at [26]). This is where the miscarriage of justice requirement is material. It is not necessary for the court to conclude<span class="font-italic"> </span>that there has in fact been a miscarriage of justice. There only needs to be sufficient material on which the court “<span class="font-italic">may</span>” conclude that there has been a miscarriage of justice. That being said, the court may only come to that conclusion if the decision in the criminal appeal that is sought to be reopened is “demonstrably wrong” (see s 394J(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), CPC), in that the court finds it apparent, <span class="font-italic">based only on the evidence tendered in support of the review application and without any further inquiry</span>, that there is a “powerful probability” – and not just a “real possibility” – that that decision is wrong (see ss 394J(6)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 394J(6)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), CPC). Alternatively, the court may conclude that there has been a miscarriage of justice if the earlier decision is “tainted by fraud or a breach of the rules of natural justice” (see s 394J(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), CPC).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases in this application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Rahmat submits that the Prosecution’s entire case at the trial, including its arguments on the s 18(2) presumption, was “in substance” based on wilful blindness in the “extended” sense, which is a mental state that is factually short of actual knowledge because the accused did not in fact know the true position but sufficiently suspected it and deliberately refused to investigate, even though he could have done so, in order to avoid confirmation of his own suspicions. This is to be contrasted with wilful blindness in the “evidential” sense, which is inferred<span class="font-italic"> </span>actual knowledge (see <span class="font-italic">Adili Chibuike Ejike v Public Prosecutor</span> [2019] 2 SLR 254 (“<span class="font-italic">Adili</span>”) at [41]–[50] in the context of s 18(1) of the MDA, which was subsequently applied to s 18(2) of the MDA in <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> at [98(c)]). In this judgment, I shall refer to wilful blindness in the “extended” sense simply as “wilful blindness”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Rahmat submits that, following <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>, the Prosecution’s case on Rahmat’s wilful blindness must be proven beyond reasonable doubt, and the Prosecution could not have recourse to the s 18(2) presumption. Rahmat submits that this is because the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> held at [56] that “the doctrine of wilful blindness … <span class="font-italic">should not feature</span> in the analysis of whether the s 18(2) presumption has been rebutted” [emphasis added]. Rahmat’s case is that this change in the law brought about by <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> is not confined to only preclude the Prosecution from relying on the s 18(2) presumption to presume wilful blindness. Rahmat’s counsel, Mr Chan, seeks to persuade this court that the holding in <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [56] extends to preclude the doctrine of wilful blindness from<span class="font-italic"> featuring</span> in the analysis on the applicability of the presumption <span class="font-italic">irrespective</span> of whether the presumption was in fact relied on to presume wilful blindness.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The Prosecution submits that its case at the trial and on appeal was based on actual knowledge. The s 18(2) presumption was relied on to presume actual knowledge. Likewise, wilful blindness was relied on in the “evidential sense”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, inferred actual knowledge, to demonstrate that Rahmat had actual knowledge of the drugs. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The principal issue in this application is whether there is a legitimate basis for the court to exercise its power of review. To determine this, it is necessary to examine whether the sufficiency and miscarriage of justice requirements have <span class="font-italic">both</span> been satisfied. The present application provides an apt occasion to clarify the sufficiency requirement under s 394J(2) of the CPC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sufficiency requirement</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Composite requirement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The first important point to note regarding s 394J(2) of the CPC is that, while it is conceptually neat to analyse the sufficiency and miscarriage of justice requirements as two discrete elements, it is also important to bear in mind that, ultimately, s 394J(2) lays down a <span class="font-italic">composite</span> requirement. This is why s 394J(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) mandates that the new material is only sufficient if it is “<span class="font-italic">capable of showing</span> almost conclusively that <span class="font-italic">there has been a miscarriage of justice</span>” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Relevancy threshold</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 This leads to the next important question: how does the court assess if a change in the law is “capable of showing” that there has been a miscarriage of justice in any given case? It appears from the earlier cases that the court has taken different paths to address this issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>, Tay Yong Kwang JCA summarily allowed the leave application without written grounds. As such, his specific approach to the twin requirements is not apparent from his decision. However, in <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>, it was clear that the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Adili </span>in relation to the doctrine of wilful blindness under s 18(1) of the MDA would be relevant, at least <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>, to show that the Prosecution should not have been permitted to invoke the presumption under s 18(2) at the trial when its case there was run on the basis of wilful blindness, and so it was never put to the accused that he did not believe that the drugs in his possession were “disco drugs” mixed with chocolate and not diamorphine. By the time of the appeal, the Prosecution ran its case on the basis of actual knowledge but it was not pointed out to the court either by the Prosecution or the Defence at the appeal that the accused had not been challenged at the trial on this point. Therefore, in <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>, the change in the law brought about by <span class="font-italic">Adili</span> was clearly <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> relevant to affect the decision in the original appeal in <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and thus<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">capable of showing</span> almost conclusively that there has been a miscarriage of justice. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In <span class="font-italic">Khartik</span>, the applicant only challenged the trial judge’s, as opposed to the Court of Appeal’s, findings. This was perhaps understandable since the Court of Appeal did not issue a judgment. As pointed out in <span class="font-italic">Khartik</span> at [8], the Court of Appeal in dismissing the appeal merely stated that there was no reason to disturb the trial judge’s finding that the accused had failed to rebut the s 18(2) presumption. In opposing the leave application, the Prosecution submitted that the sufficiency requirement was not satisfied (<span class="font-italic">Khartik</span> at [11]). Tay JCA found the applicant’s attempt to “recast” the judge’s finding to be one of wilful blindness to be unmeritorious. Tay JCA found that the Prosecution’s case at the trial was one of actual knowledge of the nature of the drugs and held at [28] and [32] of <span class="font-italic">Khartik</span> that the miscarriage of justice requirement was not satisfied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In <span class="font-italic">Datchinamurthy</span>, Chao Hick Tin SJ explicitly noted that the Prosecution did not dispute that the legal principles articulated in <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> would constitute “sufficient” material” (<span class="font-italic">Datchinamurthy</span> at [26]). In other words, it was common ground between the parties that the sufficiency requirement was satisfied. On this basis, Chao SJ considered that the “central issue” was whether there was a miscarriage of justice. To determine this issue, Chao SJ considered (a) the Prosecution’s case at the trial; (b) the trial judge’s decision; and (c) the Court of Appeal’s decision, though Chao SJ stressed that the miscarriage of justice must arise from the Court of Appeal’s decision, rather than the decision of the trial judge (<span class="font-italic">Datchinamurthy</span> at [34]). Chao SJ dismissed the leave application as he found that the Prosecution’s case at the trial, the trial judge’s decision, and the Court of Appeal’s decision had all been based on actual knowledge (specifically, the s 18(2) presumption to presume actual knowledge) rather than wilful blindness short of actual knowledge (<span class="font-italic">Datchinamurthy</span> at [28], [40], [43] and [49]). In short, the application was dismissed for failing to satisfy the “miscarriage of justice” requirement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 <span class="font-italic">Khartik</span> and <span class="font-italic">Datchinamurthy </span>share one significant common denominator with the present application. They <span class="font-italic">all</span> claimed that the Prosecution’s case at the trial and the ensuing decisions were premised on the reliance of the s 18(2) presumption to presume <span class="font-italic">wilful blindness</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In my judgment, it is clear from the text of s 394J(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the CPC that the sufficiency requirement has a relevancy threshold, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the change in the law must be <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span><span class="font-italic"> relevant </span>to show that the appellate court’s decision is demonstrably wrong. This is because s 394J(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) mandates that the new material must be “<span class="font-italic">capable of showing</span> almost conclusively that there has been a miscarriage of justice” [emphasis added]. This must be so because, if the new material is not relevant to the application, it would necessarily be <span class="font-italic">incapable</span> of showing conclusively that there has been a miscarriage of justice. Mr Chan accepted this at the hearing before me. The sufficiency requirement is not limited to examine the <span class="font-italic">probative weight</span> of the new material because, if it were otherwise, any change of law would invariably satisfy the sufficiency requirement since any such change would by definition be “reliable” and “powerfully probative”. This can be illustrated, for instance, by considering hypothetically if Rahmat had relied on the change in the law brought about by <span class="font-italic">Ramesh a/l Perumal v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2019] 1 SLR 1003 (“<span class="font-italic">Ramesh</span>”),<span class="font-italic"> </span>which held that a bailee’s act of returning drugs to a supplier would not be considered drug trafficking. Since <span class="font-italic">Rahmat (CA)</span> did not concern a bailee situation at all, the change of the law brought about by <span class="font-italic">Ramesh</span> would have no <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> relevance to the leave application. In my view, Rahmat has to show that the change in law brought about by <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> is <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>relevant to affect or disturb the appellate court’s findings in <span class="font-italic">Rahmat (CA)</span>. It is thus imperative for Rahmat to demonstrate that the Judge and the Court of Appeal had relied on the s 18(2) presumption to presume <span class="font-italic">wilful blindness</span> in finding that the presumption had not been rebutted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Court of Appeal’s decision in Rahmat (CA)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In my judgment, Rahmat has failed to show any <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> relevance of the decision in <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> to affect the decision in <span class="font-italic">Rahmat (CA)</span>. To determine if <span class="font-italic">Gobi </span>is relevant, it is of vital importance to examine the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Rahmat (CA)</span>. In particular, did the Court of Appeal rely on s 18(2) of the MDA to presume wilful blindness, which is now impermissible following <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In this connection, it is essential to examine how Rahmat has relied on <span class="font-italic">Gobi </span>to mount his leave application. He relies principally on [56] of <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>, which I shall set out below in full:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">56 Accordingly, we hold that the knowledge that is presumed under s 18(2) is confined to actual knowledge of the nature of the drugs in the accused person’s possession, and does not encompass knowledge of matters to which the accused person is said to be wilfully blind. It follows that the Prosecution is not permitted to invoke the s 18(2) presumption to presume that the accused person was wilfully blind to the nature of the drugs in his possession, and the doctrine of wilful blindness <span class="font-italic">is therefore</span> irrelevant to and <span class="font-italic">should not feature in the analysis of whether the s</span><span class="font-italic"> 18(2) presumption has been rebutted</span>. Where the Prosecution’s case is that the accused person was wilfully blind to the nature of the drugs in his possession, it must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused person was wilfully blind to that fact, such that he should be treated at law as though he had actual knowledge of that fact. These are discrete inquiries which ought not to be conflated. We discuss the elements of wilful blindness in the context of knowledge of the nature of the drugs at [76]–[96] below. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The key holding at [56] of <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> is that s 18(2) cannot be used to presume wilful blindness. Mr Chan submits that [56] of <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> also imports a separate prohibition in that wilful blindness “should not feature” in the analysis of whether the s 18(2) presumption has been rebutted. However, the point that wilful blindness should not “feature” in the analysis of whether s 18(2) is rebutted is merely a corollary of the <span class="font-italic">main holding</span> that s 18(2) cannot be invoked to presume wilful blindness. In other words, [56] of <span class="font-italic">Gobi </span>holds that, if the Prosecution cannot rely on s 18(2) to presume wilful blindness, then wilful blindness should not feature in its analysis of s 18(2). These two points are, essentially, two sides of the same coin. This is why that sentence at [56] of <span class="font-italic">Gobi </span>is preceded with the observation that the doctrine of wilful blindness “<span class="font-italic">is</span> <span class="font-italic">therefore</span> irrelevant to and should not feature” in the s 18(2) analysis [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Bearing this in mind, this application can only succeed if Rahmat can show that the Court of Appeal had relied on s 18(2) to presume wilful blindness. However, a plain review of <span class="font-italic">Rahmat (CA)</span> will reveal that the Court of Appeal’s dismissal of Rahmat’s appeal was based on its finding that the s 18(2) presumption of<span class="font-italic"> actual</span><span class="font-italic"> knowledge</span> had not been rebutted:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">30 We turn to Rahmat’s appeal. Mr Jason Chan (“Mr Chan”), counsel for Rahmat, accepted that Rahmat was in possession of the green bag and of the drugs; <span class="font-italic">his defence was solely</span> to attempt to rebut the presumption <span class="font-italic">of knowledge</span> under s 18(2) of the MDA. We refer in this connection to what we have said at [23] above on the appropriate analytical framework to be adopted in such circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">31 The objective facts are that Rahmat delivered the green bag to Zainal and, in exchange, collected $8,000 from Zainal. Rahmat needed to address both these facts in order for his appeal to succeed.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">32 Mr Chan advanced two arguments. … as a preliminary point, we observed, and Mr Chan candidly accepted, that Rahmat’s evidence was afflicted with many inconsistencies. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">33 On the first argument, Rahmat’s case was that he had been a runner for Kanna’s illegal moneylending business … and [Kanna] told him that he could have such a loan [of RM30,000] interest-free, repayable over five years and also that he could leave Kanna’s syndicate. All he had to do was to bring some medicine to someone in Singapore called Bai and then collect $8,000 from Zainal. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">34 We found this incredible. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">35 Turning to the second argument, Rahmat said he thought he was carrying medicines but this too was incredible …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">36 For all these reasons, we were satisfied that Rahmat too had failed to rebut the presumption <span class="font-italic">of knowledge</span> under s 18(2) of the MDA. Since he delivered the drugs to Zainal, there was no doubt that he was trafficking. We therefore dismissed Rahmat’s appeal also.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Unlike <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>, where the trial was run on the basis of wilful blindness while the case on appeal was run on the basis of actual knowledge, here the Judge found that the presumption of actual knowledge under s 18(2) had not been rebutted by Rahmat <span class="font-italic">in addition</span> to wilful blindness. Tellingly, Rahmat had approached his appeal on the basis that he had rebutted the s 18(2) presumption of <span class="font-italic">knowledge</span>, as is clear from [30] of the GD in <span class="font-italic">Rahmat (CA)</span>. Thus, this application is a non-starter and Rahmat’s arguments on the potential application of <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> to <span class="font-italic">Rahmat (CA)</span> are entirely misconceived.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 It bears mention that the Prosecution’s case on appeal was in response to Rahmat’s case, which focused on the Judge’s findings that the s 18(2) presumption of <span class="font-italic">actual </span><span class="font-italic">knowledge</span> had not been rebutted (<span class="font-italic">Rahmat (CA)</span> at [30]; see [32] above). As explained above, it is of paramount importance to first identify what the presumption was used for. As it was relied on by the Prosecution to presume actual knowledge and not wilful blindness, the change in the law in <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> would have no relevance at all to the leave application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Consistent with Rahmat’s case on appeal in seeking to rebut the presumption of knowledge, the Prosecution in response submitted that Rahmat could not rebut the s 18(2) presumption (which was used to presume actual knowledge) or that Rahmat had actual knowledge of the nature of the drug. This is evident from the following paragraphs of the Prosecution’s appeal submissions:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">104 … As such, the Judge found that Rahmat had <span class="font-italic">both actual and presumed knowledge</span> of the Drugs. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">116 … the Judge rightly concluded that Rahmat had <span class="font-italic">actual knowledge</span> of the Drugs, and in any event, <span class="font-italic">could not rebut the presumption of knowledge</span> under Section 18(2) of the MDA. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">121 The suspicious nature of the transaction would be apparent to Rahmat by the time he left the Bag with Zainal. Rahmat's decision to proceed with the transaction evinces <span class="font-italic">his knowledge</span> of its illicit nature. In the circumstances, he cannot rebut the presumption of<span class="font-italic"> knowledge</span> under section 18(2) of the MDA. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">122 … Rahmat apparently made no enquiries about this further onward delivery, nor did he ask about the identity of this '26'. The layers of secrecy shrouding the transaction would give any reasonable person cause to pause and make further enquiries. Rahmat's failure to do so strongly suggests that <span class="font-italic">he was well aware of</span> the illicit nature of the present transaction.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">132 Rahmat's attempt to deny <span class="font-italic">knowledge</span> of the Drugs is both illogical and fraught with material inconsistencies. <span class="font-italic">The result is an inherently incredible account that involves Rahmat (a) turning a blind eye</span> to the most suspicious of circumstances, and (b) being in a selective state of shock which affects only specific and material portions of his investigation statements. <span class="font-italic">The Judge was amply justified in rejecting Rahmat's account and finding that he had knowledge, whether actual or presumed, of the Drugs</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Paragraphs 121 and 122 of the Prosecution’s appeal submissions are of particular significance as they clearly show that the Prosecution’s primary case was based on actual knowledge: the Prosecution’s acceptance that Rahmat did not check the contents of the bag was not to show that Rahmat did not know what was in the bag; on the contrary, the Prosecution’s case was that Rahmat did not check the contents of the bag because he <span class="font-italic">already knew</span> what it contained, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, diamorphine. Paragraph 132 also shows that the Prosecution had submitted that Rahmat’s claim that he had turned a blind eye was “inherently incredible”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Prosecution <span class="font-italic">did not</span> accept this as the truth, and that the Judge was right to reject Rahmat’s account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Therefore, it is clear that the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Rahmat (CA)</span> was based on the appellant’s failure to rebut the s 18(2) presumption of <span class="font-italic">actual </span><span class="font-italic">knowledge</span>, and that <span class="font-italic">both </span>the Prosecution and Rahmat had approached the appeal on the <span class="font-italic">same</span> basis. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Prosecution’s case at trial</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In this application, as was the case in <span class="font-italic">Khartik</span>, Rahmat devotes his focus to the Prosecution’s case at the trial. However, as was emphasised recently in <span class="font-italic">Datchinamurthy</span> (see [14] above), it should not be overlooked that the decision being challenged in a criminal review application is the <span class="font-italic">appellate court’s</span> decision. The Prosecution’s case at the trial and the trial judge’s decision are only relevant to the extent that they inform the context behind the appellate court’s decision. The Prosecution’s case at the trial and the trial judge’s holding would bear significance where the Prosecution had <span class="font-italic">change</span><span class="font-italic">d </span>its case from the trial to appeal, as was the case in <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>, because the change in the Prosecution’s case (from one of wilful blindness at the trial to actual knowledge on appeal) might prejudice the accused person. This was not the case here as shown below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The Prosecution’s primary case at the trial was likewise based, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, on actual knowledge, specifically, that the s 18(2) presumption of knowledge had not been rebutted. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Prosecution’s put questions and cross-examination of Rahmat</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In <span class="font-italic">Adili</span> and <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>, as the Prosecution had accepted at the trial that the accused did not know that the delivered package contained drugs or had not challenged the accused on his claim that he did not know the nature of the drug, it followed that it was no longer open to the Prosecution to either prove actual knowledge or rely on the presumption to presume actual knowledge. In that situation, the Prosecution was limited to only one remaining basis to prove the charge – proof of wilful blindness and, in that respect, reliance on the presumption was precluded. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Mr Chan, in his effort to draw a parallel with <span class="font-italic">Adili </span>and/or <span class="font-italic">Gobi,</span> relied on the Prosecution’s put to Rahmat that “all [his] statements to IO Shafiq [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the investigation officer who took Rahmat’s statements] were accurately recorded”, and, in Rahmat’s cautioned statement recorded by IO Shafiq, Rahmat had stated that “[he] really [did not] know what was inside the bag.” However, unlike <span class="font-italic">Adili</span> and <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>, the put question was to the effect that Rahmat’s statements were <span class="font-italic">accurately recorded</span> and not that his statements were <span class="font-italic">true</span>. I agree with the Prosecution that the main reason it was put to Rahmat that his statements were recorded accurately was because Rahmat had claimed at the trial that there were inaccuracies in the statement recording and that his court testimony should be preferred. It was in that context that the Prosecution put to Rahmat that he had, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, <span class="font-italic">lied </span>in his contemporaneous statements about receiving S$8,000 from Kanna, instead of Zainal, so as to distance himself from the transaction. The put question to Rahmat that he had lied in his contemporaneous statement would put paid to Rahmat’s submission that the Prosecution had accepted his statements to be true. It was thus misleading for Rahmat to suggest that, because it was put to Rahmat that the statements were accurately <span class="font-italic">recorded</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the Prosecution had therefore accepted the <span class="font-italic">truth</span> of his statements in particular that he did not know the contents in the bag.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Prosecution’s trial submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The Prosecution’s trial submissions also make it clear that its primary case was that the s 18(2) presumption of <span class="font-italic">knowledge </span>had not been rebutted, and that its case on wilful blindness (which was not based on the s 18(2) presumption) was an alternative case. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) At paragraph 24, the Prosecution’s case was that “Rahmat had failed to rebut the presumption <span class="font-italic">of knowledge</span> given the suspicious circumstances surrounding the collection and subsequent delivery of the Drugs to Zainal” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) At paragraph 32, the Prosecution submitted that “Rahmat has given wildly inconsistent accounts” and his “bare allegation” that he was delivering medicine “is insufficient to surmount the threshold to rebut the s 18(2) MDA presumption” and “close scrutiny of the suspicious circumstances of the transaction will reveal that he was <span class="font-italic">either</span> wilfully blind <span class="font-italic">or</span> had in fact, actual knowledge of the heroin that was delivered to Zainal” [emphasis added]. The emphasised portion of the foregoing line shows clearly, as the Judge had pointed out (see [10] above), that the Prosecution’s case on wilful blindness was<span class="font-italic"> alternative</span> to its primary case relying on s 18(2) to presume actual knowledge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Notwithstanding the clear direction of the Prosecution’s submissions at the trial, Rahmat submits that the Prosecution had “featured” wilful blindness in its analysis on s 18(2) in its trial closing submissions at paragraph 36:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">36. The veracity of Rahmat’s bare assertion is highly suspect given the apparent and callous disregard as to the nature of the items he was carrying. In conjunction with the arguments pertaining to the display of wilful blindness highlighted below, Rahmat cannot be said to have successfully rebutted the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Mr Chan focused on the fact that the Prosecution had approached its analysis on s 18(2) “in conjunction with the arguments pertaining to the display of wilful blindness”. However, this sentence has to be seen in its proper context. The line immediately preceding states that “[t]he <span class="font-italic">veracity of Rahmat’s bare assertion</span> is highly suspect <span class="font-italic">given the apparent and callous disregard as to the nature of the items</span> he was carrying” [emphasis added]. The Prosecution’s submissions on wilful blindness were focused on Rahmat’s inconsistent and unbelievable accounts. Therefore, the allusion to the Prosecution’s arguments on wilful blindness at [43] above was made with reference to Rahmat’s incredible and inconsistent defence. Indeed, this was also how the Judge approached the s 18(2) analysis, as he found that Rahmat was unable to rebut the s 18(2) presumption <span class="font-italic">of knowledge</span> because his account was inconsistent and incredible (see <span class="font-italic">Rahmat (HC)</span> at [49] and [58]). The Judge’s analysis in this regard was also explicitly noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Rahmat (CA)</span> at [32].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 It appears to me that Rahmat’s application is essentially mounted on an ill-conceived argument by selectively choosing <span class="font-italic">one</span> aspect of the Prosecution’s case at the trial, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, proof of wilful blindness, and thereafter juxtaposing that argument against <span class="font-italic">another</span> separate and independent argument based on the presumption of <span class="font-italic">knowledge </span>under s 18(2). In so doing, he conflated two distinct arguments into one. This juxtaposition is fatally flawed because the Prosecution’s reliance on the s 18(2) presumption was, in any event, to presume actual knowledge and <span class="font-italic">not wilful blindness</span>. What Rahmat has effectively sought to do is to <span class="font-italic">reconstruct </span>the Prosecution’s case at the trial and in so doing <span class="font-italic">recast</span> the decision of the Judge in order to invoke the change of the law in <span class="font-italic">Go</span><span class="font-italic">bi</span> so as to persuade this court that there is compelling new material to demonstrate a miscarriage of justice. As alluded to at [33] above, Rahmat<span class="font-italic"> </span>was clearly cognisant that s 18(2) was relied on to presume <span class="font-italic">actual knowledge</span> and, significantly, he had sought to rebut the s 18(2) presumption of <span class="font-italic">knowledge</span> at the trial and on appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In the circumstances, there can be no basis to show that <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> is “capable” of showing almost conclusively that there has been a miscarriage of justice in the court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Rahmat (CA)</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Accordingly, I find that the sufficiency requirement has not been satisfied.
