</div> Thus, the defendant became entitled to make the adjudication application on 28 June 2023. The issue before me concerned the requirement that an adjudication application “must be made within 7 days after the entitlement of the claimant to make an adjudication application first arises under section 12”: see s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of SOPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The claimant submitted that as the defendant’s right to make an adjudication application arose on 28 June 2023, the seven-day period under s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of SOPA commenced on 28 June 2023 at 0000hrs. By way of an aside, 29 June 2023 was a public holiday, and consequently (as parties agreed) this day was excluded from the calculation of the seven-day period. The defendant was, in the claimant’s submission, therefore required to make the adjudication application by 5 July 2023 at 2359hrs. As the defendant only made the application on 6 July 2023, the claimant submitted that it was made out of time and hence the determination should be set aside pursuant to s 27(6)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of SOPA, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the adjudication application was not made in accordance with SOPA. Pursuant to s 16(2) of SOPA, an adjudicator must reject an adjudication application that is not made within the time period prescribed by s 13(3)(a).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The claimant’s interpretation of s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of SOPA differed from that of the adjudicator, who held that the claimant’s entitlement to make the adjudication application “first arose on 28 June 2023, and the 7-day period to lodge the [a]djudication [a]pplication was to commence on 29 June 2023 … and would therefore end on 6 July 2023”.

</div>
</div> Both of these arguments simply begged the question of how the provision should be interpreted. There is nothing absurd about the proper interpretation permitting the adjudication applicant a period of eight days after the expiry of the dispute settlement period, which equates to seven days after the day on which entitlement arose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 At one point, the claimant suggested that the position described in <span class="font-italic">YTL</span> would mean that the adjudication applicant cannot make the application on the day the entitlement arises, and such an interruption would be absurd. I agree that such an interruption would be absurd but there is no basis for contending that there is any such interruption. The question is only how to compute the continuous period for making an adjudication application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 I disagreed with the claimant’s submissions. In my view, the ordinary meaning of s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of SOPA may be approached in two steps. The first step is to answer the question, “when does the entitlement arise?”. As a matter of ordinary language and common sense, would the entitlement be said to arise on the <span class="font-italic">day</span> following the end of the dispute settlement period, or upon the <span class="font-italic">second or</span> <span class="font-italic">minute</span> following the end of the dispute settlement period? SOPA makes no mention of seconds, minutes, or times of day, only of <span class="font-italic">days</span>. The SOPA regime operates in days. This context of the time periods adopted within SOPA itself leads the ordinary reader to the conclusion that the entitlement arises on the day and not at any particular time on that day. To have a day to do something after that would mean a complete day. The second step is then to consider what is meant by the phrase the adjudication application “must be made within 7 days <span class="font-italic">after </span>the entitlement of the claimant to make an adjudication application first arises under section 12” [emphasis added]. Thus, as a matter of ordinary language, the seven-day period <span class="font-italic">after</span> the entitlement arises will commence on the day after.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The English common law on the computation of time from a certain date has been summarised by Chan Seng Onn J in the case of <span class="font-italic">Suresh </span><span class="font-italic">s/o Suppiah v Jiang Guoliang</span> [2016] 4 SLR 645 (“<span class="font-italic">Suresh</span>”), where he was considering the computation of limitation periods. Counsel for the claimant referred to this case and sought to draw support from the exposition in dicta of a possible exception to the general rule. The general rule at common law was that the day of the event was excluded from the computation of the period within which a person must act upon that event. The possible exception was said to be where a cause of action technically accrues between two dates: see <span class="font-italic">Suresh</span> at [53]. For my part, I would not conceive of an untimed moment existing between two dates, or between any two time periods. Any moment of time, for the purpose of human reckoning, must be within one day or another, and not between them. Conventionally, midnight may belong to the preceding date, but the first split second after midnight belongs to the next day. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The common law rule (using the word rule in its broad sense) springs from a conventional assumption that people make, when given a number of days to complete a task, an assumption that arose in the age before everyone had their own means of keeping accurate time. That common law rule found expression in s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IA. This section supports the work of legislative draftsmen by facilitating the economical use of language when describing time periods. While I would not go so far as to say that the contrary intention needs to be express, it must certainly be clear. I do not discern any contrary intention in SOPA that justifies not applying s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IA to the interpretation of s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of SOPA. Counsel for the claimant also failed to point me toward any material that substantiated his claim that applying s 50(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) was contrary to parliamentary intention relating to SOPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 It follows that the BCA’s infographic and the SMC’s checklist referred to above at [8] do not accurately reflect the correct position that the day on which the entitlement to make an adjudication application arises is excluded from the seven-day period provided by s 13(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of SOPA.  I also observe that they make different errors. One fails to exclude the day on which entitlement arises in computing the seven-day period, while the other starts the seven-day period after expiry of the dispute settlement period instead of the statutory provision for seven days after entitlement arises.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Turning to the second ground of alleged failure to recognise patent errors, the claimant submitted that the adjudicator failed to satisfy himself on a positive basis that the defendant had a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case for the value of its claim.

</div> In my view, this was not a case where the errors as alleged could be said to be obvious, manifest, or otherwise easily recognisable. One alleged patent error concerned the claim for payment in relation to drilling of starter bars. The claimant contended that the terms of the sub-contract obliged the defendant to install the starter bars prior to concrete casting, and to bear the cost of drilling post-casting unless this was “through no fault of the [defendant]’s own”.

</div>
</div> While the adjudicator did not deal expressly with this point, there was relevant material before him that he was entitled to take into account, including the fact of previous certification of this type of work in allowing the claim. The second alleged patent error concerned alleged inconsistencies in the documents. For this point, the adjudicator considered at length the sufficiency of the evidence provided by the defendant to prove its claim.

</div> In reality, both points went to the merits of the determination which the adjudicator undertook in accordance with his duties under s 17 of SOPA. They did not begin to rise to the level of obvious or manifest errors. Neither were they otherwise easily recognisable errors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 For these reasons, I dismissed the claimant’s application to set aside the determination and ordered costs of $13,000 all-in to the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Finally, pursuant to s 27(5) of SOPA read with O 36 r 3(2) of the Rules of Court 2021, the claimant furnished security of the sum payable under the determination, excluding the costs incurred by the adjudication. Given my decision, I made the consequential order for the security furnished to be released. If necessary, the defendant may apply pursuant to s 27 of SOPA to enforce the determination as a judgment or an order of court. During the hearing, the claimant’s solicitors informed me of the claimant’s intention to appeal against my decision and made an oral application for a stay of the enforcement of the determination. As there was no material in support of such a stay, I made no order on the oral application and told counsel that if an application for stay is filed with supporting material, it will be heard on its merits.  </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Philip Jeyaretnam <br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">John Lim Kwang Meng, Ng Kai Ling and Lee Yu Xin Audrey (LIMN Law Corporation) for the claimant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Joseph Tay Weiwen, Swah Yeqin, Shirin and Claire Tan Su Yin (Shook Lin &amp; Bok LLP) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
