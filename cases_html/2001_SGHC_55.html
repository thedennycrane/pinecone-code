terms <font face="Symbol"></font> Relevant principles<b></b></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Facts</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In settlement of a dispute between the parties, they obtained a consent

order stating <i>inter alia</i> that (a) Chang (the plaintiff’s wife) will absolutely

transfer to the defendant all her rights title and interest in a golf resort and housing

development venture (the "Batam project") including Chang's rights and or

interest in 4,250 shares in the capital of the company known as PBGR Management and

Marketing Pte Ltd ("PBGR") held in the name of Chang and her rights to the sum

of $997,192 which Boonoon Investments Limited ("Boonoon") owes to Chang; and (b)

upon and in return for the transfer by Chang of her entire investment in the Batam

project, the defendant undertook that he shall pay to Chang and/or her nominees the sum of

S$2,175,744.95 by 31 December 1999.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">    In the present proceedings, the plaintiff sought <i>inter

alia </i>for a declaration that it was the defendant's obligation to prepare or procure

the preparation of all the necessary transfer documents before the settlement date of 31

December 1999. </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Held</p></b>:

<p align="justify" xmlns="">(1) The court was mindful of two considerations: (a) the court should

not rewrite the consent order; and (b) if the terms of the consent order are clear and

unambiguous, they should be given their plain ordinary meaning without the aid of

extrinsic evidence (see  14).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(2) The court held that there was no ambiguity in the terms of the

consent order (see  16).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(3) The consent order was silent on whose obligation it was to prepare

the documents Chang had to execute (see  17).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(4) The fact that the plaintiff encountered difficulties in obtaining

the necessary information from PBGR or the defendant to enable Chang to effect transfer of

the shares or, that the task of doing so had become more onerous than what the plaintiff,

his counsel or Chang originally envisaged, did not mean that the responsibility should be

foisted onto the defendant. Even if what the plaintiff said was true, that it would be

easier for the defendant or he had the means, to obtain the requisite details to implement

the consent order, that factor ipso facto does not place the burden on the defendant to

prepare the documentation if he is not contractually obliged to do so (see  18).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(5) The court adopted a pragmatic approach to ensure that the terms of

the consent order could be efficaciously implemented. The defendant was directed to

convene a board meeting of PBGR and to approve the waiver of pre-emption rights by Yeong,

a shareholder of the company. The court further directed the defendant to furnish to Chang

the last known address of Yeong (see  20). </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(6) Chang was directed to: (i) execute the blank transfer form for the

shares; (ii) write to Yeong at the latter's last known address (when furnished by the

defendant) to request Yeong's consent to waive her pre-emption rights; and (iii) prepare

and execute the deeds of assignment pertaining to divesting her interests the Batam

project and the debt owed to her by Boonoon (see  20). </p>

<p>The background</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">1. Chua Lam (the plaintiff) and Peh Kwee Tee (the defendant) were

friends for almost 30 years (up to 1997); the plaintiff's wife is Chang Chaong Wen whom

the defendant also knows. The plaintiff said he extended friendly loans (2) of S$1.68m and

HK$2m to the defendant on 29 April 1987 and 12 January 1990 respectively. He (since 1992)

and his lawyers requested repayment but were not paid. Instead, the defendant denied

borrowing the monies and raised the defence of time-bar. Consequently, the plaintiff sued

the defendant in Suit No. 1169 of 1997 (the Suit) in June 1997.</p>
<p align="justify">2. On 27 July 1998, when the Suit came up for trial, the parties came

to a settlement and a consent order (the Consent Order) was recorded as follows:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">I. Chang Chaong Wen will absolutely transfer to Peh Kwee Tee all her

  rights title and interest in a golf resort and housing development venture on Batam

  Island, Indonesia, known as the PT Paradise Bay Golf Resort, Batam, Indonesia (the Batam

  project) including the following:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(1) Chang Chaong Wen's rights and or interest in 4,250 shares in the

    capital of the company known as PBGR Management and Marketing Pte Ltd (PBGR) held in the

    name of Chang Chaong Wen;</p>
<p align="justify">(2) Chang Chaong Wen's rights to the sum of $997,192 which Boonoon

    Investments Limited (Boonoon) owes to Chang Chaong Wen;</p>
<p align="justify">(3) Chang Chaong Wen's right to purchase 50 residential units in the

    Batam project;</p>
<p align="justify">(4) any rights that Chang Chaong Wen may have to individual golf

    memberships in the Batam project;</p>
<p align="justify">(5) all other rights and/or benefits which Chang Chaong Wen may have in

    the Batam project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">II. Upon and in return for the transfer by Chang Chaong Wen of her

  entire investment in the Batam project (as set out in paragraph 1 above), Peh Kwee Tee

  hereby undertakes that he shall pay to Chang Chaong Wen and/or her nominees the sum of

  S$2,175,744.95 by 31 December 1999.</p>
<p align="justify">III. For the avoidance of doubt:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(1) the transfer of Chang Chaong Wen's investment shall be

    contemporaneous with the payment made by Peh Kwee Tee; and</p>
<p align="justify">(2) Chang Chaong Wen shall do all necessary acts and things and to

    execute all necessary documents and transfers to effect the transfer to Peh Kwee Tee of

    her entire investment in the Batam project in order [that] the terms and conditions of

    this settlement may effectively be carried out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">IV. The above is in full and final settlement of the dispute between

  the parties and there shall be no further claims between the parties.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">3. On 25 July 2000, the plaintiff commenced these proceedings (the OS)

and prayed inter alia, for the following reliefs:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(1) a declaration that upon the true construction of the Consent

  Order:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) it is the defendant's obligation to prepare or procure the

    preparation of all the necessary transfer documents in respect of the transfer of all of

    Chang Chaong Wen's (Chang’s) rights, title and interest in the Batam project for

    Chang's execution before the settlement date of 31 December 1999 and</p>
<p align="justify">(b) the transfer of Chang's entire investment in the Batam project is

    effected upon the delivery to the defendant of the aforementioned transfer documents duly

    executed by Chang.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">4. The OS came up for hearing before me on 23 November 2000 whereupon I

granted inter alia the following orders:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">1. the defendant shall (as a director of PBGR) convene a board meeting

  with Kanhatsu Hayashi (Hayashi) to approve the transfer of 4,250 shares (the shares) from

  Chang to the defendant or to his nominees, and to approve the waiver of pre-emption rights

  by Yeong Wai Kuen or by the Registrar of Supreme Court on behalf of Yeong Wai Kuen and to

  dispense with compliance with Articles 29 to 30 provided that Chang complies with the

  following directions:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) execute the blank transfer of the shares;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) write to Yeong Wai Kuen at her last known address which shall be

    furnished by the defendant to request for her consent to the waiver of her pre-emption

    rights under Article 28 of the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the company. In

    the event that Yeong Wai Kuen fails or neglects to respond to Chang's said letter within

    14 days of the date of the letter, the Registrar of the Supreme Court is empowered to give

    written consent of waiver on Yeong Wai Kuen's behalf;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) Chang executes an assignment to the defendant or his nominee as

    notified by the defendant's solicitors within 10 days from the date hereof of items 2 to 5

    listed in the Consent Order;</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">2. completion of transfer of the shares together with all necessary

  documentation incidental thereto in exchange for cashier's order of S$2,175,744.95 is

  extended to 31 March 2001;</p>
<p align="justify">3. In the event of default in compliance of directions herein by either

  party, the other party or both parties are at liberty to revise the Suit, in the

  alternative enforce the Consent Order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">The defendant has appealed against my decision (in Civil Appeal No. 172

of 2000).</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The affidavits</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">5. Before I give the reasons for my decision, I need to refer to the

affidavits filed by the parties, starting with the plaintiff's. In the affidavit which he

filed in support of the OS, the plaintiff deposed that one month (1) before 31 December

1999 (the completion date), his solicitors had written to the defendant's solicitors to

request for the drafts of the relevant transfer forms for Chang's execution. Three (3)

weeks later, on 20 December 1999, the defendant's solicitors had requested clarification

on what documents the plaintiff meant. Further correspondence from 28 December 1999 to 21

March 2000 between the parties came to nought. In short, there was disagreement on whose

responsibility it was to prepare/procure the transfer documentation. The plaintiff

contended that as neither he nor Chang had any knowledge of the latter's supposed interest

in the Batam project apart from what the defendant himself deposed to in his written

testimony for the Suit and, the Suit itself had no connection whatsoever with Chang's

alleged interest in the Batam project, it was for the defendant to prepare/procure the

necessary documentation for Chang to divest and transfer to him, her interests in the

project. The defendant not unexpectedly, took the opposite stand.</p>
<p align="justify">6. The plaintiff's solicitors did conduct a search in the Registry of

Companies (ROC) to ascertain the particulars of the shareholders of PBGR. He alleged

however that he/Chang were then given the run-around when they attempted to obtain from

the defendant's solicitors and or PBGR information regarding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">a. the addresses/contacts of the other two (2) shareholders in PBGR

  (Hayashi and Yeong Wai Kuen [Yeong]) and to obtain details of Chang's interests in the

  Batam project;</p>
<p align="justify">b. the procedure for transferring the shares to the defendant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Chang was obliged to contact her fellow shareholders because of Article

28 of the company which states:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">28. Shares shall be freely transferred by a member or other person

  entitled to transfer to any existing member selected by the transferor; but save as

  aforesaid and save as provided by Article 33 hereof, no share shall be transferred to a

  person who is not a member so long as any member or any person selected by the directors

  as one whom it is desirable in the interest of the company to admit to membership is

  willing to purchase the same at the fair value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Hence, she sought the consent of Hayashi and Yeong for the transfer of

the shares to the defendant, who was not an existing shareholder, as well as to waive

their pre-emption rights. Hayashi gave his written consent by his letter dated 10 April

2000 to the plaintiff's solicitors; Yeong however, did not respond at all to the

plaintiff's solicitors' letters seeking her consent.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Chang/the plaintiff also had to comply with Articles 29 and 30 of

PBGR which state:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">29. Except where the transfer is made pursuant to Article 33 hereof the

  person proposing to transfer any shares (hereinafter called 'the proposing transferor')

  shall give notice in writing (hereinafter called 'the transfer notice') to the company

  that he desires to transfer the same. Such notice shall specify the sum he fixes as the

  fair value, and shall constitute the company his agents for the sale of the share to any

  member of the company or persons selected as aforesaid, at the price so fixed, or at the

  option of the purchaser, at the fair value to be fixed by the auditor in accordance with

  these articles….</p>
<p align="justify">30. If the company shall within three months after service of a sale

  notice find a member willing to purchase any share comprised therein (hereinafter

  described as a purchasing member) and shall give notice thereof to the retiring member,

  the retiring member shall be bound upon payment of the fair value to transfer the share to

  such purchasing member, who shall be bound to complete the purchase within seven days from

  the service of such last mentioned notice…</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">8. According to the plaintiff, his solicitors made no progress when

they sought particulars from PBGR (by writing to Hayashi and the company's secretary) of

Chang's rights to individual golf memberships as well as the relevant transfer procedures;

Chang also had to obtain a replacement for the certificate for the shares as she was not

in possession thereof. The plaintiff's solicitors were equally unsuccessful when they

wrote to Boonoon (a Hong Kong company) to inquire as to the sum of $997,192 which the

defendant had alleged was owed to Chang according to the audited accounts of Boonoon,

which he exhibited in his affidavits filed for the Suit. Although Hayashi was/is a close

business associate of the defendant (and would have been a witness for the defendant had

trial of the Suit proceeded), the plaintiff alleged that the defendant was singularly

unhelpful when the plaintiff's solicitors approached him for assistance to verify the

information extracted from the ROC pertaining to the addresses of the company's

shareholders. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had control over the management of

the Batam project despite which, he did not respond to the plaintiff's requests for

information regarding details of Chang's rights, title and interest therein. The plaintiff

complained that Hayashi was equally uncooperative because he was the defendant's friend.

The plaintiff alleged that the defendant's conduct showed he did not want to comply with

the terms of the Consent Order and effect the settlement.</p>
<p align="justify">9. The defendant quite naturally denied the plaintiff's many

allegations. In his affidavit, he pointed out that the clear terms of the Consent Order

(para 2 <i>supra</i>) put the onus on the plaintiff/Chang to obtain all the necessary

approvals and documentation. He pointed out that the terms of the Consent Order were

settled between the solicitors representing both parties; it was therefore wrong for the

plaintiff to assert that neither he nor Chang had any knowledge of the latter's interests

in the Batam project. If that was true, the plaintiff ought not to have agreed to the

terms of the Consent Order. He could have but failed to, raise any objections concerning

the draft order when the same was forwarded to his solicitors for approval, before the

parties appeared in court to record the Consent Order.</p>
<p align="justify">10. The defendant affirmed that the agreement reflected in the Consent

Order was not finalised on the completion date because neither the plaintiff nor Chang

took <u>any</u> steps to procure/comply with, Chang's obligations set out under the

Consent Order, until months after the completion date. Indeed, the plaintiff did nothing

at all until the defendant's solicitors wrote to his solicitors on 3 March 2000 inquiring

as to:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) what steps the plaintiff/Chang had taken since the settlement was

  concluded, to communicate with the relevant companies regarding Chang's rights, title or

  interest in the Batam project;</p>
<p align="justify">(b) what legal advice the plaintiff/Chang may have sought in various

  jurisdictions in regard to (a) above and for copies of the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">11. The defendant pointed out that the plaintiff had admitted he took

no steps until after the plaintiff's solicitors' aforesaid letter dated 3 March 2000, this

was some 1 years after the date of the Consent Order and well after the completion

date. The defendant denied the plaintiff's assertion that there was an understanding

between them as to <u>how</u> Chang was going to effect the transfer of the shares to him

and as to <u>who</u> was to be responsible for preparing the transfer documentation. As to

the plaintiff's methodology on the implementation of the Consent Order, the defendant

stated such views were subjective and were never expressed to him by either the plaintiff

or Chang.</p>
<p align="justify">12. The defendant also disagreed with the plaintiff's assertion that as

one (1) of the two (2) directors of PBGR, the defendant had control of the company.

Neither was it correct for the plaintiff to assert that the defendant was in a position to

procure and direct that the relevant transfer forms and documents be prepared for Chang's

execution.</p>
<p align="justify">13. In reply to the various allegations set out in the plaintiff's

affidavit, the defendant had this to say:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">a. granted he had affirmed (in his affidavit for the Suit) that PT

  Paradise Bay Golf Resort and or PBGR would manage the Batam project but this did not

  eventually materialise. As it turned out, PBGR was used to market and sell golf

  memberships for the Batam project; he himself was never involved in the management of the

  Batam project whether in Batam or in Singapore;</p>
<p align="justify">b. he had been a director of PBGR since 27 June 1997 but only as a

  sleeping director whilst Hayashi had been a director since 15 March 1991;</p>
<p align="justify">c. Chang had to comply with the prescribed procedure set out in

  Articles 22 to 33 of the company's articles of association to effect the transfer of the

  shares to him. In this regard he understood that Hayashi and the company secretary of PBGR

  had written to the plaintiff's solicitors to remind them of the need for such compliance

  but, it was not done to-date and without such compliance, Chang could not effect transfer

  of the shares to him;</p>
<p align="justify">d. as for the debt owed by Boonoon to Chang, it had to be assigned to

  him under the applicable Hong Kong law but, the plaintiff/Chang did not produce evidence

  that they had satisfied the requirements under Hong Kong law or, of any applicable

  alternative procedure;</p>
<p align="justify">e. he did not know and was unable to assist Chang, in the transfer of

  her right to purchase 50 residential units in the Batam project to him;</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Consequently, the defendant prayed for the OS to be dismissed since the

plaintiff was in effect asking the court to go behind the terms of the Consent Order

which, contrary to the stand taken by the plaintiff/his solicitors, were clear and

unambiguous.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i>
<p align="justify">The decision</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">14. I had set out in para 4 above, the salient terms of the orders I

made. In making those orders, I was mindful of two (2) considerations:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">a. I should not rewrite the terms of the Consent Order which had been

  agreed to by the parties who were separately represented at the material time and, who

  would have received the relevant independent legal advice;</p>
<p align="justify">b. if the terms of the Consent Order are clear and unambiguous, they

  should be given their plain ordinary meaning without the aid of extrinsic evidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">15. Citing <i>Chitty</i> on <i>Contracts</i> (see 28 ed vol 1 p 604

para 12-043) and <i>A V Pound &amp; Co v M W Hardy &amp; Co</i> <nobr>[1956] 1 AER 639</nobr>, counsel

for the plaintiff had submitted that the court should resolve any ambiguity by looking at

the commercial purpose (of the Consent Order) and the factual matrix (see <i>Reardon Smith

Line Ltd v Hansen-Tangen</i> [1976] 1 WLR 989 [infra]) against which it was made; in this

regard the whole contract had to be considered. Neither the defendant nor I disagreed with

that submission. Indeed, the Court of Appeal in <i>Pacific Century Regional Developments v

Estate of Seow Khoon Seng </i><nobr>[1997] 3 SLR 761</nobr> (cited by counsel for the defendant)

adopted that proposition of law. Counsel for the defendant had referred to two (2) other

cases namely <i>Citicorp Investment Bank v Wee Ah Kee</i> <nobr>[1997] 2 SLR 759</nobr> and <i>Benjanin

Developments Ltd v Robt Jones (Pacific) Ltd </i><nobr>[1994] 3 NZLR 189</nobr> to resist the OS. Those

cases do not detract from or add further to, the proposition of law set out in the <i>Pacific

Century</i> case.</p>
<p align="justify">16. However, I am of the view that the terms of the Consent Order do

not allow room for the application of the above principle of law, even though the learned

assistant registrar had opined (on 19 January 2000 when the plaintiff applied 'for

directions' to clarify the Consent Order) that cl III (2) was none too clear on what was

required of Chang; I see no ambiguity in the terms spelt out in the Consent Order.</p>
<p align="justify">17. What I note is, under cl I of the Consent Order, Chang was obliged

to transfer five (5) items to the defendant in exchange for the payment from him set out

under cl II. Clause III (2) reinforced cl I by putting on Chang the responsibility <i>to

execute all necessary documents and transfers to effect the transfer [to the defendant]</i>.

However, the clause and indeed the entire Consent Order was silent on <u>whose obligation</u>

it was to prepare the documents Chang had to execute; therein lies the dispute. Counsel

for the plaintiff had submitted that a term should also be implied into the Consent Order

under 'the officious bystander' test propounded in <i>The Moorcock</i> (1889) 14 PD 64 by

Bowen LJ (at p 68) so as to give business efficacy to the contract. As it could not have

been intended at the time the Consent Order was agreed, that the plaintiff or Chang (whose

shareholding amounted to only 4.25% of the paid-up capital in PBGR) would have to procure

the waiver of pre-emption rights which the defendant was in a position to procure, it must

necessarily be implied into the agreement between them that the defendant and not the

plaintiff, had that duty. Counsel submitted that the same argument would apply to

providing information of Chang's interests in the Batam project to enable her to transfer

the same to the defendant.</p>
<p align="justify">18. As was said by the appellate court in <i>Pacific Century</i> (per

Karthigesu JA at p 766), when construing a document:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">…The court is required to ascertain the mutual intention of the

  parties as expressed in the words of the agreement. The law is concerned with the

  objective appearance, rather than with the actual fact, of agreement. It is not concerned

  with the actual intentions of the parties, rather it is the court's task to decide what

  each party was reasonably entitled to conclude from the conduct of the other. In <i>Reardon

  Smith Line v Hansen Tangen</i> [1976] 1 WLR 989 at p 996, Lord Wilberforce said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">When one speaks of the intention of the parties to the contract, one is

    speaking objectively -- the parties cannot themselves give direct evidence of what their

    intention was -- and what must be ascertained is what is to be taken as the intention

    which reasonable people would have had if placed in the situation of the parties.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Consequently, the fact that the plaintiff (as he complained)

encountered difficulties in obtaining the necessary information from PBGR and or the

defendant to enable Chang to effect transfer of the shares or, that the task of doing so

had become more onerous than what the plaintiff, his counsel or Chang originally

envisaged, does not mean that the responsibility should be foisted onto the defendant.

Even if what the plaintiff said is true -- that it would be easier for the defendant or he

had the means, to obtain the requisite details to implement the Consent Order, that factor

ipso facto does not place the burden on the defendant to prepare the documentation <u>if

he is not contractually obliged to do so</u>.</p>
<p align="justify">19. One other authority relied on by counsel for the defendant in his

submissions was <i>The Interpretation of Contracts</i> by Kim Lewison (2 ed 1997) where

the learned author stated (at para 1.05 p 8):</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">In attempting to reach a conclusion as to the presumed intention of the

  parties, the court will generally adopt an objective approach, that is to say that it will

  consider what would have been the intention of reasonable persons in the position of the

  actual parties to the contract.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">He further relied on another extract from <i>Chitty</i> on <i>Contracts</i>

(vol 1 at p 649 para 13-011) to say that the court may be willing to imply a term that the

parties shall co-operate to ensure the performance of their bargain.</p>
<p align="justify">20. Applying the maxims and the guidelines culled from the cases

referred to earlier, I adopted a pragmatic approach. I directed the defendant to convene a

board meeting (with Hayashi) of PBGR because only he could do so, being a director of PBGR

but not Chang, as a shareholder. Similarly, it was possible for the defendant as a

director but not Chang as a shareholder, to approve the waiver of pre-emption rights by

Yeong (or by the Registrar of the Supreme Court on her behalf). Hence, I also placed that

responsibility on the defendant as well as the relatively easy duty of furnishing Chang

with the last known address of Yeong (since the plaintiff claimed the same was not known

to him). Chang on her part was directed to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) execute the blank transfer form for the shares;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) write to Yeong at the latter's last known address (when furnished

  by the defendant) to request Yeong's consent to waive her pre-emption rights under Article

  28 of the company's memorandum and articles of association;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) prepare and execute the deeds of assignment pertaining to

  divesting her interests the Batam project and the debt owed to her by Boonoon</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">as these acts were well within her and the plaintiff's, abilities to

comply with without the need for assistance or co-operation from the defendant or for that

matter, Hayashi or PBGR.</p>
<p align="justify">21. In making the above directions, I did not re-write the bargain the

parties had entered into nor did I interpret the Consent Order to the advantage or

disadvantage of any party. They were necessary from a practical viewpoint, to ensure that

the terms of the Consent Order could be efficaciously implemented.</p>
