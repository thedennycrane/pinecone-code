        Sundaresh Menon CJ (delivering the judgment of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against the decision of the
                    High Court judge (“the Judge”) dismissing the Appellant’s
                    claim in Suit No 1 of 2012 (“the Suit”). The Appellant had sought
                    a declaration that the Respondents were <em>not</em>
                    partners of Mitre Hotel Proprietors (“MHP”) and thus had no
                    interest in or entitlement to any part of the one-tenth share of the proceeds
                    from the sale of the Mitre Hotel at No 145 Killiney Road, Singapore (“the
                    Property”). The share in question amounted to $11,500,000 (“the
                    Sale Proceeds”). The Property had been sold on 1 March 2010 pursuant to
                    an Order of Court made in Originating Summons No 830 of 2006 (“OS
                    830/2006”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Judge dismissed the Appellant’s claim
                    and held that the Respondents were partners of MHP (see <em>Chiam
                        Heng Hsien (on his own behalf and as partner of Mitre Hotel Proprietors) v

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background to the dispute </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The formation of MHP </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Prior to the formation of MHP, another
                    partnership (comprising the five original partners of MHP and five others) had
                    run a hotel business on the Property. On 28 November 1951, it was decided that
                    the earlier partnership be dissolved and the hotel business be sold as a going
                    concern to Toh Say for the sum of $260,000. This was subsequently documented in
                    a deed of dissolution dated 26 February 1952, pursuant to which, among other
                    things, the earlier partnership was deemed dissolved as from 30 November 1951
                    and the outgoing partners assigned to Toh Say absolutely their respective
                    shares, title and interest in the hotel business which included a one-tenth
                    undivided share in the Property.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       MHP was then constituted to take over the
                    running of the hotel business. The original partners of MHP entered into a
                    partnership deed on 28 February 1952 (“the Partnership Deed”)
                    setting out their respective shares in MHP as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>

                    that this was partnership property of MHP. Subsequently, on 21 October 1952, Toh
                    Say executed a declaration of trust (“the Trust Deed”) in these
                        terms:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Toh Moo passed away in February 1961 and was
                    survived by his widow and the Appellant, who was his only child. They were also
                    the only beneficiaries of his estate. On 22 July 1968, Toh Moo’s widow
                    executed a Deed of Gift and transferred the 21/88 share in MHP that she had
                    inherited from the late Toh Moo to the Appellant. Subsequently, the Appellant
                    was admitted into the partnership of MHP in respect of that 21/88 share (see [3]
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Toh Tong’s death and the alleged Loan Agreement </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Toh Tong passed away on 17 May 1969. As provided
                    in his will, Toh Kai was appointed the executor of his estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Appellant alleged that sometime in 1974,
                    Toh Tong’s widow, purporting to act on behalf of all the beneficiaries of
                    Toh Tong’s estate, requested that Toh Kai take over the estate’s
                    share in MHP in Toh Kai’s personal capacity as the beneficiaries were not
                    prepared to bear responsibility for the substantial accumulated losses of MHP.
                    According to the Appellant, Toh Kai acceded to her request and this arrangement
                    was reflected in the omission of Toh Tong’s estate from the list of
                    partners of MHP that was submitted to the Registry of Companies and Businesses
                    in 1974 and further in the minutes of a partners’ meeting dated 6 April
                    1975.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Subsequently in the mid-1980s, Chiam Heng Pout
                    (“Heng Pout”), Toh Tong’s son and a beneficiary of his
                    estate, encountered some financial difficulties and requested a loan of $50,000
                    from the Appellant. The Appellant claims that he agreed with Toh Kai (as the
                    personal representative of Toh Tong’s estate (see above at [9])) to extend
                    such a loan to Heng Pout on the basis that the entirety of Toh Tong’s
                    original 21/88 share in MHP to the Appellant, save for a nominal interest (the
                    amount of which would be determined by the Appellant) that Toh Kai would hold on
                    trust for the estate of Toh Tong, would be transferred to the Appellant with
                    effect from the date of the loan, if:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     Heng Pout failed to repay the
                        $50,000 loan to the Appellant within six months of the date of the loan;
                        or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     Heng Pout
                        was declared a bankrupt.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>(“the alleged Loan
                    Agreement”)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     According to the Appellant, Heng Pout knew of
                    this arrangement and had signed a note stating that he was fully aware of the
                    terms of the alleged Loan Agreement (“the alleged Loan Agreement
                    Note”). Heng Pout did not dispute that he had obtained a $50,000 loan
                    from the Appellant but claimed that it was an unconditional loan and that there
                    was no such thing as the alleged Loan Agreement. He also denied ever having
                    signed the alleged Loan Agreement Note.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Heng Pout did not repay the $50,000 loan to
                    the Appellant within six months and was later adjudged a bankrupt in 1988. The
                    Appellant claimed that he became aware of Heng Pout’s bankruptcy in the
                    early 1990s, and he then asked Toh Kai to transfer Toh Tong’s 21/88 share
                    in MHP to him, save for a nominal share which Toh Kai would hold for Toh
                    Tong’s estate. The Appellant alleged that a letter evidencing this
                    transfer was prepared (“the alleged Transfer Letter”). However,
                    the Appellant was unable to produce either the alleged Transfer Letter or the
                    alleged Loan Agreement Note. According to him, Toh Kai’s daughter, Chiam
                    Siew Juat, and a relative had broken into the Property sometime in September or
                    October 2008 and stolen these documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     By way of a deed of appointment dated 27
                    February 1986 (“the First Deed of Appointment”), Toh Kai
                    relinquished his position as the sole trustee of Toh Tong’s estate and
                    appointed the 3rd Respondent and Heng Pout in his place. Subsequently, by
                    another deed of appointment dated 23 October 1996 (“the Second Deed of
                    Appointment”), Heng Pout discharged himself as executor and appointed the
                    3rd Respondent the sole executrix of Toh Tong’s estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The consent judgment with Toh Lew’s estate </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Toh Lew passed away in 1975. In District Court
                    Summons No 6648 of 1984 (“DC 6648/1984”), a consent judgment was
                    entered in which his estate agreed to withdraw his name as a partner of MHP and
                    relinquish all claims that it had in respect of any share in MHP in
                    consideration for Toh Kai, Toh Say and the Appellant paying the estate $7,000
                    and reimbursing the estate for “all payments made by [Toh Lew’s
                    estate] to the Inland Revenue Department for the years
                1983-1988”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Toh Say’s death and the proceedings brought by his estate </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Toh Say’s status as a partner was the
                    subject of court proceedings that took place more than two decades ago and which
                    culminated in Civil Appeal No 150 of 1991
                    (“CA 150/1991”). It began in 1968 when the Appellant, having
                    received Toh Moo’s share of the partnership, began to take an interest in
                    the running of the hotel business. Toh Say had been running the hotel business
                    with Toh Moo, but had become the sole managing partner upon Toh Moo’s
                    death. The Appellant questioned Toh Say over the accounts for 1973 and was
                    alleged to have physically assaulted Toh Say. Their relationship soured. On 20
                    March 1975, Toh Say, through his solicitors, wrote to the Appellant, Toh Kai and
                    Toh Lew proposing that MHP be dissolved on 31 March 1975 or that he retire from
                    MHP on that date. The proposals were not accepted. A few days later, on 31 March
                    1975, Toh Say issued a notice of dissolution to the Appellant, Toh Kai and Toh
                    Lew. Again, the notice of dissolution was not accepted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In 1984, Toh Say commenced an action against
                    the MHP among other things, for his share of the profits of the partnership from
                    1976 to 1983. Toh Say passed away on 16 February 1990 in the midst of those
                    proceedings and the 1st and 2nd Respondents, being the executors of Toh
                    Say’s estate, took over the conduct of the proceedings. The statement of
                    claim was then amended to reflect the claim for Toh Say’s share of the
                    profits of the partnership from 1976 to 1986 (instead of 1983). It appears that
                    this amendment was triggered by the decision of the Income Tax Department (the
                    predecessor of the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore) in 1986 to adjust Toh
                    Say’s previous tax liabilities upwards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Lai Siu Chiu JC (as she then was) held that
                    Toh Say ceased to be a partner of MHP as at 31 March 1975 and was therefore not
                    entitled to any share of the profits thereafter. The Court of Appeal disagreed
                    and held that, while Toh Say had given notice to dissolve MHP on 31 March 1975,
                    this was ineffective because not all the partners had given effect to it and he
                    therefore remained a partner of MHP and was entitled to a share of the profits
                    for the period between 1976 and 1986 (see <em>Chiam Heng Chow and
                        another (executors of the estate of Chiam Toh Say, deceased) v Mitre Hotel
                        (Proprietors) (a firm) and others</em>
                    [1993] 2 SLR(R) 894).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On 30 December 1993, the 1st and 2nd
                    Respondents commenced Suit No 2439 of 1993 (“S 2439/1993”)
                    against MHP and the Appellant seeking, among other things, an account of the
                    value of Toh Say’s share at the date of his death and the payment of such
                    sum found to be due on the taking of this account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On 5 October 1994, the Appellant was ordered
                    to produce all the accounts of MHP and to file an affidavit verifying the said
                    accounts within 21 days from the date of the order (“the 5 October
                    Order”). The Appellant produced some documents alleging that these were
                    MHP’s accounts, but did not verify this by affidavit. On 24 November 1994,
                    the Appellant was ordered to make an affidavit in compliance with the 5 October
                    Order within 28 days, failing which parts of his defence in S 2439/1993
                    would be struck out without further order; and in that event, the
                    Appellant’s entire defence would be struck out and the 1st and 2nd
                    Respondents would be at liberty to enter judgment against him (“the
                    Unless Order”). The Unless Order was appealed against unsuccessfully and
                    in the event it was upheld by Kan Ting Chiu J in <em>Chiam Heng
                        Chow and another (executors of the estate of Chiam Toh Say, deceased) v
                        Mitre Hotel (Proprietors) (a firm) and another</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R)
                    899.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     At the trial below, the parties did not place
                    before the Judge any documents evidencing what happened after the appeal against
                    the Unless Order was dismissed by Kan J. However, it is evident from court
                    records that the Appellant did not comply with the Unless Order and as a result,
                    his defence in S 2439/1993 was struck out and judgment was entered against
                    the Appellant with costs on 22 March 1996. The judgment was extracted on the
                    same day. Counsel for the 1st and 2nd Respondents, Mr Michael Moey
                    (“Mr Moey”) accepted at the hearing before us that there is
                    no evidence that his clients took any further action or steps to enforce that
                    judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Toh Kai’s death and the proceedings brought against his
                estate</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Toh Kai passed away on 20 June
                1993.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     According to the Appellant, Toh Kai’s
                    estate was not admitted to the partnership. He further alleged that even if it
                    were, Toh Kai’s estate had served a notice to withdraw from MHP sometime
                    after 8 September 1993 following the delivery of judgment in CA 150/1991 as it
                    did not want to be liable for any portion of the sum of approximately $400,000
                    (including interests and costs) which MHP was ordered to pay Toh Say’s
                    estate in CA 150/1991. It therefore only remained a partner in respect of
                    the nominal share belonging to Toh Tong’s estate (see [10]–[13]
                    above). The Appellant also claimed that sometime in or about 2006, the 4th
                    Respondent and Chiam Siew Juat had approached him to discuss their re-admission
                    to MHP on behalf of Toh Kai’s estate. However, the terms of such
                    re-admission could not be agreed upon and therefore the intended re-admission
                    did not take place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Appellant’s account was disputed by
                    the 4th Respondent, who claimed that he had been admitted into the partnership
                    shortly after his father’s death and remained a partner since
                then.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     On 25 January 2002, the 3rd Respondent
                    commenced Originating Summons No 136 of 2002 (“OS 136/2002”), in
                    her capacity as trustee of Toh Tong’s estate, against the 4th Respondent
                    (in his capacity as trustee of Toh Kai’s estate) seeking a transfer of the
                    share of MHP belonging to Toh Tong’s estate from the estate of Toh Kai,
                    who it will be recalled had been the executor of Toh Tong’s estate after
                    his death (see [9] above); and for the 4th Respondent to render an account of
                    and pay over all business profits due to Toh Tong’s estate. Neither MHP
                    nor the Appellant were joined as a party to the action. It was eventually
                    decided in that case that the estate of Toh Kai held a 19/88 share of MHP on its
                    own behalf and a 21/88 share of MHP on trust for the estate of Toh Tong and the
                    4th Respondent was ordered to rectify the particulars of the partnership
                    business that were maintained with the Registry of Companies and Businesses (now
                    known as the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority
                    (“ACRA”)) to reflect this.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Sale of the Property and subsequent events</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     On 25 April 2006, the co-owners of the
                    Property commenced OS 830/2006 seeking, among other things, an order that
                    the Property be sold with vacant possession. The judge who heard that matter
                    ordered that the Property be sold with the proceeds of sale to be paid into
                    court pending the final disposal of all issues in the action. That decision was
                    affirmed by the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The Property was sold on 1 March 2010 and the
                    sum of $115,000,000 was paid into court to be distributed to the owners of the
                    Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     According to a search with ACRA conducted by
                    Mr Moey on 15 October 2012, MHP’s registration with ACRA was cancelled on
                    or about 3 May 2011. In the same search, the partners of the MHP were listed as

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     On 29 October 2010, the 1st and 2nd
                    Respondents (in their capacity as the executors of Toh Say’s estate)
                    applied in Originating Summons No 1123 of 2010 (“OS
                    1123/2010”) for a declaration that MHP be dissolved and an order that the
                    Sale Proceeds be paid out to the Appellant and the other Respondents (as the
                    representatives of the respective estates) in their respective shares. On 30
                    November 2011, Philip Pillai J adjourned the application <em>sine
                        die</em> as he considered that there were numerous issues in
                    dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Appellant then commenced the Suit, from
                    which the present appeal arises, on 3 January 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The claim below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The Appellant claimed that he was the sole
                    remaining partner of MHP at the time the Property was sold and sought a
                    declaration that the Respondents had no interest in the Sale Proceeds and
                    consequently no right to claim any interest accruing from this. He therefore
                    sought an order for the Sale Proceeds to be paid to him, save for a nominal sum
                    (as determined by the Appellant) to be paid to the 3rd Respondent (as to which
                    see [10] to [13] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The Appellant pleaded that the 1st and 2nd
                    Respondents, as personal representatives of Toh Say’s estate, were not
                    entitled to a share of the Sale Proceeds because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     Neither Toh Say’s estate nor
                        the 1st and 2nd Respondents had been admitted as partners of
                    MHP.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     Any amount due
                        to Toh Say’s estate in respect of his share was a debt that accrued at
                        the time of Toh Say’s death and any claim that the 1st and 2nd
                        Respondents might have in this regard had become time-barred by operation of
                        s 6 of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the Limitation
                        Act”) and/or defeated by laches.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The Appellant pleaded that except for a
                    nominal share to be determined by him, he had taken over the 21/88 share in MHP
                    belonging to Toh Tong’s estate from the date of the alleged Loan
                    Agreement. As such, neither the 3rd Respondent nor Toh Tong’s estate was
                    entitled to the Sale Proceeds, save for the nominal share which had not yet been
                    determined by the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The Appellant pleaded that the 4th Respondent,
                    as the personal representative of Toh Kai’s estate, was not entitled to a
                    share of the Sale Proceeds because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     Neither Toh Kai’s estate nor
                        the 4th Respondent had been admitted as a partner of MHP. Alternatively, and
                        in any event, Toh Kai’s estate and/or the 4th Respondent had served a
                        purported notice of its withdrawal from MHP after 8 September 1993. However,
                        Toh Kai’s estate remained a partner holding a nominal share (to be
                        determined by the Appellant) on behalf of Toh Tong’s
                    estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_b"></a>(b)     Any amount
                        due to Toh Kai’s estate in respect of his share was a debt that
                        accrued at the time of Toh Kai’s death, or at the time the 4th
                        Respondent served notice of his/the estate’s withdrawal from MHP. Any
                        such claim would now be time-barred and/or defeated by
                laches.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defences below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In response, the 1st and 2nd Respondents said
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_a"></a>(a)     That by agreement, Toh Say’s
                        estate continued to be a partner of MHP until its registration was
                        cancelled.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_b"></a>(b)     Further or in the alternative, Toh Say’s share of the partnership
                        assets became payable to his estate as a debt once a final account had been
                        rendered to his estate. As no final account was ever provided, the surviving
                        partners of MHP held and continue to hold Toh Say’s share of the Sale
                        Proceeds as trustees for his estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_c"></a>(c)     Further or in the alternative, s 6 of the Limitation Act
                        does not apply as MHP was in possession of the Property at all material
                        times; instead, s 22 of the Limitation Act applies and there is no
                        applicable time bar as the claim is against a trustee holding trust
                        property. Nor does the doctrine of laches apply as the Appellant had not
                        come to court with clean hands.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The 3rd Respondent’s case was that on
                    Toh Tong’s death, his estate was admitted as a partner of MHP in respect
                    of a 21/88 share in the partnership and it remained a partner and owner of the
                    said share until the date of the action. In this regard, she denied that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     Toh Kai had personally ever taken
                        over the share of MHP belonging to Toh Tong’s estate;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Appellant
                        in turn had acquired the said share from Toh Kai in the
                    mid-1980s.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The 4th Respondent’s case was as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a>(a)     Shortly after Toh Kai’s death,
                        he had been admitted into MHP to represent Toh Kai’s estate in respect
                        of a 19/88 share in MHP. Toh Kai’s estate never served a notice of
                        withdrawal from MHP; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a>(b)     He further denied that any claim by Toh Kai’s
                        estate to the Sale Proceeds was time barred by s 6 of the Limitation Act
                        and/or defeated by laches. Instead, s 22 of the Limitation Act was
                        applicable and therefore no time bar could be raised against the 4th
                        Respondent as his claim to the share of the partnership assets was against
                        the Appellant as a trustee holding trust property (or the proceeds
                        thereof).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision of the court below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The Judge held that the Trust Deed did not
                    confer a beneficial interest in the Property on the original partners; and
                    therefore no such interest devolved to the respective estates upon the deaths of
                    the original partners. The Judge also held that on a true construction of the
                    Trust Deed, the Property was held on trust for whoever was a partner of MHP at
                    the “relevant future period” and therefore only those who were
                    partners of MHP when the Property was sold would be entitled to a share of the
                    Sale Proceeds: [70]–[73] of the GD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The Judge also held that pursuant to cl 3
                    of the Partnership Deed, there was a technical dissolution of MHP upon the death
                    of a partner; and that there was no agreement that the personal representatives
                    of the estate of the deceased partners would be automatically admitted as
                    partners: [74]–[76] of the GD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The Judge also found that in the absence of an
                    express provision in the partnership agreement, the surviving partners did not
                    hold a deceased partner’s share in partnership land on trust for his
                    estate. Rather, the estate’s entitlement was to the proportionate share of
                    the net proceeds from the liquidation of the partnership assets. Pursuant to
                    s 43 of the Partnership Act (Cap 391, 1994 Rev Ed) (“Partnership
                    Act”), this accrues as a debt owed to the personal representatives of a
                    deceased partner on the date of the death of the partner and this in turn was
                    subject to the six-year limitation period prescribed by s 6(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Limitation Act: [78]–[88] of the
                    GD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     However, the Judge found that all the
                    Respondents were nevertheless entitled to a share of the Sale Proceeds because
                    they had each in fact been admitted to the partnership.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     For the 1st and 2nd Respondents, the Judge
                    found that they had been impliedly accepted as partners. He based this on the
                    Appellant’s failure to rectify the ACRA records despite being repeatedly
                    advised to do so, as well as his failure to object to the payment by the 1st and
                    2nd Respondents of a 25/88 share of the property tax assessed on the one-tenth
                    share of the Property, in their capacity as partners of MHP: [98]–[99] of
                    the GD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     As regards the 3rd Respondent, the Judge held
                    that Toh Tong’s 21/88 share in MHP was not extinguished upon his death but
                    was held on trust by Toh Kai for Toh Tong’s estate. He found that Toh Kai
                    did not subsequently acquire the estate’s share in MHP in his personal
                    capacity and further that there was no alleged Loan Agreement; hence, the entire
                    21/88 share in MHP vested in the 3rd Respondent and Heng Pout upon the execution
                    of the First Deed of Appointment: [104]–[122] of the GD. Relying on
                    certain statements made by the Appellant in affidavits filed in different
                    proceedings as admissions, the Judge found that following their appointment as
                    trustees of Toh Tong’s estate, the 3rd Respondent and Heng Pout were
                    admitted as partners holding a 21/88 share in MHP. The 3rd Respondent became the
                    sole executrix of the estate and the entirety of the 21/88 share vested in her
                    following the Second Deed of Appointment: [124]-[129] of the GD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The Judge also relied on certain statements
                    made by the Appellant in various affidavits filed in other proceedings, which he
                    found amounted to admissions, and on this basis found that the 4th Respondent
                    had been admitted as a partner of MHP representing Toh Kai’s estate in
                    respect of its 19/88 share in MHP. On the evidence, the Judge also rejected the
                    Appellant’s contention that Toh Kai’s estate had given notice to
                    withdraw from the partnership subsequent to the decision in CA 150/1991:
                    [130]–[136] of the GD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The Judge therefore dismissed the
                    Appellant’s claim with costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ cases on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Appellant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The Appellant submits that the Judge was wrong
                    to find that he had consented to the admission of the Respondents as partners.
                    In this regard, he argues that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_a"></a>(a)     the 1st and 2nd Respondents did not
                        plead implied consent and further that any inaction on his part was not
                        sufficiently unequivocal to constitute consent by him to the admission of
                        the 1st and 2nd Respondents as partners; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Appellant’s statements in affidavits
                        filed in previous proceedings could not be relied upon as admissions that he
                        had consented to the 3rd and 4th Respondents being admitted as
                        partners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The Appellant further contends that the Judge
                    erred in finding that the Respondents had been admitted as partners into MHP as
                    he failed to consider whether the others who were then partners at the various
                    material times, had consented to the Respondents’ admission as
                    partners.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Respondents’ respective cases</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The 1st and 2nd Respondents submit that the
                    Judge was correct to find that the Appellant had consented to their admission as
                    partners. In the alternative, they contend that the Judge’s decision to
                    dismiss the claim should be affirmed on the following grounds:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_a"></a>(a)     They continued to be partners of MHP
                        following the death of Toh Say either because there had been no technical
                        dissolution of the partnership or because they were automatically admitted
                        into the partnership.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Judge erred in finding that the original partners’
                        beneficial interest in the Property did not devolve to their respective
                        estates upon their deaths.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_c"></a>(c)     Section 6 of the Limitation Act does not apply because
                        the 1st and 2nd Respondents were not trying to enforce a contract or bring
                        an action for an account against the Appellant. Moreover, the Appellant has
                        not come to court with clean hands and their claim would therefore not be
                        defeated by laches.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The 3rd and 4th Respondents submit that the
                    Judge was correct in finding that the Appellant’s statements in other
                    proceedings amounted to admissions that he had consented to their being admitted
                    as partners of MHP. They also contend that the allegation that the others who
                    were partners at the relevant times did not give their consent was not pleaded
                    below and that the Appellant should not be allowed to raise the argument now. In
                    any event, they argue that there is ample evidence that those who were partners
                    at the relevant times did consent to their admission as partners of
                MHP.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The 4th Respondent also submitted in the
                    alternative that the decision of the Judge should be affirmed on the basis that
                    the 4th Respondent does have a beneficial interest in the trust of the sale
                    proceeds of the Property regardless of his status as a partner. In this regard,
                    he argues (in some respects, in common with the 1st and 2nd Respondents)
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Judge erred in interpreting the
                        relevant term of the Trust Deed; and that in fact on a true construction of
                        the Trust Deed, the partners at the time the trust was created were also
                        beneficiaries of the said trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_b"></a>(b)     Irrespective of the Trust Deed, the beneficial interest
                        of a partner in partnership land devolves to his estate on his death. As
                        such, no limitation period was applicable pursuant to s 22(1) of the
                        Limitation Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_50-p2_c"></a>(c)     Alternatively, the Limitation Act has no application because no account was
                        ever rendered to Toh Kai’s estate by the surviving partners and the
                        new partnership was carried on after his death.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues before this Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Two main issues arise for our decision. The
                    first is whether the evidence bears out the finding that each of the Respondents
                    had been admitted as partners of MHP. The second is whether, in the event the
                    evidence does not bear this out, the original partners each had a beneficial
                    interest in the partnership land, namely the one-tenth undivided share in the
                    Property, which devolved upon their deaths to their respective estates. Related
                    to the second issue is the sub-issue of whether the Limitation Act applies to
                    whatever rights or interests the Respondents might have and if so, what the
                    applicable limitation period is.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Before turning to these issues, we touch on
                    one point which was not raised by the parties. The Judge’s finding at [89]
                    of the GD was expressed in terms that the Respondents had been admitted into the
                    partnership “in their personal capacities”. This was never pleaded
                    by any of the Respondents who were defending the Suit in their capacities as
                    personal representatives of the respective deceased partners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     We raised this at the hearing before us.
                    Counsel for the Appellant, Mr Edwin Lee (“Mr Lee”), in all
                    fairness did not feel able to pursue the point, observing that the Judge’s
                    finding had to be read in the context of the rest of the GD; it was apparent
                    from the rest of his grounds that the Judge had found that the respective
                    Respondents had been admitted not in their personal capacity but rather as
                    personal representatives of the respective deceased partners. We agree. Indeed,
                    all the evidence that was adduced to support the 3rd and 4th Respondents’
                    pleaded cases had been directed towards showing that they had been admitted in
                    their capacity as the personal representatives of Toh Tong and Toh Kai
                    respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Before proceeding further, we should clarify
                    one point. As Toh Say passed away in 1990, it should have been the Partnership
                    Act 1890 (53 &amp; 54 Vict, c 39) (UK) (“the 1890 Act”), made
                    applicable in Singapore by virtue of s 5 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1988
                    Rev Ed), that would apply. However, the parties have proceeded by reference to
                    the Partnership Act, and given that the 1890 Act and the Partnership Act are
                    identical save for a number of provisions which are not relevant for the present
                    proceedings, we refer to the provisions in the Partnership Act instead of the
                    1890 Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the Judge err in finding that the Respondents are partners of
                MHP? </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The 1st and 2nd Respondents</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     We first deal with the 1st and 2nd
                    Respondents’ contention that they continue to be partners of MHP because
                    (a) there has allegedly been no technical dissolution of MHP given that no
                    proper accounts have been rendered to Toh Say’s estate, and alternatively
                    (b) the partners had agreed that the legal representatives of the deceased
                    partner’s estate would step into the shoes of the deceased partner in the
                    partnership and be automatically admitted into the partnership. We deal with
                    these two points in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Did a technical dissolution of MHP occur? </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Unlike a company, which is a distinct legal
                    entity with its own legal personality, a partnership, in essence, is a
                    contractual relationship between two or more persons carrying on a business with
                    a view to profit. It has thus been observed that the essence of a partnership
                    contract is that each partner must be alive in order to contribute his
                    individual personal qualities; therefore, the death of any partner and the
                    ensuing loss of his personal attributes will, in and of itself, extinguish the
                    very spirit of the contract and terminate not only the relationship between the
                    deceased and the surviving partners but also as between the surviving partners:
                    see Yeo Hwee Ying, <em>Partnership Law in Singapore</em>
                    (Butterworths Asia, 2000) (“<em>Yeo</em>”) at
                    p 243 and Roderick I’Anson Banks, <em>Lindley &amp; Banks
                        on Partnership</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2010)
                        (“<em>Lindley</em>”) at para
                3-04.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Reflecting this principle, s 33(1) of the
                    Partnership Act provides that a partnership is dissolved by the death of a
                    partner, subject to any agreement to the contrary. In the present case, cl 3 of
                    the Partnership Deed provides that “[t]he death or retirement of any
                    partner shall not dissolve the partnership as to the other partners”. We
                    note first that cl 3 in effect provides for the continuance of the partnership
                    “as to the <em>other</em> partners” [emphasis
                    added]. It does not in terms contemplate that the estate of a deceased partner
                    remains a partner. But does this mean that in a setting where a contrary
                    arrangement has been agreed to that no technical dissolution occurs? In our
                    judgment that does not follow. A <em>technical</em>
                    dissolution of the original partnership occurs, <em>as a matter
                        of law</em>, due to the change in the composition of the firm. It is
                    therefore observed in <em>Lindley</em> as follows (at para
                    24-02):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…It has already been seen that, as a matter of law, a change in the
                        composition of a partnership results in a dissolution of the existing firm
                        and the creation of a new firm; in such a case, the new firm will usually
                        take on the assets and liabilities of the old, without any break in the
                        continuity of the business. This is often referred to as a
                        “technical” dissolution and is usually, but not always, the
                        result of agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     This basic proposition was reiterated in
                        <em>Hadlee v Commissioner of Inland Revenue</em> [1989]
                    2 NZLR 447 at 455 (<em>per</em> Eichelbaum CJ): see also
                        <em>Inland Revenue v Graham’s Trustees</em>
                    [1971] SC (HL) 1 at 5 and <em>Khoo Yoke Wah v Lee Choo Yam
                        Holdings</em> [1991] 1 MLJ 414 at 416 (<em>per</em> Gunn Chit Tuan SCJ, in <em>obiter</em>)
                    where the courts found that the surviving partners who continue to run the
                    business of the partnership, carry on as a “different and distinct legal
                    persona”. Put simply, therefore, a technical dissolution occurs because
                    the composition of the partnership has changed. The rendering of accounts is
                        <em>not</em> a <em>pre-requisite</em> for the technical dissolution of a partnership to
                    occur; rather it would be a <em>consequence</em> of
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Mr Moey, counsel for the 1st and 2nd
                    Respondents, sought to rely on s 27(2) of the Partnership Act to support
                    his proposition that there will not be a technical dissolution of the
                    partnership until the accounts have been rendered. That section provides as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Where partnership for term is
                            continued over, continuance on old terms
                        presumed</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27.—(1) Where a partnership entered into for a fixed term is
                        continued after the term has expired, and without any express new agreement,
                        the rights and duties of the partners remain the same as they were at the
                        expiration of the term, so far as is consistent with the incidents of a
                        partnership at will.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) A continuance of the business by the partners or such of them as
                        habitually acted therein during the term, without any settlement or
                        liquidation of the partnership affairs, is presumed to be a continuance of
                        the partnership.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     With respect to Mr Moey, his reliance on this
                    provision is misplaced. Section 27 of the Partnership Act is concerned with the
                    continuation of a partnership for a term (that is a partnership that has been
                    entered into for a fixed term and that will automatically be dissolved upon the
                    expiration of that term). Such a partnership continues as a partnership at the
                    will of the partners after the expiration of the stipulated term. In other
                    words, s 27(2) of the Partnership Act essentially creates a presumption
                    that a partnership for a term continues as a partnership at will where the
                    partners or such of them have continued the business, “without any
                    settlement or liquidation of the partnership affairs”. The provision has
                    no application in the present case which was not a partnership for a term and
                    which had been technically dissolved not by the effluxion of time but by the
                    death of one of the partners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In light of the foregoing, we find that there
                    was a technical dissolution of MHP upon the death of Toh Say.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Were the 1st and 2nd Respondents automatically admitted as
                partners? </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     We turn to the second point. It is clear that
                    unless the parties to the partnership contract have agreed to the contrary, the
                    personal representatives of a deceased partner have no automatic right to become
                    a partner. This is so even if the business of the partnership continues with the
                    remaining partners: see <em>Lindley</em> at para 26-02 and
                        <em>Yeo</em> at p 244. In this regard, the 1st and 2nd
                    Respondents repeat their arguments raised in the trial below that it can be
                    inferred from the practice of the partners and from cll 23 and 25 of the
                    Partnership Deed that the intention was that the personal representatives of a
                    deceased partner’s estate would automatically be admitted to the
                    partnership.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     We first consider the clauses of the
                    Partnership Deed. Clause 23 provides that the “[i]f any partner should
                    die during the continuance of the partnership[,] his share of the nett [sic]
                    profits shall be paid to his legal personal representatives.” The Judge
                    observed that nothing in the wording of cl 23 suggests that the personal
                    representatives of the deceased’s estate are to be admitted as partners
                    and we agree. Notably, cl 23 expressly provides that the payments would be
                    received by the personal representatives of the deceased’s estate in that
                    capacity <em>and not as partners</em>. Moreover, the clause
                    will clearly cease to operate once the deceased partner’s share in the
                    partnership has been extinguished.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     As regards cl 25 of the Partnership Deed,
                    which is the dispute resolution clause, Mr Moey sought to contend that the fact
                    that it contemplates disputes between the personal representatives of a partner
                    and any other partner suggests that the personal representatives were themselves
                    to be admitted as partners. We disagree and instead concur with the Judge that
                    nothing in its wording limits the operation of cl 25 to <em>partners</em> of MHP. Indeed, the clause expressly states
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All disputes and questions whatsoever which shall either during the
                        partnership <em>or afterwards</em> arise between the
                        partners <em>or their respective representatives</em>
                        or between any partners or partner <em>and the representative
                            of any other partner</em> touching this deed or the construction
                        or application thereof… shall be referred to a single arbitrator
                        … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Clause 25 thus contemplates that even disputes arising
                            <em>after the partnership ceases to exist</em>
                        shall be referred to arbitration, where these are between the partners or
                        their personal representatives in the case of a deceased partner. This does
                        not assist Mr Moey’s argument or support his contention that it was
                        contemplated that the personal representatives would automatically become
                        partners. Indeed, the fact that cl 25 refers to “partners
                            <em>or</em> their respective
                        representatives” would suggest that the personal representatives of
                        the partners are <em>not</em> automatically admitted
                        into the partnership. If Mr Moey was right, then the words “or their
                        respective representatives” would have been redundant. In this
                        regard, it appears to us that cl 25 actually contradicts Mr
                        Moey’s contention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     As to the alleged practice of admitting the
                    personal representatives of a deceased partner to the partnership, we are
                    satisfied that there was no such consistent practice. Indeed, the true position
                    was quite to the contrary. First, the Appellant had been admitted into MHP with
                    the <em>express consent</em> of the other surviving
                    partners and this was done <em>in his own right</em>
                        (<em>ie</em>, not in his capacity as personal
                    representative of Toh Moo’s estate). That this is so is reflected in the
                    fact that although Toh Moo passed away in February 1961, the Appellant was only
                    admitted as a partner on 19 November 1974. Second, the 1st and 2nd
                    Respondents’ reliance on the consent judgment in DC 6648/1984 as evidence
                    that Toh Lew’s estate had been admitted as a partner of MHP is tenuous.
                    Disputes are settled for an infinite variety of reasons and the entry of a
                    consent judgment generally says nothing about the merits of either side’s
                    case. Moreover, the consent judgment in that case entailed the estate giving up
                    its claims in return for certain payments. This says nothing about the nature of
                    those claims. Finally, and most importantly, the 1st and 2nd Respondents did not
                    take the position in S 2439/1993 (see above at [19]-[21]) that they had
                    been automatically admitted as partners in their capacity as personal
                    representatives of Toh Say following Toh Say’s demise. On the contrary,
                    the 1st and 2nd Respondents claimed that the Appellant was the sole surviving
                    partner of MHP and sought various reliefs <em>in their capacity
                        as personal representatives of Toh Say</em>, which was consistent with
                    an intention to liquidate and extract the value of Toh Say’s share from
                    the partnership (see below at [136]-[137] and [153]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In the premises, we find that there was no
                    agreement that the personal representatives of the deceased partners’
                    estates would be automatically admitted as partners. Therefore, s 24(7) of
                    the Partnership Act applies and the consent of all remaining partners had to be
                    obtained for a person to be admitted into the partnership. It is to this
                    question of consent that we now turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Did the Appellant consent to the admission of the 1st and
                2nd Respondents as partners?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The Judge primarily relied on the
                    Appellant’s failure to rectify the particulars in ACRA and his failure to
                    object to the 1st and 2nd Respondents’ payment of property tax in respect
                    of the property to find that the Appellant had impliedly consented to the
                    admission of the 1st and 2nd Respondents as partners of MHP. The Appellant
                    submits that the Judge erred and makes three contentions in respect of his
                    submission. First, he contends that his alleged “silent
                    inactivity” was not sufficiently unequivocal to signify his implied
                    consent to the admission of the 1st and 2nd Respondents into MHP. Second, and in
                    any event, he submits that there was no “silent inactivity” on his
                    part. Finally, he contends that implied consent was not even pleaded by the 1st
                    and 2nd Respondents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In our judgment, the last contention can be
                    dismissed quickly. The 1st and 2nd Respondents had pleaded the facts on which
                    they intended to rely to make good their contention that the Appellant
                    considered them to be partners. Further and in any event, there has been no
                    prejudice to the Appellant as this issue had been fully ventilated and the
                    necessary evidence was adduced at the court below. Mr Lee quite properly did not
                    pursue this point at the hearing before us.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In relation to the first two contentions,
                    before we turn to the relevant facts, we think it useful to briefly set out the
                    relevant legal principles. In accordance with contract law principles, the fact
                    of consent must be ascertained objectively and it may be express, implied or
                    inferred from the surrounding circumstances including the conduct of the parties
                    at the time the agreement was reached: <em>Lindley</em> at
                    para 10-256 and <em>Yeo</em> at pp 29 and 79. The Judge
                    relied on the decision in <em>Giuffrida Luigi v Julius Baer
                        (Singapore) Ltd (in members’ voluntary liquidation) and
                        another</em> [2010] SGHC 96 (“<em>Julius
                        Baer</em>”) (at [20]) for the proposition that silent
                    inactivity may be sufficient to signify a party’s implied consent to an
                    arrangement <em>if the circumstances are such that the silent
                        party ought to have spoken up or objected</em>. It is important to
                    emphasise that this inquiry is invariably fact-sensitive. As observed by
                    V K Rajah JC (as he then was) in <em>Midlink Development Pte
                        Ltd v The Stansfield Group Pte Ltd</em> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 258 at
                    [52]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… In the final analysis, the touchstone is whether, <em>in the established matrix of circumstances</em>, the
                        conduct of the parties, objectively ascertained, supports the existence of a
                        contract… Legal intentions, whether articulated or unarticulated,
                        should not be viewed in isolation but should be filtered through their
                        factual prism. Silence, depending on whether it is conscious or unconscious,
                        may also from time to time entail altogether disparate legal consequences.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In <em>Julius Baer</em> for example, the
                        circumstances which were thought to warrant finding a duty on the silent
                        party to object included the fact that the complainant customer was deemed
                        to have received a letter which specifically stated that bank customers were
                        to respond if they did not agree to the transfer of their
                    accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Returning to the case at hand, it is true that
                    the present proceedings are the first commenced by the Appellant to clarify just
                    who the partners of MHP are. Furthermore, although the Appellant had claimed
                    under cross-examination that he had requested that the 1st and 2nd Respondents
                    sign and file the prescribed Form D to rectify ACRA’s records and reflect
                    that they were no longer partners, he was unable to produce any documentary
                    evidence in support of this claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Nonetheless, we consider that the
                    Appellant’s failure to rectify the register must be seen in context. Such
                    a failure can only be held against the Appellant if he owed a duty to the 1st
                    and 2nd Respondents to take steps to rectify the register. As was recognised by
                    the Judge, the registration of a deceased partner’s estate as a partner of
                    MHP cannot affect the rights and status of the partners <em>inter
                        se</em>. Indeed, ACRA had consistently accepted that the inclusion of
                    the deceased partners’ estates on its register was merely for
                    administrative purposes and did not mean that the estates in question had in
                    fact been admitted into the partnership. In its letter dated 30 March
                        2000,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> the
                    Registry of Companies and Businesses (ACRA’s predecessor) explained that
                    the addition of the words “Estate of” in respect of Toh Kai and
                    Toh Say had been done only “to denote that these two persons…have
                    passed away. <em>It does not denote that the estate has been
                        admitted into the partnership</em>” [emphasis added]. Similar
                    statements to the Appellant were made in ACRA’s letter dated 27 November
                        2006<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> and
                    ACRA’s email dated 18 January 2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     This is entirely consistent with the fact that
                    the Business Registration Act (Cap 32, 2004 Rev Ed) imposes a statutory duty on
                    persons carrying on a business to ensure the accuracy of the particulars of the
                    business registered with ACRA (see ss 5 and 14), for a particular purpose,
                    which is to protect <em>third parties</em> dealing with
                    these persons from fraud (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary
                        Debates, Official Report</em> (26 July 1973) vol 32 at col 1229 (Hon
                    Sui Sen, Minister for Finance)). In our judgment, the 1st and 2nd Respondents
                    can hardly be said to be in the same position as a third party dealing with MHP.
                    On the contrary, there is ample evidence that the 1st and 2nd Respondents were
                    put on notice of the Appellant’s consistent and vehement objection to
                    their claim to be partners of MHP. The Appellant had denied that they were
                    partners in his 5 March 1998 affidavit filed in Originating Summons No 31 of
                        1998<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> and
                    subsequently also in his affidavit dated 31 August 2006 filed in
                    OS 830/2006 (“the OS 830 affidavit”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The 1st and
                    2nd Respondents were parties to both of these proceedings and would therefore
                    have known of the Appellant’s objections. Further, on 2 October 2006,
                    subsequent to the filing of the OS 830 affidavit, the 1st and 2nd
                    Respondents’ solicitor had sent a letter, purporting to give notice of a
                    partnership meeting of MHP, to the Appellant as well as the 3rd and 4th
                    Respondents. In his reply, the Appellant objected to the purported notice on the
                    basis that the 1st and 2nd Respondents had not been admitted as partners into
                    MHP.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In the circumstances, we are satisfied that
                    the Judge erred in finding that the circumstances were such as to justify
                    imposing a duty on the Appellant, as against <em>the 1st and 2nd
                        Respondents</em>, to take steps to rectify ACRA’s records by
                    removing Toh Say’s estate from the register. Moreover, in our judgment,
                    the Appellant’s consistent objections to the 1st and 2nd Respondents
                    and/or Toh Say’s estate being named as partners of MHP ran counter to a
                    finding of implied consent on his part to their admission as
                partners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     We next consider the Judge’s finding in
                    relation to the payment of property tax. It is important to emphasise from the
                    outset that as Toh Say’s estate was the legal owner of the one-tenth share
                    of the Property, the 1st and 2nd Respondents (being the executors of his estate)
                    were <em>legally obliged</em> to pay the property tax
                    assessed on it, although they would then have been entitled to be reimbursed out
                    of the trust funds for this expense. Indeed, this was the Appellant’s
                    understanding as he testified under cross-examination:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Yes. So far as you know, as trustee for the whole
                            one-tenth of the property, who should pay the property
                        tax?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Er, the trustee is considered as---as the property

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The 1st and 2nd Respondents relied on the
                    letter from their counsel dated 9 March 2009 to the other parties in relation to
                    the property tax payable to suggest that this indicated that the Appellant
                    accepted that they were partners. We do not agree. First, the letter has to be
                    read in light of the legal position stated above at [69] which is that it must
                    be construed objectively in the light of all the circumstances. Paragraph 2 of
                    the letter states as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Our clients instruct that <em>in the light of the current
                            situation</em>, <em>it is preferable</em>
                        that all the partners of Mitre Hotel Proprietors pay the property tax due
                        for their 1/10<sup>th</sup> share of the captioned property
                        directly to the Comptroller of Property Tax in proportion to their shares.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     In our judgment, the language of this extract,
                    read in light of the 1st and 2nd Respondents’ legal obligation (as the
                    registered legal owners) to pay property tax, suggests that the payment of
                    property tax in accordance with the parties’ claimed partnership shares
                    was merely a <em>suggestion</em>. Unlike in <em>Julius Baer</em>, where the letter from the bank expressly
                    stated that the bank customers were obliged to respond if they disagreed to the
                    transfer, there was no duty on the Appellant to respond, such that his silence
                    would constitute acquiescence. On the contrary, it was the 1st and 2nd
                    Respondents who requested the Appellant to respond precisely because he was not
                    obliged to do so. Thus paragraph 4 of the letter stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As for the estate of Chiam Toh Lew, <em>our clients shall
                            appreciate if [the Appellant] will confirm</em> if he will be
                        making payment of S$2,363.64 over and above his own share, being the amount
                        of property tax due for the 2/88 share owned by the estate of Chiam Toh Lew,
                        which he claims. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In the circumstances, we do not agree that the
                    Appellant’s failure to respond to the letter from the 1st and 2nd
                    Respondents could be deemed sufficiently unequivocal to connote
                consent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     It is also irrelevant whether the Appellant
                    offered to reimburse the 1st and 2nd Respondents for the property tax that they
                    had paid because as trustees, the 1st and 2nd Respondents would in any event be
                    entitled to be reimbursed from the proceeds of sale of the trust property for
                    any expenses they had incurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     We therefore find that the Judge erred in
                    relying on the Appellant’s failure to object to the 1st and 2nd
                    Respondents’ payment of property tax as constituting implied consent to
                    their admission as partners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Finally, for completeness, we address two
                    further points raised by Mr Moey at the hearing before us. First, he sought
                    to rely on a letter dated 29 April 2006<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> from the Appellant to the 1st and 2nd
                    Respondents in respect of OS 830/2006 as evidence that the Appellant had
                    consented to the admission of the 1st and 2nd Respondents as partners. Second,
                    he argued that the implied consent of the Appellant could also be inferred from
                    his failure to take action to displace the 1st and 2nd Respondents as trustees
                    of the one-tenth undivided share in the Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     As to the first point, we begin by setting out
                    the contents of the letter dated 29 April 2006 in full:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We refer to [OS 830/2006] in which you are the
                            6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup>
                        Defendants. As you are fully aware, you are holding the
                            1/10<sup>th</sup> share of the property as a trustee for
                        [MHP] who is the beneficial owner. WE [sic] have written to you a few years
                        back asking you to transfer the property to the precedent partner as trustee
                        but there was no response. AS [sic] we are the
                            8<sup>th</sup> defendant, we shall engage a lawyer to
                        act for us on this matter to protect our interest. <em>I

                            incur unnecessary costs</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Mr Moey argued that it was clear from the Appellant’s
                        reference to “our interest” that he thought that the 1st and
                        2nd Respondents were also partners of MHP. We disagree. As we observed at
                        the hearing, the reference to “our interest” was consistent
                        with the 1st and 2nd Respondents being trustees of the one-tenth share of
                        the Property for MHP because as trustee their interest in relation to the
                        trust property would have been aligned with the interest of the beneficiary.
                        This reading of the words “our interest” is further supported
                        when read in the context of the rest of the letter as it is clear that the
                        Appellant was addressing the 1st and 2nd Respondents <em>in
                            their capacity as trustees</em>. The question of whether the 1st
                        and 2nd Respondents were also partners is a separate one that was neither
                        raised nor put in issue by this letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     As for Mr Moey’s second contention
                    that the Appellant should have removed the 1st and 2nd Respondents as trustees,
                    we do not see any force in this. First, as noted in the letter that Mr Moey
                    referred to and which is set out in the preceding paragraph, the Appellant had
                    sought a transfer of legal title to him as precedent partner (for him to hold on
                    trust for MHP). Second, the fact that no action was taken to remove the 1st and
                    2nd Respondents as trustees sheds no light at all on whether they had in fact
                    been admitted to the partnership in the first place.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Conclusion on Issue 1 in relation to the 1st and 2nd
                Respondents</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     For these reasons, we find that the Appellant
                    did not consent to the 1st and 2nd Respondents being admitted as partners of MHP
                    following the demise of Toh Say. In the premises, it is unnecessary for us to
                    consider whether the others who were partners of MHP at the time had consented
                    to their admission.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The 3rd and 4th Respondents </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The Judge primarily relied on statements made
                    by the Appellant both in these and in other legal proceedings (primarily in
                    OS 830/2006) as admissions (in the evidentiary sense) that the 3rd and 4th
                    Respondents had been admitted as partners of MHP. In this regard, the case
                    advanced by the Appellant has two main prongs. First, he submitted that the
                    Judge had erred in finding that the statements made by the Appellant were
                    admissions that the 3rd and 4th Respondents had become partners of MHP. Second,
                    he submitted that even if these were admissions, the Appellant could not have
                    acted unilaterally; consent also had to be obtained from the others who were
                    partners of MHP at the time and this, allegedly, was never done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     We begin by stating that we affirm the
                    Judge’s finding that neither Toh Kai nor the Appellant had acquired Toh
                    Tong’s 21/88 share in the partnership, as set out at [10]–[13]
                    above. We agree with the Judge’s finding on this and his reasons as set
                    out at [107]-[122] of the GD.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The Appellant’s statements </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The Appellant makes two arguments in respect
                    of the Judge’s reliance on the statements made in the OS 830 affidavit.
                    First, he argues that the OS 830 affidavit essentially dealt with the issue
                    of whether MHP continued to be in existence and not whether the 3rd or 4th
                    Respondents were substantive partners of MHP at the relevant time and that his
                    statements should be read in that context. Second, he argues that his statements
                    were not inconsistent with the position that the 4th Respondent had been
                    admitted as a partner only in respect of the nominal share that he says belongs
                    to Toh Tong’s estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     We set out the relevant extract of the OS 830
                        affidavit:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>

                            admitted as partners into [MHP] by the remaining partners. To date, this
                            remains the case.</span></p>

                            the remaining partners. …</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     It is clear from this that the Appellant had
                    stated in definite terms and <em>on oath</em> that the 3rd
                    and 4th Respondents as the personal representatives of the estates of the
                    deceased partners (namely, Toh Tong and Toh Kai) had been admitted as partners.
                    In our judgment, these statements were clearly admissions that could be and were
                    properly relied on against the Appellant as they were statements that he had
                    made and were contrary to the position he was taking in the present proceedings.
                    We are also satisfied that the context in which the statements were made does
                    nothing to alter their clear and unequivocal meaning. In fact, the statements
                    had been made in the context of the Appellant giving an account of the changes
                    in the composition of MHP and its partners as at the date of the affidavit
                        <em>in order to show</em> that the partnership still
                    existed. We note that the Appellant appeared to reserve his position on who the
                    partners of MHP were and what their respective shares were at paragraph 27 of
                    the said affidavit. In our judgment, however, this does not displace the weight
                    of the assertions that he was making. Significantly, the Appellant had himself
                    relied on these statements in the later parts of his affidavit to support his
                    claim that he did have standing to represent MHP in those proceedings (see paras
                    32 and 33 of the OS 830 affidavit).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Turning to the Appellant’s second
                    contention, we have already stated (at [85] above) that we agree with the
                    Judge’s rejection of the Appellant’s contentions on the nominal
                    share issue. But there is a further point. In his affidavit filed on 6 June 2011
                    in OS 1123/2010 (“the OS 1123 affidavit”), which was an
                    application taken out by the 1st and 2nd Respondents as trustees of the
                    one-tenth share of the Property, the Appellant had said as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Toh Kai] passed away on 20 June 1993. His administrator, [the 4th
                        Respondent] was admitted to the partnership, <em>to represent
                            [Toh Kai’s] estate</em>. However, after the Court of
                        Appeal’s decision for Civil Appeal No. 150 of 1991, which was issued
                        on 8 September 1993, [Toh Kai’s] estate served notice of its
                        withdrawal from MHP through its solicitors, M/s Laycock &amp; Ong. …
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>This was an express statement contrary to the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     For completeness, we also affirm the
                    Judge’s finding that the 4th Respondent did not withdraw from the
                    partnership. In addition to the Judge’s reasons at [133]-[135] of the GD,
                    which we accept, we also observe that there was no mention of the 4th
                    Respondent’s purported withdrawal in the OS 830 affidavit that the
                    Appellant filed in August 2006, long after the alleged withdrawal of the 4th
                    Respondent from the partnership. Moreover the Appellant had confirmed, under
                    cross-examination in those proceedings, that the 4th Respondent was still a
                    partner of MHP as at 17 April 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>

                    that the 3rd and 4th Respondents were not effectively admitted as partners
                    because the consent of the others who were partners at the time of their alleged
                    admission had not been obtained. This was a point taken only at the appeal. Is
                    the Appellant entitled to raise this now? The 3rd and 4th Respondents submit
                    that this had not been pleaded by the Appellant and was never put forward as a
                    basis for the Appellant’s claim that he was the sole surviving partner of
                    MHP. In response, the Appellant contends that it was incumbent on the 3rd and
                    4th Respondents (and not on him) to plead and prove the facts that support their
                    claim that the administrators of the respective estates have been admitted as
                    partners of MHP, and this would include proving the fact that <em>all the partners at that time</em> had consented to their admission:
                    see s 24(7) of the Partnership Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     It is trite that every pleading must contain
                    the material facts on which the party relies for his claim or defence and that
                    both the parties and the court are bound by the parties’ pleadings. In
                    this regard, the Appellant’s claim in respect of the non-admission of the
                    3rd and 4th Respondents was based on particular factual allegations as
                    summarised at [33]-[34] above and expressly pleaded in his Statement of Claim
                    (Amendment No 4) at paras 32-49 and 50-55.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> It was never the Appellant’s
                    position below that the 3rd and 4th Respondents had not been admitted into the
                    partnership on the basis that no consent had been obtained from the <em>other</em> partners at that time. In turn, the 3rd and 4th
                    Respondents <em>denied</em> that the Appellant’s
                    pleaded factual allegations were true in their respective defences. Having
                    squarely met the Appellant’s pleaded case, the lack of consent of the
                    other partners was a matter which, if raised, would have taken the 3rd and 4th
                    Respondents by surprise and should therefore have been specifically pleaded in
                    any subsequent pleadings: O 18 r 8(1)(<em>b</em>)
                    Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”). However, the
                    contention that the consent of the other partners had not been obtained was
                    conspicuously absent from the Appellant’s subsequent pleadings. Moreover,
                    the Appellant never contended that the 3rd and 4th Respondents had failed to
                    obtain the consent of the other partners, even in his closing
                    submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Aside from the pleadings, the issue of the
                    alleged failure to obtain the consent of the other partners was not a live issue
                    between the parties at the trial. Neither the 3rd nor the 4th Respondent took
                    the position as against one another that they had not been admitted into the
                    partnership. Moreover, at the hearing before us, counsel for the 3rd and 4th
                    Respondents respectively confirmed that the position of their clients was that
                    although there was no express consent, there was implied consent which could be
                    inferred from their conduct <em>inter se</em> and from the
                    way in which the partnership was run.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     We are satisfied that the Appellant’s
                    attempt to raise this contention now is plainly an afterthought and to allow him
                    to do so will prejudice the 3rd and 4th Respondents. We therefore disallow the
                    attempt to raise the point at this late stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     In any case, there is no substance in the
                    Appellant’s contention having regard to the available evidence. First, as
                    we noted above at [88], his statements, which we regard as admissions (in an
                    evidentiary sense), were in definite terms that the 3rd and 4th Respondents had
                    been admitted as partners in their capacity as the personal representatives of
                    the estates of the deceased partners (namely, Toh Tong and Toh Kai). This was in
                    no way qualified or limited by any suggestion that he alone had consented to
                    their admission or that they were partners only so far as he was concerned.
                    Moreover any such qualification would have rendered untrue the Appellant’s
                    assertion (on oath) that they were partners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Finally, as regards the 4th Respondent, the
                    Appellant sought to rely on the 3rd Respondent’s evidence under
                    cross-examination to show that she had not consented to the 4th
                    Respondent’s admission as a partner. The 3rd Respondent’s evidence
                    was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Okay? Mr Chiam Toh Kai passed away in 1993. You

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     With respect, this exchange does not support
                    the Appellant’s contention. At best, the essence of the 3rd
                    Respondent’s evidence was that her formal consent in respect of the 4th
                    Respondent’s admission as a partner was never sought in a partnership
                    meeting. Indeed, she had earlier said under cross-examination that no meetings
                    of the partners of MHP were held.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> In no way does this evidence
                    negate the 3rd Respondent’s implied consent to the 4th Respondent’s
                    admission as a partner as manifested in their conduct <em>inter
                        se</em>. Pertinently, the 3rd Respondent never took the position that
                    the 4th Respondent was not a partner, even when it would clearly have been
                    advantageous for her to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Conclusion on Issue 1 in relation to 3rd and 4th Respondents </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     For these reasons, we find that the Appellant
                    did consent to the admission of the 3rd and 4th Respondents as partners of MHP
                    in their capacity as the personal representatives Toh Tong and Toh Kai
                    respectively. They were therefore partners of MHP at the time of the sale of the
                    Property. We accordingly affirm the Judge’s findings in this respect. This
                    is sufficient to dispose of the appeal insofar as the 3rd and 4th Respondents
                    are concerned. However, there remains an issue as far as the 1st and 2nd
                    Respondents are concerned and it is to this that we now turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the Respondents acquire a beneficial interest in the trust of
                Sale Proceeds even if they are not partners of MHP?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     In the alternative, the 1st and 2nd
                    Respondents argue that the Judge’s decision to dismiss the
                    Appellant’s claim ought to be affirmed on the ground that the original
                    partners had a beneficial interest in the one-tenth share of the Property that
                    was held on trust for MHP and that this devolved to their respective estates
                    upon their death. In response, the Appellant raises first, a technical objection
                    that, not having filed a cross-appeal, the 1st and 2nd Respondents are not
                    entitled to rely on O 57 r 9A(5) of the ROC to canvass this argument
                    in this appeal. The Appellant also argues that the Judge did not err in finding
                    that the original partners had no beneficial interest in the one-tenth share of
                    the Property being held on trust and that, in any event, no such beneficial
                    interest devolved to the estates of the deceased partners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    The operation of O 57 r 9A(5) was
                    considered in <em>Lim Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wei and another
                        and another appeal</em> [2010] 4 SLR 331 (“<em>Peter Lim</em>”) at [26]. Order 57 r 9A(5) provides
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A respondent who, not having appealed from the decision of the Court
                        below, desires to contend on the appeal that the decision of that Court
                        should be varied in the event of an appeal being allowed in whole or in
                        part, or that the decision of that Court should be affirmed on grounds other
                        than those relied upon by that Court, must state so in his Case, specifying
                        the grounds of that contention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In <em>Peter Lim</em>, the trial judge
                        had dismissed the plaintiff’s claim in defamation as he found that
                        – (1) although the relevant extracts were defamatory, (2) they were
                        published on an occasion of qualified privilege, and (3) there was no malice
                        defeating the qualified privilege. The respondents who had not filed a
                        cross-appeal against the first finding that the extracts <em>were</em> defamatory, sought to argue that, contrary to the trial
                        judge’s decision, the relevant extracts were not defamatory of the
                        appellant. The respondents argued that they could do so by virtue of
                        O 57 r 9A(5) as this was a new or additional ground on which they
                        contended that the trial judge’s dismissal of the appellant’s
                        claim should be affirmed. The Court of Appeal rejected this, observing that
                        the purpose of O 57 r 9A(5) was to allow a successful respondent
                        to support a decision of the court below that is in his favour by affirming
                        it on a ground that the court had not relied on. The Court of Appeal further
                        held that a “decision of the court” as contemplated by the
                        rule included a “finding of law or fact that can be varied or
                        affirmed”. On the facts before it, the Court of Appeal held that the
                        respondents were not entitled to rely on O 57 r 9A(5) because in
                        effect, they were asking the Court of Appeal to <em>reverse</em> the trial judge’s decision on this point
                        insofar as it had been held that the relevant extracts were
                        defamatory.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    In the case before us, the Judge held that
                    the deceased partners’ estates have no beneficial interest in the
                    one-tenth share of the Property. In this appeal, the 1st and 2nd Respondents are
                    seeking by their alternative argument to reverse this decision. This would seem
                    impermissible based on the approach taken in <em>Peter
                        Lim</em>. In such circumstances, they ought to have filed a
                    cross-appeal and not having done so, they are not entitled to pursue
                    this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Nevertheless, as this is a question of law,
                    and as the point was fully argued by both parties both in their written
                    submissions and in oral arguments, we make some observations on
                this.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The applicable law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    The parties do not dispute that the
                    one-tenth undivided share in the Property was partnership property as defined in
                    s 20 of the Partnership Act. The arguments revolved mostly around the
                    interpretation of various provisions of that Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    The 1st and 2nd Respondent contend that,
                    based on the proviso to s 20(1) of the Partnership Act, Toh Say had a
                    beneficial interest in the one-tenth undivided share in the Property, which
                    devolved to his estate upon his death.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Section 20(1) of the Partnership Act
                    provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Partnership
                        property</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20.—(1) All property and rights and interests in property originally
                        brought into the partnership stock or acquired, whether by purchase or
                        otherwise, on account of the firm, or for the purposes and in the course of
                        the partnership business, are called in this Act partnership property, and
                        must be held and applied by the partners exclusively for the purposes of the
                        partnership and in accordance with the partnership agreement:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Provided that the legal estate or interest in any land which belongs to
                        the partnership shall devolve according to the nature and tenure thereof,
                        and the general rules of law thereto applicable, but in trust, so far as
                        necessary, for the persons beneficially interested in the land under this
                        section.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) Where co-owners of an estate or interest in any land, not being itself
                        partnership property, are partners as to profits made by the use of that
                        land or estate, and purchase other land or estate out of the profits to be
                        used in like manner, the land or estate so purchased belongs to them, in the
                        absence of an agreement to the contrary, not as partners, but as co-owners
                        for the same respective estates and interests as are held by them in the
                        land or estate first mentioned at the date of the purchase</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Particular reliance was place on the
                    following words of the proviso: “but in trust, so far as necessary, for
                    the persons beneficially interested in the land under this section”. The
                    1st and 2nd Respondents contend on this basis that Toh Say (and, for that
                    matter, each of the partners) had a discrete equitable interest in the land
                    which was capable of passing and did pass to Toh Say’s estate when he
                    died; they also argue that s 22(1)(<em>b</em>) of the
                    Limitation Act applies, since the 1st and 2nd Respondents’ claims are for
                    trust property (or the proceeds thereof), and therefore no period of limitation
                    applies in such circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    On the other hand, the Appellant submits
                    that no beneficial interest in the one-tenth undivided share in the Property
                    devolved to Toh Say’s estate or to the 1st and 2nd Respondents upon Toh
                    Say’s death and that the 1st and 2nd Respondents never had any right to an
                        <em>in specie</em> division of the land. According to
                    the Appellant, all the 1st and 2nd Respondents had upon Toh Say’s death
                    was a right to be paid the value of his share and this was a debt pursuant to
                    s 43 of the Partnership Act, which in turn was subject to a 6-year
                    limitation period under s 6(<em>a</em>) of the
                    Limitation Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Background to the Partnership Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    It is helpful first to set out the
                    legislative background to the Partnership Act, which provides the backdrop
                    against which we consider the meaning and operation of its provisions. As
                    mentioned earlier, our Partnership Act, save for a few minor amendments, is
                    similar to the 1890 Act. The 1890 Act became part of our law through the
                    reception of English law by virtue of s 6 of the Civil Law Ordinance
                    (No IV of 1878), later replaced with s 5 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 24,
                    1955 Ed), and subsequently confirmed by the enactment of s 4(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Application of English Law Act (Act 35 of
                    1993). The Partnership Act was then updated and re-enacted in its current form
                    in 1994.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    The 1890 Act was not a complete code of
                    partnership law or a precise legislative enactment of the existing case law that
                    had developed the applicable legal and equitable principles. As Lord Lindley
                    observed, it was “not a perfect measure, nor even so good as Parliament
                    might have made it”: see <em>Lindley</em> at para
                    1-05. The 1890 Act itself provided, by s 46, that the existing rules of
                    equity and of common law would continue in force except so far as they were
                    inconsistent with the express provisions of the 1890 Act. This saving provision
                    was retained in our Partnership Act. The English Court of Appeal in <em>Robert John Hopper and another v June Lilian Hopper</em>
                    [2008] EWCA Civ 1417 (“<em>Hopper</em>”)
                    recognised at [45] that much of the statute broadly reflects the pre-existing
                    case law. We note that this is particularly the case for the provisions that
                    deal with partnership property and the interest of each partner in such
                    property: see <em>Lindley &amp; Banks on Partnership</em>
                    (Ernest H Scamell and R C I’Anson Banks eds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    15th Ed, 1984) at p 6.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    It follows that in construing the provisions
                    of the Partnership Act, it may be relevant to have regard to the principles
                    articulated in cases that predate the 1890 Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The nature of a partner’s interest in partnership
                property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    The nature of a partner’s interest in
                    partnership property has been elucidated in various decisions. Prior to the
                    enactment of the 1890 Act, Kindersley VC made several key observations in
                    relation to the nature of a partner’s interest in partnership property in
                        <em>Darby v Darby</em> (1856) 3 Drewry 495
                        (“<em>Darby</em>”), and we reproduce the
                    relevant parts below (at 503-506):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Now it appears to me that, irrespective of authority, and looking at the
                        matter with reference to principles well established in this Court, if
                        partners purchase land merely for the purpose of their trade, and pay for it
                        out of the partnership property, that transaction makes the property
                        personalty, and effects a conversion out and out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">What is the clear principle of this Court as to the law of partnership?
                            <em>It is that, on the dissolution of the
                            partnership</em>, <b><em>all the property belonging
                            to the partnership shall be sold</em></b><em>, and the
                            proceeds of the sale, after discharging all the partnership debts and
                            liabilities, shall be divided among the partners according to their
                            respective shares in the capital. </em><b><em>That is
                            the general rule; it requires no special stipulation; it is inherent in
                            the very contract of partnership</em></b>. That the rule applies to
                        all ordinary partnership property is beyond all question, and no one partner
                        has a right to insist that any particular part or item of the partnership
                        property shall remain unsold, and that he shall retain his own share of it
                        in specie. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I should therefore feel no hesitation in coming to this conclusion, that
                            <b><em>the mere contract of partnership, without any
                            express stipulation, involves in it an implied contract</em></b>,
                        quite as stringent as if it were expressed, <em>that, at the
                            dissolution of the partnership, all the property then belonging to the
                            partnership</em>, whether it be ordinary stock-in-trade, or a
                        leasehold interest, or a fee-simple estate in land, <b><em>shall be sold</em></b>, <em>and the net proceeds,
                            after satisfying all the partnership debts and liabilities, be divided
                            among the partners;</em> and that each partner, and the
                        representatives of any deceased partner, have a right to insist on this
                        being done.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Next, what is the doctrine of this Court as to conversion? ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Now <em>if it be established that, by the contract of
                            partnership, all the partnership property is to be sold at the
                            dissolution of the partnership, then any real property which has become
                            the property of the partnership becomes, by force of the partnership
                            contract, converted into personalty</em>; and that, <b><em>not merely as between the partners</em></b>, to the extent
                        of discharging the partnership debts, <b><em>but as between the
                            real and personal representatives of any deceased
                        partner</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That this is so, I should, in the absence of all authority, have decided
                        upon principle; and when I find, notwithstanding the decision of Lord
                        Thurlow, followed by Sir W. Grant, that Lord Eldon was clearly of opinion
                        that real property purchased by a partnership for the partnership purposes,
                        and with the partnership funds, becomes personalty; that Sir J. Leach
                        repeatedly so decided without any doubt; and that Sir L. Shadwell also
                        decided the last case in the same way, <em>I can have no
                            difficulty in coming to the conclusion that, whenever a partnership
                            purchase real estate for the partnership purposes, and with the
                            partnership funds</em>, <b><em>it is as between the
                            real and personal representatives of the partners personal
                            estate</em></b><em>.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Two salient points can be discerned from the
                    above passage. First, it is implied in all partnership agreements that, upon
                    dissolution, partnership property will be sold and the net proceeds, after
                    having satisfied the debts and liabilities of the partnership, will be divided
                    amongst the partners in their proportionate share. Second, as a result of the
                    equitable doctrine of conversion (which is based on the maxim that equity looks
                    upon that as done which ought to be done), partnership property which was
                    supposed to be sold at the dissolution of the partnership will be deemed as sold
                    (see <em>Snell’s Equity</em> (John McGhee QC gen ed)
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 31st Ed, 2005) at paras 6-01, 6-02 and 6-03). The
                    effect is that a partner’s interest (as well as persons claiming through
                    him in respect of his interest as a partner) in the partnership property as
                    against the other partners is no more than a proportionate share of the net
                    proceeds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Kindersley VC’s observations in
                        <em>Darby</em> were made with regard to the nature of
                    the partner’s interest in partnership property as against the other
                    partners. There is a subtle distinction in the position among the partners on
                    the one hand and between the partnership and the outside world on the other
                    hand. This was noted for instance by Hoffmann LJ (as he then was) in
                        <em>Inland Revenue Commissioners v Gray</em> [1994] STC
                    360 at 377 where he said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... <em>As between themselves</em>, partners are not
                        entitled individually to exercise proprietary rights over any of the
                        partnership assets. This is because they have subjected their proprietary
                        interests to the terms of the partnership deed which provides that the
                        assets shall be employed in the partnership business, and on dissolution
                        realised for the purposes of paying debts and distributing any surplus.
                            <em>As regards the outside world</em>, however, the
                        partnership deed is irrelevant. The partners are collectively entitled to
                        each and every asset of the partnership, in which each of them therefore has
                        an undivided share. ... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    The same distinction was drawn by
                    Luxmoore J in the earlier case of <em>In re Fuller’s
                        Contract</em> [1933] 1 Ch 652 at 656, where he explained as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My attention has been called to a statement by Romer L.J. in <em>In re Bourne</em> [[1906] 2 Ch 427 at 432–433] on
                        which reliance is placed by Mr. Lightwood in support of his argument. The
                        passage he relies upon is: “It is to be borne in mind that the real
                        interest of the partnership in real estate is of a personal character,
                        because wherever the legal estate may be, whether it is in the partners
                        jointly or in one partner or in a stranger it does not matter, the
                        beneficial interest in the real estate belongs to the partnership, with an
                        implied trust for sale for the purpose of realizing the assets and for the
                        purpose of giving to the two partners their interests when the partnership
                        is wound up and an account taken. So that no real distinction can be drawn,
                        it appears to me, between real estate held for partnership purposes and
                        personal estate.” It is said that this statement is equivalent to a
                        decision that a partner has no beneficial interest in the partnership real
                        estate that he can point to and say: “I have an interest in that
                        particular property.” I am unable to accept that view. I think Romer
                        L.J. was only pointing out that the beneficial interest in the real estate
                        belonged to the partnership, that is, to those persons who constituted the
                        partnership, and that those persons were together entitled to the
                        partnership property. Of course, <em>as between the
                            partners</em>, the partnership property must be dealt with in a
                        particular way, <em>but so far as all the rest of the world
                            is concerned</em>, there is no limitation on the interests of the
                        partners; the partners have the beneficial interest in the partnership
                        assets, which are held together as an undivided whole, but they respectively
                        have undivided interests in them. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    In the same vein, Nourse LJ in <em>Popat v Shonchhatra</em> [1997] 1 WLR 1367 at 1372 considered
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Although it is both customary and convenient to speak of a
                        partner’s “share” of the partnership assets, that is not
                        a truly accurate description of his interest in them, at all events so long
                        as the partnership is a going concern. While each partner has a proprietary
                        interest in each and every asset, he has no entitlement to any specific
                        asset and, in consequence, no right, without the consent of the other
                        partners or partner, to require the whole or even a share of any particular
                        asset to be vested in him. On dissolution the position is in substance not
                        much different, … each partner in a solvent partnership is
                        presumptively entitled to payment of what is due from the firm to him in
                        respect of capital before division of the ultimate residue in the shares in
                        which profits are divisible… It is only at that stage that a partner
                        can accurately be said to be entitled to a share of anything, which, in the
                        absence of agreement to the contrary, will be a share of cash.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    It is apparent from these cases that there
                    are two periods in the life of the partnership – first, while it is
                    continuing, and second, after a general dissolution; and there is both an
                    internal and an external perspective of the nature of a partner’s interest
                    in partnership property. During the continuation of the partnership, and as
                    against the outside world, the partners are <em>collectively</em> entitled to each and every asset of the partnership
                    in which each of them has an undivided share. However, as between themselves,
                    none of the partners are entitled <em>individually</em> to
                    assert proprietary rights over any specific part of the partnership property to
                    the exclusion of the other partners. This follows from their having subjected
                    their proprietary interests to the terms of the partnership agreement.
                    Therefore, each partner’s interest in the partnership property is in the
                    nature of an interest in their use and application for the benefit of the
                    partnership until the time of its determination. At such time, each
                    partner’s beneficial interest in the partnership property will, unless the
                    partners have agreed otherwise, take effect by the division of any surplus
                    (after the settlement of the debts and liabilities) amongst the partners in
                    their proportionate share.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    The nature of the partner’s interest
                    in the partnership property in relation to the other partners is the result of
                    the implied agreement between the partners that all partnership property
                    (including land) will be sold upon the dissolution of the partnership and which
                    equity deems to have been performed. Hence, in the absence of any agreement to
                    the contrary, the default position is that a partner’s share in the
                    partnership property as against the other partners is a proportionate share in
                    the net proceeds of sale of the partnership property after all the firm’s
                    debts and liabilities have been paid or provided for upon
                dissolution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Because of this, the traditional view in the
                    common law has been to treat the partner’s interest in the partnership
                    property as an equitable chose in action (<em>ie</em>, a
                    right enforceable by action or the right of action itself): <em>In re Bainbridge, ex parte Fletcher</em> (1878) 8 Ch D 218 at 223 and
                    225. This, however, has been the subject of conflicting judicial authority in
                    Australia. At least two Australian cases, including one from the High Court of
                    Australia, have accepted that a partner has a beneficial interest in every asset
                    of the partnership during the continuation of the partnership: see <em>Canny Gabriel Castle Jackson Advertising Pty Limited and another v
                        Volume Sales (Finance) Pty Limited</em> (1974) 131 CLR 321
                        (“<em>Canny</em>”); <em>Connell and another v Bond Corporation Pty Ltd and others</em> (1992)
                    8 WAR 352 (“<em>Connell</em>”). Subsequent
                    cases, however, appear to have taken a different position. Shortly after
                        <em>Connell</em> was decided, the same issue arose in
                        <em>Chettle v Brown</em> [1993] 2 Qd R 604. No
                    reference was made to <em>Connell</em>. Interestingly,
                    despite considering the same authorities (albeit in far briefer fashion), White
                    J held that the partners only had an interest in the distribution of the
                    proceeds of sale, and in doing so, took a different approach than was taken in
                        <em>Connell</em>. Moreover, the High Court of Australia
                    had held on several occasions after <em>Canny</em> that a
                    partner’s interest in the partnership property is an equitable chose in
                    action: see <em>Federal Commissioner of Taxation v
                        Everett</em> (1980) 143 CLR 440 at [7]–[8], [15], [21];
                        <em>United Builders Pty Ltd and another v Mutual Acceptance
                        Ltd</em> (1980) 144 CLR 673 at 687–688; <em>Commissioner of State Taxation of the State of South Australia v Cyril
                        Henschke Pty Ltd and others</em> (2010) 242 CLR 508 at [25],
                    [27]–[28]. It seems to us that neither <em>Connell</em> nor <em>Canny</em> concerns the
                    nature of the partner’s interest in the partnership property as against
                    other partners. Indeed, Malcolm CJ accepted in <em>Connell</em> at 374 that, even though a partner may have a
                    proprietary interest which constitutes a “caveatable interest in the
                    land”, he has no specific title to any individual asset and has no right
                    to require that any particular asset be transferred to him. For present
                    purposes, we do not need to decide if the position in <em>Connell</em> and <em>Canny</em>, on their
                    particular facts, is correct. What is pertinent, however, is that they do not
                    support the conclusion that a partner (or his personal representatives) can
                    demand as against the other partners that any particular partnership asset (or a
                    share thereof) be transferred to him (or his personal representatives). This of
                    course cuts against the position of the 1st and 2nd Respondents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Mr Moey further submitted that the
                    doctrine of non-survivorship between partners applies in respect of the
                    partners’ beneficial interests in the partnership property and that there
                    is therefore a strong presumption against partnership property accruing to the
                    surviving partner(s) beneficially (see generally <em>John
                        Frederick Bathurst (as Administrator of the estate of Michael David Bathurst
                        deceased) v Philip Charles Scarborow</em> [2004] EWCA Civ 411). In the
                    absence of an agreement to the contrary, we agree that the doctrine of
                    non-survivorship applies. However, we do not think this can change the <em>nature</em> of the partners’ beneficial interest in the
                    partnership property as against the other partners which, as we have already
                    explained above, is not an entitlement to specific property or any part thereof
                    that is capable of devolving upon the deceased partner’s estate or his
                    personal representatives upon his death, unless by way of special agreement.
                    Rather, it is a right to a share of the surplus after the partnership property
                    has been realised and the liabilities met.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   The proviso to s 20(1) of the Partnership Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    In the light of this discussion, we turn to
                    consider the meaning and operation of s 20(1) of the Partnership Act.
                    Section 20(1) is generally concerned with the definition of partnership
                    property as any property that is bought into the partnership or acquired by it
                    and it goes on to provide that such property must be held and applied
                    exclusively for the purposes of the partnership.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    A partnership, not being a separate legal
                    entity, cannot hold in its name the legal title to partnership land, and such
                    legal title would therefore have to vest in the names of one or more of the
                    partners (or any other person(s) as the partners deem fit). In keeping with
                    this, the proviso to s 20(1) of the Partnership Act (which, but for the absence
                    of a reference to Scots Law, is <em>in pari materia</em>
                    with s 20(2) of the 1890 Act) provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Provided that the legal estate or interest in any land which belongs to
                        the partnership shall devolve according to the nature and tenure thereof,
                        and the general rules of law thereto applicable, <em>but in
                            trust, so far as necessary, for the persons beneficially interested in
                            the land under this section</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    One of the effects of the proviso is that
                    the <em>legal</em> title to partnership land devolves
                    according to the normal law affecting real property (statutory or otherwise):
                    see Keith L Fletcher, <em>The Law of Partnership in
                        Australia</em> (Lawbook Co, 9th Ed, 2007) at para 5.25 and Geoffrey
                    Morse, <em>Partnership Law</em> (Oxford University Press,
                    7th Ed, 2010) (“<em>Morse</em>”) at para
                    6.11.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    But what of the <em>beneficial</em> interest? It is clear that the trustees hold
                    partnership land on behalf of the persons who are beneficially interested in it.
                    However, this does not mean that an outgoing partner is entitled to assert a
                    proprietary interest in the partnership land <em>in
                        specie</em> or that a proportionate share of specific partnership land
                    is held on trust for the estate of the deceased partner. We have already noted
                    above that the partners’ beneficial interest in the partnership property
                    as against the other partners is not an interest <em>in
                        specie</em> but an interest in the net proceeds of sale of the
                    partnership assets upon dissolution (unless, of course, the partners have agreed
                    otherwise). This is equally true of partnership land. The phrase “for
                    persons beneficially interested in the land under this section” must
                    therefore to be understood in the light of the nature of a partner’s
                    interest in partnership property as explained at [111]-[117] above. Hence, if a
                    partner holding partnership land on trust for the partnership dies, then the
                    legal interest in that property shall devolve according to the general rules of
                    law, but those to whom the property so devolves shall continue to hold the
                    property on a trust for those beneficially interested in the land <em>as a partnership asset</em>. In short, the section does not
                    alter the <em>nature</em> of the interest that the partners
                    (including the estate of any deceased partner) have, which is as we have set out
                    above. It follows from this that the proviso does not assist the 1st and 2nd
                    Respondents. The legal interest passes to the 1st and 2nd Respondents but
                    subject to the trust in favour of those beneficially interested in it, namely,
                    the partners, <em>all</em> of whom in light of s 22 of
                    the Partnership Act, continue to have a proportionate interest in the surplus of
                    the sale proceeds after accounting for the debts and liabilities of the
                    partnership, but <em>none</em> of whom have a specific and
                    exclusive interest in any specific part of the partnership assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Section 22 of the Partnership Act </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    The Judge below considered the relationship
                    between the proviso to s 20(1) and s 22 of the Partnership Act.
                    Section 22 of the Partnership Act states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where land or any interest therein has become partnership property, it
                        shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be treated as between the
                        partners (including the representatives of a deceased partner), and also as
                        between the heirs of a deceased partner and his executors or administrators,
                        as personal or movable and not real estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Section 22 of the Partnership Act is
                    essentially a codification of the equitable doctrine of conversion. As explained
                    earlier, land that belongs to a partnership (in common with the rest of the
                    partnership property) is held upon an implied trust for sale (unless the
                    partners agree otherwise); equity, looking upon that as done which ought to be
                    done, treats the partners’ interests as being in the proceeds of sale,
                        <em>ie</em>, personalty: see <em>Attorney-General v Hubbuck and others</em> (1884) 13 QBD 275 at 289.
                    Thus, as Lord Lindley explained (<em>Lindley</em> at para
                    19-14):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">From the principle that a share of a partner is nothing more than his
                        proportion of the partnership assets after they have been turned into money
                        and applied in liquidation of the partnership debts, <em>it
                            necessarily follows that, in equity, a share in a partnership, whether
                            its property consists of land or not, must, as between the real and
                            personal representatives of a deceased partner, be deemed to be his
                            personal and not real estate</em>, unless indeed such conversion
                        is inconsistent with the agreement between the parties. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    Sir Frederick Pollock, the draftsman of the
                    1890 Act commented in his work, <em>A Digest of the Law of
                        Partnership, incorporating the Partnership Act 1890</em> (Stevens
                    &amp; Sons Limited, 5th Ed, 1890) (“<em>Pollock’s
                        Digest</em>”) on the meaning and operation of s 22 of the 1890
                    Act (which is <em>in pari materia</em> with s 22 of our
                    Partnership Act) in similar terms (at p 66):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The share of a partner in the partnership property at any given time may
                        be defined as the proportion of the then existing partnership assets to
                        which he would be entitled if the whole were realized and converted into
                        money, and after all the then existing debts and liabilities of the firm had
                        been discharged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    He considered the meaning of the words
                    “unless the contrary intention appears” as follows (at p
                    65):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… partners may at any time by agreement between themselves convert
                        partnership property into the several property of any one or more of the
                        partners, or the several property of any partner into partnership property.
                        And such conversion, if made in good faith, is effectual not only as between
                        the partners, but as against the creditors of the firm and of the several
                        partners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Section 22 of the 1890 Act has since largely
                    been overtaken by statutory developments in England. However, similar
                    developments have not occurred in Singapore – the doctrine of conversion
                    survives here (see generally <em>Foo Jee Seng and others v Foo
                        Jhee Tuang and another</em> [2012] 4 SLR 339 at [29]) and s 22 of
                    the Partnership Act remains in force. Mr Moey drew our attention to
                    s 35(1) of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap 61, 1994 Rev Ed),
                    which provides that land shall devolve as “chattels real” upon
                    death; but the position on partnership land is governed by the relevant
                    provisions in the Partnership Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    The Judge held that, because partnership
                    land is deemed the personal rather than real property of the partners pursuant
                    to s 22 of the Partnership Act, a deceased partner’s estate cannot be
                    said to have been “beneficially interested in the land” as set out
                    in the proviso to s 20(1) of the Partnership Act. If this were right, it
                    would render the proviso to s 20(1) otiose; but the Judge thought that such
                    a conclusion could be avoided on the basis that the proviso would continue to be
                    relevant in situations where the parties contract out of ss 22 and 43 of
                    the Partnership Act and agree that the surviving partners are to hold the
                    deceased partner’s share on trust for his estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    With respect, we disagree. If the deceased
                    partner’s estate acquires a specific beneficial interest in land that
                    belongs to the partnership by virtue of an express provision in the partnership
                    agreement, then the surviving partners would hold the deceased partner’s
                    share on trust for his estate by virtue of and in order to give effect to the
                    agreement and not because of the proviso to s 20(1) of the Partnership Act.
                    Indeed, on the Judge’s reading of the effect of s 22, the proviso to
                    s 20(1) of the Partnership Act would be rendered superfluous.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    Section 22 provides that where land or any
                    interest in land is partnership property, it is treated <em>as
                        between the partners</em> as if it had been converted into money
                        (<em>ie</em>, the sale proceeds). As we have observed
                    above, this is a reflection of the equitable doctrine of conversion which
                    operates on the implied trust for sale. This is true as between the partners and
                    s 22 makes it clear that this is also the position with respect to the
                    personal representatives of a deceased partner. Section 20(1), as we have
                    noted above, deals with the meaning of “partnership property”
                    generally; and the proviso deals with the specific matter of interests in any
                    land that belongs to the partnership. Because the partnership lacks legal
                    personality, it cannot hold land in its own name. Hence, the legal title to
                    partnership land will vest in a trustee. Upon the trustee’s death, the
                    proviso sets out how the <em>legal</em> title will pass
                    without affecting the beneficial interests of the partnership in such land. It
                    therefore follows, as we have already noted above at [123], that those to whom
                    the land devolves continue to be bound by the trust for sale in favour of the
                    partners. Hence, the proviso to s 20(1) is entirely consistent with the
                    substantive position reflected in s 22. Our departure with the position
                    taken by the Judge is that, in our judgment, the proviso to s 20(1) is
                    designed to preserve the beneficial interest of the partnership in the land, but
                    this does not alter the <em>nature</em> of the interest,
                    which as we have noted above, as between the partners, is in the net proceeds
                    after sale upon the dissolution of the partnership (unless the partners have
                    agreed otherwise).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(5)   Section 43 of the Partnership Act </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    We turn finally to s 43 of the
                    Partnership Act, which provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to any agreement between the partners, the amount due from
                        surviving or continuing partners to an outgoing partner or the
                        representatives of a deceased partner in respect of the outgoing or deceased
                        partner’s share <em>is a debt accruing at the date of
                            the dissolution or death</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    In our judgment, this provision must be
                    understood in the light of the nature of a partner’s interest in
                    partnership property. In the analysis that follows, we refer to the rights of
                    the deceased partner’s personal representative in relation to the
                    surviving partners since these are the facts of the present case, but the same
                    analysis would apply as between an outgoing partner and the other
                    partners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    It follows from our analysis at [111]-[117]
                    above, that in the event of a <em>general</em> dissolution,
                    the right of deceased partner’s personal representative consists in
                    “having an account of the property, of its collection and application,
                    and in receiving that portion of the clear balance that accrues to the
                    deceased’s share and interest in the partnership”: see <em>Brownlow William Knox v Frederick Gye</em> (1871-1872) LR 5
                    HL 656 (“<em>Knox v Gye</em>”) at 675. Unless
                    modified by an agreement to the contrary, the deceased partner’s personal
                    representative therefore has the power to bring an action against the surviving
                    partners to have the partnership wound up, with a view to realizing the
                    partnership assets by a sale and for final accounts to be taken between the
                    partners: see <em>Lindley</em> at para 26-02; <em>Morse</em> at paras 7.36 and 7.60. This is reflected in
                    s 39 of the Partnership Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    It follows that where this is the nature of
                    the action being brought by the personal representatives of a deceased partner,
                    it cannot properly be said to be one by a beneficiary under a trust to recover
                    trust property (or the proceeds thereof) from the trustee. This was recognised
                    by Lord Westbury in <em>Knox v Gye</em> as follows (at
                    675–676):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Another source of error in the matter is the looseness with which the word
                        “trustee” is frequently used. The surviving partner is often
                        called a “trustee” but the term is used inaccurately. He is
                        not a trustee, either expressly or by implication. On the death of a partner
                        the law confers on his representatives certain rights as against the
                        surviving partner, and imposes upon the latter correspondent obligations.
                            <em>The surviving partner may be called, so far as these
                            obligations extend, a trustee for the deceased partner; but when these
                            obligations have been fulfilled, or are discharged, or terminate by law,
                            the supposed trust is at an end</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the surviving partner may be called a trustee for the dead man,
                            <em>but the trust is limited to the discharge of the
                            obligation, which is liable to be barred by lapse of time</em>; as
                        between the express trustee and the <em>cestui que
                            trust</em> time will not run; but the surviving partner is not a
                        trustee in the full and proper sense of the word. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    In our judgment, this is consistent with the
                    foregoing analysis which has led us to conclude that partnership property is, by
                    default, subject to a trust for sale to realise the partnership assets and
                    distribute the net proceeds to the partners in their respective shares upon a
                        <em>general</em> dissolution of the partnership. Such
                    an obligation, for which an action to enforce is available, would nonetheless be
                    liable to be barred by the lapse of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    Where there is a <em>technical</em> dissolution of the partnership, <em>ie</em>, where the partnership business remains intact and is carried
                    on by the remaining partners notwithstanding the death or departure of one
                    partner, while the deceased partner’s personal representatives have a
                    right to have the value of the deceased partner’s share ascertained and
                    paid out by the surviving partners, just how this is to be brought about will
                    depend on, among other things, whether the agreement between the partners
                    provides for this. If it does, then the deceased partner’s share is
                    properly regarded as a debt with effect from the date on which he ceased to be a
                    partner; in other words, his personal representative’s rights are only
                    those of an unsecured creditor for the amount: see <em>Lindley</em> at para 19-10 and <em>Sobell v Boston and
                        others</em> [1975] 1 WLR 1587 at 1590–1591. In the absence of
                    any such express provision, the deceased partner’s personal representative
                    could first offer to sell the deceased partner’s share to the surviving
                    partner(s), or failing that, the representative may be left with no alternative
                    but to bring an action to wind up the partnership in the usual way: see
                        <em>Lindley</em> at para 26-04.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    It is settled law that s 43 of the
                    Partnership Act will apply where a <em>technical</em>
                    dissolution occurs and the amount found to be owing to the deceased
                    partner’s personal representatives will then be regarded as a debt to
                    which the normal periods of limitation apply, <em>ie</em>,
                    six years pursuant to s 6(1)(<em>a</em>) of the
                    Limitation Act. There has, however, been some doubt as to whether the provision
                    applies in a <em>general</em> dissolution. The difficulty
                    has been explained as follows (<em>Lindley</em> at para
                    26-03):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the share is indeed converted into debt on such a dissolution
                            [<em>ie</em>, a general dissolution], it is a debt
                        of a most unusual nature, since the estate is clearly entitled to a full
                        share of any increase in the value of the partnership assets accruing in the
                        period between the date of death and the date of realisation and,
                        conversely, must bear a full share of any diminution in value during that
                        period. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The point here is pertinent to a general dissolution rather
                        than a technical dissolution because the concern relates to changes in the
                        value of the assets that arise not out of the continuance of the business
                        (indeed there will be no such continuance in a general dissolution) but out
                        of fluctuations in the conditions affecting the realisation of the assets.
                        The current edition of <em>Lindley</em> therefore takes
                        the view that s 43 of the Partnership Act does not apply in a <em>general</em> dissolution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    Nevertheless, this difficulty does not
                    appear to be insurmountable. In <em>Duncan and another v The MFV
                        Marigold PD145</em> [2006] SLT 975 (“<em>Duncan</em>”) the Outer House of the Scottish Court of Session
                    came to a different conclusion following an examination of the backdrop to
                    s 43 of the Partnership Act. Lord Reed first considered (at [52]) the
                    discussion of s 43 in <em>Pollock’s Digest</em>
                    (at pp 121–122) which states as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A surviving partner has sometimes been said to be a trustee for the
                        deceased partner’s representatives in respect of his interest in the
                        partnership; but this is a metaphorical and inaccurate expression. The claim
                        of the representatives against the surviving partner is in the nature of a
                        contract debt and is subject to the Statute of Limitations, which runs from
                        the deceased partner’s death. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    Lord Reed observed that s 43 of the
                    Partnership Act was intended to give effect to the decision in <em>Knox v Gye</em>, the relevant passages of which we have
                    reproduced and considered at [135] above. He therefore concluded as follows (at
                    [52]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The intended significance of the use of the word “debt” in s
                        43, appears to have been to make it clear that the surviving partners were
                        not trustees for the deceased partner’s representatives in respect of
                        his interest in the partnership, and that the claim of the representatives
                        against the surviving partners was therefore subject to the statute of
                        limitations. …
                        <em>Interpreted as a provision concerned primarily with
                            prescription and limitation, and with the related question whether the
                            surviving partners should be regarded as trustees, s 43 can be
                            understood as applicable to all dissolutions</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    We agree with and adopt this analysis in
                        <em>Duncan</em>. The difficulty expressed in <em>Lindley</em> (see [138] above) appears to arise as a result
                    of reading the word “debt” in its <em>descriptive</em> sense (namely that the partner’s share is a
                    fixed sum of money due and owing upon death or dissolution, and thus, not
                    capable of encompassing any fluctuation in the value of the assets thereafter).
                    On this basis, he argues that it would be a “debt of a most unusual
                    nature” (see [138] above). But in our judgment, the effect of s 43
                    is that the amount due from the surviving or continuing partners to an outgoing
                    partner or to the representatives of a deceased partner in respect of such
                    partner’s share is to be treated as a debt that has accrued on the date of
                    the dissolution or death even though the outgoing or deceased partner’s
                    share may not, at that point in time, be a sum of money that has been
                    ascertained. This appears to have been the conclusion reached in <em>Duncan</em> at [63] and we see no reason to reach a different
                    conclusion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Application to the facts </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    We turn to consider the application of the
                    law to the relevant facts of the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The Trust Deed </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    The 1st and 2nd Respondents argue that the
                    Trust Deed conferred upon the original partners a beneficial interest in the
                    one-tenth share of the Property which devolved to them upon Toh Say’s
                    death. The salient terms of the Trust Deed have been set out at [7] above. The
                    dispute below centred on the interpretation of the phrase, “in trust for
                    the firm and the partners for the time being thereof”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    With respect, we think that the
                    parties’ contentions failed to address the logically anterior issue
                    – namely, what is the nature of the interest in the Property that was
                    created by the Trust Deed? In particular, did the Trust Deed confer discrete
                    proprietary rights and interests in respect of specific assets on each of the
                    partners to begin with? In our judgment, the answer to this is no. The recital
                    to the Trust Deed expressly refers to the one-tenth undivided share of the
                    Property as “belonging in equity to the partnership business”. The
                    Trust Deed <em>in effect</em> makes it clear that although
                    the legal interest was held in Toh Say’s name, he held it on a trust for
                    sale for the benefit of the partnership.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    In our judgment, the beneficial interest
                    that vested in the partners was limited to an entitlement to enforce a sale and
                    division of the proceeds that would take effect upon the dissolution of the
                    partnership. The Trust Deed never purported to vest a specific portion of the
                    land in any of the partners on term that allowed them to use it or to realise it
                    for their own benefit to the exclusion of the other partners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    In short, the words “in trust for the
                    firm and the partners for the time being thereof” must be interpreted in
                    a manner that is consistent with the settlor’s clear and unambiguous
                    intention that the one-tenth undivided share in the Property would be held by
                    him as partnership property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The 1st and 2nd Respondents’ rights upon the demise of
                Toh Say</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    The question that then arises is whether
                    there was any agreement or provision in the Partnership Deed that confers upon
                    an outgoing partner or his personal representative (where he has died) a right
                    to an <em>in specie</em> division of the partnership
                    assets? In our judgment, no such agreement or provision in the Partnership Deed
                    exists. On the contrary, cl 21 of the Partnership Deed provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Upon the determination of the partnership by effluxion of time or by any
                        other event not herein otherwise provided for a full and general account
                        shall be taken of the assets credits debts and liabilities of the
                        partnership and of the transactions and dealings thereof and … such
                        assets and credits shall be sold realised and got in and the proceeds
                        applied in paying discharging such debts and liabilities … and the
                        balance (if any) of such proceeds shall be divided between the partners in
                        the shares in which they are entitled to…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>This reflects the conventional position that a partner’s
                        share is represented by his proportionate share in the net proceeds
                        remaining after all the partnership assets have been sold and the
                        partnership debts and liabilities paid and discharged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    It is true cl 3 of the Partnership Deed
                    provides for the continuance of the partnership business upon the death and
                    retirement of any partner. But this is as between the remaining partners. Hence,
                    the net effect of these provisions is that a technical dissolution took place
                    upon Toh Say’s demise and his personal representatives (being the 1st and
                    2nd Respondents) had the right to have the value of Toh Say’s share
                    ascertained and paid pursuant to cl 21 of the Partnership Deed as well as
                    s 43 of the Partnership Act. This is insufficient for the 1st and 2nd
                    Respondents because such a claim (<em>ie</em>, in debt)
                    would have been time-barred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    To overcome this, the 1st and 2nd
                    Respondents’ next line of argument is that the Limitation Act has no
                    application because no account was ever rendered to them following the death of
                    Toh Say and the surviving partners instead carried on a new partnership. They
                    rely on the decision in <em>Betjemann v Betjemann</em>
                    [1895] 2 Ch 474 (“<em>Betjemann</em>”) in
                    support of this. There a father and his two sons had carried on the business as
                    partners from 1856 to 1886; the father died in 1886 but the sons continued the
                    business until 1893 when one of the sons died. The deceased son’s executor
                    brought an action against the surviving partner for an account of the
                    partnership dealings from 1886. The surviving partner claimed that the accounts
                    of the old partnership should be taken from 1856. The court found that the
                    surviving son was entitled to an order for the accounts to be taken against the
                    deceased son’s executor with effect from 1856, on the basis that the
                    accounts of the original firm had been carried on into the new firm without
                    interruption or settlement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    In our judgment, the principle enunciated in
                        <em>Betjemann</em> is not as broad the 1st and 2nd
                    Respondents contend. Sonia Proudman QC (sitting as a deputy High Court judge) in
                        <em>Mehra v Shah and others</em> [2003] All ER (D) 15
                    (Aug) (decision upheld on appeal; see <em>Mehra v Shah and
                        others</em> [2004] EWCA Civ 632) observed at [76] that the principle
                    that continuing the partnership business prevents time running applies only as
                    between the continuing or surviving partners who carry on the partnership
                    business. This is apparent from the very passage in <em>Betjemann</em> (at 478) that was cited by the 4th Respondent:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">They continued the partnership account as one account and never wound it
                        up; they brought in all the balances, carried on the balances at the
                        bankers, carried on the ledgers, and carried on the account without a break.
                            <em>Now as between persons who deal with each other upon
                            that footing, I fail to see that the Statute of Limitations has any
                            application whatever</em>. Notwithstanding, therefore, that the
                        partnership was determined between the three and that there was a new
                        partnership account between the two, there was no break in the account, and
                        the account was never brought to an end. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    
          <em>Betjemann</em> thus
                    stands only for the limited proposition that the event of a technical
                    dissolution following the death of one partner does not start time running as
                    between the surviving partners who can rather seek an account from the inception
                    of the earlier partnership if there was no break in the partnership account and
                    the earlier partnership account was never settled. Save in that exceptional
                    factual situation, which does not avail here, the settled law is as promulgated
                    in <em>Knox v Gye</em>, namely that a limitation defence
                    will be available and effective as between the continuing or surviving partners
                    on the one hand and the outgoing partner or his estate on the other, regardless
                    of whether the accounts are rendered or have been settled.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    Finally, the 1st and 2nd Respondents contend
                    that s 6 of the Limitation Act does not apply as they were not the ones
                    trying to bring a claim in the present case (being the defendants). In our
                    judgment, this argument wholly misses the point, which is that any claim that
                    the 1st and 2nd Respondents might have had to the share of the Sale Proceeds has
                    now become time-barred.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   The effect of S 2439/1993 </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    In closing, we make one further observation.
                    The rights of the 1st and 2nd Respondents are foreclosed for another reason as
                    well, which is that they did in fact exercise their rights under cl 21 of
                    the Partnership Deed and s 43 of the Partnership Act as personal
                    representatives of Toh Say when they commenced S 2439/1993. The 1st and 2nd
                    Respondents sought the following relief in those proceedings:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_153-p2_a"></a>(a)     An account of Toh Say’s share
                        in the profits of MHP for the years 1987 to 1989 inclusive and for the
                        period 1 January 1990 to 16 February 1990 (the date of Toh Say’s
                        death) and payment of the sum found due on the taking of this
                        account.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_153-p2_b"></a>(b)     Payment at their option of the sum found due under either (i) an account of
                        Toh Say’s share of the profits of MHP from 17 February 1990; or (ii)
                        an account of interest at 8% per annum on Toh Say’s share in the
                        capital of MHP from 17 February 1990.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_153-p2_c"></a>(c)     An account of the value of Toh Say’s share in MHP
                        at 16<sup></sup>February 1990, <em>ie</em>, the date of
                        his death, and payment of the sum found to be due on taking the
                        account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    The relief sought by the 1st and 2nd
                    Respondents reflect the position of personal representative(s) seeking to have
                    the partnership property realised and to receive the portion of the assets that
                    accrues to the deceased’s share and interest in the partnership. The
                    various orders made in those proceedings have already been set out in some
                    detail above (at [20]–[21]). To summarise, an unless order was made
                    against the Appellant which he did not comply with. As a result, his defence was
                    struck out and judgment was entered against him with costs on 22 March 1996. The
                    solicitor acting for the 1st and 2nd Respondents’ at that time extracted
                    the said judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    The legal consequences that flow from this
                    are significant. Having sought and obtained judgment, the causes of action
                    contained in S 2439/1993 merged in the judgment. As a result, the rights to
                    the relief set out in the statement of claim were extinguished and replaced with
                    the right to enforce the judgment. Such a right is in turn subject to a
                    limitation period of 12 years: see s 6(3) of the Limitation Act. In the present
                    case, this period of 12 years has lapsed and the 1st and 2nd Respondents are
                    therefore barred from bringing an action on the judgment in
                    S 2439/1993.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    At the hearing before us, Mr Moey conceded
                    that the 1st and 2nd Respondents had not taken any steps to enforce the
                    judgment. However, he also contended that there was nothing the 1st and 2nd
                    Respondents could do if the Appellant was adamant about not producing the
                    accounts. With respect, we disagree. As we mentioned at the hearing, the 1st and
                    2nd Respondents could have sought an assessment or as a last resort, even
                    committal of the Appellant. We do note however, that Mr Moey was not the 1st and
                    2nd Respondents’ solicitor then and did not have conduct of the matter; as
                    such, he was not in a position to explain why no further steps were
                    taken.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion on Issue 2 </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    For these reasons, we find that Toh Say
                    (and, for that matter, the other original partners of the partnership) never
                    obtained a beneficial interest in the one-tenth undivided share of the Property
                    that was capable of passing to their estates and/or their personal
                    representatives. Any rights that the 1st and 2nd Respondents had in respect of
                    Toh Say’s share as against the other partners of MHP was a claim in debt
                    that is now time-barred; and in any event has been merged into the judgment
                    obtained in S 2439/1993 and their right to enforce that judgment has since
                    become barred because of the passage of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties’ respective shares </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    At the hearing, we asked Mr Lee to address
                    us on the effect that a finding that the 1st and 2nd Respondents were not
                    partners would have on the shares of the other parties. Mr Lee argued that the
                    3rd and 4th Respondents were bound by the result in OS 136/2002 which clarified
                    their respective shares in the partnership (see [25] above). We understood Mr
                    Lee in effect to contend that as it was held there that the 3rd and 4th
                    Respondents had respectively a 21/88 and 19/88 share, any extinguishment of the
                    1st and 2nd Respondent’s share should enure to the benefit of the
                    Appellant alone. We do not accept this argument. We do not think that the 3rd
                    and 4th Respondents can be bound by proceedings that they commenced nearly 20
                    years ago based on certain facts which are different to what is known today.
                    Most significantly, they did not know at that time whether Toh Say’s
                    estate did or did not have any claim to the assets of the
                partnership.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    The Judge found in relation to Toh
                    Lew’s share that it was not extinguished by the consent judgment in DC
                    6648/1984, but was to be proportionately redistributed to the partners of MHP
                    based on their respective shares in MHP. In our judgment, this is incorrect. As
                    analysed above, the nature of the partner’s share is an interest in the
                    proportionate share in the net proceeds of sale of the partnership property. If
                    this interest cannot be enforced for some reason, including by the passage of
                    time, the result will be to extinguish the said share, thus reducing the total
                    number of “shares” in the partnership. Hence, Toh Say’s
                    share in the partnership as well as Toh Lew’s share should be treated as
                    extinguished.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    On this basis, we hold that the
                    parties’ respective shares in MHP is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_160-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Appellant:
                    21/61</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_160-p2_b"></a>(b)     The 3rd
                        Respondent: 21/61</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_160-p2_c"></a>(c)     The 4th Respondent: 19/61</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    In the premises, we allow the appeal in
                    part. The Judge’s decision below that the 1st and 2nd Respondents are
                    partners of MHP is reversed. However, we affirm his decision that the 3rd and
                    4th Respondents are partners of MHP.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    The 3rd and 4th Respondents are to have
                    their costs of the appeal against the Appellant. The Appellant will have half
                    his costs of the appeal as against the 1st and 2nd Respondents on the basis that
                    he cannot recover his costs that are attributable to the appeal insofar as these
                    pertain to the position of the 3rd and 4th Respondents. These costs are to be
                    taxed if not agreed with the usual consequential orders.</p>
