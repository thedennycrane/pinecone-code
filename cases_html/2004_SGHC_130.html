<p class="Judg-Author" style="MARGIN: 10pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Choo Han Teck J:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">1<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> This suit was filed by the liquidators of the plaintiff, Lion City Holdings Pte Ltd, against three of its former directors. The writ when filed on 18 April 2002 was filed as a generally endorsed writ. No statement of claim was filed until 18 May 2004. The endorsement on the writ merely stated as follows:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">The Plaintiff’s claims are as follows:-</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" style="MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt 1in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(a)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Claim against the Defendants for breaches of fiduciary duties owed to the Plaintiff;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" style="MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt 1in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(b)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> An account of all profits made by Defendants as a result of the breaches of fiduciary duty;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" style="MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt 1in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(c)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Damages to be assessed against the Defendants;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" style="MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt 1in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(d)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Costs; and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" style="MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt 1in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(e)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> Such further relief as this Honourable Court may deem fit.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">2<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The plaintiff applied to amend the writ to include a claim based on a breach of the duties of care. The application was allowed by the assistant registrar and consequently the plaintiff filed its statement of claim on 18 May 2004. The defendants appealed against the order granting leave to the plaintiff to amend the writ because by the amendment the plaintiff was able to present a claim that would otherwise be time barred. This was not disputed but the plaintiff’s contention was that the cause of action based on the breach of a duty of care arose from the same or substantially the same facts.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">3<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> It will be useful to set out the context for a better understanding of the issue in dispute in these appeals. The courts will not normally allow a claim to be amended if the amendment produces a new cause of action that would have been defeated by a limitation defence. This is encapsulated in a passage in the judgment of Lord Esher in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Weldon v Neal</i> (1887) 19 QBD 394 at 395:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">We must act on the settled rule of practice, which is that amendments are not admissible when they prejudice the rights of the opposite party as existing at the date of such amendments. If an amendment were allowed setting up a cause of action, which, if the writ were issued in respect thereof at the date of the amendment, would be barred by the Statute of Limitations, it would be allowing the plaintiff to take advantage of her former writ to defeat the statute and taking away an existing right from the defendant, a proceeding which, as a general rule, would be, in my opinion, improper and unjust. Under very peculiar circumstances the Court might perhaps have power to allow such an amendment, but certainly as a general rule it will not do so.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">L P Thean JA in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Chan Mui Eng v Chua Chu Huwe</i> <nobr>[1994] 1 SLR 375</nobr> concurred with the even stronger view of Scrutton LJ in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Mabro v Eagle, Star and British Dominions Insurance Company, Limited</i> <nobr>[1932] 1 KB 485</nobr> at 487 where Scrutton LJ held:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">In my experience the Court has always refused to allow a party or a cause of action to be added where, if it were allowed, the defence of the Statute of Limitations would be defeated. The Court has never treated it as just to deprive a defendant of a legal defence.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">The way O 20 was to be applied was considered by the Court of Appeal in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Lim Yong Swan v Lim Jee Tee</i> <nobr>[1993] 1 SLR 500</nobr>. Noting the intention to depart from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Weldon v Neal</i>, the court held at 506, [19]:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">For an application to come within any of the paragraphs, there must already be asserted in the writ or the pleading a set of allegations which, in spite of the expiry of the limitation period, reasonably identify the party suing or sued, which is capable of conveying the capacity of the party to sue or which permits the addition or substitution of another cause of action. In other words, the matters of identity, capacity or cause of action are already asserted or implied, from the inception of the writ or the filing of the pleading and it is merely a matter of correction to make explicit what is implicit.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">Further on at 508, [28], the court summarised the purport and application of O 20 r 5 as follows:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1" style="MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">A party seeking to amend under O 20 r 5(5) must therefore show:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" style="MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt 1in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(a)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> that the new cause of action arises out of the same or substantially the same facts as a cause of action in respect of which relief has already been claimed in the action, and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2" style="MARGIN: 8pt 0.5in 0pt 1in" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">(b)<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">       </span> if the court thinks it is just to grant leave to make the amendment.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">5<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> The above two conditions were clearly meant to be read conjunctively otherwise the first condition would be limp as it would be subsumed under the word “just” in the second condition. As to the first condition the court approved the test in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Steamship Mutual Underwriting Association Ltd v Trollope &amp; Colls (City) Ltd</i> (1986) 33 BLR 77, that is to say, “whether there is a sufficient overlap between the facts supporting the existing claim and those supporting the new claim” (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">per</i> Yong Pung How CJ at 508, [29]).</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1" style="MARGIN: 16pt 0in 0pt" xmlns=""><span lang="EN-GB">6<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">         </span> Reverting to the present appeals before me, I find that I am unable to apply the first condition because there were no facts upon which I can determine whether there was an “overlap” between those facts and those in which the new cause of action was intended to be pleaded. A generally endorsed writ without a statement of claim provided insufficient material to work with. The claim for breach of fiduciary duty is an allegation, not a statement of fact. Furthermore, the plaintiff has not convinced me that even the second condition could be satisfied. The writ was filed, on its admission, merely as a “protective writ” in 2002. That is to say that at that time the plaintiff had not made up its mind whether it ought to pursue its claim in court. The position remained unchanged for two years when the writ was renewed three times. As counsel for the defendants pointed out, it was only four years after the plaintiff company was wound up (24 March 2000) and two years after the bare writ was filed, that the plaintiff decided to pursue its action against the defendants. I am of the view that the plaintiff had taken too long to decide on the present course of action. In such circumstances, I do not think that it would be right to allow the amendment and deprive the defendants of a limitation defence.</span></p>
