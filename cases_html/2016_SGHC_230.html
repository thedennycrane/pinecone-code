Given that TGN was a Singapore-incorporated company, the dispute thus centred on the ownership of <span class="font-italic">Singapore</span> <span class="font-italic">assets</span>. Further, as the Plaintiff pointed out, the events surrounding the incorporation of TGN (for example, instructing Corporate Finedge, determining the share allocation and directorship of TGN) took place entirely in Singapore. These were therefore factors which connected the dispute to Singapore.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 On the other hand, it was clear that the occasion for the incorporation of TGN arose because of the parties’ business dealings <span class="font-italic">in Indonesia</span>. It was undisputed that the legal transfer of the PTPG and PTSA shares to the 1st Defendant took place pursuant to the parties’ partnership in resolving the problems PTPG and PTSA faced in Indonesia. TGN was merely a special purpose vehicle set up to hold the PTPG and PTSA shares. Based on the affidavit evidence before me, it appeared that Singapore was chosen as the place of incorporation to minimise cost – it was not chosen because parties had any joint business dealings in, or any business connections to, Singapore.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In addition, TGN had no business activities of its own. The parties’ substantive business dealings related entirely to assets and events in Indonesia. Indeed, it was noteworthy that TGN had no value apart from the Indonesian shares it held title to. It thus could be fairly said that while the TGN shares were, technically speaking, the assets in dispute, the real underlying assets of interest to the parties were the shares in the two Indonesian companies, PTPG and PTSA.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 On balance, I found that while the disputed assets were technically Singapore assets, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">in substance</span>, the business dealings and the assets at the heart of the dispute were situated in Indonesia. Singapore was the location of choice for the incorporation of TGN – but this was not because the parties’ business activities had any substantive connections to this jurisdiction. In my view, if one were to look at substance over form, Indonesia clearly had more real and substantial connections with the dispute than Singapore did. This weighed strongly in favour of staying the action. I noted that there was some dispute as to whether the oral agreement relating to the transfer of the PTPG and PTSA shares was reached in Singapore or Indonesia. I was unable to make a finding on this based on the affidavit evidence before me. Nevertheless, in my view, whether the parties happened to orally agree to the transfer of the PTPG and PTSA shares or the trust in Singapore or Indonesia was not particularly significant to the inquiry. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applicable law and public policy</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Applicable law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The choice of law rules for trusts are drawn by analogy from contracts – the proper law of the trust is the law chosen by the trustee, or, in the absence of such choice, the system of law to which the trust has the closest connection (<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span><span class="font-italic"> Laws of Singapore </span>vol 6(2) (LexisNexis, 2016 Reissue) (“Halsbury’s Conflict of Laws”) at para 75.330).

I then considered whether the intentions of the parties as to the governing law could be <span class="font-italic">inferred</span><span class="font-italic">. </span>I decided that it could not. First, while the Plaintiff argued that the parties could not have chosen Indonesian law as it did not recognise the concept of a trust, it was not clear on the evidence that the parties were aware of Indonesian law on the same. Indeed, Article 6 within each of the two deeds of sale and purchase signed by TGN and SKPP/SKPS contained an exclusive jurisdiction clause in favour of the District Court of South Jakarta, which would raise a query as to whether the players in the transaction (who were also the main actors behind the deeds) may have assumed Indonesian law as the <span class="font-italic">lex</span><span class="font-italic"> fori</span> would apply to the larger transaction as a whole. Second, while Singapore was chosen as the place of TGN’s incorporation, this was because “there were certain advantages, including tax efficiencies, in [the 1st Defendant] holding the shares in PTPG and PTSA through a Singapore company”

</div>. No preference for Singapore’s <span class="font-italic">system of law</span> was expressed by the parties based on the affidavit evidence. There was thus no basis to draw any inference about the intentions of the parties as to the governing law of the trust or contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The main issue then, was which system of law the contract and trust had the most close and real connection with, in light of the surrounding circumstances. As held in <span class="font-italic">Pacific Recreation</span> at [48], this “is a pragmatic exercise acknowledging that parties do not always have a governing law in mind when they enter into contracts. Equal weight ought to be placed on all factors, even those which would not, under the second stage, have been strongly inferential of any intention as to the governing law.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Here the trust assets, being shares of a Singapore company, were situated in Singapore. Nevertheless, TGN had no business operations of its own. The sole purpose of its incorporation was to be the legal vehicle through which the 1st Defendant could hold the Indonesian Shares. The Indonesian Shares were the true <span class="font-italic">raison </span><span class="font-italic">d’être</span> for this dispute, and the oral agreement to be tested in this suit was in substance a part of the parties’ larger Indonesian business ventures. For these reasons my provisional view, without having the benefit of the full facts as tested in cross-examination, was that Indonesian law had a closer connection to the dispute. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Public policy considerations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The defendants submitted that the dispute inevitably raised considerations of Indonesian public policy. This was because the defendants were relying on the defence that any agreement to create a trust over the TGN shares was contrary to Indonesian public policy prohibiting the holding of Indonesian company shares on behalf of another. The defendants’ submission was that a trust over TGN’s shares would effectively enable the PTPG and PTSA shares to be held on trust for the Plaintiff, which would be an illegal arrangement under Indonesian law. The defendants submitted that these public policy considerations were better dealt with by the Indonesian courts.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 It was common ground between the parties’ Indonesian law experts that Article 33 of Indonesian Law No 25 of 2007 on Investment (“Article 33”) prohibited the making of an agreement and/or statement that the ownership of the shares of a limited liability company in Indonesia is for and on behalf of another party. Any such agreement or statement would be null and void under Indonesian law.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Assuming <span class="font-italic">Indonesian law applied</span> to the present dispute, the defendants’ illegality defence would inevitably raise questions of whether (a) Article 33 or any other Indonesian law provision <span class="font-italic">directly</span> prohibited shares in foreign companies from being held on behalf of another, or (b) whether the policy behind Article 33 would be undermined if a special purpose vehicle holding Indonesian company shares was itself held on trust for another (hence, creating an indirect trust structure over the Indonesian shares). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In such circumstances, where questions of public policy of a foreign country are directly in play, this was a strong factor in favour of a stay. In <span class="font-italic">Eng </span><span class="font-italic">Liat Kiang v Eng Bak Hern</span> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 851 (“<span class="font-italic">Eng </span><span class="font-italic">Liat Kiang</span>”), the appellant commenced an action claiming that the respondent held certain Malaysian company shares (among other assets) on trust for him. The respondent successfully obtained a stay of the action on the ground of <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span>. One of the respondent’s arguments was that should the appellant’s trust claim in respect of the Malaysian shares be true, the appellant would have been in breach of Malaysian company law and also in breach of the listing requirements of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (“KLSE”). This argument weighed strongly with the Court of Appeal, which stated, at [31]: “An issue of Malaysian public policy is best left to be determined by the Malaysian court”. At [32] the Court of Appeal explained further: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In response, the appellant submitted that as the Malaysian Companies Act and the KLSE listing requirements were both codified, there would be no difficulty for a Singapore court to adjudicate whether a breach has been committed. To examine the provisions of the Malaysian Companies Act and the KLSE listing requirements and determine whether or not the appellant has committed a breach or breaches is not an insuperable problem to the court here. <span class="font-italic">But the difficulty is that having done that, the court then has to decide whether it is against public policy to enforce the trust, and</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> the public policy is that in Malaysia, and that issue the court in Singapore cannot determine</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 It is important to note that preceding this analysis in <span class="font-italic">Eng </span><span class="font-italic">Liat Kiang</span> was the Court of Appeal’s finding that the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">governing law was</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Malaysian law</span> (at [30]). The above Malaysian public policy considerations were therefore <span class="font-italic">directly relevant</span> to the enforceability of the alleged trust under Malaysian law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 I should, for completeness, consider the converse situation, where Singapore law governs. If <span class="font-italic">Singapore law</span> were the applicable law, the question was then whether <span class="font-italic">Indonesian public policy considerations</span> were relevant to determining the enforceability of the trust arrangement under <span class="font-italic">Singapore law</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In such circumstances, Indonesian public policy considerations regarding the holding of Indonesian company shares on trust would, nonetheless, still be pertinent, because it is part of <span class="font-italic">Singapore’s</span><span class="font-italic"> public policy</span> <span class="font-italic">and desire for international comity</span> to respect the public policy of foreign and friendly states. In <span class="font-italic">Peh</span><span class="font-italic"> Teck Quee v Bayerische Landesbank Girozentrale</span> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 842, the Court of Appeal affirmed that the Singapore courts would not enforce contracts where “the parties contemplate performance of acts which are illegal by the laws of a friendly country, whether or not it is the contractually stipulated place of performance” (at [53]). The underlying principle is that, as stated at [45]:  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the courts will treat a contract governed by its own law as void where the parties’ intention and object contemplated thereby jeopardises relations between its government and another friendly government</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Thus, if Singapore law governs this transaction, it follows as a matter of Singapore law that it remains critical to determine the scope of Indonesian public policy concerns.

</div> whilst the defendants submitted that the documents relating to the PTPG and PTSA shares were in Indonesian. Based on the limited evidence before me, I found an equal mix of documents in both English and Indonesian. Documents relating to the incorporation of TGN were in English, but the documents relating to the Indonesian companies PTPG and PTSA were mostly in Indonesian. The language of the documentary evidence thus did not weigh significantly in either direction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The place of residence, and the languages which the witnesses were conversant in, did not weigh strongly in favour of either Singapore or Indonesia as well. The 1st Defendant was Singaporean, the 2nd and 3rd Defendants were Indonesian, and the Plaintiff’s main witnesses seemed to come from Malaysia generally. While the Plaintiff has argued that most of its witnesses cannot conversely fluently in Indonesian, the 1st Defendant and the Plaintiff’s main witnesses travelled to and conducted business in Indonesia regularly. On the whole, therefore, I found no basis to conclude that they would be greatly inconvenienced by having the matter heard before the Indonesian courts, a jurisdiction they must be intimately familiar with. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The Plaintiff raised concerns as to the compellability of Florence Tan, the Corporate Finedge representative involved in the incorporation and management of TGN. While Indonesian courts could not compel a witness living abroad, the evidence before me did not suggest that Florence Tan was or would be an unwilling witness. To the contrary, when the defendants’ solicitors wrote to her asking her about the events surrounding the incorporation of TGN, she was ready to provide her version of events (as seen from her email to them dated 21 April 2016).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 None of these proceedings related <span class="font-italic">directly</span> to the ownership of shares in TGN, which was the subject matter of S 349/2016. Therefore, strictly speaking, there were no parallel proceedings and there was no risk of conflicting judgments. Regardless of whether the Indonesian courts find that the <span class="font-italic">PTPG and PTSA shares</span> were held on trust (or some equivalent construct) by TGN, the question whether the <span class="font-italic">TGN shares</span> were held on trust by the defendants for the Plaintiff was a separate legal question. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Nevertheless, I found that the <span class="font-italic">underlying</span> <span class="font-italic">factual inquiry</span> which the courts would have to embark on in TGN’s claim against SKPP and SKPS (see [39(a)] above), as well as in this suit, was ultimately <span class="font-italic">one and the same</span>: did the parties intend for the 1st Defendant to hold the PTPG and PTSA shares on trust for the Plaintiff and/or its related companies, or did the parties intend to transfer the PTPG and PTSA shares to the 1st Defendant outright? It bears noting that the incorporation of TGN and the transfer of the PTPG and PTSA shares to TGN were all part of the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">same transaction</span>. These events all arose out of the collaboration between the 1st Defendant and the Plaintiff (or its related companies) to solve the problems which PTPG and PTSA were facing in Indonesia. TGN was incorporated as part of these business dealings for the sole purpose of holding the PTPG and PTSA shares. In the circumstances, it would be far more just and convenient for the issues relating to the ownership of the PTPG and PTSA shares, as well as the TGN shares, to be heard together in Indonesia. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In my judgment, there was a real risk that the Indonesian and Singapore courts may reach contrasting <span class="font-italic">findings of fact</span> on material issues, for example, whether the intention was to transfer the PTPG and PTSA shares outright or on trust to the 1st Defendant. In <span class="font-italic">Chan Chin Cheung v Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Fatt Cheung and others</span> [2010] 1 SLR 1192 (see [44]-[46]), the Court of Appeal held that although the causes of action in Singapore and Malaysia were different, the trial courts would have to traverse much the same ground. In the result the High Court’s order for a stay pending outcome of the Malaysian proceedings promoted international comity.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on stage 1</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 To conclude, at the first stage of the two-stage inquiry, I found that Indonesia was clearly and distinctly the more appropriate forum for the trial of the dispute over the ownership of TGN shares. True it may be that TGN was a Singapore incorporated company. But the underlying assets, events and wider transaction were rooted in Indonesia; further, this suit could not be considered independently of Indonesian public policy considerations and proceedings that are live in that jurisdiction.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Stage 2: Does justice nevertheless require a stay?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 At the second stage, it is for the Plaintiff to show circumstances by reason of which justice nevertheless justified refusing the stay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The Plaintiff submitted that (a) it may not get a remedy in Indonesia because the Indonesian courts would not recognise a trust over the TGN shares, and (b) the Indonesian courts may refuse to exercise jurisdiction over the dispute. In the light of my view that issues of illegality under Indonesian law and Indonesian public policy ought properly to be dealt with in Indonesia, it followed, then, that I did not think these arguments relevant under Stage 2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In any event, the Plaintiff’s concerns related to the disadvantages that the Plaintiff would face if <span class="font-italic">Indonesian law</span> were the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">applicable law</span>, and not if Indonesia was the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">forum</span> of litigation. If the dispute was heard before the Singapore courts, <span class="font-italic">but Indonesia law applied</span>, the Plaintiff would have to overcome the disadvantages identified; conversely, if the Indonesian courts were to hear the dispute and come to the conclusion that Singapore law applied, the courts there would be compelled to give effect to the respect that Singapore law accords to the laws of friendly foreign states. The Plaintiff’s complaint therefore related to the disadvantages they would face if <span class="font-italic">Indonesian law</span> applied; it did not relate to any injustice they would face if the <span class="font-italic">Indonesian courts</span> heard the matter. Disadvantages which parties may face from a particular substantive law applying do not form a premise to refuse a stay in the interest of justice under the second stage of the <span class="font-italic">forum non </span><span class="font-italic">conveniens</span> inquiry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Notwithstanding the above, this suit is, in my judgment, very closely intertwined with Suit 252. Both suits require decision on the existence of the oral agreement contended by the Defendants, the trusts contended by the Plaintiff, the applicable governing law and whether the arrangements are affected by Article 33 of the Indonesian Investment Law. Both suits ought to be tried together. If Suit 252 is not stayed in favour of Indonesia, Stage 2 of the test, in my opinion, should then result in the same outcome for this suit. It was for this reason that when counsel first argued this application on 12 August 2016, I asked parties to return for a decision only after the then pending application for leave to appeal in Suit 252 had been decided. Leave to appeal was subsequently granted on a point of law of importance regarding trust arrangements involving trust property situated in a foreign jurisdiction which prohibits trusts. I then recalled parties for decision on 29 August 2016. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 For the above reasons, a stay of proceedings was granted pending the outcome of the actions in Indonesia. Parties were given liberty to apply, and costs were awarded to the defendants in the sum of $10,000 (inclusive of disbursements). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I should explain in closing the limited form of the stay given. I ordered a stay of proceedings pending the outcome of the actions in Indonesia as TGN is a Singapore company, and an order for the transfer of its shares may be required after the Indonesian cases have been dealt with. This approach was consonant with my view that although it was not clear whether the proceedings in Singapore and Indonesia could require different judgments, the material findings of fact were the same. Such an order allows parties to return to the Singapore suit if necessary, after the relevant material findings of fact had been made by the Indonesian courts. Similar terms accompanied the stay in <span class="font-italic">Chan Chin Cheung</span>, where the court granted a stay to avoid inconsistent findings of fact between courts in two jurisdictions.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Valerie Thean<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chew Ming Hsien Rebecca and Chew Xiang (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the applicant in SUM 2416/2016;<br/>Lim Tong Chuan and Joel Wee (Tan Peng Chin LLC) for the respondent in SUM 2416/2016.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
