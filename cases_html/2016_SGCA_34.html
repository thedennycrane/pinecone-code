The judicial commissioner who heard OS 1049 (“the Judge”) dismissed the action on the ground that the Appellant had no standing to bring the claim because it had failed to prove that it was the same entity (albeit in registered form) as Chee Hock Keng Temple (see <span class="font-italic">Chee Hock Keng v Chu</span><span class="font-italic"> Sheng Temple </span>[2015] SGHC 192 (“the Judgment”)).

Pursuant to Articles VI(1) and VII of the Constitution, the 15 members of each constituent temple’s management committee have one vote each at the Respondent’s annual general meetings (“AGMs”). From this perspective, the members of each constituent temple’s management committee can be regarded as that temple’s voting representatives at the Respondent’s AGMs. The Respondent itself has a separate 21-member management committee made up of seven representatives from each constituent temple. Each constituent temple’s seven representatives are chosen from the 15 members of that temple’s management committee. At each AGM of the Respondent, the 45 members of the three constituent temples’ management committees will vote to elect six of the 21 persons constituting the Respondent’s management committee as office-holders (as opposed to mere committee members) in the committee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Pursuant to Article VII(5) of the Constitution, the role of the Respondent’s management committee is to: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… organise and supervise the day to day affairs of the Confederation [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Respondent]; … check its sources of income and expenditure; see that its current accounts are in proper order and … make decisions on matters affecting its running when the Annual Meeting of member-temples is not sitting. … [and]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… be responsible for the collection, custody, investment or expenditure of all funds of the Confederation derived from whatever source. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The duties of the three constituent temples, which are described in the Constitution as “member-temples”, are as follows (<span class="font-italic">per </span>Article VII(6) of the Constitution):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Each member-temple shall be responsible for the maintenance and preservation of its respective altars and other paraphernalia of worship, whose property shall be vested in the member-temple concerned and not in any way come under the jurisdiction of the Confederation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The three constituent temples share an altar table and a single incense burner in a common area of the Property.

The Judge concluded from the Respondent’s structure, as well as from the functions and responsibilities of the three constituent temples, that each constituent temple was an entity distinct from the other constituent temples as well as from the Respondent. He noted that the voting rights and membership structure of the Respondent contained elements which appeared to militate against this conclusion, but found that, on the whole, the Constitution envisaged that each constituent temple would remain separate and distinct from one another and also from the Respondent. The Judge based his decision, instead, on his finding that the Appellant had failed to prove that it was Chee Hock Keng Temple or, at least, that it comprised substantially the same persons as the persons making up Chee Hock Keng Temple. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Although this was sufficient to dispose of OS 1049, the Judge went on to address the other issues raised by the parties.

The Appellant argues that it has the necessary standing to bring OS 1049 because it is the registered form of Chee Hock Keng Temple, which existed even before the formation of the Respondent in 1978. It explains that the registration of the entity known as “Chee Hock Keng” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the registration of the Appellant) was necessary as Chee Hock Keng Temple would otherwise have become an unlawful society pursuant to s 14 of the Societies Act, which prescribes penalties against persons involved in any unincorporated association which is not a “registered society” as defined in s 2 of that Act. The Appellant submits that it must be Chee Hock Keng Temple, given that the 15 expelled members had, on that temple’s behalf, registered the Appellant under the Societies Act.

<div class="modal-body">
<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> Respondent’s Case at p 66. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> According to the Respondent, the Appellant was formed by a breakaway faction within Chee Hock Keng Temple – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the 15 expelled members – after disagreements arose within the Respondent’s management committee about the way in which the 15 expelled members, seven of whom were members of the Respondent’s management committee at that time, were managing the Respondent.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In our view, these factual issues are secondary to a more fundamental legal issue which was initially missed by the parties, but which was addressed by both parties’ counsel after we pointed it out during the hearing of this appeal. Chee Hock Keng Temple, which merged with the other two constituent temples to form the Respondent in 1978, was an <span class="font-italic">unregistered</span> unincorporated association. This has certain legal implications. An unincorporated association consists of a mere aggregate of individuals, and is not a legal entity capable of suing or being sued in its own name: see <span class="font-italic">Chen Cheng and another v Central Christian Church and another appeal </span>[1995] 3 SLR(R) 806 (“<span class="font-italic">Chen Cheng</span>”) at [6]. An unincorporated association may, however, be clothed with legal personality by Parliament through legislation such as the Societies Act: see <span class="font-italic">Chen Cheng</span> at [8]. But, unless and until such legal personality is conferred by statute, an unincorporated association has no legal existence separate from the members who comprise it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Another characteristic of an unincorporated association is that it is based on a contract, whether written or oral, between its members. The constitution of an unincorporated association, if it has one, usually embodies the terms of the contract between its members. Every individual who subsequently seeks to join the association is, in law, trying to enter into a contract with the existing members. Applying this to the present case, since the three constituent temples were (so we were given to understand) all unregistered unincorporated associations at the time of the Respondent’s registration in 1978, the nine individuals selected by the representatives of these temples for the purposes of registering the Respondent (see [7] above) contracted on behalf of all the members of the three constituent temples, including themselves, when they came together to form the Respondent and create the Constitution. Legally speaking, the individual members of the three constituent temples, and not the temples themselves, are the members of the Respondent. Some of the provisions of the Constitution would appear to suggest that its drafters did not appreciate the correct legal position of the three unregistered unincorporated associations behind the three constituent temples; the same applies to the manner in which these three temples and their members have been conducting these temples’ affairs since the Respondent’s registration. However, nothing in the erroneous appreciation of the correct legal position can alter the three constituent temples’ position in law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The three constituent temples, including Chee Hock Keng Temple, could not have been members of the Respondent as, being <span class="font-italic">unregistered</span> unincorporated associations, they had no legal existence separate from the individuals which they were made up of at the time of the Respondent’s registration. Under the Societies Act, a “society” is defined in s 2 as “any club, company, partnership or association of 10 or more <span class="font-italic">persons</span>, whatever its nature or object” [emphasis added]. A “person” is defined in s 2(1) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) as including “any company or association or body of persons, corporate or incorporate”. Whilst it is possible for an unincorporated association to be a member of another unincorporated association, the caveat is that the first-mentioned unincorporated association must be a legal person, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it must be registered under the Societies Act such that it has the capacity to sue and be sued. Without registration, the first-mentioned unincorporated association is no more than a collection of individuals and has no separate legal personality to become a member of another unincorporated association. Applying these principles to the facts of the present case, it follows that at the time of the Respondent’s registration, each of the three constituent temples did not have the capacity to enter into contractual relations with each other nor with each other’s individual members. Thus, even if the Appellant succeeds in proving the fiercely-contested factual issue that it is the same entity, albeit in registered form, as the <span class="font-italic">unregistered</span> unincorporated association known as “Chee Hock Keng Temple”, this would not confer on the Appellant the requisite standing to enforce the rights set out in the Constitution because even the “authentic” Chee Hock Keng Temple has no such rights, notwithstanding the provisions of the Constitution. We reiterate that Chee Hock Keng Temple, being an unregistered unincorporated association, has no separate legal personality of its own. Thus, in law, it could not be and is not a member of the Respondent. The Constitution cannot confer legal personality on any of the three constituent temples as, by general law, they do not possess such personality.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 More importantly, the Appellant cannot be the same entity as the unregistered unincorporated association known as “Chee Hock Keng Temple” because the latter, having no separate legal personality of its own, was nothing more than an amorphous collection of individuals who had banded together for a common cause. A new legal person comes into being when a hitherto unregistered unincorporated association is registered under the Societies Act. Contrary to the submissions of the Appellant’s counsel (“Mr Sreenivasan”), this new legal person cannot and does not inherit the rights of its previous unregistered self because: (a) the latter never existed as a legal person in the eyes of the law in the first place; and (b) in any event, there would be no rights to inherit because its previous unregistered self, not being a legal person, never held any rights. This also puts paid to Mr Sreenivasan’s other submission that since unincorporated associations are statutorily required to be registered (failing which the persons involved in them would be committing an offence and, thus, be liable to prosecution), it would be contrary to “policy” and logic for such associations to lose their rights upon registration. As we understand it, Mr Sreenivasan’s argument is that the members of an unregistered unincorporated association would, in the aforesaid scenario, be placed in a catch-22 situation as they would either lose their rights upon registering the association under the Societies Act, or, in the event of their failing to effect such registration, be guilty of an unlawful act. With respect, there is a flaw in this submission. The act of registering a hitherto unregistered unincorporated association under the Societies Act does not take away any right from either that association or its members. This is because an unregistered unincorporated association cannot and does not hold any rights in the first place as it has no separate legal personality of its own. The rights that are often erroneously thought to belong to an unregistered unincorporated association are in fact vested in its members, and will continue to be so vested post-registration unless the rights are otherwise assigned. In this regard, we agree with the Judge that the proper plaintiffs in OS 1049 should perhaps have been the 15 expelled members, who were members of the Respondent before the Expulsion and who would still remain members if the Expulsion is found to be invalid. In any event, it is clear that there is no merit to Mr Sreenivasan’s submission that the act of registering a hitherto unregistered unincorporated association under the Societies Act would bizarrely result in the extinguishment of the rights of that association’s members. The effect of registration is, instead, to clothe the (hitherto unregistered) unincorporated association with legal personality, which would then allow it thereafter to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, have the capacity to acquire and hold rights from the time of registration onwards. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Even if we take the Appellant’s case at its highest and assume (despite the evidence which suggests otherwise) that it is the registered form of the unregistered unincorporated association known as “Chee Hock Keng Temple”, the Appellant does not have the requisite standing to commence OS 1049. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Having said that, we do not disagree with the Judge that the Appellant has not proved that it is in fact Chee Hock Keng Temple. The fact that the 15 expelled members acted together to procure the registration of the Appellant under the Societies Act using the appellation “Chee Hock Keng” is not sufficient to prove that the Appellant is, or is the successor of, Chee Hock Keng Temple. A faction of the group of persons who constituted the unregistered unincorporated association known as “Chee Hock Keng Temple” cannot claim to be, or to represent, that association by mere assertions alone. Instead, records must be produced. As pointed out by the Judge (at [34] of the Judgment), the Appellant failed to prove that its membership coincided with or was even substantially the same as the membership of Chee Hock Keng Temple. The mere fact that the 15 expelled members, who were the 15 members of Chee Hock Keng Temple’s management committee at the material time (see [14] above), have all taken the position that the Appellant and Chee Hock Keng Temple are one and the same is not sufficient to prove that the two are indeed so in law. Moreover, the Appellant has not shown that at the time of its registration, the 15 expelled members had the authority to act on behalf of all the other members of Chee Hock Keng Temple, whose identities and positions in respect of the present dispute are not even clear from the evidence before us. For the foregoing reasons, we are not minded to disturb the Judge’s factual finding that the Appellant has not proved that it is the same entity (albeit in registered form) as Chee Hock Keng Temple, and it is open to us to dismiss this appeal on this factual basis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 We would, however, prefer to uphold the Judge’s decision and dismiss this appeal on the basis of law, rather than on the basis of fact. For the avoidance of doubt, we reiterate that our decision is limited to the issue of the Appellant’s standing to bring OS 1049 (see [23] above). We have not made and are not making any decision on the issues which are to be determined in Suit 1339. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The costs of this appeal are to be awarded to the Respondent, and are to be taxed if not agreed. The usual consequential orders shall also apply.  </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Sundaresh Menon        Chao Hick Tin          Andrew Phang Boon Leong<br/>Chief Justice         Judge of Appeal          Judge of Appeal</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">N Sreenivasan SC, Choo Si Sen, Liow Wang Wu Joseph and Timothy Soo Zhi Ren (Straits Law Practice LLC) for the appellant;<br/>Daniel Koh Choon Guan, Amanda Lim Jia Yan and Koh Huini Valerie (Eldan Law LLP) for the respondent. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
