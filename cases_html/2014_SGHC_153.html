<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against the decision of the
                    District Judge in <em>Public Prosecutor v Tan Kian
                        Tiong</em> [2014] SGDC 85 (“the GD”). The appellant
                    pleaded guilty to a charge under the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed)
                    (“RTA”) and was sentenced to a fine of $800 and disqualified from
                    holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes of vehicle for six months
                    (“the disqualification order”) from the date of his conviction. He
                    has appealed against the imposition of the disqualification order
                only.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The facts of this case are straightforward. The
                    charge that the appellant pleaded guilty to is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You, Tan Kian Tiong, are charged that you, on
                            8<sup>th</sup> day of May 2013, at about 3:35pm, along
                        Sims Avenue towards Sims Avenue East, Singapore, being the driver of motor
                        vehicle SJE 7597D, did use a mobile telephone while the said motor vehicle
                        was in motion, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under
                        Section 65B of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       When the appeal came before me on 25 June 2014,
                    apart from elaborating on the grounds of appeal found in the appellant’s
                    petition of appeal, counsel for the appellant also raised the possibility of
                    filing a criminal revision in order to qualify the appellant’s plea of
                    guilt. I observed then that based on counsels’ submissions, there was no
                    prejudice or serious injustice so as to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of
                    the court, but reserved my judgment on the appeal to be delivered on a later
                    date. After considering the arguments raised by the parties, I am satisfied that
                    the District Judge did not err and that the imposition of the disqualification
                    order is not manifestly excessive. My reasons for dismissing the appeal are set
                    out below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The appellant was not represented in the
                    proceedings below. He pleaded guilty to the charge and his Statement of Facts
                    (“SOF”) was admitted without qualification. In mitigation, the
                    appellant asked for a lighter fine and stated that he needed his driving licence
                    for the purposes of his work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In deciding on the appropriate sentence, the
                    District Judge observed that the primary sentencing principle in such cases was
                    one of deterrence. She relied on the decision of the High Court in <em>Heng Jee Tai v PP</em> [1997] 1 SLR(R) 149 (“<em>Heng Jee Tai</em>”) and the relevant Parliamentary
                    Debates pertaining to the introduction of the offence of using a mobile phone
                    while driving a vehicle. As there was no particular aggravating or mitigating
                    factor, the District Judge imposed a fine of $800 and a disqualification order
                    of six months, noting that this was consistent with sentences ordinarily meted
                    out for this offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appellant’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The appellant raised four grounds of appeal
                    which can be found in his petition of appeal dated 24 March 2014. These grounds
                    assert that the District Judge had erred in law and in fact as she had:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     failed to fully appreciate that the
                        appellant’s handling of the mobile telephone was momentary and, as
                        such, his ability to control his vehicle was
                    questionable;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     failed
                        to fully appreciate the exceptional circumstances surrounding the case, in
                        that the appellant had not deliberately used the mobile phone and was merely
                        trying to switch off the phone which was ringing continuously and, towards
                        that end, had only responded to say “I will call back” before
                        ending the call;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     failed to give sufficient weight and/or consideration to all the factors,
                        especially the length of the call, such that a shorter disqualification
                        period would have sufficed due to the exceptional circumstances of the case;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_d"></a>(d)     been
                        influenced by irrelevant considerations outside the proper scope and/or
                        ambit leading to her imposing a sentence that was not in accordance with the
                        law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The appellant’s argument that the District
                    Judge had been influenced by “irrelevant considerations” requires
                    some elaboration. The appellant had admitted to the following facts at paragraph
                    3 of the SOF:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…the driver was holding the mobile phone in his right hand to his
                        right ear and was seen communicating with it while using only his left hand
                        to control the steering wheel of the vehicle when driving. In doing so, the
                        driver <em>lessened his ability to control the vehicle and
                            diminished his concentration on the road</em>. [Emphasis
                        own]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On appeal, the appellant challenged his
                    admission that his ability was lessened and that his concentration was
                    diminished. According to him, he was under the impression that he was only
                    admitting to the act of using his phone whilst driving. This is significant
                    because, so the appellant argued, the admission of the lessening of his ability
                    and the diminishing of his concentration pertains to a charge under s 65 of the
                    RTA, whereas an admission of the use of his mobile phone <em>simpliciter</em> pertains to a charge under s 65B of the RTA, which
                    was what he was charged with. By making this “additional”
                    admission which he did not intend to, the District Judge was made to take into
                    account “irrelevant considerations” in deciding on the sentence.
                    Furthermore, the appellant asserted that the reliance on <em>Heng
                        Jee Tai</em> was erroneous as the decision in <em>Heng
                        Jee Tai</em> was premised on the fact that there was a lessening of
                    ability and diminishing of concentration and not on the use of a mobile phone
                        <em>simpliciter</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       There are two issues that should be explored in
                    deciding whether the disqualification order for six months is manifestly
                    excessive. First, whether the appellant should be allowed to retract his
                    admission of paragraph 3 of the SOF and, second, assuming that his plea can be
                    qualified to that extent, whether it would mean that the disqualification order
                    for six months is manifestly excessive given his other grounds of
                appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Should the appellant be allowed to retract his admission of paragraph
                3 of the SOF? </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The law on whether a plea of guilt is
                    qualified is well-established. As explained by then Chief Justice Yong Pung How
                    (“CJ Yong”) in <em>Toh Lam Seng v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2003] 2 SLR(R) 346 (“<em>Toh
                        Lam Seng</em>”) at [5] (see also <em>Balasubramanian Palaniappa Vaiyapuri v PP</em> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 138
                        (“<em>Balasubramanian</em>”) and
                        <em>Koh Thian Huat v PP</em> [2002] 2 SLR(R) 113),
                    there are three procedural safeguards to be observed before a plea of guilt can
                    be accepted:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     that the accused should plead guilty
                        by his own mouth;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     that the onus lies on the court to ensure that the accused
                        understands the true nature and consequences of his plea;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     that the court
                        must establish that the accused intends to admit without qualification the
                        offence alleged against him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The observations of then CJ Yong in <em>Toh Lam Seng</em> at [8] and [9], describing the purpose and
                    the approach to be taken in applying these safeguards, are instructive:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8       There is good reason for these
                        stringent requirements. As I observed in <em>Koh Thian
                            Huat</em>, a revisionary court must jealously guard its powers to
                        prevent abuse by litigants seeking to use it as an alternative avenue of
                        appeal against their conviction. The safeguards protect accused persons from
                        uninformed or misguided pleas of guilt and as such are to be stringently
                        observed; equally, however, where circumstances show that one has pleaded
                        guilty unreservedly and with full knowledge of the consequences, it would be
                        an abuse of the court's revisionary jurisdiction to allow a retraction of
                        his plea.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9       Accordingly, the paramount
                        function of the lower courts when accepting a plea of guilt is to
                        determine whether the accused knowingly and unreservedly intends to plead
                        guilty to the charge and admit the truth of the allegations against him in
                        the SOF. In pursuance of this, it is beholden on the lower court to fully
                        explain to the accused the nature and consequences of both the charge and
                        his plea of guilt to it, and to ensure his comprehension. With
                        regard to a mitigation plea, a statement which discloses the
                        possibility of a defence does not
                        always qualify a plea of guilt. Such statements made in
                        mitigation could validly be treated as being made solely for their
                        mitigatory effect without an intention to deny or contradict the accused
                        person's prior admissions to the charge and SOF.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     As seen from above, it is paramount for the
                    court to ensure that the accused “knowingly and unreservedly intends to
                    plead guilty to the charge and admit the truth of the allegations”. That
                    said, it cannot be the case that a plea of guilt would be qualified and rejected
                    every time an accused simply asserts that he did not understand what he was
                    pleading to. To that end, the court must carefully consider the circumstances
                    surrounding his plea and, if relevant, also properly consider the mitigation
                    plea to see whether this qualifies his plea of guilt. Where there is a dispute
                    in relation to facts that may have a material effect on sentence
                    (notwithstanding that the plea of guilt remains valid) and the dispute cannot be
                    resolved, the proper course would be for the court to convene a post-conviction
                    (or <em>Newton</em>) hearing pursuant to s 228(5) of the
                    Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) and hear evidence, if
                    necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In the present case, counsel for the appellant
                    suggested that the plea of guilt remained valid as there was no qualification of
                    the legal ingredients of the charge under s 65B of the RTA, but the appellant
                    should nonetheless be permitted to retract his admission of paragraph 3 of the
                    SOF. According to counsel, the appellant had not intended to make this
                    “additional” admission and it was not germane to an offence under
                    s 65B of the RTA. In substance, this was an attempt to invoke the court’s
                    revisionary jurisdiction to allow the appellant to retract his admission of the
                    SOF insofar as paragraph 3 was concerned. To that limited extent, his plea of
                    guilt was qualified but it would not warrant a rejection of the plea
                    outright.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     There are three points that can be made in
                    relation to the appellant’s plea of guilt. First, I am not convinced that
                    the appellant did not know or understand what he had admitted to in his SOF as a
                    matter of plain English. The SOF comprises four paragraphs and is not complex.
                    Given that the appellant understands English, I cannot see how he could not have
                    understood the four simple paragraphs and the facts that they
                cover.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Second, I am not persuaded that, as counsel
                    for the appellant argued, the appellant did not have a “proper
                    realization of the far reaching <em>consequences</em>
                    of” admitting that the use of the mobile phone “lessened his
                    ability to control the vehicle and diminished his concentration on the
                    road”. Implicit in this argument is a challenge that the court had not
                    adhered to the procedural safeguard of ensuring that the accused understands the
                    true nature and <em>consequences</em> of his plea (see [10]
                    to [12] above). As explained in <em>Balasubramanian</em> at
                    [25]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the court must ascertain that the accused understands the nature and
                        consequences of his plea and intends to admit without qualification the
                        offence alleged against him. By "nature" of the plea, this meant that the
                        accused must know exactly what he was being charged with. <em>As for the "consequences" of the plea, the accused had to be aware of
                            the punishment prescribed by the law so that he knew the possible
                            sentence that he would receive upon conviction</em>. [Emphasis in
                        italics added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As a matter of law, however, it is incorrect
                    to say that the appellant did not understand the consequences of his plea simply
                    because he admitted to a certain fact that could be an aggravating factor as a
                    matter of sentencing. So long as the appellant knew the possible sentence that
                    he could receive, he is taken to have understood the consequences of his plea.
                    In this case, it is clear that possible consequence of disqualification from
                    driving was plain to the appellant, given that he had pleaded in mitigation that
                    he needed his driving licence for the purposes of his work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Third, counsel for the appellant also raised
                    what seems to be a hypothetical or ‘imagined” situation where, if
                    the appellant had appreciated the consequences better, he:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…could have agreed that whilst his attention was divided between
                        the call and the driving he could nevertheless have said that he had slowed
                        down and he was on the extreme lane of the road such that he was able to
                        proceed at a tortoise pace and successfully rebut the fear of imminent
                        danger to third parties…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Suffice to say, the appellant has had his full opportunity to
                        challenge the SOF, or to raise the relevant matters in his mitigation plea.
                        The fact that he did not do so strongly suggests that this was a purely
                        hypothetical situation, and therefore, I see absolutely no merit in this
                        argument. Even if he had raised these points, they are of dubious mitigating
                        value. Quite apart from the flippancy of the claim that he was able to slow
                        down and proceed “at a tortoise pace” on the extreme left lane
                        of the road, this did not mean he could never pose any risk to other road
                        users when he was using his mobile phone. Conceivably, there might well have
                        been a separate charge of inconsiderate driving for holding up traffic
                        behind him as he drove in such a fashion while attending to the
                    call.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In these circumstances, I see no reason to
                    allow the appellant to retract his earlier admission of paragraph 3 of the SOF.
                    There was no credible basis whatsoever for his contention that he did not intend
                    to make this “additional” admission. I find that the appellant had
                    admitted fully to the facts as found in his SOF and there is thus no
                    justification for the court to exercise its revisionary
                jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Is the disqualification order of six months manifestly excessive? </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Even if it were assumed that the appellant did
                    not admit to the fact that using his mobile phone while driving had
                    “lessened his ability to control the vehicle and diminished his
                    concentration on the road” (“the admitted words”), I am not
                    persuaded that the disqualification order of six months is manifestly excessive.
                    The disqualification order of six months is in accordance with previous
                    sentencing precedents – see the cases cited in <em>Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts Volume II</em>
                    (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2013) at pp 1706 and 1707. Counsel for the appellant,
                    however, submitted that the cases under s 65 of the RTA should not be used
                    as a sentencing benchmark for a s 65B offence because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_a"></a>(a)     the admitted words form the key
                        ingredients of an offence under s 65 of the RTA, which the appellant was not
                        convicted of; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     there is a distinction between the cases under s 65 of the RTA and
                        those under s 65B of the RTA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I disagree. As can be discerned from the
                    relevant Parliamentary Debates which were cited by the District Judge at [6] of
                    the GD, the primary purpose of creating a separate offence was to curb the
                    rising number of drivers who were using their mobile phones. While such offences
                    were prosecuted under s 65 of the RTA in the past, special recognition is now
                    given to this class of offences because of the problem of <em>prevalence</em>, and not so much because there is a difference in the
                    moral culpability between the specific offence of using a hand phone while
                    driving on one hand, and the general offence of driving without due care and
                    attention and without reasonable consideration on the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In my judgment, the sentencing regime and
                    precedence for such offences under s 65 of the RTA following <em>Heng Jee Tai’s</em> case continue to remain relevant and
                    applicable for offences under s 65B of the RTA. This is also supported by the
                    fact that both the courts (when such offences fell under s 65 of the RTA) and
                    the Parliamentary Debates (commenting on such offences under s 65B of the RTA)
                    reflect the same concerns and sentiment – drivers who use mobile phones
                    pose serious risks to other road users as they are likely to have less control
                    over their vehicles, and there is a need to take a deterrent approach as a
                    manner of sentencing. I therefore do not agree with counsel for the appellant
                    that the approach for such cases which had previously been dealt with under s 65
                    of the RTA is not relevant for cases prosecuted under s 65B of the
                RTA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The appellant argued that the use of his
                    mobile phone was only “momentary”, in that all he did was to tell
                    the caller that he would call back shortly. Further, the appellant also
                    submitted that he was merely trying to switch off the phone which was ringing
                    continuously. In my view, these assertions do little to help the
                    appellant’s case. They were clear afterthoughts. They were also inherently
                    contradictory in that he claimed, on one hand, that he had wanted to switch off
                    his phone, and on the other, that he went ahead instead to answer the call,
                    albeit only momentarily. In any event, the appellant chose not to raise such
                    facts in his mitigation plea and has only raised them at this stage. I cannot
                    see how he would have thought that it was irrelevant to raise these facts
                    earlier on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It is also pertinent to note that counsel for
                    the appellant had initially intimated that he would seek leave to adduce further
                    evidence which could support the appellant’s claim, namely the call logs
                    showing the duration of the call. At the commencement of the appeal hearing,
                    counsel conceded that he would not pursue this line of argument, having seen the
                    relevant call logs produced by the prosecution. No more need be said about this
                    as the inference is obvious. As such, his claims are merely bare assertions, and
                    I see no reason why they should be accepted by this court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     To further buttress their case, the
                    Prosecution brought to my attention a decision of the State Courts and two
                    newspapers articles commenting on the increasing number of summonses being
                    issued to drivers for using their mobile phones. This was done by letter after
                    the appeal hearing. While these documents might indeed be relevant to the appeal
                    and the act of bringing them to my attention is appreciated, the proper
                    procedure is for these documents to have been exchanged and tendered during the
                    hearing before me. If, for whatever reason, parties see a need to supplement
                    their case after the hearing, the appropriate way to do this would be to write
                    in to request for permission to adduce further arguments or documents <em>before</em> submitting them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     As the documents had already come to my
                    attention, it was only fair to afford the appellant an opportunity to respond.
                    Counsel was duly informed of this and was directed to file a response in writing
                    if he so desired by 21 July 2014. In the event, no such response was received.
                    In any case, there was no need in the circumstances to rely on the
                    Prosecution’s additional documents or counsel’s response to come to
                    my decision, as the sentencing policy and practice for such offences is clearly
                    established. For the reasons stated above, I do not find that the
                    disqualification order of six months is manifestly excessive, and therefore,
                    dismiss the appeal.</p>
