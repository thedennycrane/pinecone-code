The Property is the only valuable asset of the Deceased’s estate (“the Estate”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Ong Chin Woon (“the Plaintiff”) is the second eldest child of the Deceased and the older of the Deceased’s two sons. His six siblings (or their estates) are the defendants in this suit. They are: (i) Ong Bee Hah (‘Bee Hah”), a sister who is the first and sixth defendant; (ii) Ong Ah Hua (“Ah Hua”) another sister who is the eighth defendant; (iii) Ong Chin Ee (“Chin Ee”) a brother who is the fourth defendant; (iv) Ong Ee Peng (“Ee Peng”), a sister who passed away in 2017 and whose estate is represented by Ee Peng’s daughter Ng Yee Ping Grace (“Grace”), is the fifth defendant and (v) Ong Yew Hong (“Yew Hong”) a sister who is the second and seventh defendant. The Plaintiff had another sister Ong Siew Eng (“Siew Eng”), the eldest in the family, who passed away intestate on 25 October 1997. Her son Ng Wuay Ming (“Wuay Ming”), who is the only beneficiary of her estate, is the third defendant. Ah Hua, the eighth defendant, was given up for adoption when she was a child but remains a beneficiary of the Estate because she was not formally adopted by her adoptive family. Henceforth, where the context requires, Bee Hah and Yew Hong will be referred to collectively as “the administratrices”. In this Suit, the Plaintiff has sued the administratrices in their dual capacity – as administratrices and as beneficiaries of the Estate. Chin Ee and his sisters will, where the context is appropriate, be referred to collectively as the “siblings” in relation to the Plaintiff – the term does not include Ah Hua, as she was never part of the Ong family throughout the years where the events concerning this Suit took place. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The siblings’ father Ong Kim Huat (“the Father”) passed away on 21 March 1976 while the Deceased herself passed away in February 2015.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The facts hereafter set out are extracted from the affidavits of evidence-in-chief (“the AEICs”) of the Plaintiff, Chin Ee, Bee Hah, Yew Hong, Ong Geok Leng (“Geok Leng”) who is the Plaintiff’s wife and Ong Wen Jin (“Wen Jin”) who is the Plaintiff’s daughter. Yew Hong filed two affidavits, one as an administratrix of the Estate, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in her capacity as the second defendant and the other as a beneficiary of the Estate, as the seventh defendant. Where reference is made to Yew Hong’s AEIC and unless otherwise stated, it refers only to her AEIC that was filed in her capacity as a beneficiary of the Estate. The reasons for this will be apparent when the court refers to the joint defence filed by the administratrices

The Deceased and Chin Ee were shareholders of Success Timber but were not involved in running its operations. The Plaintiff was not a shareholder even though Success Lumber was his company as he did not want his partners in his Malaysian timber business to know he owned a competing business.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The Plaintiff deposed that he would help out in the business of Southern Tyre whenever he returned to Singapore from Malaysia on weekends.

</div>, “Selegie” was a reference to a five-storey apartment building (“the Selegie Building”) situated along Selegie Road which Goldrich owned. The entire Ong family were Goldrich’s shareholders before Chin Ee moved to Canada with the Deceased being the major shareholder. Goldrich had purchased for $140,000 the plot of land upon which the Selegie Building was constructed; the Plaintiff and Chin Ee paid $120,000 while the Deceased lent the balance of $20,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Whilst the Selegie Building was still under construction in 1988, the Plaintiff was embroiled in disputes with the contractor over delays in construction works. This resulted in the Plaintiff’s car being vandalised. The Deceased was afraid that matters would get out of hand and wanted the Selegie Building disposed of with the return of her loan of $20,000. The Selegie Building was sold in 1989 for at least $1m. Less the bank loan used for construction and the Deceased’s loan, Chin Ee

Bee Hah (and the other daughters) opined that this in effect meant that Chin Ee was paying for half of the Plaintiff’s expenses which they felt was unfair. Hence, from about 1991 onwards, the Plaintiff took over the payment of the regular household expenses at the Property as by then, he had two children. Furthermore, the Deceased had since October 1990, started making annual trips of about six months’ duration each to Canada to visit Chin Ee and his family. She would leave for Vancouver in spring (March or April) and return to Singapore in autumn (September or October) when the Canadian weather started to turn cold. Her last trip to Canada was in late 2014. According to Yew Hong, due to the Deceased’s long absences from Singapore between 1990 and 2014, the bulk of the expenses incurred at the Property was, in any case, those of the Plaintiff and his family.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Between 1997 and 2005, the Deceased’s daughters took her to see lawyers with a view to making a will, as the Deceased did not speak English.

From June to July 2017, the administratrices agreed to sell the Property with vacant possession at the price of $2.76m but it was not to the Plaintiff and Wen Jin – it was to Wen Jin’s husband-to-be. The reason for the change was based on legal advice. Wen Jin’s lawyers were concerned that as the daughter of a beneficiary of the Estate that was selling the Property, her loan application may be affected and not be approved by virtue of that relationship. To show it was an “arm’s length” transaction, Wen Jin and/or the Plaintiff decided that Wen Jin’s future husband would be the sole purchaser. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 For reasons that will become apparent in the court’s subsequent findings, Yew Hong made copious references in her AEIC to the WhatsApp exchanges that showed that the Plaintiff actively encouraged Wen Jin (and Wen Jin’s future husband) to purchase the Property at a discount to the market value. In her communication with the administratrices in particular with Yew Hong, Wen Jin also made no secret of the fact she could only afford to buy the property with the (financial) support of her father as her budget was only $2.7m and the Plaintiff would pay the difference of $60,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The administratrices issued the option to purchase for the Property in July 2017 and the sale was completed in October 2017.

</div>, the Plaintiff submitted a handwritten note in Chinese setting out his claims again the Estate. Besides a sum of $298,008.94 for the Deceased’s hospitalisation, his note included a claim for $100,000 (“the $100,000 claim”) for his eldest son Yan Jie that the Deceased had purportedly promised to him. However, the administratrices rejected the $100,000 claim on the basis that it was not the Deceased’s debt and they could not admit the claim without the consent of the other beneficiaries (which was not forthcoming) as required under the law of intestacy.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 As Bee Hah was going on holiday in October 2017, the administratrices planned to distribute the sale proceeds in November 2017. However, distribution of the sale proceeds did not take place as planned in November 2017. Despite repeated requests from the administratrices, the Plaintiff failed to provide accounts of all the cash donations he collected from well-wishers at the wake as well as the sums he disbursed therefrom to each sibling. He failed and/or refused to do so even when the Estate’s solicitors wrote to him. Unlike the other beneficiaries, the Plaintiff further refused to confirm the Estate’s accounts when the same were sent to him before distribution could take place. Indeed, he objected to the distribution taking place before his claims against the Estate were paid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 On 26 January 2018

</div>, the Plaintiff through his lawyers stated for the first time that the Plaintiff had contributed substantially to the purchase of the Property and there was no basis for an equal distribution of the sale proceeds to all the beneficiaries of the estate. In response, the administratrices requested for evidence from the Plaintiff to support his claim to the Property and the sale proceeds. However, no evidence was forthcoming from him between February and July 2018.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Hence, on 16 July 2018, despite the Plaintiff’s objections, the administratrices through the Estate’s solicitors, made a distribution of $300,000 of the sale proceeds to each beneficiary for a total distribution of $2.1m. The Plaintiff was unsuccessful in his attempt to obtain an injunction to stop the payments that the administratrices made. On the same day, the Plaintiff served his writ of summons in this Suit on the administratrices followed by service of the statement of claim (“SOC”) on 27 July 2018. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 On 25 July 2018, the Plaintiff requested and subsequently received a cheque for $300,000 as his share of the interim distribution from the sale proceeds of the Property.

</div> the court only referred to Yew Hong’s AEIC affirmed as a beneficiary of the estate. This was due to the defence filed by the administratrices. In that joint defence, Bee Hah and Yew Hong stated that they are not in a financial position as administratrices to defend this Suit properly due to a lack of funds. They had proposed to utilise the Estate’s funds to defend this suit but were precluded from doing so by the Plaintiff’s objections. Consequently, the administratrices averred that they adopt a neutral position in respect of the Plaintiff’s claim and will abide by the court’s decision. In the same vein, Yew Hong in the AEIC that she filed as administratrix of the estate, deposed that she would abide by the decision of the court.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Not surprisingly, in the joint defence that they filed as the third to eighth defendants, the siblings (and the two legal representatives of the siblings) put up a lengthy and robust defence to the Plaintiff’s allegations in the SOC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The siblings set out in their defence the events that took place from the time of the demise of the Deceased and the appointment of the three sisters as the administratrices of the Estate. They further set out the background of Southern Tyre and described the Deceased as an independent and entrepreneurial woman who was behind the success of the tyre business.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The siblings averred that the names of the Plaintiff and Chin Ee were added to the title of the PG Property because they were the only sons in the family and this was a traditional Chinese family. If anything should happen to the Deceased, the PG Property would pass to the Plaintiff and Chin Ee and the siblings would have a roof over their heads. It was pointed out that when the two sons became joint tenants of the PG Property, they were in their mid-twenties and had been involved in Southern Tyre for only a few years. The Plaintiff worked there on Saturdays and made limited contribution towards the business as he was then still in his polytechnic course. Hence, the siblings denied the Plaintiff’s claim that he and Chin Ee were made joint tenants because they helped out in the family business from which income the entire family was supported.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Instead, the defendants asserted that a resulting trust arose in favour of the Deceased from the joint tenancy held by the Plaintiff and Chin Ee in the PG Property. Neither of them provided consideration for the addition of their names as joint tenants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The defendants further denied that after the Father’s passing, it was the Plaintiff who provided the main financial support to the family from his business activities in Malaysia. They averred that the Deceased continued to receive income from Southern Tyre and from her investments in other businesses including Goldrich, which income the Deceased used to pay for household and other expenses. By 1976, all the siblings save for Yew Hong, were above 18 years of age and were either working or married. They did not rely on the Deceased or the Plaintiff for financial support save that some of them were still living with the Deceased.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The defendants referenced the May 1988 meeting

To the best of the defendants’ knowledge, the Deceased had sufficient funds from the sale proceeds of the PG Property and her other sources of income to pay for the Property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The defendants denied the Plaintiff’s allegation that Chin Ee gave up one-third of his share of the sale proceeds of the PG Property as his contribution towards the costs of care for the Deceased.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The defendants averred that until her demise, the Deceased occupied the master bedroom of the Property while the Plaintiff (and subsequently his wife and children after his marriage) occupied other bedrooms in the Property.

The Deceased did not allow the Plaintiff or the Plaintiff’s family to occupy Chin Ee’s room until after the Plaintiff’s third or fourth child was born.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The defendants set out the steps that were taken by the Deceased between 1997 and 2015 to distribute her assets (which included the sale proceeds of the Property) that negated the existence of the alleged common intention.

What was noteworthy and which Ms Hing highlighted was the fact that the overdraft facility was secured on three fixed deposits of the Plaintiff charged to Indosuez Bank, one in the amount of £220,148.41, the second in the sum of DEM458,209.76 and the third in the amount of CHF392,203.75.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 According to historical exchange records maintained by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, in April 1991, the exchange rate between the sterling pound and the Singapore dollar was about £1.00 to S$3.14, 100 units of the Swiss franc was then worth between S$121.00 and S$125.18 and 100 German marks was then equivalent to between S$101.49 and $104.36. (According to the Bank of America letter in exhibit P1, the exchange rate between the sterling pound and Singapore dollar was S$3.4515 to £1.00 as of 10 January 1989). Consequently, £220,148.41 would have approximated S$691,266.01 (@ S$3.14 to £1.00), CHF392,203.75 would have been worth at least S$474,566.54 and DEM458,209.76 was about S$465,037.09. The total value of the Plaintiff’s fixed deposits exceeded S$1.63m. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 It would appear from the evidence adduced from the Plaintiff in cross-examination that he was a very shrewd investor who knew how to make money from the spread in interest rates between 1988 and 1991. The interest rates on foreign currencies were then in double digits as against single digits for loans in local currency. According to the Bank of America documents in exhibits P1 and P2, the then interest rate for sterling pound deposits ranged between 12% to 13.3125% per annum. What the Plaintiff did was to borrow in the name of the Deceased with him as guarantor, $500,000 in the UOF loan at 4% interest per annum, convert the sum into foreign currency and profit from the interest spread of 8–9% (12%–13% less 4%). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Ms Hing suggested to the Plaintiff that he had the same <span class="font-italic">modus operandi</span> for the Flat.

In that case, the Court of Appeal varied the orders made by the trial judge (see <span class="font-italic">See Fong Mun v Chan Yuen Lan</span> [2013] 3 SLR 685). A property purchased for $1.83m was registered in the name of the defendant/appellant-wife but save for a contribution of $290,000 from her, the purchase price was funded by the plaintiff/respondent-husband.

</div>. Given his own admission and the court’s observations in [86]–[87] above, there was no evidence of the Plaintiff’s contributions towards the purchase price of the Property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 More in point would be <span class="font-italic">Geok Hong Co Pte Ltd v Koh Ai Gek</span><span class="font-italic"> and others</span> [2019] 1 SLR 908 (“<span class="font-italic">Geok Hong</span>”) a case cited by the defendants. There, the family of the deceased son (“TTL”) of the late founder (“TGC”) of the defendant company (a family business), instituted proceedings seeking a declaration that the property which had been the home of TTL’s family but purchased in the name of the company in 1977 was vested in equity in the estate of TTL.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 The judge relied on a statutory declaration (“SD”) made by TTL days before his demise where TTL outlined his version of events (disputed by the defendant) concerning ownership of the property. TTL’s SD alleged that when he was given an option to purchase the property, TGC had told TTL that he would buy the property for TTL since TTL would be staying behind to handle the family business while his siblings were studying abroad. The property would be registered in the name of the company so that TTL’s wife would not be able to get a share in the event of a divorce (“the oral representation”). TGC passed away in 1990. In 2012, TTL contracted liver cancer and made a will on 10 October 2012 bequeathing the property absolutely to his wife. The respondents alleged that 20 days later on 30 October 2012, TTL became agitated after a visit by some of his siblings – he told his children that his siblings had refused to return the property to him. TTL made the SD that same evening. None of his children witnessed the altercation between TTL and his siblings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 The company denied that the oral representation was ever made. The plaintiffs’ claim was based on a common intention constructive trust and in the alternative, proprietary estoppel that had arisen from the oral representation. The court below allowed the respondents’ claim based on a common intention constructive trust. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 The appellate court reversed the decision of the court below and held that there was no resulting trust in favour of the estate of TTL. In allowing the company’s appeal, the Court of Appeal’s following holdings are particularly applicable to this case:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the veracity of the oral representation could not be tested given the lack of documentary evidence and the fact that the only two persons who could provide evidence on the circumstances of the oral representation were no longer available for cross-examination. Given that the oral representation could not be established, there was nothing to rebut the presumption that the company as the legal owner was also the beneficial owner of the property (at [67]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) it was troubling that TTL, throughout his lifetime, had never informed his siblings about the oral representation or his alleged beneficial interest in the property. The only person who could have validated the oral representation was TGC, yet TTL did not take any steps to realise his interest while TGC was alive (at [69]–[71]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In any event, the doctrine of laches would have barred the respondents’ claim. The difficulties with the fact and contents of the oral representation could not be clarified through cross-examination, given that information relating to the oral representation resided only in TTL and TGC. TTL had not taken steps to realise his interest while he was alive, but chose to assert his interest by way of the SD when he was suffering from terminal liver cancer. TTL had no reasonable explanation for his inordinate delay of almost 40 years before asserting his claim which was extremely prejudicial to the company (at [98] and [101]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 The holdings of the appellate court in <span class="font-italic">Geok Hong</span>, summarised in [177], would be pertinent to this Suit. The only person who could confirm or rebut the Plaintiff’s allegation of oral representations that the Deceased allegedly made to him as set out earlier at [53] would be the Deceased herself. The Plaintiff took no steps while the Deceased was still alive to realise his claim to be the beneficial owner of the Property.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 The Plaintiff’s claim based on a resulting trust
