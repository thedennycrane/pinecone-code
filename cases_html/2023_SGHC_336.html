The defendant is NUHS Fund Limited (“NUHSF”), a Singaporean company limited by guarantee that is registered as a charity under the Charities Act 1994 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “Charities Act”) and as an Institution of a Public Character (“IPC”) under the Charities (Institutions of A Public Character) Regulations (2008 Rev Ed). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In OA 510, the Executrix seeks the following orders:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A declaration that the intended specific legatee of a gift in cl 3(f)(iii) of the Will did not exist at the time of the execution of the Will and/or at the date of death of the Testator.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) A declaration that, based on the construction of the Will, there is no general charitable purpose in the gift as described in cl 3(f)(iii) of the Will; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) A declaration that the gift of a property in cl 3(f)(iii) of the Will (the “Property”) has lapsed into the residue of the Estate, and that pursuant to s 20 of the Wills Act 1838 (2020 Rev Ed), the sale proceeds of the Property shall be distributed in accordance with the residuary device in cl 3(g) of the Will. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 On 20 March 2018, the Testator passed away.

NUHSF was consequently formed and registered as a charity. As seen from the 4 June 2012 Resolution, the funds in NUHPCF were transferred to NUHSF to continue the objectives of NUHEF/NUHPCF and were ring-fenced for this purpose. NUHSF submits that the objects of NUHEF/NUHPCF are in substance included as part of the statement of NUHSF’s objects in its corporate constitution and are clearly being carried on in NUHSF. Therefore, the funds of NUHPCF continue to be held on trust for its purposes and have not been destroyed by any alteration in the machinery or objects of NUHSF. In addition, the assets from NUHPCF were distinctly ring-fenced in NUHSF. They were restricted for application to only four programmes, which were the same as those that had been carried out by NUHPCF.

All three cases involved external intervention through some act based on the powers given to charity commissioners or some legislation, such as the National Health Service Act 1946 (9 &amp; 10 Geo 6 c 81) (UK) (“NHSA”).

In <span class="font-italic">Re Faraker </span>and <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Lucas</span>, the charity commissioners had no power to, and could not have intended to, destroy those charities, as the charities were founded as a perpetual charity with no ability to self-terminate.

If the charity was terminated by its own rules, there is nothing to prevent the gift from lapsing.

It has been said that such intent was to be collected from the words of the will and nothing else (see <span class="font-italic">Bermuda Trust (Singapore) Ltd v Wee Richard and others </span>[1998] 3 SLR(R) 938 at [7]).

The Court of Appeal also clarified that extrinsic evidence <span class="font-italic">can</span> and will be admissible to aid in the construction of a will where the expressed intention is ambiguous (at [20]). I note that it has also been held that where a strict literal construction would be regarded as out of sync with the general intention of the testator as derived from the will as a whole, such a reading should give way to a more purposive interpretation (<span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Seng and others v Foo Jhee Tuang and another</span> [2012] 4 SLR 339 at [17]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The above cases did not involve a gift to a charity.

It cites <span class="font-italic">Re Rymer </span>and <span class="font-italic">R</span><span class="font-italic">e Stemson’s Will </span>in support of this proposition. <span class="font-italic">Principles of Equity and Trusts</span> goes on to note that whether or not a gift is regarded as one for the charitable institution as such or one for the purposes of the charitable institution is influenced by whether the intended recipient of the gift is incorporated or unincorporated. Referring to <span class="font-italic">Re Vernon’s Will</span> and <span class="font-italic">Re Finger’s Will</span>, <span class="font-italic">Principles of Equity and Trusts</span> summarises (at pp 202–203) that a gift to an unincorporated charity must be a gift for a charitable purpose as such a charity does not have a separate legal personality able to take the gift beneficially (see above at [16]), and that if the charitable purpose can still be fulfilled, the gift will not fail <span class="font-italic">unless the continued existence of the institution was essential to the gift</span>. This proposition is also set out in <span class="font-italic">Theobald on Wills</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2021), which states (at p 500) that a gift to an incorporated charity that has dissolved before the date of death will lapse (unless the corporation was to take the gift as a trustee or unless the will discloses a general charitable intention), but a gift to an unincorporated charity is regarded as a gift for charitable purposes, and the continued existence of the unincorporated charity is unnecessary <span class="font-italic">unless the will requires otherwise</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see also <span class="font-italic">Williams on Wills</span> (LexisNexis, 11th Ed, 2021) at paras [103.4]–[103.5] and <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 34th Ed, 2022) at para 23-054).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In <span class="font-italic">Re Vernon’s Will</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Buckley J stated (at 789):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Every bequest to an unincorporated charity by name </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">without more</span><span class="font-italic"> must take effect as a gift for a charitable purpose</span>. No individual or aggregate of individuals could claim to take such a bequest beneficially. If the gift is to be permitted to take effect at all, it must be as a bequest for a purpose, viz., that charitable purpose which the named charity exists to serve … A bequest to a named unicorporated [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] charity, however, <span class="font-italic">may on its true interpretation show that the testator's intention to make the gift at all was </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">dependent</span><span class="font-italic"> upon the named charitable organisation being available at the time when the gift takes effect</span> to serve as the instrument for applying the subject matter of the gift to the charitable purpose for which it is by inference given. <span class="font-italic">If so and the named charity ceases to exist in the lifetime of the testator, the gift fails</span> ... </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In short, a gift to a named unincorporated charity, without more, is a gift for charitable purposes, <span class="font-italic">unless</span> the gift depended on the continued existence of the specific charitable institution, in which case the gift will lapse if the specific charitable institution ceases to exist prior to the disposition taking effect. As for the position in relation to incorporated charities, Buckley J held (at 789):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A bequest to a corporate body, on the other hand, takes effect simply as <span class="font-italic">a gift to that body beneficially</span>, <span class="font-italic">unless there are circumstances which show that the recipient is to take the gift as a trustee</span> … the natural construction is that the bequest is made to the corporate body as part of its general funds, that is to say, <span class="font-italic">beneficially and without the imposition of any trust</span>. That the testator's motive in making the bequest may have undoubtedly been to assist the work of the incorporated body would be insufficient to create a trust. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Gifts to an incorporated charity therefore presume the opposite and are <span class="font-italic">not</span> considered gifts for charitable purposes, but rather gifts to the charitable institution <span class="font-italic">as such</span>, <span class="font-italic">unless </span>the will shows otherwise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 I turn to <span class="font-italic">Re Finger’s Will</span>, where the distinction in <span class="font-italic">Re Vernon’s Will</span> was also regarded as significant. There, the testatrix left large residuary gifts to eleven charitable institutions and funds, two of which had ceased to exist prior to the date of her death. One of these, by the reference to the “National Radium Commission” in the will was held to refer to an unincorporated charity known as the “Radium Commission” (at 293G), whereas the other was an incorporated charity, the “National Council for Maternity and Child Welfare” (at 292E). It was undisputed that both had completely ceased to exist. While Goff J considered that the distinction between gifts to incorporated and unincorporated charities would produce “anomalous results”, he accepted that the distinction was “well established” (at 294E–F). The position is that a gift to an unincorporated charity will not lapse if its charitable purposes are still being carried on, “unless there is something positive to show that the continued existence of the donee was essential to the gift” (at 295G). As the will had “no context whatever” to make the National Radium Commission of essence to the gift, that gift did not lapse and was a gift for its purposes (at 297F–H and 298E–F). On the other hand, applying the distinction in<span class="font-italic"> Re Vernon’s Will</span>, the same absence of context meant that the gift to the National Council for Maternity and Child Welfare, an incorporated charity, lapsed (at 298F–299B).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The principle in <span class="font-italic">Re Vernon’s Will </span>has been applied in more recent English decisions.

In <span class="font-italic">Kings (personal representative of Schroder (deceased) v Bultitude</span><span class="font-italic"> and another</span> [2010] EWHC 1795 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">Kings</span>”), Proudman J held (at [23]) that “a gift for the purposes of the church (an unincorporated association) can take effect under a scheme even if the institution was not in existence at the death, provided that (a) the testatrix did not intend to make the gift dependent on the named institution remaining in existence and that (b) the work of the institution is still being carried on as a matter of fact”. Both <span class="font-italic">Re Vernon's Will </span>and <span class="font-italic">Re Finger’s Will</span> were cited as good authority. <span class="font-italic">Re Vernon's Will </span>was followed in <span class="font-italic">Macintyre &amp; Anor v Oliver &amp; Ors</span> [2018] EWHC 3094 (Ch) (“<span class="font-italic">Macintyre</span>”), for the proposition that “a gift made to an unincorporated association is for the purposes of the unincorporated association, unless it is a condition of the gift that the association is in existence when the gift takes effect” (at [44]–[49]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Australian cases</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Australian and Canadian authorities are consistent with the English position, but only in so far as they adopt a presumptive position of construing a gift to an unincorporated charity as being for the charitable purposes of that charity.

There, the court observed (at [55]) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Little is required to establish a general charitable purpose.

However, Vanstone J also held that (at [23]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As a starting point, it should be noted that <span class="font-italic">a gift by will to a particular charitable institution is generally construed as being a gift on trust for the charitable purposes of that institution</span>: <span class="font-italic">Tyrie </span>at 177. Although some English authorities appear to limit this principle to unincorporated charities (for example, <span class="font-italic">Re Vernon’s Will Trusts </span>[1972] Ch 300), no such distinction applies in Australia. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In other words, <span class="font-italic">all</span> gifts to charitable institutions are regarded as gifts for charitable purposes, rather than gifts to the institution as such, regardless of whether it is incorporated or unincorporated (see also <span class="font-italic">Harmony </span><span class="font-italic">- The Dombroski Foundation Ltd v Attorney General in and for the State of New South Wales </span>[2020] NSWSC 1276 at [66]). Vanstone J referred to the Supreme Court of Victoria decision in <span class="font-italic">Re Tyrie (deceased) (No 1)</span> [1972] VR 168 (“<span class="font-italic">Re Tyrie</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Re Tyrie</span>, Newton J summarised the relevant principles and stated (at p 177) that “[a] gift by will to a particular charitable institution <span class="font-italic">simpliciter</span> must be treated as a gift for the advancement of the charitable work or purposes of that institution”, but that “a gift by will to a particular charitable institution … which at some time existed, but had ceased to do so in the testator’s lifetime, whether before or after the date of his will, ordinarily lapses”, referring to this second proposition as the “lapse rule”. Newton J then set out three exceptions to the “lapse rule”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Ceduna</span>, Vanstone J summarised these three exceptions to the “lapse rule” as follows (at [10]):  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(A) Where, at the testator’s death, there is another institution which has <span class="font-italic">taken over the work previously carried on by the named institution</span> and which <span class="font-italic">can properly be regarded as its successor</span>, and where the dominant charitable intention of the testator was wide enough to allow the gift to take effect in favour of that successor; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(B) Where the testator intended that the gift should operate as an <span class="font-italic">accretion to the assets of the named institution</span> and thereby became subject to other charitable trusts; and </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(C) Where, in cases outside (A) and (B), the testator is found to have had a <span class="font-italic">dominant intention</span> to benefit work or purposes of the kind which the named institution carried out, and it is practicable to apply the gift to work or purposes of that kind, in which case the gift will be applied by means of a <span class="font-italic">cy-près</span> scheme. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Canadian cases</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 There is also Canadian authority that adopts the principle in <span class="font-italic">Re Vernon’s Will</span>, without limiting it to unincorporated charities. In <span class="font-italic">Re Winding-up of the Christian Brothers of Ireland in Canada</span> 3 ITELR 34 (“<span class="font-italic">Christian Brothers</span>”), the Ontario Court of Appeal held (at [71]) that the courts maintain a supervisory power to ensure that gifts with charitable intent will not fail “even if the object of the gift is unclear or uncertain, or if the gift is directed to a charitable corporation which is misnamed or the corporation no longer exists”, citing <span class="font-italic">Re Vernon’s Will</span> and <span class="font-italic">Re Finger’s Trust</span>. The court referred (at [72]) to Buckley J’s proposition (quoted above at [33]), but then went further, stating (at [74]) that the “public policy which the courts wish to implement is to save charitable gifts and to apply them as far as possible to the purposes intended by the donor … To do that, <span class="font-italic">the court can determine that a gift was intended as a trust, even though left to a corporate </span><span class="font-italic">charity</span>, in order to save the gift where the particular corporate charity is no longer available to receive the gift” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Charitable gifts to altered charities</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Besides <span class="font-italic">Re Vernon’s Will</span> and <span class="font-italic">Re Finger’s Will</span>, there is another line of English cases which are of relevance of this case, including <span class="font-italic">Re Faraker</span>, <span class="font-italic">Re Lucas</span> and <span class="font-italic">Re Bagshaw</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>cited by NUHSF (above at [17]). They held that so long as there are funds held in trust for the purposes of a charity, the charitable purposes continue in existence and survive the end of a particular charitable institution. The charity is not destroyed by any alteration in name, constitution or machinery, or its objects made in accordance with law. The charitable gift simply vests in the charity so surviving or altered, or in a successor institution.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic">Re Faraker, Re Lucas,<span class="font-italic"> and </span>Re Bagshaw</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The first in this line of cases is <span class="font-italic">Re Faraker</span>. The testatrix in <span class="font-italic">Re Faraker </span>died in 1911 and bequeathed a legacy of £200 to a charity by the name of “Mrs Bailey’s Charity, Rotherhithe”. However, there was no known charity by that name. Instead, there was a charity known as “Hannah Bayly’s Charity” located at Rotherhithe (it was admitted that “Bailey” was a misspelling and Hannah Bayly’s Charity was intended by the testatrix). It was founded in 1756 by a testamentary disposition in the will of one Mrs Bayly, who created a charitable trust for the benefit of poor widows resident in, and parishioners of, St Mary Rotherhithe. In 1905, the charity commissioners sealed a scheme that consolidated Hannah Bayly’s Charity with thirteen other charities located in Rotherhithe, whereby the endowments of all the consolidated charities were applied for the benefit of “poor persons of good character resident in the parish of Rotherhithe” (at 491). There was no specific mention of widows in the scheme of consolidated charities, which benefited a wider group of persons, but pensions paid out to widows under Hannah Bayly’s Charity continued under the scheme and was indeed increased in amount (at 491). The testatrix’s executors took out an application to determine whether the legacy had lapsed. The judge at first instance decided that Hannah Bayly’s Charity had ceased to exist on account of the alteration of its constitution and because its objects had entirely changed, and accordingly held that the legacy had lapsed. However, this was reversed on appeal. The English Court of Appeal held that Hannah Bayly’s Charity was an endowed charity and <span class="font-italic">could not be destroyed</span>, notwithstanding the change to its objects in accordance with law. The consolidated charities were held to be entitled to the legacy. Cozens-Hardy MR held (at 493–494) that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Hannah Bayly’s Charity is not extinct, it is not dead … it cannot die</span>. Its objects may be changed, though not otherwise than in accordance with law: they may be changed either by the Court … in its own jurisdiction over charities or by schemes formed by the Charity Commissioners, to whom Parliament has entrusted that particular duty. Subject to that lawful alteration by competent authority of the objects, Hannah Bayly's Charity is not extinct … Now it is to be remembered … that this legacy <span class="font-italic">was not given to Mrs. Bayly's Charity for widows</span>; <span class="font-italic">it was simply given to a charity which is identified by name</span>. It was given to an ancient endowed charity, and in my opinion a gift of that kind carries with it the application of it according to the lawful objects of the charity funds for the time being … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Farwell LJ similarly held (at 495): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… in the scheme which [the charity commissioners] have issued dealing with the amalgamation of the several charities the objects are stated to be poor persons of good character resident in Rotherhithe, not mentioning widows in particular … But to say that this omission has incidentally destroyed the Bayly Trust is a very strained construction of the language and one that entirely fails, because the Charity Commissioners had no jurisdiction whatever to destroy the charity … In all these cases one has to consider not so much the means to the end as the charitable end which is in view, and <span class="font-italic">so long as that charitable end is well established the means are only machinery, and no alteration of the machinery can destroy the charitable trust for the benefit of which the machinery is provided</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The principle in <span class="font-italic">Re Faraker </span>was applied in <span class="font-italic">Re Lucas</span>. There, the testatrix bequeathed a £500 legacy to “the Crippled Children’s Home, Lindley Moore, Huddersfield” and a share of the residuary estate to “the Crippled Children’s Home”. Although there had been a home called “the Huddersfield Home for Crippled Children” located at Lindley Moor since 1916, which had as its primary (though not its sole) object the maintenance and operation of such a home (but not necessarily at that address) for the benefit of poor crippled children living within the Huddersfield district, it had been closed down in 1941, before the date of the will. The charity commissioners had applied its assets under a scheme to establish a new charity known the “The Huddersfield Charity for Crippled Children”, which had the object of sending poor crippled children to holiday or convalescent homes. There was therefore no longer any premises used as a home for crippled children at Lindley Moor. The judge at first instance held that the bequests had lapsed. On appeal, the English Court of Appeal held that the “essential primary purpose” of the charity survived and was preserved by the scheme “although the means originally prescribed of carrying out that purpose were altered to suit the altered circumstances” (at 426). The main question was whether the legacy took effect as a gift to “The Huddersfield Charity for Crippled Children” or lapsed upon the closing of the home at Lindley Moor (at 426). Lord Greene MR, delivering the judgment of the court, held that (at 426–427):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is settled by authority binding upon this court that <span class="font-italic">so long as there are funds held in trust for the purposes of a charity the charity continues in existence and is not destroyed by any alteration in its constitution or objects</span> made by a scheme under the Charitable Trusts Act: see <span class="font-italic">In re Faraker</span> … Accordingly, if the gifts made by the testatrix were upon their true construction <span class="font-italic">gifts to the charity … for the objects of the Huddersfield Home for Crippled Children</span> as defined by the deed, they took effect as gifts to that same charity in the reconstituted form in which it was continued under the scheme, that is to say as gifts in augmentation of the funds held by the trustees appointed by the scheme for the modified objects thereby prescribed.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">On the other hand, it is equally well settled that (in the absence of general charitable intention which is not in question here) a gift for a particular charitable purpose which has <span class="font-italic">wholly failed</span> is subject to the ordinary doctrine of lapse: see <span class="font-italic">In re Rymer</span> Accordingly if the testatrix's gifts were on their true construction <span class="font-italic">gifts for the upkeep of the premises at Lindley Moor as a home for crippled children and for no other purpose, they lapsed</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The English Court of Appeal then held that had the testatrix had intended for the legacy to be limited to the upkeep of the particular home, she would not simply have named “the Crippled Children’s Home” without adding “some specific reference to its upkeep or maintenance”, and added (at 428):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The mere fact that the testatrix when she made her will was under the impression that the particular home was still being carried on in the premises at Lindley Moor (and this is we think a legitimate inference from the terms of the gift) is clearly <span class="font-italic">no indication that she intended to benefit only and exclusively the particular home as distinct from the charity carrying it on</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In sum, the English Court of Appeal held that in “the absence of any words in the will to indicate that the gifts were to be held for <span class="font-italic">some special or restricted </span><span class="font-italic">purpose</span> as distinct from the general purposes of the charity”, the gift was for the purposes of the charity and the legacy was valid notwithstanding the fact that the charity had ceased to exist at the date of the will (at 429). I note that the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Re Lucas</span> was that the gift operated as an accretion to the assets of a named institution, being exception (B) identified by Vanstone J<span class="font-italic"> </span>in <span class="font-italic">Ceduna</span> (above at [40]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 <span class="font-italic">Re Faraker </span>and <span class="font-italic">Re Lucas </span>were then followed in <span class="font-italic">Re Bagshaw</span>. The testatrix in that case had bequeathed her entire estate to a charitable institution known as “Bakewell and District War Memorial Cottage Hospital” by her will dated 1942. This hospital was founded in 1921 as an unincorporated charity governed by certain rules, and its funds were held by trustees pursuant to a trust deed. The object of the institution was the provision of accommodation and facilities for poor residents within a five mile radius from Memorial Cross in Bakewell who were suffering from disease or bodily injury. By resolutions passed in 1946 and 1947, after the will was executed, the governing body of the charity, pursuant to and in accordance with powers contained in its rules and the trust deed, altered: (a) the name of the institution to the “Bakewell and District 1914-18 War Memorial Charity”; and (b) the objects of the institution to include charitable purposes other than the cottage hospital, namely the provision of hospital and medical benefits to residents of the parish of Bakewell, and surrounding parishes within a five mile radius from Memorial Cross in Bakewell, as well as relief for ex-soldiers who had served in World War I and II. In other words, the objects of the charity ceased to be for the purpose of providing a hospital for poor people suffering from disease or bodily injury within the limited district prescribed under the original trust and expanded to provide more general hospital and medical benefits. In 1948, the NHSA came into force and, consequently, the charity and its assets vested in the government. Thereafter, a hospital carried on in the same building under the new name. However, certain funds of the original institution were not taken under the NHSA, and in 1949 a new set of rules were adopted for the institution with its new name and new objects. The testatrix died in 1951 without having altered her will. The bequest was claimed by the charity under its new name, as well as the next-of-kin. The court held that the claim of the next-of-kin must fail at the outset, since the bequest could only be either a gift for the charity which still existed, or for the purpose designated by the description in the will. The court noted that, in <span class="font-italic">Re Faraker </span>and <span class="font-italic">Re Lucas</span>, the charity’s objects and name were altered by a scheme established either by the court of the charity commissioners. It was “well established” that “a charity founded as a perpetual charity can never come to an end, even though its objects and its name may be altered according to due process of law”. Accordingly, the court held that there is <span class="font-italic">no distinction</span> in principle between, on one hand, the alteration of the objects and name of a charity by a scheme established by an “outside body” such as the courts or the charity commissioners, and, on the other, alteration through the provisions of the trust deed. In either case, the charity remained the same charity, although its name and its objects have been altered. The gift was a gift for the general purposes of the Bakewell and District War Memorial Cottage Hospital, and was thus payable to the trustees of the Bakewell and District 1914-18 War Memorial Charity (at 241).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In <span class="font-italic">Re Vernon’s Will</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Buckley J did not consider the applicability of the principles in the <span class="font-italic">Re Faraker</span> lines of cases to depend on whether the charity was unincorporated or incorporated.

</div> <span class="font-italic">Re Stemson’s Will </span>also deserves consideration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In <span class="font-italic">Re Stemson’s Will</span>, the testator intended to bequeath the residue of his estate to an incorporated charity, the “Rationalist Endowment Fund Ltd” (the “REF”), by way of a will dated 1950. REF had been incorporated in 1938 for the purposes of receiving charitable donations on behalf of the Rationalist movement. It was undisputed that REF was a charity for the advancement of education (in particular, the study of Rationalist philosophy and ethics) and the relief of poverty. The testator passed in 1966. REF, however, had been dissolved by special resolution in 1965, after the execution of the will and during the testator’s lifetime. REF’s assets had been transferred to an incorporated charity, the Rationalist Press Association Ltd (the “RPA”), pursuant to cl 7 of REF’s memorandum of association, which provided:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If upon the winding-up or dissolution of the fund there remains … any property whatsoever, the same shall not be paid to or distributed among the members of the fund, but shall be given or transferred to some <span class="font-italic">other</span> institution or institutions having objects similar to the objects of the fund … such institution or institutions to be determined by the members of the fund at or before the time of dissolution … and if and so far as effect cannot be given to the aforesaid provision, then to some charitable object …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">RPA was registered as a charity in 1963. In contrast to REF, the RPA did not have as an object the relief of poverty, but was focused only on the advancement of education (in particular, the study of Rationalist philosophy and ethics). Nevertheless, the functions that were previously performed by REF were, after REF’s dissolution, performed by RPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Notably, it was conceded in <span class="font-italic">Re Stemson’s Will</span> that the testator’s gift was “a <span class="font-italic">gift to a charitable corporation as such</span> and is <span class="font-italic">not</span> a gift for charitable purposes” [emphasis added] (at 24D). Plowman J also held that the will disclosed no general charitable intention, as cl 5 of the will showed that the testator was particularly relying on REF to carry out his wishes (at 24E). It is helpful, as an illustration, to reproduce the degree of detail and specificity with which cl 5 of the will was drafted:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I give devise and bequeath all the rest residue and remainder of my estate … unto the Rationalist Endowment Fund Ltd. (hereinafter called 'the association') absolutely … and I request that <span class="font-italic">the said association shall … apply the residue for the purpose of founding a hostel for the benefit of rationalists in reduced circumstances especially as this appears to be one of the objects in the memorandum of the association</span> and also in view of the fact that <span class="font-italic">the association are aware of my wishes in this respect</span> but I declare that such request shall not create any trust … or make any obligation … but I declare that when the association shall apply the residue in accordance with my wishes they shall if possible inform and consult my executor.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Plowman J recognised (at 24F–G) that the principle in <span class="font-italic">Re Faraker</span>, <span class="font-italic">Re Lucas</span>, and <span class="font-italic">Re Bagshaw</span> was “well settled”, that “so long as there are funds held in trust for the purposes of a charity, the charity does not cease to exist but continues in existence and is not destroyed by an alteration in its constitution or objects made in accordance with law”, but noted (at 24H) that those cases did not deal with an incorporated charity liable to voluntary dissolution, but rather to “a charity founded as a perpetual charity”. Plowman J went on to consider <span class="font-italic">Re Roberts</span>, concluding that the principle in <span class="font-italic">Re Faraker</span> was not regarded as being applicable to the case of an incorporated charity liable to voluntary dissolution (at 27E–F). After considering <span class="font-italic">Re Vernon’s Will</span>, he then held that (at 28H–29A): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… a charitable trust, which no one has power to terminate, retains its existence despite such vicissitudes as schemes, amalgamations and change of name so long as it has any funds … where funds come to the hands of a charitable organisation such as R.E.F., which is founded, not as a perpetual charity but one liable to termination, and its constitution provides for the disposal of its funds in that event, then if the organisation ceases to exist and its funds are disposed of, the charity or charitable trust itself ceases to exist and there is nothing to prevent the operation of the doctrine of lapse.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Therefore, per <span class="font-italic">Re Stemson’s Will</span>, whether a gift to a charity that has ceased to exist will lapse, depends on whether it was terminated voluntarily.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Analytical framework</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I have adopted the following framework for my analysis, drawing on the authorities in Singapore, England, Australia, and Canada, as set out above.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Where there is a gift by will to a named charity, has the named charity ceased to exist in the lifetime of the testator, whether before or after the date of the will?  </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) In examining whether the gift is to a particular named charity, a benignant interpretation is to be accorded (above at [28]–[29]). A mere misnaming will not vitiate the gift. For example, the gift <span class="font-italic">need not</span> state the precise legal or registered name of a charity before the gift can be construed as a gift to a charity of matching description. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) In examining whether the named charity has ceased to exist, there should be consideration of whether the charity existed in substance in the form of a charitable trust. If the charity or its governing body has ceased to operate as an institution, but the underlying charitable trust has not been dissolved and continues to exist (for example, where the trust fund has not been exhausted or dissipated), the gift has not lapsed and will accrue in favour of the charitable trust.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) In examining whether the named charity has ceased to exist, the focus should be on substance over form. A mere change in name or an alteration in objects will not mean that a charity has ceased to exist (above at [42]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If the named charity (<span class="font-italic">regardless</span> of whether it is incorporated or unincorporated) has ceased to exist, (1) can the gift be construed as a gift for the purposes of the named charity on a benignant construction of the will, or (2) can the gift <span class="font-italic">only</span> be construed as being intended for the particular named charitable institution <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, in the sense that the continued existence of the named institution is <span class="font-italic">essential</span> to the gift (above at [32]–[35], [40], [44])?</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) In construing the gift, a gift to a named charity <span class="font-italic">without more </span>raises the inference that the gift is to the purposes of the named charity (see also, the discussion below at [87]–[90]).</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) In applying a benignant construction, the court will generally find that the gift is for charitable purposes. However, the court will not strain the will (above at [28]–[29]). For example, if the gift contains detailed provisos that express a clear intention that the gift is <span class="font-italic">exclusively</span> intended to be restricted <span class="font-italic">only</span> to specific persons, particular structures, or a specific locality, the limited character of the gift should not be ignored.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) If the gift can be construed as being for the purpose of the named charity, the gift will not lapse if: (1) substantially the same purpose of that named charity was continued on, as a matter of fact, (2) by what can properly and reasonably be regarded as a successor of that named charity. The dissolution of the institutional form does not terminate the charitable purpose so long as that purpose is still capable of being carried out. The gift will accrue in favour of the successor (above at [35], [40] and [44]–[46]).</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Whether or not the same charitable purpose continues to be carried out, and whether or not there exists a successor, is again a matter of substance over form. The same purpose may continue to be carried out as a matter of fact, even if the objects of the successor are broader than that of the original named charity. Successors include, but are not limited to, amalgamated or consolidated charities. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) If no such successor exists, the gift will not lapse if the gift can be construed as an accretion to or augmentation of the assets of the named charity, which continue to be applied for charitable purposes. The gift will accrue in favour of the charity presently administering those funds.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) If no such successor exists, the gift will not lapse if the testator expressed a general charitable intent. The gift may be applied <span class="font-italic">cy-près</span>.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) If the gift is <span class="font-italic">only</span> to be construed as being intended for the particular named charitable institution <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, and for no other purpose, the gift will lapse.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I now set out my analysis in greater depth. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 It was held by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Low Ah Cheow</span> (at [19]–[20]) that “effect must be given to the intention of the testator at the time he made his will, as <span class="font-italic">declared and apparent</span> in the will”. However, extrinsic evidence will be admissible to aid in the construction of the will where the intention is ambiguous. In particular, where a charitable gift is in issue, it has been held by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Koh Lau Keow</span> (at [21]), that “where a bequest is capable of two constructions, one of which would make it void, and the other would make it effectual, the latter should be adopted … On the other hand, the court must not strain the will to gain money for charity”. This is the principle of benignant construction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 As the analysis of the Testator’s intention proceeds from the words of the Gift Clause, I restate them for convenience:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">upon the demise of my said wife my Trustees shall vest the said property to the National University Hospital Endowment Fund</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Notably, the intention of the Testator here was to vest the Property in “the National University Hospital Endowment Fund” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, NUHEF). What is apparent from the Gift Clause, is that the Gift is not a gift to an institution operating at any particular place or to a charity delimited by some specified locality, but a gift to what is indisputably a charitable <span class="font-italic">fund</span>, namely the NUHEF.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the charity has ceased to exist </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The first question is whether the named charity, NUHEF, has in substance ceased to exist. In my view, NUHEF and NUHPCF are undoubtedly the same charity, merely renamed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Counsel for the Executrix contends that, on the available evidence, NUHEF/NUHPCF was not an unincorporated association, but a charitable trust.

Rule 6.6 provides that the NUHEF Board of Trustees shall have power exercisable from time to time as they may in their absolute discretion think fit: (a) to champion the cause of NUHEF; (b) to assist in fundraising; (c) to appoint or set-up committee(s) or officers for the purpose of fund raising and keeping the appointed “Endowment Fund Administrator(s)” informed. In relation to the disbursement of the moneys for grants, rule 8 of the Rules of Operation 2005 sets out the approval authority structure. Disbursements above $500,000 require the approval of the NUH Board of Directors. Disbursements exceeding $50,000 but not more than $500,000, require the approval of any two of the following: (1) the Chairman of the NUHEF Board of Trustees; (2) the CEO of NUH; and (3) the Chairman of the Medical Board of NUH. All disbursements below $50,000 can be approved by the CEO of NUH or the Chairman of the Medical Board of NUH alone. Certain staff of NUH may approve disbursements below $10,000 in capital expenditure.

It had almost no involvement in the disbursements of the fund’s moneys. Only the Chairman of the NUHEF Board of Trustees could be involved where disbursements exceeded $50,000 but were below $500,000. Even then, his approval was not necessary where the CEO of NUH and the Chairman of the Medical Board of NUH provide their approval. The NUHEF Board of Trustees hence did not have the usual responsibilities of trustees in managing the use of the trust funds. Importantly, rule 6.1 of the Rules of Operation 2005 identifies NUH as the “Trustee of the Fund”.

Up to 2005, they were a “Management Committee”. Even after they were called a “Board of Trustees” in around 2005, they did not have powers and responsibilities resembling those of trustees of a trust. Instead, the role of the Board of Trustees was mainly in relation to stewardship and fundraising. In fact, NUH was consistently referred to as the trustee of the charitable trust.

The 10 October 2011 Board Paper highlighted the distinct advantages that would be brought by this corporate structure, such as enhanced corporate governance, limited liability cover, and more stringent regulatory compliance, which were not available to NUHPCF. As a company limited by guarantee, there would be a need for only one Board of Directors to oversee both NUHPCF and NUH HREF, whereas there were prior to that point separate boards for NUHPCF and NUH HREF. The 10 October 2011 Board Paper stated that the plan was to incorporate NUHPCF as a sub-fund within the umbrella fund.

There is no indication that the trust fund had been exhausted. The trust funds that were transferred from NUHPCF continued to be held on trust by NUHSF for the charitable purposes of NUHEF/NUHPCF. The trust funds were ring-fenced and dedicated for those purposes. It is clear from the documentary evidence that the NUHPCF Board of Trustees was not the trustees of the underlying charitable trust and did not have any power to dissolve it via the 4 June 2012 Resolution. The true trustee of NUHPCF, NUH, showed no intention (through the NUHS Board of Directors) of dissolving the underlying charitable trust when it approved of the transfer of funds to NUHSF. The de-registration of NUHPCF as a charity on 6 December 2012 pertains to its <span class="font-italic">registration status</span>, and does not detract from the continued existence of the underlying charitable trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 For completeness, I briefly address two further points raised by counsel for the Executrix.

</div>
</div>
</div> In my view, this letter was merely a public communication by NUHS of what would happen <span class="font-italic">in practical terms</span> and was not intended to be relied upon as a statement of the legal position in respect of the underlying charitable trust. The letter mainly informed the addressee of the need to bill new activities to NUHSF, and to ensure that outstanding invoices for NUHPCF were submitted before the cut-off date of 20 July 2012.

</div>
</div> In the totality of the evidence considered at [67]–[71] above, this letter is entirely consistent with NUHPCF simply being subsumed as a sub-fund under the NUHSF umbrella fund. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Second, counsel for the Executrix submits that the financial accounts provided by NUHS do not expressly state that the transferred funds were ring-fenced. However, it is trite that the absence of segregation does not render funds that are subject to a trust, any less a trust (see <span class="font-italic">Hinckley Singapore Trading Pte Ltd v Sogo Department Stores (S) Pte Ltd (under judicial management)</span> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 119 at [39], citing the well-established authority of <span class="font-italic">Re Kayford Ltd </span>[1975] 1 WLR 279). In any event, I am also satisfied that on the evidence, the funds transferred were intended to be ring-fenced, given that this was consistently stated in multiple sources, such as the 4 June 2012 Resolution, in NUHS’ external communications, and in NUHSF’s audited financial statements, which referred to the funds as “restricted funds” that could only be applied towards charitable purposes that were in substance the same as those of NUHPCF. They were restricted for application to only four programmes, which were the same as those that had been carried out by NUHPCF.

</div> This is clear evidence of the intention to continue to hold the funds on trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The Gift therefore did not lapse as the charitable trust underlying NUHEF/NUHPCF continues to exist.

On the facts, the question is whether the Testator intended to gift the Gift to NUHEF <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, or to gift the Gift to the charitable purposes of NUHEF.

The position is that every gift to a named unincorporated charity without more, must take effect as a gift for its charitable purposes, unless the continued existence of the named institution was <span class="font-italic">essential</span> to the gift. The Gift Clause provides for a gift to NUHEF <span class="font-italic">without more</span>. It discloses no details save for the beneficiary. Following <span class="font-italic">Re Vernon’s Will</span>, the Gift is for the charitable purposes of NUHEF.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Counsel for the Executrix refers to the <span class="font-italic">obiter </span><span class="font-italic">dictum</span> of Wilberforce J in <span class="font-italic">Re Roberts </span>(above at [21]), which appears to doubt that a gift to an unincorporated charity without more must take effect as a gift for charitable purposes. In my view, the <span class="font-italic">dictum</span> in <span class="font-italic">Re Roberts</span> does not go so far as to doubt the position in <span class="font-italic">Re Vernon’s Will</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In <span class="font-italic">Re Roberts</span>, the testatrix gifted the residue of her estate to six named charities, one of which was “the Sheffield Boys Working Home (Western Bank, Sheffield)”, by a will executed in 1930. The gift clause was bare, stating no more than the names of the six charities. The premises at Western Bank had been acquired in 1889 under a trust deed dated 19 October 1889. Clause 1 of the trust deed stated that the premises would be used for the “Sheffield Boys Working Home”, described as an institution for the benefit of orphan or destitute boys. Clauses 17 and 18 empowered the trustees to deal with the premises, and provided that the proceeds of any such sale were to be “added to the general funds of the charity”. Clause 19 provided that if the governors of the Sheffield Boys Working Home found that it cannot be efficiently kept up or ought to be discontinued, the premises could be sold by the trustees, with the proceeds to be paid to other “charitable institutions of the town of Sheffield” or for “for such other purposes for the benefit of the poor inhabitants of Sheffield”. In 1945, after the date of the testatrix’s will, the Sheffield Boys Working Home closed and the premises were sold. The assets were then transferred to the “Sheffield Town Trust”, a trust which concerned a wide variety of purposes connected with Sheffield. The testatrix passed in 1961 without changing her will. Referring first to the “well-known cases” of <span class="font-italic">Re Faraker</span>, <span class="font-italic">Re Lucas</span> and <span class="font-italic">Re Bagshaw</span>, Wilberforce J considered that the principle in those cases <span class="font-italic">did not necessarily</span> apply to a case where the trustees of a charity had express powers to terminate the charity. Wilberforce J then said (at 414):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Is this a gift to a particular institution at a particular place, or should it be treated as a gift for charitable purposes, the purposes for which the home was originally established?</span> That is a question of construction as was stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">In re Lucas</span>, and, apparently, of course, a question of what in fact the trusts of the charity are. The mere fact that there is a gift to an unincorporated charity does not seem to me to be enough to enable me to come to the conclusion that it is a gift for charitable purposes … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The specific <span class="font-italic">dictum</span> that is relied upon by counsel for the Executrix (above at [21]) had been analysed by Goff J in <span class="font-italic">Re Finger’s Will</span> (at 296E–297C). Goff J did not find that <span class="font-italic">Re Roberts</span> doubted <span class="font-italic">Re Vernon’s Will</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and held that there was nothing in <span class="font-italic">Re Roberts</span> that seriously conflicted with <span class="font-italic">Re Vernon’s Will</span>. Goff J explained that the <span class="font-italic">dict</span><span class="font-italic">um</span> of Wilberforce J in <span class="font-italic">Re Roberts</span> must be taken in the context of the question which Wilberforce J had previously posed for himself (emphasised above in italics). Goff J highlighted that the gift in <span class="font-italic">Re Roberts</span> was <span class="font-italic">not</span> a gift to a named unincorporated charity generally, but a gift specifically to a “home” (the Sheffield Boys Working Home), “which describes something having a physical existence” (at 296H). Wilberforce J was therefore not concerned with whether the gift was a purpose gift. Wilberforce J assumed that it was. In Goff J’s view, Wilberforce J was not considering in <span class="font-italic">Re Roberts</span> any distinction between gifts to corporate and unincorporated bodies. The most that could be said of the <span class="font-italic">dict</span><span class="font-italic">um</span> was that Wilberforce J was looking for some positive indication that the purposes of the gift were general and not tied to the particular body and Wilberforce J indeed concluded that it was general, as Goff J observed, “without any real context affirmatively to show that” (<span class="font-italic">Re Finger’s Will</span> at 297A).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Moreover, I observe further that, as can be seen from the extract of <span class="font-italic">Re Roberts</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>above,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Wilberforce J expressly followed <span class="font-italic">Re Lucas</span>. As I have canvassed, the question in <span class="font-italic">Re Lucas</span> was whether a gift to the “Crippled Children’s Home, Lindley Moore, Huddersfield” was either (a) a gift for the purposes of upkeeping the premises at Lindley Moor as a home for crippled children as distinct from the charity carrying it on, and for no other purpose; or (b) a gift for the general purposes of the charity. The English Court of Appeal concluded that unless there were clear and specific words that indicated that the gifts were for “some special or restricted purpose as distinct from the general purposes of the charity”, the gift was for the charity’s general purposes (above at [44]). This analysis was evidently followed by Wilberforce J in <span class="font-italic">Re Roberts</span>, as he ultimately held that although the gift was to “Sheffield Boys Working Home” without more, the gift of the testatrix in her will was for the <span class="font-italic">purposes</span> of an institution. It “was not so <span class="font-italic">exclusively</span> tied up with a <span class="font-italic">particular home physically located on the premises</span>” such that Wilberforce J would have to find that when the physical home at Western Bank ceased to exist, the charity ended (<span class="font-italic">Re Roberts</span> at 415). Wilberforce J accordingly distinguished both <span class="font-italic">Re Rymer</span>, a case which he noted had “not received much favour in the courts”, and <span class="font-italic">Re Harwood</span>, with the former being a case where the gift was “of a particularly local character by reason not only of the gift itself but by reason of the other context in the will” and the latter concerning “a gift to a very particular society for a very special purpose” (at 415–416). Both are cases relied on by counsel for the Executrix for the proposition that a general charitable intention should be difficult to find if a particular charitable institution has been selected and care has been taken to identify it as the beneficiary of the gift, but that charitable institution ceased to exist before the date of the testator’s demise (above at [21]). In Wilberforce J’s view, the antecedent question is necessarily that of whether the charity had <span class="font-italic">in fact </span>ceased to exist, taking into account the circumstance of the charity and the available information (<span class="font-italic">Re Roberts</span> at 416).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In addition, Wilberforce J considered whether cl 19 of the trust deed (above at [79]) meant that the trustees had the power to terminate the charity. He held that, on the facts, the trustees did not have such power. To answer this question, Wilberforce J first identified “what really was the charity”, and concluded that it had two elements: first, the premises at Western Bank, and second, some other funds. This was sufficient for Wilberforce J to conclude that the trust deed dated 19 October 1889 did not <span class="font-italic">also</span> govern the charitable trusts relating to those funds (<span class="font-italic">Re Roberts</span> at 415). If the purposes of the charitable trusts relating to the funds could still be carried out, they must remain the subject of charitable trusts. Accordingly, by cl 19 of the trust deed, the trustees <span class="font-italic">could not </span>terminate the <span class="font-italic">entire charity</span>, but were only given the power to decide that the particular machinery of the home at Western Bank could not be carried on at particular premises which no longer existed. He therefore found that the charitable purposes of the charity could not be and was not put to an end, citing <span class="font-italic">Re Faraker</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">Re Roberts </span>at 416).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 From the above examination of the decision in <span class="font-italic">Re Roberts</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and Goff J’s analysis of the specific <span class="font-italic">dictum</span> in <span class="font-italic">Re Finger’s Will</span>, I do not think it can be said that Wilberforce J was doubting the proposition in <span class="font-italic">Re Vernon’s Will</span>. Rather, <span class="font-italic">Re Roberts</span> illustrates the approach of favouring upholding charitable gifts and shows that a great degree of specificity is required before a gift will be construed to be of a limited character.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Furthermore, I note that in England, the courts have continued to endorse the principle in <span class="font-italic">Re Vernon’s Will</span>, for example in <span class="font-italic">Re Koeppler</span>, <span class="font-italic">Kings</span>, and <span class="font-italic">Macintyre </span>(above at [35]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 While the Australian and Canadian authorities adopt a similar approach to unincorporated charities, they do not adopt the distinction made in <span class="font-italic">Re Vernon’s Will</span> between incorporated and unincorporated charities (above at [36]–[41]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 There is therefore, minimally, a common thread running through the authorities in England, Australia and Canada, which is that the courts will generally apply a presumption that gifts to named unincorporated charities are gifts to the charitable purposes of that charity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 As the Gift here does not involve an incorporated charity as the intended beneficiary, the issue of whether this approach should also apply to incorporated charities (per the Australian and Canadian approach) or if a distinction should be made between incorporated and unincorporated charities (per the English approach following<span class="font-italic"> Re Vernon’s Will</span>), does not strictly arise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 However, I would observe, that taking a testator’s expressed intention as set out in a will as the starting point of analysis, it will not usually be apparent that a testator would have considered the corporate or unincorporated form of a charity when making the testamentary disposition. I accept the force of counsel for the Executrix’s submission that lay testators would not typically address their mind to this distinction. Following such a distinction could lead to what Goff J described as “anomalous results” in <span class="font-italic">Re Finger’s Will</span>. It could certainly result in arbitrary outcomes that are at variance with the testator’s actual intentions, especially as the specific machinery chosen by a charity and whether or not such a charity might cease to exist prior to the date of the testator’s death are in the usual case matters outside of their knowledge and control. Neither has there been any distinction made between gifts to unincorporated charities and incorporated charities in our local jurisprudence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The principle of benignant construction of charitable gifts as set out in <span class="font-italic">Koh Lau Keow</span> was made without such distinction. It applies to gifts to both unincorporated charities and incorporated charities. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Khoo Jeffrey</span> also did not draw a distinction between unincorporated and incorporated forms when it held (at [33]) that a “distinction must be drawn between a charitable purpose and the institutional form (<span class="font-italic">be it an unincorporated </span><span class="font-italic">association, individuals, or a company</span>) through which the charitable purpose is effected or administered” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In my view, there is much to commend the certainty and predictability brought about by the Australian approach, which does not follow the distinction stated in <span class="font-italic">Re Vernon’s Will</span>. Nevertheless, I leave that issue to be determined in an appropriate case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Gift was for charitable purposes</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Following the benignant construction accorded to charitable gifts as set out in <span class="font-italic">Koh Lau Keow</span> and bearing in mind the authorities in England, Australia and Canada as set out above, I consider that even if NUHPCF had ceased to exist, the Gift does not necessarily lapse, as the Gift was a gift for the charitable purposes of NUHEF. The Gift is not one that can <span class="font-italic">only</span> be construed as being intended for NUHEF <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, in the sense that the continued existence of NUHEF in a wholly unaltered form is <span class="font-italic">essential</span> to the gift.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In my view, such a reading does not strain the Gift Clause or the Will. I reiterate that it is undisputed that the Gift Clause was bare as to any detailed or specific purpose. It was a gift to NUHEF <span class="font-italic">without more</span>. There is nothing in the language of the Gift Clause which indicates a particular intention to gift an institution <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, or to a particular building or locality, where there might arguably be a stronger case that construing the Gift as a gift for charitable purposes would strain the Will. Unlike a gift that is specific to a particular building or particular locality, as in <span class="font-italic">Re Spence</span> (“The Blind Home Scott Street Keighley and the Old Folks Home at Hillworth Lodge Keighley for the benefit of the patients”), or in <span class="font-italic">Re Rymer</span> (“to the rector for the time being of St. Thomas’ Seminary for the education of priests in the diocese of Westminster for the purposes of such seminary”), the Gift in this case was to an “Endowment Fund”, NUHEF, which cannot be tied to any particular locality, and can only be applied for purposes. A charitable fund is a pool of money applied for charitable purposes. It likewise cannot be contended that the Gift was for the upkeep of a particular building or premises (see <span class="font-italic">Re Broadbent</span> at [36] and [44]). However, I should note that even in in <span class="font-italic">Re Roberts</span>, Wilberforce J found that the gift to “Sheffield Boys Working Home” was for charitable purposes (see [80]–[81] above). Indeed, this was the case in <span class="font-italic">Re Faraker</span>, <span class="font-italic">Re Lucas</span> and <span class="font-italic">Re Bagshaw</span>, where the gifts were all expressed in relation to some structure (“Mrs Bailey’s Charity, Rotherhithe”, “the Crippled Children’s Home, Lindley Moore, Huddersfield”, and “Bakewell and District War Memorial Cottage Hospital”), but the real question was whether the charitable purposes continued to exist, as a matter of fact. Finally, the Gift Clause does not set out rich details that are specific to the named charitable institution, that could suggest that it is exclusively intended to be limited to some special application. It is quite unlike the gift in <span class="font-italic">Re Stemson’s Will</span> (above at [49]) or in <span class="font-italic">Re Rymer</span> (see <span class="font-italic">Re Rymer</span> at 28–29). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 In my judgment, there is nothing in the language of the Gift Clause which indicates a particular intention to gift to NUHEF as a “charitable institution” <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, rather than to the charitable purposes of NUHEF. It is in fact difficult to describe a fund (such as NUHEF) as a “charitable institution” in any way that is meaningfully distinct from its existence as a pool of money to be applied for charitable purposes. It cannot be conceptualised otherwise. The name of the fund, “National University Hospital Endowment Fund”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a fund for the purposes of the hospital, is on its face suggestive that the fund is for charitable purposes. The raison d'être of NUHEF/NUHPCF is to apply funds for charitable purposes. The Gift, being a gift to a fund, is a gift for the charitable purposes of NUHEF/NUHPCF. This finding does not require straining the Gift Clause or the Will.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Continuing with the assumption that NUHPCF has ceased to exist, the question which follows is whether substantially the same charitable purposes of NUHEF/NUHPCF continued through NUHSF, as its successor. This in turn raises two sub-issues: (a) whether it could be said that substantially the same charitable purposes of NUHEF/NUHPCF continued on, as a matter of fact, through NUHSF; and (b) whether NUHSF could properly and reasonably be regarded as the successor of NUHEF/NUHPCF.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The same charitable purposes continued </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Counsel for the Executrix submits that where a charity has the power to voluntarily terminate itself, and does so, that charity ceases to exist and there is nothing to prevent the gift from lapsing, citing <span class="font-italic">Re Stemson</span><span class="font-italic">’s Will</span> for the proposition that the principle in <span class="font-italic">Re Faraker</span>, <span class="font-italic">Re Lucas</span> and <span class="font-italic">Re Bagshaw</span> does not apply. This submission depends on a prior finding that the Gift was a gift to NUHEF as a charitable institution <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, rather than a gift to its charitable purposes.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> As I have explained, <span class="font-italic">Re Stemson</span><span class="font-italic">’s Will</span> was a case where the gift was made to the charitable corporation <span class="font-italic">as such</span>, and was not concerned with gifts for charitable purposes (above at [49]). I have already found that the Gift was a gift for charitable purposes. Furthermore, <span class="font-italic">Re Stemson</span><span class="font-italic">’s Will</span> was a case where it was undisputed that the charity in question, REF, had completely ceased to exist, and RPA was an entirely different charitable institution, rather than a successor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 While I agree that whether a charity has the power to voluntarily terminate itself might be a relevant consideration, in my respectful view, that cannot be the end of the enquiry. There is no principled basis not to consider whether the same charitable purposes continued to be carried out, even after an apparent voluntary dissolution. In <span class="font-italic">Re Vernon’s Will</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Buckley J did not consider a change to the mechanical aspect through which the charity held property and managed its affairs would mean that the charity, as distinct from the institutional mechanism it employed, would cease to exist (above at [46]). As was held by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Khoo</span> <span class="font-italic">Jeffrey</span> (at [33]), there is a distinction between the charitable purpose and the institutional form. The “dissolution of the institutional form <span class="font-italic">does not terminate the charitable purpose</span> as long as that purpose is still capable of being carried out”. Hence, even where there is a voluntary dissolution of a charity, the facts of each individual case must be considered to assess if the same charitable purposes continue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 On the evidence, I find that NUHSF was pursuing and continuing the same charitable purposes as NUHPCF. I accept NUHSF’s submissions, and the evidence of Ms Geraldine Goh, an officer of NUHSF, that there was no substantive change to the charitable purposes of NUHEF/NUHPCF. Any amendments that had been made were clarificatory in nature (above at [14] and [19]). Counsel for the Executrix did not contend otherwise. I am also satisfied that the objects of NUHEF/NUHPCF are included in the objects of NUHSF, and that NUHSF continues to hold the funds for the same charitable purposes as NUHEF/NUHPCF.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">NUHSF was the successor of NUHPCF</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In relation to the second sub-issue, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether NUHSF can properly and reasonably be regarded as the successor of NUHEF/NUHPCF, I find that the evidence shows that NUHSF took custody of the funds of NUHPCF and was its successor. There are several factors pointing to this conclusion:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The documentary evidence confirms that the funds of NUHPCF were directly transferred to NUHSF (above at [70]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) It is undisputed that NUHSF was planned to take over the functions and purposes previously carried out by NUHPCF, and the purported dissolution of NUHPCF was directly brought about as a consequence of the incorporation of NUHSF as its replacement;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) NUHSF was held out to third-parties as the successor of NUHPCF;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) It was expressly intended, and NUHSF did in fact carry out and pursue the same charitable purposes as NUHPCF; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The same funds were applied to the same four programs in NUHSF as they had been in NUHPCF.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Following from the above, even if NUHEF had ceased to exist, I find that on a benignant construction of the Gift Clause, without straining the Will, the Gift was to the charitable purposes of NUHEF, and that the same charitable purposes continued through NUHSF, which was its successor. Accordingly, the Gift did not lapse and the sale proceeds of the Property are therefore to go to NUHSF as the successor of NUHEF/NUHPCF.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In view of the above, I find that the Property should vest in NUHSF, pursuant to the Gift Clause.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 As NUHSF has succeeded, they are entitled to costs. NUHSF submits for the quantum of $30,000 in costs plus reasonable disbursements, in the event that they succeed. The Executrix agreed that this was fair. I consider the quantum sought by NUHSF to be reasonable and award NUHSF costs in the amount of $30,000 plus reasonable disbursements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 The parties agree that in the event the court interprets the Gift Clause in favour of NUHSF, NUHSF’s party-and-party costs, as well as legal expenses incurred in defending OA 510, shall be paid out from the Estate. I so order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 I wish to record my gratitude for the able assistance provided by counsels, Mr Kenneth Tan SC, Mr Christopher Yong, and Professor Tang Hang Wu, who provided thoughtful responses to the court’s queries and assisted with further research on the applicable positions in England, Australia, and Canada at my request.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Kwek Mean Luck<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Wee Kheng Kenneth Michael SC (Kenneth Tan Partnership) (instructed), Yong Shu Wei Christopher, Tan Yun Hao Alson, and Lui Shi Qi Claudia (Legal Solutions LLC) for the claimant; </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tang Hang Wu (TSMP Law Corporation) (instructed), Lek Siang Pheng, Sim Mei Jun Audrey (Shen Meijun), and Tan Yi Xi Joie (Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP) for the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
