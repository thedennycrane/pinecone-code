<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>

</p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="3" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">1.    This is an action in which Wellform Construction Pte Ltd (Wellform

Construction) is the plaintiff. It claimed an account from the defendant Lay Sing Construction

Pte Ltd (Lay Sing).

</p><p align="justify">2.    Lay Sing had taken over two building projects regarding

Canossa Convent School (9702) on the one hand, Canossaville Childrens Home and Magdelenes

Kindergarten (9901) on the other hand. They were referred to as Phase 1 and 2 respectively in the

proceedings.

</p><p align="justify">3.    The parties had a joint venture agreement in which both

would manage and do the work. Payment by the owner would be made first to Lay Sing and the net

profits were to be shared 30:70 as between Wellform Construction and Lay Sing respectively.

</p><p align="justify">4.    On 12 May 2000 an order was made by an Assistant Registrar

in which directions were given for the taking of accounts in order to determine what amount, if any,

was payable by Lay Sing to Wellform Construction. The order, inter alia, directed that Lay Sing was

to file an affidavit by 31 May 2000 exhibiting an auditors report as well as depose that full

discovery of relevant documents was made available to the auditors for their report. Wellform

Construction was to file an affidavit by 21 June 2000 deposing to the profits and expenses in

relation to the auditors report as well as exhibit a list of queries.

</p><p align="justify">5.    The report was done by Chio Lim &amp; Associates (Chio

Lim) but it turned out during cross-examination that the report was only for Phase 1 and not for

Phase 2. Lay Sing should have ensured that it was for both phases but did not. Indeed no

satisfactory reason was given as to this unsatisfactory state of affairs. It gave the impression

that Lay Sing had not been candid with Chio Lim and with the court.

</p><p align="justify">6.    Chio Lims report dated 20 June 2000 showed that the net

profit for Phase 1 was $158,397.68.

</p><p align="justify">7.    On the other hand, Wellform Construction produced print-outs

obtained from Lay Sings computer which showed a set of accounts prepared by Lay Sing for Phase 1

and for Phase 2. The print-outs were exhibited in its affidavit in reply. There was no list of

queries as such in this affidavit in reply.

</p><p align="justify">8.    Mr David Ong, for Lay Sing, argued that Wellform

Construction was not entitled to object to the report by Chio Lim as it did not, in his affidavit in

reply, filed on 8 August 2000, state a list of queries on the report although he informed me that a

list of queries was filed on the day of the hearing before the Assistant Registrar. I do not think

this is a valid argument.

</p><p align="justify">9.    In the first place, the report by Chio Lim did not comply

with the order of court of 12 May 2000 in that it did not cover both phases as was intended. As Lay

Sing had failed to obtain a report which complied with the order, Wellform Construction did not have

to list out its queries as regards the report.

</p><p align="justify">10.    In any event, the purpose of the order of 12 May 2000 was

for Wellform Construction to indicate to Lay Sing, by the list of queries, what objection it had to

the report. In exhibiting the accounts prepared by Lay Sing for Phase 1 and 2 and which, for Phase

1, were different from Chio Lims report, Wellform Construction had made it clear to Lay Sing that

it did not agree with the report and preferred to rely on the accounts prepared by Lay Sing itself.

</p><p align="justify">11.    As regards Phase 1, work thereon had been completed by 20

December 1998 and Lay Sings accounts for this phase were prepared in April 1999.

</p><p align="justify">12.    The last page of the accounts prepared by Lay Sing for

Phase 1 showed that the profit was $1,394,629.66 as follows:

</blockquote>
<p align="justify">13.    There was no satisfactory explanation by Lay Sing or Chio

Lim as to why, for Phase 1, there was this huge difference between the profit figure from the

accounts prepared by Lay Sing on the one hand in April 1999 ($1,394,629.66) and from the report

prepared by Chio Lim in June 2000 ($158,397.68). Neither Lay Sing or Chio Lim were asked by either

counsel to elaborate on the difference. It also appeared that Chio Lim may not have been aware of

the accounts prepared by Lay Sing for Phase 1.

</p><p align="justify">14.    The only explanations given by Mr Sim Lay Sing for Lay Sing

as regards the accounts for Phase 1 prepared by Lay Sing was that:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">a.    The accounts prepared by Lay Sing provided for an

  approximate payment to it of $1,132,650.86. However it actually received $868,883.18, ie. a

  reduction of $263,767.48.

  </p><p align="justify">b.    The profit element of $3,472,142.03 had excluded materials

  and preliminaries. The profit as reflected in such accounts was just an estimate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">15.    On 11 November 2000, the Assistant Registrar Ms Chong Chin

Chin made the following order:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">a. Phase 1</p>
<p align="justify">That the accounts prepared by the Defendants were preliminary accounts and did

  not account for overhead costs.</p>
<p align="justify">That there is no distinction between structural works and architectural

  work as alleged by the Defendants.</p>
<p align="justify">That the Plaintiffs are not bound by the agreement entered into by the

  Defendants and Chon Hwa Construction Pte. Ltd.</p>
<p align="justify">That the accounts prepared by Messrs. Chio Lim &amp; Associates for Phase 1 of

  the works in issue are correct. The profits earned by the Defendants in Phase 1 is a sum of

  $158,397.68.</p>
<p align="justify">b. Phase 2

  </p><p align="justify">The profits earned by the Defendants in Phase 2 is a sum of $328,447.74.</p>
<p align="justify">c. The Defendants Set-Off

  </p><p align="justify">The Defendants are entitled to set off these items against the Plaintiffs

  claim:</p>
<p align="justify">i. Set-off for the Ubi Project $41,729.00</p>
<p align="justify">ii. Advance payments $159,708.74</p>
<p align="justify">iii. Partial payment of profits $8,625.55</p>
<p align="justify">d. The total sum due to the Plaintiffs

  </p><p align="justify">The total sum due to the Plaintiffs from the Defendants, after the Defendants

  set-offs are accounted for, is a sum of $0.00.</p>
<p align="justify">e. The costs of this action is to the Plaintiffs, to be agreed to or taxed.

</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">16.    In doing So, Ms Chong, inter alia, adopted the profit

figure for Phase 1 as stated in the report prepared by Chio Lim.

</p><p align="justify">17.    Wellform Construction appealed against part of Ms Chongs

order on two grounds: (a) the Assistant Registrar was wrong to accept the profit figure for Phase 1

as stated in the accounts prepared by Chio Lim and (b) the Assistant Registrar should not have

allowed a further deduction of $159,708.74 from the sum to be paid by Lay Sing to Wellform

Construction as that sum had already been taken into account by Chio Lim.

</p><p align="justify">18.    On the other hand, Lay Sing also appealed against part of

Ms Chongs order. In the appeal before me, Lay Sing confined its appeal to that part of the order

which did not allow a further deduction of $80,000 from the profit figure for Phase 1, which $80,000

was allegedly paid by Lay Sing to another company as part of an earlier joint venture agreement

pertaining to Phase 1 and 2. This would have meant not only that no payment should be made by Lay

Sing to Wellform Construction but that Wellform Construction should make some payment to Lay Sing.

</p><p align="justify">19.    One of the arguments of Wellform Construction was that the

report of Chio Lim was not admissible as it was hearsay evidence even though Mr Y C Chee of Chio Lim

had given evidence. The argument of hearsay was that he had to rely on work done by his staff and he

had no personal knowledge about the documents which he had to consider.

</p><p align="justify">20.    I do not agree that the report was inadmissible. Mr Chee

was the person in charge of the report. He was entitled to rely on the work of his staff as one

cannot expect the person in charge to do everything himself. Also he did not need to have personal

knowledge of the documents which he considered. The weight to be given to the report was another

matter.

</p><p align="justify">21.    After hearing arguments and considering the documents, I

agree that the Assistant Registrar should not have accepted the report of Chio Lim in place of the

accounts prepared by Lay Sing.

</p><p align="justify">22.    The last page of the accounts for Phase 1 as prepared by

Lay Sing has been set out in paragraph 12 above. Although the fourth line from the bottom of the

accounts had the qualification that materials and preliminaries were excluded, the next line, ie.

the third line from the bottom, made a deduction of $2,376,548.85. This figure was derived from

another page of the accounts prepared by Lay Sing which showed a break-down, by each month, of the

costs for Phase 1 with separate columns for materials/machinery, wages (workers), staff salary and

others. The second line from the bottom showed an add back and the last line from the bottom showed

a net profit of $1,394,629.66.

</p><p align="justify">23.    It was therefore not accurate to look at the fourth line

from the bottom of the last page only and ignore the last three lines. Contrary to Mr Sims

assertion, Lay Sing had included cost of materials and preliminaries in this set of accounts to

arrive at the eventual net profit figure of $1,394,629.66.

</p><p align="justify">24.    Mr Ong sought to argue that only some and not all the

materials and preliminaries had been included in this set of accounts but that was not the evidence

of Mr Sim, who gave the impression that all had been excluded. Furthermore, no explanation was given

as to why Lay Sing should include some but exclude other expenses in its own attempt to determine

the profit for Phase 1.

</p><p align="justify">25.    Secondly, Chio Lim had to draw certain conclusions which

were not necessarily correct. For example, there was apparently no invoice to substantiate claims of

and payments to NSCs (nominated sub-contractors) and DSCs (direct sub-contractors) against Lay Sing

amounting to a total of $1,392,630.48.

</p><p align="justify">26.    Mr Chee was aware of this but said they had verified the

payments from alternative sources such as certification of payment and claims.

</p><p align="justify">27.    It was not clear from paragraphs 5.1.3 and 5.1.4 of the

report as to who had certified the payments to these sub-contractors, the architect or Lay Sing

itself.

</p><p align="justify">28.    According to the notes of evidence, Mr Chee had said that

for NSC claims, the payments were always approved by the architect. Even if this were so, it still

left open the question about the claims by the DSCs.

</p><p align="justify">29.    If payments to the DSCs had indeed been made as claimed by

Lay Sing, then there should be some other means of verifying the same such as by the cheque numbers,

if cheques were used, or by bank statements of Lay Sing.

</p><p align="justify">30.    Further or alternatively, verification could and should

have been obtained from the DSCs. This was not done.

</p><p align="justify">31.    During cross-examination at NE 22 line 23, Mr Sim said he

would produce evidence to substantiate the payments to the NSCs and DSCs but no evidence was

produced thereafter by him.

</p><p align="justify">32.    Another example of a conclusion drawn by Chio Lim which may

not be correct is their treatment of certain payments in 1999 by Lay Sing to Wellform Construction.

According to Mr Shahiran, acting for Wellform Construction, these payments totalled $159,708.74 but,

including GST, they actually totalled $164,500. Chio Lim had treated the payments as part of

expenses of Phase 1 but gave no reason why they did so.

</p><p align="justify">33.    According to Mr Sims second affidavit of 24 February

2000, paragraph 11.2, for Lay Sing, these payments were various advance payments to Wellform

Construction by way of a loan.

</p><p align="justify">34.    According to Mr Johnny Thngs second affidavit of 14

April 2000, paragraph 10, for Wellform Construction, these payments were part of payments made to

Wellform Construction for the purchase of raw materials to be used for our joint venture in the

Canossa Convent Project and they were therefore advance payments towards the joint-venture profit

and progress payments towards this amount.

</p><p align="justify">35.    Phase 1 had already been completed by 20 December 1998. I

did not see how payments in 1999 could be for payments of raw materials to be used for Phase 1

as contended by Mr Thng. Besides Mr Thngs affidavit was contradictory on this point. On the one

hand, he gave the impression that the payments were used to pay for expenses but yet on the other

hand, the second part of his paragraph 10 said, they were therefore advance payments towards the

joint venture profit . The two were inconsistent.

</p><p align="justify">36.    Thirdly, Mr Sim himself admitted during cross-examination

at NE 21 line 10 to 17 that the accounts for Phase 1 prepared by Lay Sing were correct.

</p><p align="justify">37.    I therefore conclude that based on those accounts, the

profit for Phase 1 was $1,394,629.66 subject to the qualification that since Lay Sing received a

payment of $868,883.18 instead of the anticipated payment of $1,132,650.66, the profit should be

reduced by the difference of $263,767.48 ie. it would then become $1,130,862.18 as follows:

</p><blockquote>
<table border="0" width="92%">
<tr>
<td width="78%">(a) Profit (including anticipated payment)</td>
<td width="22%">$1,394,679.66</td>

<tr>
<td width="78%">(b) Less $263,767.48 (being the difference between an anticipated and the

        actual payment)</td>

<td width="22%">$1,130,862.18</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="78%"></td>
<td width="22%">____________</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">38.    The profit for Phase 2 is agreed by the parties at

$328,447.74. This is based also on a set of accounts prepared by Lay Sing.

</p><p align="justify">39.    The total profit for Phases 1 and 2 is therefore

$1,459,309.92.

</p><p align="justify">40.    I now come to the second part of Wellform Constructions

appeal.

</p><p align="justify">41.    Mr Shahiran argued that as the Assistant Registrar had

accepted the set of accounts in the report by Chio Lim, then there was no need to deduct the

payments totaling $159,708.74 to Wellform Construction from the profit derived by Chio Lim as the

$159,708.74 had already been taken into account by Chio Lim in deriving the profit of $158,397.08.

Mr Ong agreed provided the profit figure as determined by Chio Lim was accepted by me and subject to

Lay Sings appeal that $80,000 should be deducted from the profit figure.

</p><p align="justify">42.    However, for Phase 1, I did not accept the profit figure

from the report by Chio Lim but from the accounts prepared by Lay Sing.

</p><p align="justify">43.    Mr Shahirans alternative argument regarding the

$159,708.74 was that this figure should be deducted as expenses from the profit for Phase 1 first

instead of deducting it from Wellform Constructions share of the profit as it was part of

expenses.

</p><p align="justify">44.    I do not agree with this argument. The $159,708.74 was paid

to Wellform Construction after Phase 1 had been completed. It was not paid as part of expenses for

Phase 1 but to account of Wellform Constructions share of the profit for Phase 1, as was

mentioned in the second part of paragraph 10 of Mr Thngs second affidavit (see para 35 above).

</p><p align="justify">45.    Accordingly, the deduction should be from Wellform

Constructions share of the profit for Phase 1 as determined by Lay Sing. The sum to be deducted

is $164,500 as this was the total sum received by Wellform Construction from the payments. As I have

mentioned in paragraph 32 above, the figure of $159,708.74 given by Mr Shahiran excluded the GST

which was received by Wellform Construction. This deduction is in addition to two other sums to be

deducted, which deductions were not disputed.

</p><p align="justify">46.    Therefore, subject to Lay Sings appeal, the balance

payable to Wellform Construction would be:

<p align="justify">47.    I now come to Lay Sings appeal against part of Ms Chongs

order which was argued before me. It was the part which did not take into account a sum of $80,000

allegedly paid by Lay Sing to another company, Chon Hwa Construction Pte Ltd (Chon Hwa)

pursuant to an alleged agreement between Lay Sing and Chon Hwa dated 21 June 1997 in which Lay Sing

purportedly agreed with Chon Hwa to set up a joint venture to carry out works pertaining to the

upgrading of Canossa Convent Primary School and the relocation of Canossian School for the Hearing

Impaired to the premises of Canossian Convent and the upgrading of Canossa Convent.

</p><p align="justify">48.    Under that agreement, Lay Sing purportedly agreed with Chon

Hwa that Chon Hwa should retain 1% of the Building Contract for the works.

</p><p align="justify">49.    The Building Contract is not defined although Lay

Sings position appeared to be that it pertains to both Phase 1 and 2.

</p><p align="justify">50.    Lay Sing alleged that it had subsequently by a sub-contract

agreement dated 29 January 2000, agreed to let Chon Hwa have $80,000 as its share of the profit from

Phase 1 and 2 and that this sum should be deducted from the profits to be shared with Wellform

Construction.

<p align="justify">52.    I do not see how that letter could substantiate the alleged

payment of $80,000 by Lay Sing to Chon Hwa. It dealt with a different project at No 4 Lorong M Telok

Kurau and the figure of $80,000 had nothing to do with the value of Chon Hwas contract for that

project which value was $4,510,000.

</p><p align="justify">53.    Furthermore, there was no evidence that the intended joint

venture between Lay Sing and Chon Hwa for Phase 1 and 2 had been carried out. Indeed, the evidence

was to the contrary as Lay Sing eventually ended up with Wellform Construction to carry out the

works for Phase 1 and 2. There was no reason why Lay Sing should let Chon Hwa have $80,000 for Phase

1 and 2 or why Wellform Construction should be affected by this.

</p><p align="justify">54.    It is quite clear to me that the sub-contract agreement

dated 29 January 2000 is but a desperate attempt by Lay Sing to try and reduce the profits of Phase

1 and 2 so as to reduce the payment it has to make to Wellform Construction.

</p><p align="justify">55.    Accordingly, I am of the view that there is no need to

reduce the profit figure of Phase 1 and 2 by $80,000 and Lay Sings appeal is dismissed.

</p><p align="justify">56.    In the circumstances, the appeal of Wellform Construction

is allowed in that Ms Chongs order of 11 November 2000 is set aside and Lay Sing is to pay

Wellform Construction $222,938.43 with interest at 6% per annum from the date of Writ of Summons

until the day before my judgment as statutory interest runs from the date of judgment. Costs of the

action up to the hearing before Ms Chong is to be paid by Lay Sing to Wellform Construction to be

agreed or taxed.

</p><p align="justify">57.    I would also mention that should Lay Sing recover more

monies from the owner regarding the difference between $1,132,650.66 which it anticipated receiving

and the $868,883.18 which it received, then, 30% of the net monies recovered should be paid by Lay

Sing to Wellform Construction.

</p><p align="justify">58.    I will hear the parties on costs of the appeal before me.
