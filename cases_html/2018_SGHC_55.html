class="font-weight-bold">Introduction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">1 In Originating Summons No 534 of 2016 (“OS 534/2016”), the plaintiff, [BQP] (“the Plaintiff”), appealed under s 10 of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”) against the jurisdictional ruling of the arbitral tribunal (“the Tribunal”) entitled “Decision on Bifurcated Jurisdictional Defences” (“the Award”) in Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) Arbitration No 197 of 2014, where the Plaintiff was the respondent, and the defendant, [BQQ] (“the Defendant”), was the claimant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 I heard oral arguments on 27 June 2017 and I gave my decision with 16-page brief oral grounds on 27 September 2017, dismissing the Plaintiff’s challenge on the Award.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Plaintiff then sought leave to appeal against my decision under s 10(4) of the IAA in Summons No 4722 of 2017 (“SUM 4722/2017”). Its main ground for leave was that there was a question of general principle to be decided for the first time, and upon which further argument and a decision of a higher tribunal would be to the public advantage. This question was whether pre-contractual negotiations were admissible in evidence to construe written agreements – a point left open by the Court of Appeal (see <span class="font-italic">Xia Zhengy</span><span class="font-italic">an v Geng Changqing </span>[2015] 3 SLR 732 (“<span class="font-italic">Xia Zhengy</span><span class="font-italic">an</span>”<span class="font-italic">), Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 4 SLR 193 (“<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pt</span><span class="font-italic">e Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 (“<span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span>”)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 At the hearing before me on 20 November 2017, I considered, with respect, that both parties’ written submissions did not fully address the issues. Having referred counsel to the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the EA”), some articles and material facts, the most important being Procedural Order No 1 issued by the Tribunal and the SIAC Rules, counsel asked for an opportunity to look at the same and address them by way of written submissions. I agreed and directed that the parties file further simultaneous written submissions by 11 December 2017 and written reply submissions, if any, by 18 December 2017. The parties then informed me they did not need an oral hearing but were content for me to read their further submissions and to make my ruling.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Having considered the parties’ respective submissions, I dismiss the Plaintiff’s application in SUM 4722/2017 for leave to appeal, and now give the full grounds for my decision in two parts:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the facts, findings and ruling of the Tribunal on jurisdiction, the Plaintiff’s challenge thereto, and my decision on its challenge, which is an expansion of my brief oral grounds; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the reasons for my refusing leave to appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The following largely appears in the Award and are not really disputed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Plaintiff is a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”). The Defendant is a company organised under the laws of Indonesia. The Plaintiff and the Defendant (“the parties”) and their affiliates have had commercial dealings in the forestry industry since at least 2003, in the course of which various disputes arose.

The CEA was therefore entered into to neutralise the Defendant’s payments under the MWA via the payment of a commission to [PER].

Since the MWA is an onshore legal agreement, and no subsequent offshore legal agreement was entered into, the RLS MOA remained in force and continued to be valid and binding on the parties. As such, the Identified Claims were validly brought under the SIAC arbitration agreement in Cl 16 of the RLS MOA.

In particular, it does not indicate whether the “definite legal agreement” was to be an “onshore” or an “offshore” legal agreement. It is clear that one has to look to the context to derive some assistance. Some of that relevant context must include the provisions within the RLS MOA and the MWA, the various other agreements and their provisions as well as the factual matrix within which the parties entered into a suite of agreements with the aim of settling the disputes that had arisen over their commercial dealings since at least 2003. Those agreements were both “onshore” and “offshore” agreements. The former category contained BANI arbitration clauses and the latter SIAC arbitration clauses. Each party had subsidiaries and affiliates in Indonesia and the BVI. The Plaintiff explained that “offshore” agreements refer to agreements between the Defendant and a non-Indonesian entity chosen by the Plaintiff’s affiliate, [CAH], which would be governed by Singapore law, and the “offshore” agreements would then be implemented by “onshore” agreements between Indonesian companies and would be governed by Indonesian law.

The Tribunal carefully considered all the factual material before it and came to its conclusion on the jurisdictional issues. I agree with the Tribunal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 First, in considering the text alone, although the phrase “definite legal agreement” by itself does not indicate whether it refers to an offshore or onshore agreement, it is followed by another phrase: “<span class="font-italic">this MOA</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>shall continue in force” [emphasis added]. If “<span class="font-italic">this</span> MOA” was to continue in force under Cl 13 absent entry into another agreement, it would tend to follow that the contemplated new “definite legal agreement” must also be another offshore agreement. That new offshore definite legal agreement would then logically supersede the existing offshore RLS MOA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Turning to the context in which the RLS MOA was entered into, I note that the parties entered into a whole suite of agreements in settlement of their disputes. It was not a simple but a rather complex settlement with different parts and of high value. The agreements encompassed both onshore and offshore agreements. The need for some onshore agreements in relation to aspects of the forestry industry was obvious as there were regulatory considerations. It is accepted that the RLS MOA is an offshore agreement, being entered into by an Indonesian and a BVI entity and the parties did not enter into any other offshore agreement after the RLS MOA was concluded. Considering the context in which the RLS MOA was entered into, it confirms the construction that the phrase “definite legal agreement” must have been, on a balance of probabilities, an offshore agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Secondly, when considering the Master Agreement for context, Cl 5 confirms this construction. To recapitulate, Cl 5 states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Round Logs Supply MOA <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">will be </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">implemented </span><span class="font-italic">by way of an onshore</span><span class="font-italic"> wood supply agreement </span>to be finalized between the parties. The <span class="font-italic">parties agree to enter into a binding legal agreement </span>to be governed by the respective laws, substantially on the terms set out in the Round Logs Supply MOA. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The words chosen by lawyers in drafting the Master Agreement were clear – “will be implemented by”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the RLS MOA would be performed by or carried into effect or given effect to by an onshore agreement. They did not use the word “supersede” as they did elsewhere, as in the first draft of Clause 1.1 of the JOA and Shares MOAs (see [49] above) which referred to “the date of execution of definitive legal agreements <span class="font-italic">superseding</span> this MOU” [emphasis added]. These parties were aware in drafting these agreements of the concepts of “supersession” and “implementation”. The extra detail in the MWA confirms this process of “implementing” the RLS MOA’s comparatively general provisions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The Tribunal also stated, at [161] of its Award, and I agree, that Cl 5 of the Master Agreement was consistent with the parties’ dual track onshore offshore structure. Cl 5 expressly states in the first sentence their agreement to implement the RLS MOA by finalising an onshore wood supply agreement.  In the second sentence, they agree to “enter into” a binding legal agreement “substantially on the terms” of the RLS MOA. Given the industry they were in, the Plaintiff, as a BVI entity, could not have entered into a binding onshore agreement and hence the binding legal agreement that they agreed to “enter into” in the second sentence of Clause 5 must refer to a subsequent offshore agreement. It follows that by Cl 13 of the RLS MOA, the parties were referring to a subsequent and more definite offshore agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Thirdly, the RLS MOA contains several provisions describing the direct role of the Plaintiff in connection with the round log supply to the Defendant and this suggests that the MWA is intended to operate in tandem with the RLS MOA, as opposed to supersede and replace it. The Defendant correctly pointed out that Cl 3 of the RLS MOA, “ROUND LOGS supply”, expressly states that if the Nominated Companies fail to supply the agreed volume of round logs, “<span class="font-italic">[the Plaintiff]</span><span class="font-italic"> shall provide</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>the round logs from its concessions within [Sumatra]” [emphasis added]. Similarly, but admittedly less directly, Cl 8(b), “Round Logs Grading, Scaling”, places an obligation on “[the Plaintiff] (<span class="font-italic">or</span> the Nominated Companies)” [emphasis added] to render full cooperation in scaling and grading the round logs. Also Cl 10, “Compensation for underperformance”, provides that if the quarterly supply volume of round logs is not met “due to the negligence or default of the obligations under this MOA of [the Plaintiff] <span class="font-italic">and/or</span> the Nominated Companies”, then “[the Plaintiff] <span class="font-italic">and/or</span> the Nominated Companies shall compensate [the Defendant] for the amount of the shortfall” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Fourthly, when we compare the parallel wording in Cl 6, “Definitive Legal Agreement”, of the JOA MOA and the Shares MOA, we find that Cl 6.2 expressly mentions a binding onshore legal agreement:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This MOA shall continue in full force and effect <span class="font-italic">notwithstanding the execution of any binding </span><span class="font-italic">onshore legal agreements</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>concerning the transactions contemplated herein<span class="font-italic">.</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>This MOA shall terminate only upon the execution of a written agreement to that effect signed by the Parties hereto.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">whereas this language is missing in the RLS MOA. Whilst the Plaintiff contends that this shows that the Defendant did not intend to secure a double track regime comprising offshore and onshore agreements for the RLS MOA, as it did for the JOA and Shares MOAs, I agree with the Tribunal that in fact it shows the contrary, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, that the approach for two of the MOAs under the parties’ Master Agreement implicitly supports interpreting Cl 13 of the RLS MOA as being focused on a subsequent offshore MOA superseding the RLS MOA rather than a parallel onshore agreement like the MWA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The Plaintiff submitted that [CH]’s testimony showed that Cl 6.3 of the JOA MOA and the Shares MOA “inspired” the Defendant’s insertion on 10 September 2009 of the new paragraphs in Cl 13 of the RLS MOA and the Defendant saw fit to retain Cl 13 even after Cl 6.3 had been deleted from the JOA MOA and the Shares MOA. Therefore, according to the Plaintiff, the retention of Cl 13 of the RLS MOA by the Defendant was deliberate as a different regime from that in the JOA MOA and Shares MOA was intended. In response to the Tribunal’s questions, the Plaintiff candidly offered an explanation at the hearing for this “different regime”, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the Plaintiff is the beneficiary under the JOA MOA and the Shares MOA as the purchaser of the Forestry Licence, JOA Interest and [NUS] Shares whereas the Defendant is the beneficiary of the round logs supply commitment in the RLS MOA.

</div>
</div> Like the Tribunal, I am of the view that this explanation for the difference in wording between Cl 6 of the JOA and Shares MOAs, and Cl 13 of the RLS MOA at best shows that the difference was probably missed by the Defendant which thus failed to make a similar amendment to the RLS MOA. I note that the current wording of Cl 6.2 of the JOA and Shares MOAs were last minute amendments introduced on 18 September 2009 the day of the signing, at 11.06am.

However I would note that even in this form, Cl 6 was clearly intended by the parties to refer to a future <span class="font-italic">offshore</span> agreement, see the Plaintiff’s comments on Cl 6 at [60] and [64] above. The reference in Cl 6 to an “onshore” agreement was added to make this more explicit, more clearly sorting out offshore from onshore agreements, and its absence from Cl 13 is therefore inconclusive. In my judgment, the absence of the word “onshore” from Cl 13 does not change the reasonable interpretation of Cl 13 of the RLS MOA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Fifthly, given that the phrase “definite legal agreement” presents an ambiguity in the context of the rival interpretations advanced by the parties, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether it refers to an offshore or onshore agreement, I turn, as the Tribunal turned, to the negotiating history which constituted a large percentage of the factual record.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The evidence, as set out above, shows that the parties drafted and executed a large number of agreements in a comparatively short period of time. One thing stands out clearly from these negotiations, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the Plaintiff originally took the <span class="font-italic">unequivocal</span> position that phrase “definite legal agreement” in Cl 13 meant a different, and presumably more detailed, <span class="font-italic">offshore</span> agreement to follow the offshore RLS MOA (see [59] and [61] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The Tribunal did not accept, as I do not, the Plaintiff’s contention that this meaning somehow silently evolved into a “definite legal <span class="font-italic">onshore</span> agreement”. If so, one would expect to see documents, documented discussions, email exchanges or some credible evidence that the intention changed and that change was consistent with good commercial sense, given that the parties were exchanging emails almost daily and expressly discussing draft onshore agreement language for Cl 6 of the JOA and Shares MOAs. I also agree with the Tribunal that the technical switch of the title from MOU to MOA, even though it occurred later for the RLS MOA than the JOA and Shares MOAs, could not have somehow added “onshore” to the phrase “definite legal agreement” in Cl 13 of the RLS MOA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Like the Tribunal, I also find the Plaintiff’s argument of silent evolution undermined by its acknowledged concession at the hearing before them, that Cl 18(b) of the RLS MOA (“Termination”) must have survived post-MWA, for its own contractual protection. This is inconsistent with its original case that the entire RLS MOA had been superseded by the MWA and if “definite legal agreement” in Cl 13 meant <span class="font-italic">only an</span><span class="font-italic"> onshore</span> agreement, then with the execution of the MWA some three months after the RLS MOA, given that there were no obligations that had to be performed by either party in the interim, then nothing in the RLS MOA survived.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 I also note that the Plaintiff has now changed its case regarding Cl 18(b) of the RLS MOA. To recapitulate, Cl 18 essentially ensures that the Plaintiff would not be put in the position of having to deliver the same amount of round logs to the Defendant despite not having acquired the Forestry Licence and/or [NUS] shares. While it had previously taken the position before the Tribunal that Cl 18(b) was somehow ‘carved out’ and survived the supersession of the RLS MOA, the Plaintiff now argued, before me, that Cl 18(b) would not survive, and is not required for the Plaintiff’s protection because its contractual obligations under the RLS MOA would be discharged upon the MWA coming into effect, while the Nominated Companies could simply insist on payment for the round logs supplied under the MWA.

</div> The Plaintiff sought to rely on an e-mail sent on 10 September 2009 by [SA], corporate counsel assisting the Defendant in drafting in the Master Agreement and MOUs.

</div>
</div> The e-mail expressed a preference to have an Indonesian party as the purchaser or contracting entity, and to that end proposed an assignment/novation clause in lieu of a nomination clause (see [56] above). The Plaintiff submitted that this showed that the parties did not intend the Plaintiff to remain separately liable under the RLS MOA after an onshore agreement was entered into. I find it would be inappropriate to draw any conclusion about how Cl 13 of the RLS MOA should be interpreted from [SA]’s comments about a novation clause in the Master Agreement. The nexus between the two was not strong enough to support such an inference. Moreover, the Plaintiff’s submission is flatly contradicted by the JOA and Shares MOAs, in respect of which the Plaintiff remains liable notwithstanding the execution of onshore agreements. In any event it is not disputed that neither party novated its contractual rights and obligations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The Plaintiff also submitted that the corporate guarantee arrangements show that the Defendant did not intend the Plaintiff to remain liable after the MWA came into force. Clause 10A of the RLS MOA calls for cross-corporate guarantees between the Defendant and the Plaintiff’s Nominated Companies, and the performance bond was entered into between the Defendant and [LES]. But this again is inconclusive: just because the Defendant sought certain contractual protections under the MWA from the Nominated Companies does not mean that it did not also intend the Plaintiff to remain liable under the RLS MOA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Finally, I do not see any difficulty with the RLS MOA and the MWA concurrently having legal effect. Many of the so-called inconsistencies identified by the Plaintiff are simply instances of the MWA containing more detail than the RLS MOA. Where there are true inconsistencies, one possible resolution may be in Cl 19(d) of the MWA where it is provided that the MWA shall prevail in the event of contradiction, incompatibility or difference with other agreements.

</div> However that is something that the Tribunal will deal with and decide at the merits hearing; what I state here is just in answer to an argument put forward by the Plaintiff for the purposes of this jurisdiction challenge. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing I say here is to bind the Tribunal in the merits or any other phase of the arbitral proceedings. Notwithstanding that Cl 3 of the RLS MOA uses the phrase “indicative terms”, the RLS MOA contains agreement on essential matters in sufficient detail to constitute a binding agreement. In any event, the Plaintiff does not dispute that the RLS MOA was a binding agreement; it only says that it was superseded by the MWA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Like the Tribunal, and for the reasons set out above, I agree that Cl 13 of the RLS MOA refers to a definite offshore legal agreement and that the Defendant’s entry into the onshore MWA did not supersede the RLS MOA in its entirety or in part. The RLS MOA and the MWA co-exist and the RLS MOA is valid and separately enforceable from the MWA. The Tribunal therefore had jurisdiction to hear these disputes. The scope and impact of the separate enforceability of the RLS MOA is a different matter. The Tribunal accepts that it has jurisdiction only over disputes brought under the RLS MOA, and to decide liability for the alleged breaches of the RLS MOA and not the MWA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ reliance on evidence of pre-contractual negotiations    </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 I find it germane to point out that the parties appeared to take the admissibility of the pre-contractual negotiations for granted during the proceedings before the Tribunal.

Essentially, the Plaintiff’s position is that it had only relied on the pre-contractual negotiations to the extent that it was necessary to meet the Defendant’s case.

(“question (c)”)</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 I find that question (b) and question (c) are, in essence, appeals against the arbitral tribunal’s and my construction of the clauses within the special facts of this case. Given the central issue in this case and the contextual approach adopted, such questions are very fact-sensitive and the factual context in which they arise are unique to these parties. We have before us two groups of companies who have had commercial dealings in the forestry industry since 2001, or at least 2003, who, with the aim of settling all disputes between them, entered into a slew of specially drafted agreements. In doing so, they were advised and assisted by legally qualified persons who attended to the drafting of these bespoke agreements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Additionally, in relation to question (b), the entities to the agreements, and therefore the parties governed by the two arbitration clauses, are dissimilar. The RLS MOA was entered into between the Plaintiff and the Defendant but the MWA was entered into between [SUM] and the Defendant. The Plaintiff also seems to advance the ground that if the MWA did not supersede the RLS MOA and the latter therefore remains valid and binding as well, then the claims that were brought under the RLS MOA should be brought under that MWA. However, the Tribunal has not made a decision on this issue as there were insufficient facts to do so and instead reserved it to the merits hearing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Question (c) is again without any merit. It was common ground before the Tribunal and before me that “definite legal agreement” should either be read as a definite <span class="font-italic">offshore</span> legal agreement or a definite <span class="font-italic">onshore</span> legal agreement. It cannot be right that the Plaintiff can now ask for leave to appeal on the ground that the arbitral tribunal and the court strayed into rectification by saying that “definite legal agreement” means an offshore legal agreement and when they contend it should read “onshore” legal agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Admissibility of pre-contractual negotiations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 As to question (a), the Plaintiff submits that the question of whether pre-contractual negotiations are admissible falls within the First Time and Public Importance Limbs.

This was made clear in the judgments of <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance </span>(at [132(d)]), <span class="font-italic">Soup Restaurant</span> (at [39]–[40]), <span class="font-italic">Xia Zhengyan </span>(at [62], [69]) and <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span><span class="font-italic"> Marine </span>(at [75]). However, there is an important difference because these were all cases commenced in the Singapore courts, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, domestic litigation, whereas these proceedings before me arise from an international arbitration and a challenge to an award on jurisdiction. It comes before our courts because Singapore is the seat, thereby making our courts the curial court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 I brought counsel’s attention to a number of articles which debate whether the admissibility of evidence is an evidentiary rule or whether it is a substantive rule in<span class="font-italic"> international arbitration</span>. At the first hearing for leave to appeal, the authorities relied upon by counsel were all cases involved in <span class="font-italic">domestic</span> <span class="font-italic">litigation</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 In considering these articles, authors like Jonas Rosengren in “Contract Interpretation in International Arbitration” (2013) 30(1) Journal of International Arbitration at p 6, put forth the view that the current role of exclusionary rules of common law systems stirs up confusion in international arbitration. The learned author says the proper characterisation of these rules is a fundamental issue. He opines that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… <span class="font-italic">despite the title of the parol evidence rule and the reference to evidence not being ‘admissible’ or ‘allowed’ as a result of it or any related exclusionary rules, it is generally accepted that these kind of rules are not procedural but rather substantive rules. They are rules of contract interpretation which exclude certain evidence from being considered</span> and insofar as any question of admissibility arises, it arises because evidence that is irrelevant will not be considered. Although modern arbitration laws and rules grant the arbitrators broad discretion to ‘determine the admissibility, relevance, materiality, and weight of any evidence’, the circumstances that the arbitrator is allowed to consider in interpreting the contract are controlled by the applicable law. <span class="font-italic">To let the procedural rules determine which facts </span><span class="font-italic">should be allowed to throw light on the intention of the parties will not result in a faithful application of the substantive law; it could in fact be tantamount to distorting it.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 There are authors who hold the contrary view that the admissibility of evidence is an <span class="font-italic">evidentiary</span>, not <span class="font-italic">substantive</span> rule, see Jeffrey Waincymer, <span class="font-italic">Procedure and Evidence in International Arbitration </span>(Wolters Kluwer 2012, at para 10.16, although he seems to moderate his view in the context of parol evidence at para 10.16.4, where he refers to Lew, Mistelis and Kroll’s suggestion that the treatment of parol evidence is “in the grey zone between substance and procedure”. Patrick Ostendorf, in “The exclusionary rule of English law and its proper characterisation in the conflict of laws” (2015) 11(1) Journal of Private International Law 163 holds the view that the prevailing opinion that the admissibility of extrinsic evidence is directly concerned with the decision on the merits and hence functionally belongs within the realm of contract interpretation, is flawed. He opines that “only issues <span class="font-italic">concerned </span>with the decision on the merits rather than merely <span class="font-italic">affecting</span> it should be governed by the <span class="font-italic">lex causae</span> instead of the <span class="font-italic">lex fori</span>” [emphasis in original] since almost any procedural rule “may in some way or other affect the material outcome of a given case” (at 172). In Mr Ostendorf’s view, the “characterisation of the exclusionary rule as a matter of substantive law can only be justified if its <span class="font-italic">function</span> is more closely intertwined with principles of contractual interpretation, such as the objectivity principle, the <span class="font-italic">contra proferentem</span> rule, the holistic approach or the contextual dimension, rather than with matters of evidence and procedure” [emphasis in original] (at 175). Mr Ostendorf cites [65] of <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span><span class="font-italic"> Marine</span> to support his view that the “admissibility of extrinsic evidence is not directly <span class="font-italic">concerned</span> with the interpretation of contracts though it may certainly <span class="font-italic">affect</span> the material outcome of a given case” [emphasis in original] (at p 177).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 I referred counsel to further academic discussions of this issue, see Carol Mulcahy, “What Does It Mean – Contractual Interpretation in International Commercial Arbitration” (2015) 9 Dispute Resolution International 15; Joshua D.

No doubt that body of principles is independent of the law of evidence. But there should also be only one body of principles which determines what evidence that body of contractual principles can operate upon. … A dispute over how a contract is to be construed must yield the same final judicial determination whether the contract is construed at trial in an action (to which Pt II of the Evidence Act does apply) or whether it is construed on a summary judgment application, on a striking out application, on an originating summons or even in arbitration (to all of which Pt II of the Evidence Act does not apply). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 I would first point out that in <span class="font-italic">HSBC Trustee (Singapore) Ltd</span>, the learned Judge there was dealing with the construction of a lease in proceedings to which Part II of the EA did not apply, but he was doing so as a court of first instance in Singapore, <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>in the context of domestic litigation; secondly, his comment “or even in arbitration”, is with respect <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> and was certainly not a point argued before him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 I am of the view that the law on this issue, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the characterisation of admissibility of evidence as a rule of evidence or procedural law as compared to substantive law, has been made clear, and in that sense settled, by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span><span class="font-italic"> Marine</span>. The following principles are clearly stated in the judgment of the court delivered by Sundaresh Menon CJ:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a)  “The law governing the admissibility of extrinsic evidence in Singapore is primarily statutory in the form of the EA [Evidence Act].” Since jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and New Zealand do not have equivalent provisions of the EA their cases on construction of contracts must be treated with a degree of caution (at [39]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b)  “We begin with a fundamental, even obvious, proposition of law. The EA only governs the <span class="font-italic">admissibility</span> of evidence. It is not concerned with and so does not prescribe rules of contractual construction. The province of the EA is the treatment of evidence, and this is conceptually independent and distinct from rules of contractual construction. Of course, the rules of <span class="font-italic">evidence</span> under the EA may affect the <span class="font-italic">application</span> of specific rules of contractual interpretation; but they do not prescribe how a contract should be interpreted and construed” [emphasis in original] (at [40]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Referring to s 94(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) and Part II of the EA, and after citing from the drafter of the Indian Evidence Act of 1872, Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, <span class="font-italic">An Introduction to the Indian Evidence Act</span> (Thacker, Spink &amp; Co, 1904), the CA stated: “The distinction between rules of contract law, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the substantive law which determines rights and liabilities, and rules of evidence, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the procedural law which determines what and how facts may be proved, could not be clearer” (at [43]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d)  “A lingering question remains: what exactly is extrinsic evidence of surrounding circumstances that is admissible without restriction under s 94(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) of the EA? The short answer … would be such extrinsic evidence of ‘facts and circumstances which were (or ought to have been) in the mind of the [drafter] when he used those words’ [citation omitted]. Parol evidence of the drafter’s subjective intention does not constitute such surrounding circumstances” (at [64]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 At the substantive level, Singapore adopts the contextual approach to the construction of contracts. This is settled law. In any case, it would be useful to set out again the relevant <span class="font-italic">dicta</span>, as stated in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span><span class="font-italic"> Marine</span> as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a)  “… [I]nterpretation is the ascertainment of the meaning which the <span class="font-italic">expressions in a document</span> would convey to a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties at the time of the contract” [emphasis in original] (at [33]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b)  “We have largely adopted the contextual approach to interpretation under our law in [<span class="font-italic">Zurich</span><span class="font-italic"> Insurance</span>] where this court held (at [132(d)]) that extrinsic evidence is admissible if it ‘[goes] towards proof of what the parties, from an objective viewpoint, ultimately agreed upon’, subject only to the limitation that the extrinsic evidence ‘is relevant, reasonably available to all the contracting parties and relates to a clear or obvious context’” (at [34]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I pause to note that in this case, the requirements in [123(b)] above have been clearly satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 However, there are fundamental differences when we examine the applicability of these principles to international arbitration cases with Singapore as the seat and where Singapore law is the governing law of the contract. First and foremost, s 2(1) of the EA provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Parts I, II and III shall apply to all judicial proceedings in or before any court, <span class="font-italic">but not</span> … <span class="font-italic">to proceedings before an arbitrator</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Part I of the EA covers the relevancy of facts, Part II deals with proof of facts and documents and Part III deals with the production and effect of evidence. Sections 94 to 100 EA, which featured heavily in <span class="font-italic">Zurich</span><span class="font-italic"> Insurance</span>, <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span><span class="font-italic"> Marine</span>, <span class="font-italic">Soup</span><span class="font-italic"> Restaurant </span>and <span class="font-italic">Xia Zhengyan</span>, fall within Part II and cover the exclusion of certain kinds of oral or extrinsic by documentary evidence. <span class="font-italic">None</span> of these provisions are applicable to proceedings before an arbitrator.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Parliament’s deliberate preclusion of our EA to proceedings before an arbitrator is unsurprising. Parties resort to arbitration, especially in the context of international trade and commerce, <span class="font-italic">precisely</span> because they wish to avoid the national laws of countries shackling their quest for a speedy, commercial and practical outcome to their dispute, and preclude the application of laws and procedures which may be alien to them. To a businessman from a civil law country, concepts like the parol evidence rule, the hearsay rule, common law discovery or the rule in <span class="font-italic">Browne v Dunn </span>(1893) 6 R 67 do not make much sense.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Secondly, and of equal importance, is the fact that the parties agreed that any dispute arising out of or in connection with the RLS MOA shall be referred to and finally resolved in accordance with the SIAC Rules for the time being in force and those rules were specifically incorporated by reference under Cl 16 of the RLS MOA. Rule 16.2 of the SIAC Rules 2013 states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Tribunal shall determine the relevance, materiality, and admissibility of all evidence. Evidence need not be admissible in law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Under Rule 16.2, admissibility clearly lies within the sole province of the tribunal, as do relevance and materiality. The second sentence in Rule 16.2 makes this even clearer by allowing an arbitral tribunal to decide whether to admit evidence that is not admissible <span class="font-italic">in law</span>. In Procedural Order No 1 dated 13 March 2015 it is recorded that by agreement between the parties, the arbitration is to be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the SIAC (5th Ed, 1 April 2013) save for Rule 28.9 therein (which is of no relevance to these proceedings).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 To underscore the different underlying premises in international arbitration as compared to national court procedures on the admissibility and treatment of evidence, Rule 16.2 of the SIAC Rules 2013 does not stand alone. Many other arbitral institutions have a similar rule, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) London Court of International Arbitration Rules 2014, Art 22.1: “The Arbitral Tribunal shall have the power, upon the application of any party … or its own initiative … (vi) to decide whether or not to apply any strict rules of evidence (or any other rules) as to the admissibility, relevance or weight of any material tendered by a party on any issue of fact or expert opinion …”</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 2010, Art 27.4: “The arbitral tribunal shall determine the admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of the evidence offered.”</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre Administered Arbitration Rules 2013, Art 22.2: “The arbitral tribunal shall determine the admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of the evidence, including whether to apply strict rules of evidence.”</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) American Arbitration Association International Dispute Resolution Procedures 2014, Art 20.6: “The tribunal shall determine the admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of the evidence.”</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Korean Arbitration Act (revised on 31 December 1999 and again on 30 November 2016 to incorporate the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration), Art 20 confers on the arbitral tribunal the “power to determine the admissibility, relevance and weight of any evidence” (see also Doo-Sik Kim <span class="font-italic">et al</span>, “Commercial Arbitration 2017: Korea” Global Arbitration Review <https: 1000194="" globalarbitrationreview.com="" jurisdiction="" korea=""> (22 May 2017)).</https:></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Although the International Chamber of Commerce Rules do not contain a specific provision like those above, it is generally accepted that it is inherent in its powers under Art 25, “Establishing the Facts of the Case” (formerly Art 20): “The arbitral tribunal shall proceed within as short a time as possible to establish the facts of the case by all appropriate means”. This discretion enjoyed by the tribunal has been described as being “extremely broad”, and subject only to (i) Art 19, “Rules Governing the Proceedings” (formerly Art 15): “The proceedings before the arbitral tribunal shall be governed by the Rules and, where the Rules are silent, by any rules which the parties or, failing them, the arbitral tribunal may settle on, whether or not reference is thereby made to the rules of procedure of a national law to be applied to the arbitration” and (ii) Art 21, “Applicable Rules of Law” (formerly Art 20): “The parties shall be free to agree upon the rules of law to be applied by the arbitral tribunal to the merits of the dispute. In the absence of any such agreement, the arbitral tribunal shall apply the rules of law which it determines to be appropriate…” (see Nathan D. O’Malley, <span class="font-italic">Rules of Evidence in International Arbitration</span> (Informa, 2013) ch 7 at para 7.06; Yves Derains &amp; Eric A. Schwartz, <span class="font-italic">Guide to the ICC Rules of Arbitration</span> (Kluwer Law International, 2nd Ed, 2005) at pp 270–272). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Concerns that the admission of pre-contract negotiations or subsequent conduct could vastly expand discovery obligations and consequently the volume of evidence in common law systems, see <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span><span class="font-italic"> Marine </span>at<span class="font-italic"> </span>[66]–[70], are usually not valid in the arbitration context as most international arbitrations now adopt the International Bar Association Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration (this aspect was also included in Procedural Order No 1, issued by the Tribunal, at [7.3]). Arbitral tribunals invariably retain control over discovery. Be that as it may, these are all considerations that arbitral tribunals in international arbitration take into consideration when a dispute is referred to them and they then have to adopt such procedures and conduct the arbitration in a manner that is the most expeditious and cost-effective.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 There is therefore no general principle to be decided for the first time or question of importance upon which further argument and a decision of a higher tribunal would be to the public advantage. I therefore refuse leave to appeal.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 For the reasons given above:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) I dismissed the Plaintiff’s challenge to jurisdiction in OS 534/2016 on 27 September 2017.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) I dismiss the Plaintiff’s application in SUM 4722/2017 for leave to appeal.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Costs are to follow the event; to be agreed.
