The victim is the elderly mother of a successful businessman who owns a well-known supermarket chain in Singapore. At trial, the accused conceded that he had lied to the elderly lady to induce her into entering his car, that he had subsequently issued a demand for ransom to her wealthy son, and that he had released her only after receiving a bag containing cash amounting to $2 million. But the defence emphasised throughout the course of the trial that the accused had intended to release the victim at the end of the day, even if he had not received the ransom he sought.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The dispute essentially narrows into a question of law: whether the statutory provision that creates the offence of kidnapping for ransom requires that the abductor intend to hold his victim until and unless he receives the ransom. The defence argues, and the Prosecution contends otherwise, that this is the correct reading of the statutory provision. I will explain my decision on this question of law and my overall determination of whether the Prosecution has succeeded in proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused has committed the offence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The accused faces a single charge (“the Charge”) under s 3 of the Kidnapping Act (Cap 151, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the Kidnapping Act”). The Charge reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">That you, <span class="font-weight-bold">LEE SZE YONG</span>,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">on 8 January 2014, from the roadside along Hougang Avenue 2, Singapore, did abduct one Ng Lye Poh, female / then 79 years old, with intent to hold the said Ng Lye Poh for ransom, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 3 of the Kidnapping Act, Chapter 151. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The evidence of the parties </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 I begin with a brief review of the evidence adduced at trial. Counsel for the accused did not challenge the admissibility or accuracy of any of the statements that the accused provided to the police. Upon the application of the Prosecution, I therefore admitted the following ten statements of the accused as evidence:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) One contemporaneous statement recorded on 9 January 2014 at about 6.19 am; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) One cautioned statement recorded on 9 January 2014 at about 5.15 pm; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Eight other long statements, recorded between 11 January and 23 January 2014.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">These statements are detailed and comprehensive. When aggregated with the undisputed evidence of the other witnesses, one can piece together a clear picture of the relevant events that transpired until the accused’s arrest on 9 January 2014 at about 12.37 am.

Abduction is defined at s 362 of the Penal Code, which states, “Whoever by force compels, or by any deceitful means induces any person to go from any place, is said to abduct that person.” It is evident from the undisputed facts that the accused lied to Mdm Ng when he first approached her at about 11.30 am on 8 January 2014, telling her that Mr Lim had suffered a fall and had sent the accused to bring Mdm Ng to see Mr Lim at his office, in a bid to induce Mdm Ng to get into the rental car with him and leave the area (see [22] to [23] above). This strategy was undeniably successful.

All written law, penal or otherwise, must be interpreted purposively.

It is only after the literal and purposive interpretations of the provision as methods of ascertaining Parliament’s intent have been exhausted that the strict construction rule kicks in in the accused’s favour. In <span class="font-italic">Low Kok Heng</span>, Rajah JA expressed the view (at [38]) that the position taken in <span class="font-italic">Forward Food Management</span> is “decidedly the most appropriate approach to adopt [in relation to the strict construction rule], particularly in the light of the principle of statutory construction of statutes endorsed by Parliament in the Interpretation Act”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The defence has begun its analysis by applying a “literal interpretation” to the language of s 3.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I do not consider that the defence conducted its analysis according to the proper approach to statutory interpretation that I have described in the preceding paragraphs. As emphasised by Rajah JA in <span class="font-italic">Low Kok Heng </span>(at [57]), s 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act mandates that a purposive approach be adopted in the construction of all statutory provisions, and allows extrinsic material to be referred to even where, on a plain reading, the words of a statute are clear and unambiguous. Purposive interpretation is the “paramount principle of interpretation”. Accordingly, I will begin my analysis with a purposive interpretation of s 3 of the Kidnapping Act, in order to ascertain the <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>requirement stated therein. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Purposive interpretation </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Legislative history </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The Penal Code (Amendment) Bill was laid before Parliament on 23 April 1958 by the Chief Secretary, Mr E. B. David (“Mr David”). One of the aims of the Bill was to increase the sentences for the crime of kidnapping, in light of several instances of kidnapping and attempted kidnapping over the past years. According to Mr David, “the essence of every kidnapping case is to put the victim and his relatives in fear of physical violence”: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span>, Official Report (23 April 1958) vol 6 at col 135. Mr David explained that “for the better protection of the public, it [was] considered advisable to arm the Courts with this additional power to be used at discretion”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In the same debate, Member of Parliament Mr Lee Choon Eng expressed the view that “[k]idnapping and gangsterism are very, very serious offences because they cause fear and alarm not only to the rich and poor but also to every individual citizen in this country. … We must also consider the condition of the family of that victim. When a victim is kidnapped and confined illegally or wrongfully, the family is put under mental torture and suffers more if that victim is the sole bread-winner of the family.”: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span>, Official Report (23 April 1958) vol 6 at col 136.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 An even more resolute stance was expressed by the then-Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Ong Pang Boon (“Mr Ong”), in moving the Punishment of Kidnapping Bill on 24 May 1961. Mr Ong described the Bill as “the strongest manifestation yet of the Government’s determination to wipe out evil perpetrators of the offence of kidnapping for ransom”: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span>, Official Report (24 May 1961) vol 14 at col 1504. One of the aims he described was to “deter potential kidnappers from risking their necks without the certainty of gain”. He emphasised the need to combat the kidnapping menace which, at the time the Bill was introduced, had “reared its ugly and evil head…and caused alarm and nervousness especially among the wealthy merchants and businessmen”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The Bill introduced the offence of kidnapping for ransom as an aggravated form of ordinary kidnapping or abduction. Mr Ong explained that cl 3 of the Bill, which is the precursor of s 3 of the Kidnapping Act, made it an offence for a person to abduct, wrongfully restrain or wrongfully confine any other person with intent to hold such person for ransom, and that on conviction the offender would be punished with death or imprisonment for life (whereupon he would also be liable to caning). He also observed the need to encourage victims and their families and agents to be more resolute in their cooperation with the police, because “[n]othing makes the kidnapper feel more secure and become bolder than the knowledge that most victims and their relatives are tongue-tied during negotiations whilst the victim is in captivity and even after payment of ransom through fear of possible reprisals instilled into them by these kidnappers, who cleverly use this psychological weapon to good advantage”. This formed the rationale for the further creation of an offence for a person who knowingly negotiates to pay or to pays any ransom to procure the release of a victim (now under s 5(2) of the Kidnapping Act). As Mr Ong described, the purpose of the Bill was to “deter criminally-minded kidnappers from kidnapping persons for ransom” and to provide “a stern warning that kidnapping does not pay. Should there be any future kidnapping case, it could become an appointment with death or an invitation to life incarceration for the kidnapper.”: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span>, Official Report (24 May 1961) vol 14 at col 1507.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The Kidnapping Act (Cap 101, 1970 Rev Ed) came into operation on 15 April 1971. A query by Member of Parliament Mr Leong Horn Kee was posed to the then-Minister for Home Affairs and Second Minister for Law Professor S. Jayakumar during the parliamentary session on 23 March 1985, regarding the incidence of kidnap for ransom cases in Singapore over the past few years. Professor Jayakumar responded that all 34 cases reported to the police since 1959 had been solved. The punishments provided by the Kidnapping Act and the success of the police in dealing with such cases had the desired deterrent effect: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span>, Official Report (23 March 1985) vol 45 at col 1260. On 23 May 1994, the then-Minister for Home Affairs Mr Wong Kan Seng reported that the introduction of the death penalty for kidnapping in 1961 had resulted in a “dramatic drop in such cases” – there were only 6 cases of kidnapping reported in the last ten years (<span class="font-italic">ie </span>between 1984 and 1994), compared with a peak of 38 cases in 1959 alone: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span>, Official Report (23 May 1994) vol 63 at col 61. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">My findings </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In my view, there is nothing within the relevant parliamentary speeches discussed above that warrants a restrictive approach towards the <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>requirement for the s 3 offence. Rather, it appears that the legislative intent is to cast a wide net to penalise the actions of abductors who place their victims and the relatives of their victims in fear that physical violence may be caused to the victims. As observed by Mr David as far back as 1958, the “essence” of kidnapping is the generation of such fear for victims and their relatives. In that debate, Mr Lee Choon Eng expressed similar sentiments, emphasising that kidnapping is a serious offence “because [it] cause[s] fear and alarm” to citizens. He further noted that the families of the victims are “put under mental torture”. Mr Ong similarly observed that kidnapping had “caused alarm and nervousness” amongst the citizenry. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 From a reading of the parliamentary speeches, one can immediately discern the real concern that kidnapping for ransom causes considerable fear and apprehension to both victims and their families. No distinction is drawn between cases in which abductors intend to release their victims only if ransom is received, and those where abductors intend to effect such release after a certain period even if they did not obtain their desired payoff. Nor would one have expected Parliament to draw such a distinction, in light of the sentiments expressed by the Ministers and Members of Parliament, because in both types of cases the victims and their families will undoubtedly experience fear and apprehension. Accordingly, there was no need for Parliament to draw such a distinction, nor is there any basis for the defence to divine such a theoretical divide from the parliamentary speeches.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Following from its discussion of the harm to society posed by kidnapping, Parliament adopted an unambiguous and unwavering position that such acts had to be deterred – in the words of Mr Ong, there was a need to “deter potential kidnappers from risking their necks without the certainty of gain”. Parliament’s palpable intent was to establish a strong disincentive for abductors to embark on such a risky venture, gambling against the investigative abilities of law enforcement in the hope that they might derive some ill-gotten gains. Yet this is precisely what a person who abducts his victim and seeks ransom for the victim’s release is doing, regardless of whether he intends to release his victim after a period of time despite not receiving the ransom. Such a person has already cast his lot by embarking on a criminal endeavour in the hope of monetary return. Nothing in the parliamentary debates suggests that Parliament intended to allow those people who deliberately choose to abduct innocent victims and essentially gamble on whether they receive the ransom demanded, within a self-selected window of time, to escape criminal responsibility under the s 3 offence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The defence points out that the offence of kidnapping or abducting in order to murder under s 364 of the Penal Code carries also a punishment of death or imprisonment for life, and argues that since an abductor with intent to release his victim regardless of whether he obtains ransom does not possess the same moral blameworthiness as an abductor who intends to murder his victim, the former cannot fall within the scope of the s 3 offence, which carries a similar sentence of death or life imprisonment.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I do not think there is merit in this argument. This is for two reasons which the Prosecution has brought to my attention. First, the approach adopted by the defence essentially seeks to determine the scope of a penal provision by reference to the severity of the punishment provided for. The Prosecution submits, and I agree, that it would be an usurpation of the legislative function for a court to deliberately narrow the scope of a provision simply because it feels that the punishment which Parliament has prescribed for a certain offence is too severe.

</div> I note further that a similar warning was sounded by Rajah JA in <span class="font-italic">Low Kok Heng</span> in his discussion of the limits of purposive interpretation<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [52]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Courts must be cautious to observe the limitations on their power and to confine themselves to administering the law. “Purposive construction often requires a sophisticated analysis to determine the legislative purpose and a discriminating judgment as to where the boundary of construction ends and legislation begins” (<span class="font-italic">per </span>McHugh JA in <span class="font-italic">Kingston v Keprose Pty Ltd </span>(1987) 11 NSWLR 404 at 423). <span class="font-italic">Section 9A of the Interpretation Act should not be viewed as a means or licence by which judges adopt new roles as legislators;</span> the separation of powers between the judicial branch and the legislative branch of government must be respected and preserved. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Rajah JA strikes an appropriate note of caution that I bear well in mind in determining the scope of a statutory provision by way of purposive interpretation. In my view, Parliament has explained its view of the essence and the true harm of kidnapping to society (described at [60] to [64] above). Having set out the breadth of the offence in s 3 of the Kidnapping Act, Parliament has accordingly made a considered decision to prescribe the punishment it did in s 3 of the Kidnapping Act in order to stamp out such evil, and it has since then noted on more than one occasion the deterrent effect produced by such punishment (see [64] above). The Prosecution also correctly notes that when Parliament determines the appropriate sentence for offences, it considers a range of factors apart from the moral heinousness of the offences.

</div> It takes into account other factors such as the prevalence of the offence, whether the offence is committed for profit, and whether the offence is difficult to detect or prevent. I find that the relevant parliamentary speeches reflect Parliament’s consideration of these factors, in particular the prevalence of the offence as well as its difficulty of detection, due to the reluctance of victims’ families to provide assistance to the police for fear of reprisals to the victims (see [63] above). Upon a holistic consideration of these factors, Parliament deemed it appropriate for the punishment for kidnapping for ransom to be set at the level laid down in s 3 of the Kidnapping Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The Prosecution also submits that the sentencing options that are open to the court for an offence under s 3 allow the court to take into account the relative culpability of the offender. For instance, the greater the level of harm inflicted on the victim, the more likely that a harsher sentence will be imposed on the offender. I agree with the Prosecution that s 3 of the Kidnapping Act provides for a “properly calibrated system of punishments that takes into account the level of harm inflicted on the hostage”.

</div> According to the defence, a kidnapping where ransom is demanded is ultimately a transaction. The victim’s family pays the abductor ransom, and in exchange the abductor releases the victim. If so, the <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>required under s 3 would be the intention to hold any person <span class="font-italic">until and unless the ransom is </span><span class="font-italic">paid</span>. In other words, it is a “condition precedent” to the release of the person that the ransom is paid.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">My findings </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In my view, the defence’s interpretation of the phrase “intent to hold any person for ransom” as “intent to hold any person until and unless ransom is paid” is untenable. The intention to require the payment of ransom as a “condition precedent” for release ultimately entails implausible consequences. In the interest of clarity, I will employ the use of the diagram below (<span class="font-italic">ie </span>Figure 1) to aid my explanation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-italic">Figure 1</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Figure 1 depicts the possible intentions of an abductor regarding the victim’s release, situated along a scale of relative culpability. On the lower end of the scale is the intention to release the victim regardless of whether ransom is obtained, which I have termed “Intention (A)” for ease of reference. The defence argues that Intention (A) is less morally blameworthy than Intention (B), which is the intention to release the victim only when ransom is obtained –in other words (and in the words of the defence), the intention to hold the victim until and unless the ransom is paid. The antithesis of Intention (A) is Intention (C), which refers to an abductor’s intent not to release the victim regardless of whether ransom is obtained. Such an abductor never intends to let his or her victim go, even if the victim’s family pays the ransom in full. An abductor who possesses Intention (C) is seated ignominiously at the highest end of the culpability spectrum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The defence’s interpretation of the <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>requirement as the “intent to hold any person until and unless ransom is paid” (see [75] above) is essentially a reference to Intention (B). Such an abductor, according to the defence, possesses sufficient moral culpability to be penalised under s 3 of the Kidnapping Act. The defence is at pains to emphasise that a person with Intention (A) would not possess the necessary <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span>. His intention does not contain the requisite “condition precedent”, because he intends to release the victim even if he does not obtain the ransom from the victim’s family. In other words, the existence of the “condition precedent” is an essential and indispensable element of the <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> for the offence under s 3. The defence suggests that an abductor with Intention (B) does not have sufficient moral culpability for criminal liability under s 3. This accordingly forms the basis for the defence’s submission that the accused, as an abductor who intended to release Mdm Ng eventually regardless of whether he obtained the ransom, does not have the requisite <span class="font-italic">mens </span><span class="font-italic">rea</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The difficulty with the defence’s proposed <span class="font-italic">mens </span><span class="font-italic">rea</span>, however, is that it is ultimately unable to account for Intention (C), <span class="font-italic">ie </span>an intention not to release regardless of whether ransom is obtained. Intention (C), similar to Intention (A), does not contain a condition precedent. In this sense, Intention (C) possesses a marked dialectical similarity to Intention (A). Significantly, however, Intention (C) stands at the very opposite end of the culpability spectrum from Intention (A). An abductor with such intention is the <span class="font-italic">most</span> morally blameworthy. Given his degree of moral blameworthiness, how could it possibly be the case that an abductor with Intention (C) manages to elude criminal liability under s 3 simply because the requisite “condition precedent” is similarly absent in Intention (C)? His state of mind represents the scourge of kidnapping at its most evil. Even after he receives the ransom (and also if he does not), he intends for his victim to remain languishing in an unnameable dungeon, possibly never to be found. But the logically unavoidable consequence of the requirement (as proposed by the defence) that the abductor must<span class="font-italic"> </span>intend to hold<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">until and unless </span>he obtains the ransom is that Intention (C) will be excluded from the scope of s 3. Just as Intention (A) is excluded from the scope of s 3 (as the defence recommends), so must Intention (C), if the defence’s analysis is pursued to its logical end. I reject such an analysis. In my view, an acceptance of the defence’s characterisation of the <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>requirement will lead to the unacceptable corollary that greater evil will go unpunished. This is unsound as a matter of logic and policy and cannot conceivably represent Parliament’s intention. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The Prosecution has referred me to <span class="font-italic">Tan Ping Koon</span>, a decision of Tay Yong Kwang J (as he then was) in the High Court. The facts of this case are not akin to those of the present case so I shall state them briefly. The two accused persons in that case each faced a charge of kidnapping with common intention. The victim was a young girl of less than 10 years at the time of the offences. The second accused had entered the victim’s house, carried the victim out of the house and brought her into his car, which was driven by the first accused. They then left the scene, but soon noticed that they were followed by another vehicle. They decided to abandon the victim by asking her to alight at the side of the road. Although the two accused persons subsequently pleaded guilty before Tay J, Tay J nevertheless explained his views (at [54] and [55] of his judgment) on whether the elements of the offence were satisfied for each accused person. Tay J found that the act of abduction was complete when the second accused carried the victim out of the compound of the house onto the road. In relation to the existence of <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span>, Tay J held as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">55 However, in order to sustain a conviction under s 3 of the Kidnapping Act, the Prosecution must prove that the abduction was with the intention of holding that person for ransom. … <span class="font-italic">A demand for ransom made after abduction would offer the best proof of the purpose of the abduction but no demand made does not mean no intention to make a demand. What has to be proved is the intent, not the demand nor the payment of ransom. </span>In the present case, the voluntary statements of both accused persons put the matter beyond any dispute. The only purpose of abducting [the victim] was to force her father to pay their price of her release. The offence is complete even if the perpetrators did not succeed in their purpose. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In his analysis of whether the <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>requirement for the s 3 offence was satisfied, Tay J focused on “the purpose of the abduction”, and reasoned that a demand for ransom made after abduction would offer the “best proof” of what this purpose was. He further reasoned that the fact that no demand was actually made on the facts of the case (given that the accused persons decided to release the victim for fear that they were being followed) did not mean that there was no intention to make a demand for ransom. I find that Tay J’s analysis coheres with my finding that the <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>requirement for the offence under s 3 is the intention to hold the victim <span class="font-italic">for the purpose of obtaining ransom</span>. One clear means by which an abductor would evince such an intention would be by making a demand for ransom, backed by the leverage of the victim’s captivity and well-being. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The strict construction rule </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 I have explained at [57] above that the strict construction rule is only applied as a “tool of last resort”, when both the purposive and literal interpretations of the statutory provision have been attempted and the meaning of the provision remains in ambiguity. It is a “<span class="font-italic">qualified </span>and <span class="font-italic">non-absolute </span>principle of interpretation that applies <span class="font-italic">only </span>where ambiguity persists after a purposive interpretation approach pursuant to s 9(A)(1) of the Interpretation Act is adopted” (emphasis in the original): <span class="font-italic">Low Kok Heng </span>at [85]. Having applied both purposive and literal interpretive techniques to s 3, and having found no such ambiguity in reaching my conclusions thereon, it would be inappropriate for me to apply the strict construction rule. I therefore reject the defence’s invitation for me to do so.

</div>
</div>
</div> Since the sole defence of the accused is premised on his legal argument (which I have rejected) on the scope of the <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>requirement under s 3, his defence falls away. I add for completeness that even if the accused had not conceded that he had the necessary <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span>, I would have rejected this contention. In my view, the overwhelming weight of the evidence demonstrates that the accused conceived and executed his plans to abduct Mdm Ng for the sole purpose of demanding ransom of $20 million from Mr Lim. These plans were indeed carried out with some success – he managed to extract a sum of $2 million from Mr Lim for his efforts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Even if I were to accept the defence’s proposed formulation of the <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span>, I would have had serious doubts that the accused intended to release Mdm Ng regardless of whether he obtained the ransom. On the contrary, I would have been prepared to find that the evidence before me demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had intended to hold Mdm Ng until and unless Mr Lim made some payment for her release. I have set out the contents of the text message sent by the accused to Mr Lim at [27] above. The language is highly threatening and the expressed intention is clear: “pay money and life will be saved”. This was a “problem that [could] be resolved with money [and was therefore] not a problem”. The indisputable meaning of the message was that unless Mr Lim paid the money (and thereby resolved the “problem”), his mother’s life and liberty would be forfeited. During cross-examination, Mr Lim disagreed with counsel for the defence’s suggestion that the accused had intended to release Mdm Ng regardless of whether Mr Lim paid the ransom to the accused.

</div>
</div> Thereafter, following Mr Lim’s indication that he had only managed to raise $2 million in the evening of 8 January 2014, the accused agreed to accept this sum. There is nothing to indicate that the accused’s decision to accept $2 million (which is obviously still a substantial sum) as ransom was anything other than a considered choice on his part. In the totality of the circumstances, I do not consider that the evidence supports the defence’s assertion that the accused intended to release Mdm Ng regardless of whether he obtained the money or not. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I also emphasise the tremendous amount of preparatory work undertaken by the accused before 8 January 2014. His planning was assiduous and meticulous, as is evident from the documentary evidence (including the accused’s organiser) seized by the police. He carried out surveillance at 73 Jalan Arif numerous times over the course of six months in order to observe Mdm Ng’s daily routine, before he actually set the wheels of his plan in motion. Several years before that, he had already begun purchasing items that he might need to use in aid of his nefarious schemes. He sourced these items not merely locally, but also from Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Johor Bahru and online from eBay. These items were obtained for various purposes – to subdue the victim, to conceal the accused’s appearance from the victim, and to aid him in eluding police detection. The defence’s attempt to characterise the accused as “an amateur wannabe” and “the most woeful kidnapper in Singapore history” is therefore wholly without basis.

</div>
</div> Indeed, he met with considerably more success in his endeavour than did the two accused persons in <span class="font-italic">Tan Ping Koon</span>, who abandoned their plan even before they made a demand for ransom. Given the vast efforts invested by the accused into the planning and preparation of his scheme, I consider it highly implausible that he would simply have given up when the clock struck twelve, and released Mdm Ng with his pockets empty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Furthermore, when Mr Heng pleaded insistently that the accused should release Mdm Ng at a nearby bus stop or taxi stand, and that there were other solutions available to his financial woes, the accused’s response was simply that he “could not turn back” (see [34] above). Following Mr Heng’s refusal to cooperate, the accused even threatened that he would reveal their sexual history to Mr Heng’s family members if Mr Heng did not comply (see [38] above). These are not the words of a sympathetic, half-hearted, would-be offender willing to release his hard-won financial leverage even if he did not receive a return. It is the language of a man who perceived that he had no recourse but to embark upon a criminal enterprise and who was determined to see his plans through, even if this entailed issuing threats to Mr Lim on the well-being of his elderly mother, or even to Mr Heng, a friend of 20 years to whom the accused is so close that he is “like…family”.
