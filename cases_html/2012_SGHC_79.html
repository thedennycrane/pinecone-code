<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff is the sole administrator of the
                    estate of Ching Kwong Kuen, deceased (“KK Ching”). He
                    brought this originating summons against two companies, the first defendant,
                    Seng Realty &amp; Development Pte Ltd (“Seng Realty”) and the
                    second defendant, National Aerated Water Company Pte Ltd (“National
                    Aerated”), to obtain orders to compel the directors of both defendants to
                    register certain share transfers that had been executed in his favour. I heard
                    the application and on 14 March 2011, I dismissed the application in respect of
                    National Aerated. Subsequently, I acceded to the plaintiff’s request for
                    further arguments. The further arguments were heard in April 2011. After taking
                    time for consideration, on 12 September 2011, I decided that the original
                    decision was correct and should be maintained. The plaintiff has
                    appealed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       This case arose as a consequence of the decision
                    in <em>Ching Chew Weng Paul v Ching Pui Sim and others</em>
                    [2010] 2 SLR 76 (<em>“Ching v Ching</em>”).
                    The background facts are clearly set out in the judgment of Steven Chong JC
                    from [5] to [14].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In brief, KK Ching had created trusts of certain
                    shares and assets. His youngest son, Paul Ching Chew Weng (“Paul
                    Ching”) claimed to be either the beneficiary of those trusts or the
                    beneficiary of KK Ching’s estate (“the estate”) and in those
                    capacities, commenced <em>Ching v Ching</em> to recover the
                    shares and assets. One of the defendants in that action, Ching Pui Sim
                    (“Ms Ching”), held 765,000 shares in Seng Realty (“the
                    Seng Shares”) and 72,270 shares in National Aerated (“the National
                    Shares”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Paul Ching was successful in his action in his
                    capacity of beneficiary of his father’s estate and Steven Chong JC
                    ordered, <em>inter alia</em>, that Ms Ching should
                    transfer the Seng Shares and the National Shares to the estate. Pursuant to the
                    judgment, Ms Ching executed the transfer of the Seng Shares on 3 March 2010
                    and that of the National Shares on 30 June 2010. Both transfers were in favour
                    of the plaintiff as the executor of the estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Subsequently, the plaintiff’s solicitors
                    wrote to the first and second defendants requesting them to register the
                    transfers of the Seng Shares and National Shares respectively and deliver the
                    new share certificates to the plaintiff as executor of the estate, as required
                    under s 130 of the Companies Act (Cap. 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the
                    Act”). The first and second defendants refused to do as
                requested.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The plaintiff then brought this action to compel
                    the defendants to register the said transfers and deliver the said share
                    certificates. In my judgment on 14 March 2010, I granted the plaintiff’s
                    first prayer, <em>ie</em> that Seng Realty be ordered
                    to register the transfer of the Seng Shares and deliver the new share
                    certificates to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       However, I dismissed the plaintiff’s
                    second prayer, <em>ie</em> that National Aerated be ordered
                    to register the transfer of the National Shares and deliver the new share
                    certificates to the plaintiff. I so decided on the basis that the pre-emption
                    clauses in Arts 30 to 33 of National Aerated’s articles of association
                    (“the National pre-emption clauses”) were applicable and
                    Ms Ching had to offer the National Shares to the existing members of
                    National Aerated before she could transfer them to the estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The essential question before me was whether or
                    not the National pre-emption clauses applied such that Ms Ching was obliged
                    to offer the National Shares to the existing members of National Aerated before
                    she could transfer the National Shares to the estate. The National pre-emption
                    clauses are set out in full below:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30.    A share may be transferred by a member or other
                            person entitled to transfer to any member, but save as aforesaid and
                            save as provided by articles 33 and 34 hereof, no share shall be
                            transferred to a person, who is not a member, so long as any member is
                            willing to purchase the same at fair value.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31.    Except where the transfer is made to a member or
                            pursuant to articles 33 and 34 hereof, the persons proposing to transfer
                            any share (hereinafter called the proposing transferor) shall give
                            notice in writing (hereinafter called the transfer notice) to the
                            Company that he desires to transfer the same. Such notice shall specify
                            the sum he fixes as the fair value, and shall constitute the Company his
                            agent for the sale of the share to any member of the Company at the
                            price so fixed, or at the option of the purchaser, at the fair value to
                            be fixed by two arbitrators, both of whom shall be members of the
                            Company, one to be appointed by each of the parties in
                            difference.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The transfer notice shall not be revocable except with the sanction of the
                        Directors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">32.    If the Company shall within the space of 14 days
                            after being served with such notice find a member (hereinafter called
                            the purchasing member) willing to purchase the share and shall give
                            notice to the proposing transferor, he shall be bound upon payment of
                            fair value, to transfer to the purchasing member.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">33.    If the Company shall not within the space of 14
                            days aforesaid find a member willing to purchase the share and give
                            notice in manner aforesaid, the proposing transferor shall at any time
                            within 2 months afterwards be at liberty to sell and transfer the share
                            to any person at any price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Art 8 of National Aerated’s articles of
                    association (“the Non-Recognition of Trusts Clause”) reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to the provisions of these presents the Company shall not be bound
                        by or recognise any contingent, future, partial or equitable interest in the
                        nature of a trust or otherwise in any share or any interest in any
                        fractional part of a share, or any other right in respect of any share,
                        except an absolute right thereto in the person for the time being registered
                        as the owners [<em>sic</em>] thereof.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Parties’ submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The plaintiff argued that the National
                    pre-emption clauses did not apply because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     The term “any transfer of
                        shares” as used in the National pre-emption clauses refers to a
                        transfer of <em>both</em> legal and beneficial
                        interests (and the transfer here was a transfer of legal title only);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        National pre-emption clauses were not intended to apply to the situation
                        where a bare trustee was returning shares to the beneficial owner of the
                        same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     I rejected both arguments and my reasons for
                    doing so are set out below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Applicability of pre-emption clauses to transfers of legal
                title</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Court of Appeal case of <em>Sing Eng (Pte) Ltd v PIC Property Ltd</em> [1990] 1 SLR(R) 792
                        (“<em>Sing Eng</em>”), is one of the few
                    Singapore cases that deal with pre-emption rights with regard to share
                    transfers. In <em>Sing Eng</em>, MM and MK, shareholders in
                    the appellant company, Sing Eng, had charged all their shares to the Xiamen
                    International Bank (“XIB”) under an equitable mortgage. When MM
                    and MK defaulted on their obligations, XIB entered into an agreement to sell the
                    mortgaged shares to the respondent. The question was whether or not the
                    attempted sale and transfer was caught by the pre-emption clauses in Sing
                    Eng’s articles of association. The pre-emption clauses in that case, Arts
                    33 and 34, read (<em>Sing Eng</em> at <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">33    A share may be transferred by a member or other
                            person entitled to transfer (hereinafter called ‘the
                            transferor’) to any member selected by the transferor; but no
                            share shall be transferred to a person who is not a member so long as
                            any member (or any person selected by the directors as one whom it is
                            desirable in the interests of the company to admit to membership) is
                            willing to purchase the same at the fair value.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34    Except where the transfer is made pursuant to arts
                            33, 36 and 43 hereof, a person proposing to transfer any share
                            (hereinafter called the proposing transferor) shall give notice in
                            writing (hereinafter called the transfer notice) to the company that he
                            desires to transfer the same. Such notice shall specify the sum he fixes
                            as the fair value, and shall constitute the company his agent for the
                            sale of the share to any member of the company at the price so fixed or
                            at the option of the purchaser, at the fair value to be fixed by the
                            auditors of the company. The transfer notice shall not be revocable
                            except with the sanction of the directors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The pre-emption clauses in Sing Eng’s articles of
                    association are almost identical to National’s pre-emption
                clauses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Court of Appeal in <em>Sing
                        Eng</em> held that the transfer of shares was ineffectual because XIB
                    was not even a “person entitled to transfer” the shares under Art
                    33 of Sing Eng’s articles of association. The Court held, at [25] and [27], that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The word “transfer” in Art 33, in our
                            opinion, means a transfer of a share or shares and a transfer of [a]
                            share or shares means a transfer of the legal title to the share or
                            shares </em>
<em>…</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is common ground that XIB is an equitable mortgagee of the shares in
                        question, and as such it does not have any legal title to the shares; the
                        legal titles to the shares remain vested in [MM] and [MK] respectively. This
                        being the position, clearly XIB is not a person entitled to transfer the
                        shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In reaching its conclusion, the Court found
                    support in the case of <em>Safeguard Industrial Investments Ltd v
                        National Westminster Bank</em> [1981] 1 WLR 286 (<em>“Safeguard (HC)</em>”), a decision of Vinelott J in the
                    English High Court, as well as in the Court of Appeal decision (affirming the
                    trial judge’s decision) in <em>Safeguard Industrial

                    cases, the original holder (“P”) of a block of shares in a company

                    will, National Westminster Bank (“the defendant bank”). By his
                    will, P had left the beneficial interest in his shares to two beneficiaries. The
                    pre-emption clauses in the company’s articles of association,
                    Arts 7(B)(a) and (b), read as follows (<em>Safeguard

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The question before the court was whether or
                    not Arts 7B(a) and (b) applied to the transfer of the beneficial interest by P
                    to his beneficiaries. Vinelott J held that they did not, since the word
                    “transfer” in Arts 7B(a) and (b) referred to a transfer of the
                    legal interest in the shares and not a transfer of the beneficial interest. At
                    297 – 298, the judge stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although it may seem at first sight unduly restrictive to read the word
                        ‘transfer’ as referring only to a transfer of the legal interest
                        in a share leaving, as Lord Sorn put it, the ‘obvious manoeuvre’
                        of a sale of the beneficial interest unprohibited, Art 7 seems to me wholly
                        inapt to ‘catch’ transfers of beneficial interests. <em>A ‘transfer of a share’ in the ordinary sense of
                            that expression is a transfer of the legal title to the share with the
                            rights and liabilities attaching to it; on registration of the transfer
                            the transferor ceases to be, and the transferee becomes, a member of the
                            company in right of that share.</em> A member who desires to
                        transfer a share will carry his intention into effect by executing a
                        transfer and lodging it for registration. At that stage the restrictions in
                        the pre-emption provisions come into operation. <em>To treat
                            the references to the transfer of a share as comprehending a transfer or
                            disposition of a beneficial interest in a share is to give the
                            expression ‘transfer of a share’ a meaning wider than it
                            would ordinarily bear.</em></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In the Court of Appeal, Oliver LJ (with whom
                    the other Lord Justices agreed unreservedly) endorsed Vinelott J’s
                    analysis of this issue (<em>Safeguard (CA)</em> at
                    599).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Considering the near-identical phraseology of
                    the pre-emption clauses in <em>Sing Eng</em>, the <em>Safeguard</em> cases and the National pre-emption clauses, I
                    could not find any reason for construing the National pre-emption clauses in a
                    different manner. I found that the word “transfer” in the National
                    pre-emption clauses referred to transfers of legal title in the National Shares.
                    I was fortified in my decision by the existence of the Non-Recognition of Trusts
                    Clause, which provides that National Aerated “shall not be bound by or
                    recognise any ... interest in the nature of a trust ... in any share ... except
                    an absolute right thereto in the person for the time being registered as the
                    owners thereof”. National Aerated was not concerned as to whether or not
                    the beneficial interest in the National Shares was being transferred (and,
                    consequently, whether or not the transfer was of <em>both legal
                        and beneficial interest</em>). Indeed, it was obliged to take notice
                    only of persons “registered” as having legal title to the National
                    Shares. Therefore, once there was a transfer or intended transfer of legal title
                    in the National Shares, the National pre-emption clauses would
                apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The plaintiff, however, citing two New Zealand
                    cases, <em>Ord v Calan Healthcare Properties Ltd</em>
                    [2005] 2 NZLR 96 (“<em>Ord</em>”) and
                        <em>Parkinson &amp; Parkinson v James Products Ltd and
                        another</em> (HC AK CIV 2008-404-0033098) [3 September 2008]
                        (<em>“Parkinson</em>”), suggested that
                    the word “transfer” should refer only to a transfer of <em>both</em> the legal and beneficial interests in
                    shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In <em>Ord</em>, the
                    appellant held the beneficial interest in shares in the respondent company, and
                    the said shares were held on trust for the appellant by one Mr Akehurst.
                    The appellant sought to replace Mr Akehurst with a new trustee, <em>ie</em> he sought to transfer the legal title in the shares
                    from Mr Akehurst to the new trustee. The question was whether or not the
                    pre-emption clauses applied. The New Zealand Court of Appeal held that they did
                    not, because the pre-emption clauses were “not a good fit for the changes
                    of trustee which have occurred in relation to the [trust vehicle]” (at
                    [40]). This decision was based on an interpretation of the pre-emption clause in
                    question. The clause read as follows (at [14]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">'8.4 A shareholder intending to transfer any shares (‘the
                        Transferor’) must give a transfer notice in writing to the Board. The
                        transfer notice shall state the number, class and <em>asking
                            price of the shares to be offered for sale</em>. The transfer
                        notice shall constitute the Board the Transferor's agent (to the exclusion
                        of the Transferor) <em>for the sale of the
                            shares.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The pre-emption clause in <em>Ord</em> was phrased very differently from the National pre-emption
                    clauses. The former required the transfer notice to provide for the number,
                    class and asking price of the shares “<em>to be offered
                        for sale</em>”. Clearly, as a matter of contractual
                    interpretation, the clause was meant to apply in the context of <em>sales</em> of the shares only. Indeed, the New Zealand Court
                    of Appeal recognized this when it held at [39]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The paradigm case envisaged by cl 8.4 involves a sale. Clause 8.4 makes
                        this clear by reference to the words '”asking price of the shares to
                        be offered for sale” and the constitution of the board as the
                        transferor's agent “for the sale of the shares'”. The
                        stipulation of an asking price is very significant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The facts of <em>Ord</em>
                    were also quite different from that of the case before me in that it was clear
                    that the pre-emption provisions there were tailored to meet the specific needs
                    of the parties. At the time the company’s articles were adopted, the
                    appellant’s shares were already held by a trust and the pre-emption
                    clauses were drafted with these in mind. Cl 8.5 specifically exempted the
                    pre-emption clauses from transfers associated with the death or bankruptcy of
                    the appellant or any person with whom the appellant was registered as a joint
                    holder. The court found that if the appellant had realised that a change in
                    trustee would have triggered pre-emption rights, the parties would have agreed
                    to a carve-out in respect of changes of trustee. This indicated to the court
                    that “it was regarded on all sides as so obvious that the [pre-emption
                    clause] did not apply to mere changes of trustee that no such carve-out was
                    required” (at [44]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     There is no overt reference to a
                    “sale” of shares in the National pre-emption clauses and there is
                    nothing to suggest that they should be interpreted as applying only in the
                    context of a sale of shares. Unlike in <em>Ord</em>, there
                    was no evidence that the articles were adopted to cater for the needs of
                    shareholders who were holding their shares through trustees. I therefore found
                    that <em>Ord</em> was distinguishable from the case at hand
                    and did not assist the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The next case, <em>Parkinson</em>, had a pre-emption clause that provided (at [12]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.    No share in the capital of the company shall be
                            sold or transferred by any shareholder unless and until the rights of
                            pre-emption hereinafter conferred have been exhausted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Like the court in <em>Ord</em>, the New Zealand High Court in <em>Parkinson</em> held that the pre-emption clause applied only in the
                    context of sales of shares. The reasoning of the Court from [47] to [48] also
                    reveals the language of the pre-emption clauses:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That conclusion is reinforced by the wording of subclauses 12.3 to 12.5.
                        Notwithstanding that clause 12.3 requires a shareholder wanting to
                        “sell or transfer” shares to give notice of the desire to do
                        so, <em>the subclause goes on to refer only to the
                            </em><em>“sale” of shares, “at
                            a price to be agreed upon” or “at a fair price to be
                            determined.”</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subclause 12.4 sets out the procedure to be followed once the
                        “price” has been agreed to determined. The procedure includes
                        giving shareholders the opportunity of giving notice of a desire to
                        “purchase” shares, the apportionment of shares to be
                        “sold”, and the payment of the purchase money. Subclause 12.5
                        sets out what is to occur if shares are not “sold” pursuant to
                        subclause 12.4.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Thus, the pre-emption clause in <em>Parkinson</em> also made almost exclusive references to
                    “sales”, phraseology that was significantly different from the
                    National pre-emption clauses. <em>Parkinson</em> was, like
                        <em>Ord</em>, distinguishable from the case at hand. It
                    was another case where there was a trustee from the inception, the difference
                    between it and <em>Ord</em> being that in <em>Parkinson</em>, the beneficial owners wanted the shares
                    transferred to themselves by the trustee rather than to a different trustee. The
                    facts here are quite different. KK Ching had ceased to be a shareholder in
                    National Aerated decades ago and by the time the order for the shares to be
                    transferred to his estate was made, as a result of the deaths of KK Ching
                    and Paul Ching himself, the ultimate beneficial interest in the shares was
                    vested in a third party who had nothing to do with National Aerated at all. This
                    was not a situation of a bare trustee stepping aside in favour of the person who
                    had been the beneficial shareholder all along to the knowledge of the
                    company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As to any suggestion that <em>Ord</em> and <em>Parkinson</em> stand for a
                    general proposition that pre-emption clauses must apply only to transfers of
                    both legal and beneficial interest, I disagree and would defer to the position
                    stated in <em>Sing Eng</em> (which, in any event, is
                    binding on me) and the <em>Safeguard</em>
                cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Applicability of pre-emption clauses to return of shares from trustee
                to beneficiary</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The other limb of the plaintiff’s
                    argument was that the National pre-emption clauses were not meant to apply to
                    the return of shares from bare trustees to beneficiaries, which was the
                    relationship between Ms Ching and the plaintiff. The plaintiff suggested
                    that there was a distinction between cases where “a party is voluntarily
                    purporting to transfer shares (<em>eg</em> pursuant to a
                    sale or gift), and when a party involuntarily comes under an obligation”
                    to transfer shares. The plaintiff sought to rely on <em>Safeguard
                        (CA)</em> as authority for that argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The facts of the <em>Safeguard</em> cases have been set out above at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>. The appellants before the Court of Appeal
                    canvassed the alternative argument that the defendant bank (holder of the legal
                    title to the shares) was bound to serve a transfer notice to the existing
                    members because it was a “proposing transferor” under Art 7B(b),
                    the pre-emption clause in that case. The court was requested to find that the
                    defendant bank was a “proposing transferor” even though
                    “the beneficiaries disclaim any desire to exercise their right to compel
                    a transfer to them” (<em>Safeguard (CA)</em> at
                    596). The English Court of Appeal rejected that argument. Oliver LJ
                    distinguished the case of <em>Lyle &amp; Scott Ltd v
                        Scott’s Trustees</em> [1959] AC 763 (“<em>Lyle</em>”), where members of the company had voluntarily
                    entered into contracts with a stranger for the sale to him of their shares.
                    Viscount Simonds in <em>Lyle</em> stated at 774 that
                    “it is not open to a shareholder, who has agreed to do a certain thing
                    and is bound to do it, to deny that he is desirous of doing it”. Oliver
                    LJ in <em>Safeguard (CA)</em> found that the principle in
                        <em>Lyle</em> was not applicable to the case before
                    him, where the trustees had an involuntary obligation to transfer the legal
                    title in their shares, because that would mean that “duty equals
                    desire” (<em>Safeguard (CA)</em> at 597). Oliver LJ
                    concluded at 599:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I find myself quite unable to construe the article in the instant case in
                        a way which would make a person who involuntarily comes under an obligation
                        to transfer, if called upon, a “proposing transferor.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The plaintiff sought to rely on Oliver
                    LJ’s judgment to suggest that Ms Ching was similarly not a
                    “proposing transferor” under Art 31 of the National pre-emption
                    clauses. I was not persuaded by that argument. Clearly, the facts of <em>Safeguard (CA)</em> were distinguishable from those presented
                    before me. In <em>Safeguard (CA)</em>, the beneficiaries
                    had disclaimed any desire to exercise their right to compel any transfer of the
                    legal title to them. This was clearly the premise upon which Oliver LJ founded
                    his decision – the trustees had a <em>latent
                        obligation</em> to transfer shares if called upon, but they could not
                    be considered “proposing transferors” so long as the beneficiaries
                    did not exercise their right to compel a transfer of the shares. In the case
                    before me, the plaintiff had clearly sought to compel a transfer of the National
                    Shares from Ms Ching to the estate, pursuant to Chong JC’s decision
                    in <em>Ching v Ching</em>. The latent obligation was
                    triggered and Ms Ching, by executing the transfers of the National Shares,
                    was clearly a “proposing transferor” under Art 31 of the National
                    pre-emption clauses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The plaintiff also canvassed an argument to
                    the effect that the fundamental objective of the National pre-emption clauses
                    was to keep the ownership of the shares with members of the same family or of
                    the families who originally agreed to associate themselves in that way. The
                    plaintiff relied on <em>Guan Soon Development Pte Ltd v Yeo Gek
                        Lang Susie (administratrix of the estate of Teo Lay Swee, deceased) and
                        others</em> [2006] 3 SLR(R) 387 (“<em>Guan
                        Soon</em>”). This case did not help the plaintiff, however,
                    because the Court of Appeal in <em>Guan Soon</em> was
                    interpreting a wholly different clause. That clause provided that pre-emption
                    clauses would not apply in respect of share transfers from a deceased member to
                    “such person(s) who shall become entitled to a share in consequence of
                    the death of the member in accordance with the applicable laws of
                    intestacy” (at [7]). Further, the
                    court was seeking to make the quite different point that distribution of shares
                    to a beneficiary would accord with the applicable laws on intestacy even though
                    the number of shares distributed did not correspond to the number of shares
                    receivable had they been distributed <em>in specie</em> (at
                        [20] and [21]). The court was not making an immutable
                    statement of the law on the interpretation of pre-emption clauses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In conclusion, I found that the National
                    pre-emption clauses applied to a transfer of legal title in the National Shares
                    from Ms Ching, a registered shareholder, to the estate. Ms Ching was
                    bound to offer the National Shares to the existing members of National Aerated
                    under Art 31 of the National pre-emption clauses, and could only transfer the
                    same to the estate if no existing members were willing to purchase the National
                    Shares, pursuant to Art 33 of the National pre-emption clauses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     I therefore dismissed the plaintiff’s
                    prayer to compel National Aerated to register the share transfer and deliver to
                    the plaintiff new share certificates in respect of the National
                Shares.</p>
