<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Under s 285 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006
                    Rev Ed) (“the Act”), when a company is in liquidation, the court
                    may summon before it any person whom the court considers capable of giving
                    information concerning the promotion, formation, trade dealings, affairs or
                    property of the company. Such person may be examined on oath regarding the
                    aforesaid matters and the court may also require him to produce any books or
                    papers in his custody or power relating to the company. The application before
                    me concerns the exercise of that power.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The application is made by Mr Yit Chee Wah
                    (“Mr Yit” or “the Liquidator”), the liquidator of
                    Celestial Nutrifoods Limited (“the Company”). He wants the court
                    to examine the Company’s former auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
                    (“PwC”) and its relevant representatives including, but not
                    limited to, Mr Tham Tuck Seng and Mr Tan Boon Chok. PwC resists the application
                    on the basis that the Liquidator is acting oppressively, that to comply with the
                    disclosure orders might require it to do acts that are illegal under Chinese law
                    and that its working papers are not reasonably required by the Liquidator. This
                    judgment will explore those issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In the application as originally filed, the
                    Liquidator sought orders under s 285 not only against PwC but also against
                    various other persons. These included Mr Ming Dequan (“Mr Ming”),
                    the chairman of the Company, and three individuals in the People’s
                    Republic of China (“the PRC”) who were the legal representatives
                    of the Company’s subsidiaries. These latter persons did not appear at the
                    first hearing of the application and I made the orders sought against them. They
                    have not appealed against those orders. Accordingly, I need say no more about
                    the reasons for making those orders. In this judgment, I am dealing only with
                    the Liquidator’s application against PwC and its
                representatives.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Company was incorporated in Bermuda in 2003.
                    It was an investment holding company for several subsidiaries, all incorporated
                    in the British Virgin Islands (“the BVI Subsidiaries”). The BVI
                    Subsidiaries in turn owned subsidiaries incorporated in the PRC (collectively
                    called “the PRC Subsidiaries”). The operations of the Group
                    (comprising the Company and its subsidiaries) were carried on in the PRC by the
                    PRC Subsidiaries who also owned the physical and financial assets of the Group.
                    The Group’s main business activity was producing soybean protein-based
                    foods under the “Sun Moon Star” brand. The Company was listed on
                    the Singapore Stock Exchange (“SGX”) on 9 January 2004 and raised
                    some S$33m from this exercise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 12 June 2006, the Company raised S$235m from
                    investors by issuing Zero Coupon Convertible Bonds (“the Bonds”).
                    The bondholders were granted put options which allowed them to compel the
                    Company to redeem all or some of the Bonds at 116.5% of their face value. On 23
                    May 2009, a majority of the bondholders exercised their put options and the
                    Company was required to redeem the Bonds on 12 June 2009. Shortly thereafter,
                    the Company announced it would be unable to meet this obligation. On the due
                    date, it failed to redeem any of the Bonds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 23 November 2010, BNY Corporate Trustee
                    Services Ltd (“BNY”), the trustee of the Bonds, issued a statutory
                    demand against the Company for the amount due under the Bonds. When this was not
                    satisfied, BNY commenced winding up proceedings against the Company <em>via</em> CWU 195/2010 (“CWU 195”). BNY thus
                    became the plaintiff in CWU 195. Mr Yit was appointed the Company’s
                    provisional liquidator on 24 December 2010. A  year later, the Company
                    was wound up and Mr Yit then became the Liquidator. The winding up order was
                    made on 2 December 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       After taking control of the Company in December
                    2010, the Liquidator discovered that the Group’s operating companies,
                    management and directors were based in the PRC. Despite his efforts, he was
                    unable to obtain any meaningful assistance from them with regard to the affairs
                    of the Company or of its subsidiaries. He also ascertained that the
                    Company’s main assets, namely the PRC Subsidiaries, appeared to have been
                    diverted to third parties in a series of suspicious transactions. The Liquidator
                    considered that the Company’s shareholders and creditors had been left
                    holding shares in a worthless company whose assets had been completely stripped
                    away.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Liquidator also discovered that the Company
                    did not have funds to investigate suspicious transactions or to commence legal
                    proceedings against other parties to recover money and assets that were
                    allegedly paid out wrongfully. The Liquidator therefore entered into a Funding
                    Agreement (“the Funding Agreement”) with several creditors
                    (collectively referred to as “Blackrock creditors”) who are
                    members of a group identified as the Blackrock Group. Blackrock creditors hold
                    the majority of the Bonds. Under the Funding Agreement, Blackrock creditors are
                    to provide:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     US$507,122 to the Liquidator as part
                        payment towards his outstanding fees and costs;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     an additional US$230,000 for costs incurred in
                        examination and/or discovery proceedings commenced by the Liquidator;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c"></a>(c)     another
                        US$507,122 to pay for the Liquidator’s remaining outstanding fees and
                        costs and additional funding to commence proceedings if the Liquidator
                        identifies any potential claim which Blackrock creditors decide to
                        pursue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       This application was filed after the Funding
                    Agreement was concluded. The Liquidator maintained that the purpose of the
                    application was not simply to obtain information to enable him to bring legal
                    action against any party. The application had the wider purpose of obtaining
                    further documents and information to enable the Liquidator to carry out his
                    statutory duty to:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     reconcile the accounts of the Company
                        and reconstitute the state of the Company’s
                    knowledge;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     investigate the circumstances that led to the Company’s eventual
                        collapse, including certain suspicious transactions identified by the
                        Liquidator; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     upon ascertaining the true financial position of the Group and the true
                        cause of the Company’s collapse, consider whether claims should be
                        pursued to recover the Company’s assets and/or for breaches of duty by
                        the Company’s officers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Whilst the
                        application is drafted in general terms, before me, counsel for the
                        Liquidator, Ms Blossom Hing, clarified that there were seven specific areas
                        in respect of which the Liquidator considered that PwC’s information
                        and records would be particularly helpful. According to the Liquidator, the
                        documents and information that he had already obtained had come primarily
                        from the following sources:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_d"></a>(d)     the Company’s corporate
                    secretary;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_e"></a>(e)     the
                        Company’s registered agent in Bermuda;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_f"></a>(f)     the Company’s independent directors in
                        Singapore, Mr Lai and Mr Loo;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_g"></a>(g)     the corporate regulatory authorities in Daqing,
                        PRC;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_h"></a>(h)     KPMG
                        Singapore (“KPMG”), the independent accountants appointed by
                        the Company on 25 September 2009 to conduct an independent review of the
                        Company’s financial position to facilitate a restructuring of the
                        Bonds; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_i"></a>(i)     PwC
                        who had provided three arch-lever files of documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Turning to PwC, its role in regard to the
                    Company was set out in the affidavit of Mr Tan Boon Chok. PwC was engaged to
                    audit the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the financial
                    years (“FY”) 2004 to 2009. It issued audit reports for FY 2004 to
                    FY 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     As the Company’s auditors, PwC was
                    responsible for examining the Company’s consolidated financial statements
                    so as to express an opinion on the same. Broadly, this entailed PwC performing
                    procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
                    financial statements in accordance with the Singapore Financial Reporting
                    Standards (“SFRS”). PwC’s audit also included evaluating the
                    appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
                    estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
                    the financial statements. PwC emphasised that as auditors of the Company it did
                    not participate in any management or executive decisions of the Company
                    including its trade dealings, affairs or property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     PwC issued the FY 2009 audit report on 29
                    March 2010. According to Mr Tan, it did not commence any audit work for FY 2010
                    thereafter. PwC took the view that the Liquidator’s real motivation in
                    bringing the application is to obtain advance evidence in order to gain an
                    unfair advantage in any claim which he intends to bring or contemplates bringing
                    against PwC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In dealing with this application, I shall take
                    the following approach: I shall first consider the law. I shall then
                    consider the objections made by PwC and the relevant facts relating to the
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The general legal principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The extent and purpose of s 285 of the Act
                    have been considered on several occasions by the court. The leading authorities
                    in Singapore are <em>Liquidator of W&amp;P Piling Pte Ltd v Chew
                        Yin What and others</em> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 164 (“<em>W&amp;P Piling</em>”) and <em>Re Lion
                        City Holdings Pte Ltd</em> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 493. Foreign judgments on
                    similar legislation which have been found persuasive in Singapore include
                        <em>Re British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings plc v Spicer and
                        Oppenheim</em> [1993] 1 AC 426 (“<em>British
                        &amp; Commonwealth</em>”) and <em>In Re Rolls
                        Razor Ltd (No 2)</em> [1970] 1 Ch 576.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Singapore courts have adopted an expansive
                    approach towards s 285. As emphasised by V K Rajah JC in <em>W&amp;P Piling</em>, the legislative policy behind s 285 was that the
                    power given by the section should be used to assist the liquidator in
                    accumulating facts, information and knowledge that would enable him to discharge
                    his statutory duties. The judge pointed out that s 285 is couched in extremely
                    generous terms and should not be interpreted in a constricted manner. Whilst it
                    cannot be used for a collateral purpose that affords no benefit to the company,
                    it may be invoked for any proper purpose that would benefit the company and
                    which is within the statutory powers of the liquidator and the scheme of the
                    legislation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The authorities make clear that when it is
                    faced with an application under s 285, the court must bear the following in
                    mind:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     A liquidator is presumed to be
                        neutral, independent and acting in the company’s best interests. It is
                        the court’s role to support its officers while policing their
                        conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        court must balance between the purpose and intent of the application and the
                        oppression, inconvenience and disadvantage that it might cause to the
                        proposed examinee. If relevant information can be obtained without s 285, it
                        should not be invoked.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     No distinction is made between company officers and
                        outsiders and the same test applies to both categories of people although
                        the presence of a relationship between the company and the proposed examinee
                        is a relevant factor that would be considered in evaluating the
                        application.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_d"></a>(d)     An
                        order for oral examination would be seen as more onerous than an order to
                        produce documents which would be granted quite readily if relevance is
                        shown.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_e"></a>(e)     Using s
                        285 as a way to prove a case against the examinee himself is
                        oppressive.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_f"></a>(f)     Information can be sought and fact discovered in a situation where the
                        liquidator contemplates a specific claim against the examinee or related
                        entity. However, if the liquidator has already decided to sue the proposed
                        examinee, this procedure is inappropriate.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_g"></a>(g)     Whether the order is sought against a person
                        already under an obligation to co-operate with the
                    liquidator.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_h"></a>(h)     Exposure to civil or criminal liability is only a factor to be taken into
                        account and is not conclusive as to the matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     PwC did not disagree with the general
                    principles stated above. Its counsel, Mr Alvin Yeo SC, sought however to
                    emphasise the extraordinary and coercive nature of the power bestowed on the
                    court by s 285. In the light of this, the court should avoid making an order
                    that is wholly unreasonable, unnecessary or oppressive to the person concerned.
                        <em>W&amp;P Piling</em> at [30] itself establishes that
                    a proposed examinee can oppose or discharge an application for examination by
                    showing:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     a case of oppression or unfair
                        prejudice;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     that
                        the information is not reasonably required;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     the liquidator is acting inappropriately,
                        outside his statutory functions or is motivated by improper
                        considerations;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_d"></a>(d)     that there has been a lack of full and frank disclosure by the liquidator;
                        or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_e"></a>(e)     that the
                        examination is sought to give the company an undue
                advantage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     There are other relevant principles but since
                    those relate to the application of the general principles set out above, I will
                    discuss them as they arise in the context of the particular items of disclosure
                    that the Liquidator wishes to obtain.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Documents and information sought from PwC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Liquidator asserted that PwC had provided
                    the Company with only three arch-lever files even though it had been auditor of
                    the Company for more than seven years. Those files contained only high-level
                    consolidation schedules, limited company and subsidiary level financial
                    information, year-end balances and minutes of meetings which the Liquidator had
                    already recovered from other sources. Those documents would not be of use to the
                    Liquidator unless he also has access to the full general ledgers and accounts
                    that made up the high level consolidation schedules and year-end
                    balances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Liquidator said that he needs primary
                    records for a proper analysis of the consolidated financial statements and
                    year-end balances. This is essential to the Liquidator’s ability to
                    reconstruct the financial records of the Company and to investigate the
                    suspicious transactions. The primary records to which the Liquidator is
                    referring and which he believes PwC would have include:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     general ledgers and trial balance(s)
                        of each entity in the Group;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     bank statements and bank reconciliations of the same that
                        would have been prepared by each entity in the Group;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     fixed assets’ registers of each
                        entity in the Group and evidence of the ownership of assets and land use
                        rights recorded on the register;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_d"></a>(d)     copies of loan facility documents for each loan facility
                        operated by each entity of the Group;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_e"></a>(e)     sales contracts, purchase contracts, supplier contracts,
                        receipts and payments vouchers;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_f"></a>(f)     detailed creditors and debtors schedules;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_g"></a>(g)     statutory
                        documents filed by each entity of the Group.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The liquidator also wants access to PwC’s working
                        papers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Liquidator has identified seven suspicious
                    and/or irregular and/or undisclosed transactions undertaken by the Company and
                    the Group between 2006 and 2010 which warrant further investigation. These can
                    be briefly described as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     surreptitious disposal of
                        substantially all of the Company’s assets on or around 4 December 2010
                        by way of an auction (“the Auction”) of the shares of the PRC
                        Subsidiaries which had been pledged to the China Construction Bank
                        (“CCB”) as security for certain loans apparently extended by
                        CCB to the BVI Subsidiaries;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     cash payments totalling some S$16.8m to Power Charm Group
                        Ltd (“Power Charm”) between December 2009 and September
                        2010;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>(c)     payment
                        of some RMB 70m in or around December 2009 to purchase technical
                        know-how in respect of a Bio-diesel Plant;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_d"></a>(d)     goods that had been sold and returned, the value
                        of which amounted to RMB 254m in 2009 and RMB 437.1 million in
                        2010, and some of which were subsequently re-sold for only
                        RMB 14.8m;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_e"></a>(e)     cash payments of some RMB 529m without written documentation in
                        relation to the Soybean Hi-Tech Industrial Zone in Daqing (“Soybean
                        Zone”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_f"></a>(f)     an undisclosed lease of land to construct a hotel known as the Daqing
                        Manhatwen Hotel; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_g"></a>(g)     suspicious transactions described in certain anonymous letters
                        regarding the Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The Liquidator believes that PwC would have
                    obtained documents and information relating to the Group’s trade dealings,
                    affairs and properties which information could assist in his investigations
                    because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     it was the reporting accountant and
                        auditor for the initial public offering of the Company’s shares in
                        December 2003 and in this role would have prepared and presented pro-forma
                        financial information;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     it was the Company’s and Group’s auditor for
                        seven years and was closely involved in the Company’s affairs.
                        PwC’s representatives attended every single Audit Committee meeting
                        between FY 2004 and FY 2009 and attended two Audit Committee meeting held in
                        2010;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        Company’s management would have provided to PwC relevant information
                        on the background, nature and parties involved in particular
                        transactions;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_d"></a>(d)     PwC audited the financial accounts of the Group in accordance with the
                        Singapore Standards on Auditing (“SSA”) and would therefore
                        have examined, on a test basis, audit evidence supporting the amounts and
                        disclosures in the Group’s financial statements;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_e"></a>(e)     the SSA requires PwC to keep a record
                        of audit procedures performed, the relevant audit evidence obtained and
                        conclusion reached for a period of not less than five years from the date of
                        the audit reports.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Referring to the record of audit procedures
                    performed, Ms Hing submits that PwC would most likely have audit evidence in the
                    form of PwC’s working papers. This would include:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     extracts of the accounting records
                        of the Company;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     external confirmations;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_c"></a>(c)     reconciliation schedules;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_d"></a>(d)     samples of major invoices issued to, and by, the
                        Company and its subsidiaries;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_e"></a>(e)     copies of material contracts, loan documentation, payroll
                        related documentation, tax filings and/or assessment;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_f"></a>(f)     details of major customers and
                        suppliers; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_g"></a>(g)     records of interviews with the Company and the Group’s management
                        and/or staff and other supporting documents which contain information that
                        is not reflected in the Company’s financial statements, but which may
                        nevertheless be important to assist the Liquidator in discharging his
                        statutory duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Liquidator pointed out that in 2006 PwC
                    had confirmed that it had:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)     been granted unrestricted access to
                        the Group’s accounting and other records;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)     had carried analytical procedures on sales
                        revenue, gross profit margin, Value-Added Tax and substantial vouching of
                        sales;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_c"></a>(c)     received
                        bank confirmations from bank officers;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_d"></a>(d)     sighted documentation on the legal title deeds of the
                        material property, plant and equipment; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_e"></a>(e)     attended a physical inventory account and had
                        tested the reconciliation of the inventory account
                    information.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Ms Hing submits that similar
                        access and work would have been given and performed in the following years
                        as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Liquidator contends that although PwC did
                    not carry out audit work in respect of FY 2010, after the issue of the FY 2009
                    audit report on 29 March 2010, it would still have been provided with
                    further information and documents as part of its follow up work in respect of
                    material subsequent events. In fact, PwC continued to attend Audit Committee
                    meetings up to 5 May 2010 and at that meeting it was apprised of
                    information relating to the return of sold goods during the period between
                    January and March 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Given the evidence and PwC’s own letters
                    to the Liquidator, the Liquidator considers that PwC would be able to provide
                    the following information or documents in relation to the Group:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     working papers and/or notes with
                        information on the “analytical procedures on sales revenue”
                        and “substantive vouching of sales and VAT” for the purpose of
                        verifying the true nature of the trading relationships the Group had with
                        its customers;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     copies of the general ledgers, trial balances, aged receivables schedules
                        and debtors lists for the Company and each of its
                    subsidiaries;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_c"></a>(c)     copies of bank statements and bank reconciliation
                    schedules;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_d"></a>(d)     confirmations from the bank officers of Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of
                        Communications and Daqing Commercial Bank that were given to
                    PwC;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_e"></a>(e)     written
                        confirmations from the Company’s top five customers and the
                        reconciliation with the accounting records of the
                    Company;</p>

                        papers of PwC along with the external bank confirmations which show how the
                        confirmations from the bank officers were reconciled with the accounting
                        records of the Company;</p>

                        plant and equipment held by the Group which will allow the Liquidator to
                        ascertain the assets of the Group, and notes or memoranda on physical
                        inspections conducted by PwC’s staff; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_h"></a>(h)     notes recording the physical inventory stocktake
                        conducted by PwC and working papers showing the reconciliation of the
                        inventory count information.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">PwC’s objections to the application</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Is the Liquidator objective?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     PwC submits that the Liquidator is not
                    exercising his power under s 285 for a proper purpose. Citing <em>Korea Asset Management Corp v Daewoo Singapore Pte Ltd (in
                        liquidation)</em> [2004] 1 SLR(R) 671 (“<em>KAMC</em>”), PwC asserts that any liquidator making such an
                    application should be seen to be properly wearing the mantle of objective
                    neutrality untarnished by any special interest, including considerations of his
                    own fee. In this case, the Liquidator does not meet this standard
                    because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_a"></a>(a)     he is represented by the same
                        solicitors as acted for BNY in presenting CWU 195;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_b"></a>(b)     he is focussing on claims which can be
                        made to maximise recovery for the Company’s creditors, and in
                        particular Blackrock creditors, and seeks to achieve this by applying
                        pressure on Mr Ming and other parties through the s 285 procedure so as to
                        procure more reasonable settlement offers;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_c"></a>(c)     the Funding Agreement makes it clear that the
                        Liquidator is not purely trying to ascertain information relating to the
                        Company through the s 285 procedure but is doing so with a view to
                        identifying and/or obtaining more information about claims which can be
                        pursued;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_d"></a>(d)     under
                        the Funding Agreement, the Liquidator would only be paid the other half of
                        the outstanding fees of US$507,122 in the event that he identifies potential
                        claims that may be available against third parties, the Blackrock creditors
                        decide to pursue any of these claims, and parties agree on additional
                        funding for the same. Therefore, the Liquidator has every incentive to
                        commence proceedings that are frivolous and that would only result in losses
                        for the Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I do not accept the contention that the
                    Liquidator in this case is not objective and neutral. The fact that the
                    Liquidator is represented by the same solicitors as BNY in CWU 195 was, cannot,
                    without more, establish a lack of objectivity on the part of the Liquidator. The
                    Liquidator’s function is to collect assets for and protect the interests
                    of the unsecured creditors. In that respect, there is an identity of interests
                    between BNY, as the trustee for the bondholders who are among the
                    Company’s unsecured creditors, and the Liquidator as the protector of that
                    class of creditors. There is no doubt that the Company owed the bondholders a
                    debt and that the winding up order was properly made. In those circumstances,
                    the simple fact that the Liquidator’s solicitors formerly acted for BNY
                    cannot imply any lack of objectivity on the part of the
                Liquidator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The second reason given, that the Liquidator
                    is not objective because he has been seeking out claims to maximise recovery for
                    the Company’s creditors is, as the Liquidator submits, unintelligible. One
                    of the functions of the Liquidator is to maximise recovery for the
                    Company’s creditors. The fact that these creditors include Blackrock
                    creditors that are funding the exercise is irrelevant. It would be a breach of
                    duty if the Liquidator did not seek to determine whether there were claims that
                    could be pursued for the benefit of the creditors despite being put in funds to
                    do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Thirdly, I see nothing suspicious in the
                    Funding Agreement. The Liquidator needs funds to pursue investigations and
                    claims for the benefit of all creditors. Although the funds are being provided
                    by Blackrock creditors, there is nothing in the Funding Agreement that would
                    give these Blackrock creditors any preference from any recoveries made by the
                    Company. All benefits from claims and recoveries would be shared rateably among
                    all the unsecured creditors. It is correct that the Liquidator will not recover
                    half of his outstanding fees unless certain conditions are met but it is as much
                    in the interests of all the creditors as of the Liquidator (with regard to his
                    fees) that if the Company has been wrongfully deprived of assets, a proper
                    investigation should be done to determine whether viable claims for recovery of
                    the same can be brought. If the Liquidator finds and substantiates such claims
                    there may very well be benefits for the unsecured creditors and the Liquidator
                    should not be hindered by allegations of bias simply because he too may benefit
                    from the same. The Liquidator is an officer of the court. Further, apart from
                    carrying out his statutory duties, he has his own professional reputation to
                    protect. No basis has been established for the allegation that he will pursue
                    frivolous proceedings where there will be no benefit to the creditors and that
                    the creditors will not support such actions. In any case, if the Liquidator acts
                    unreasonably in pursuing frivolous claims, the court has the power to make
                    personal costs orders against him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I accept the Liquidator’s evidence that
                    there are claims that can be investigated for the benefit of the creditors and
                    that the Liquidator needed financing because the Company had no funds of its own
                    to support the investigation. The Funding Agreement was a proper step for the
                    Liquidator to take when he found out that Blackrock creditors were willing to
                    finance the investigation. It should also be noted that at the hearing that Mr
                    Yeo stated he was not suggesting that the Liquidator was misconducting
                    himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     PwC relies on <em>KAMC</em> to show that the Liquidator was not acting objectively in
                    the present case. The facts of <em>KAMC</em> are very
                    different and do not assist PwC. In <em>KAMC</em>, the
                    majority creditors of a company sought to obtain a compulsory winding up order
                    when voluntary winding up proceedings had already been commenced. The
                    liquidators appointed for the voluntary winding up proceedings objected to the
                    application. The court found that the applicants were not comfortable with or
                    confident in the liquidators’ ability to discharge their duties
                    even-handedly. It also noted that the liquidators had not been able to
                    adequately satisfy the applicants or the court how layer upon layer of intricate
                    transactions between the company and related entities could be satisfactorily
                    peeled back and accounted for. There was real basis for the applicants to
                    perceive some apparent conflict of interest between the liquidators and the
                    creditors. The situation here is completely unlike that which occurred in
                        <em>KAMC</em>. The Liquidator was appointed by
                    creditors in a compulsory winding up and all his actions so far have been to
                    further the interests of the creditors rather than those of the Company or its
                    shareholders.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Is the Liquidator’s true motivation to obtain evidence against
                PwC?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Mr Yeo submits that the Liquidator’s
                    true motivation in bringing this application is to seek discovery from PwC to
                    bolster his case in respect of a potential claim against them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     This allegation is partly based on PwC’s
                    interpretation of the Liquidator’s previous statements. PwC points to the
                    first report that the Liquidator gave to the court dated 28 November 2011
                    (“First Report”). In the First Report, the Liquidator identified
                    three areas of concern (‘the original concerns”) regarding the
                    handling of assets of the Company. Then, in a report to creditors dated 6
                    December 2011, the Liquidator said he had identified possible claims against Mr
                    Ming, the former directors and other parties related to the three specific
                    matters, that is, the original concerns. None of them involved PwC. Next, in an
                    affidavit filed in CWU 195, in June 2012, the Liquidator continued to list the
                    original concerns when describing matters that he considered warranted further
                    investigation and action. In none of the documents referred to did the
                    Liquidator claim that there were other suspicious transactions which warranted
                    investigation. Five of the seven transactions which the Liquidator now considers
                    to be suspicious were not even hinted at earlier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Mr Yeo submits that the original concerns were
                    matters that PwC could not provide the Liquidator with further information on
                    because they related to actions that had been taken after 29 March 2010 when PwC
                    was no longer doing audit work. In particular, the Liquidator was concerned with
                    the payments made to Power Charm, the loans made to the BVI Subsidiaries by CCB
                    and the propriety of the Auction. PwC said it could not assist the Liquidator in
                    respect of those matters because they all occurred in FY 2010. PwC did not
                    perform any audit work in FY 2010 and would not have any information pertaining
                    to those transactions. When this had been pointed out to him, the Liquidator had
                    sought to re-package his request in relation to those matters. This was not
                    permissible especially because the Liquidator had not informed the court of the
                    full nature and extent of the information that he had already received from
                    various parties and/or uncovered from his own investigation. It was therefore
                    not clear what information the Liquidator was seeking to verify or corroborate
                    from the documents or what information he wanted PwC to disclose. Mr Yeo went on
                    to submit that if the Liquidator made full disclosure of the information that he
                    already had, this would expose his true motives for the application (<em>ie</em>, to fish for information in order to bolster a claim
                    against PwC).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I am not convinced by this argument. In the
                    first place, the fact that the Liquidator originally identified three areas of
                    concern and has now asked the court for documents relating to seven areas of
                    concern is by itself a completely neutral fact. The Liquidator has been carrying
                    on his investigation since he was first appointed in December 2010 and he has
                    managed to obtain information over the past few years which has enabled him to
                    identify further areas of concern. Just because PwC may not be able to help very
                    much in relation to the original concerns, does not mean that the new areas have
                    been selected in order to persecute PwC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Secondly, the objection is too vague. The
                    Liquidator has never said anything in any of the reports or court affidavits
                    about the quality of PwC’s audit work or about suing PwC. So far there has
                    been no suggestion that PwC, in the course of its audit work, behaved
                    unprofessionally in any way. The approach by PwC appears to be unduly defensive.
                    At this stage of the proceedings, the assertion that the Liquidator’s true
                    motive is to fault PwC’s audit work and unfairly obtain advance evidence
                    to substantiate a claim against PwC is completely baseless.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The Liquidator’s evidence is that he has
                    not settled on any view as to whether any claims may even exist against PwC. He
                    simply wants to try and obtain as much information as possible in relation to
                    the Company’s affairs. In any case, in the English case of <em>Re Chesterfield United Inc and another company; Akers and another v
                        Deutsche Bank AG</em> [2013] 1 BCLC 709, the court observed that it
                    was not a bar to an examination order being made that the liquidators have in
                    mind the possibility of litigation and that it was legitimate for an office
                    holder to seek relief with a view to investigation whether a claim
                    exists.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In this connection, PwC also argues that the
                    Liquidator had no reasonable requirement for the information and documents
                    sought from it. I disagree. I will deal with this below but I accept that
                    PwC’s information and documents will assist the Liquidator to carry out
                    his statutory duty as described at [9] above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Would granting the application result in oppressing PwC?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     PwC submits that granting the application
                    would result in an order which is oppressive to it because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_a"></a>(a)     it is being asked to turn over its
                        audit working papers, which are its proprietary
                    information;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        order would expose PwC to a real risk of civil liability as well as criminal
                        sanction under Chinese law; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_c"></a>(c)     an oral examination of Mr Tham and Mr Tan would be
                        oppressive, unnecessary and unfruitful in any case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Proprietary information</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     It is true that the working papers belong to
                    PwC and contain their proprietary information meant for internal use when PwC
                    staff was preparing the various audit reports. This does not mean, however, that
                    disclosure of these documents cannot be ordered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In <em>British &amp;
                        Commonwealth</em>, the auditors of the company concerned were ordered
                    to disclose their working papers because the same included “information
                    of relevance”. The applicant in that case was the administrator of an
                    insolvent company which had earlier purchased and acquired a target company
                    based in part on a report by the target company’s auditors that the target
                    company had sufficient working capital for its operations. Subsequently, it was
                    found that the target company’s assets were insufficient for this purpose
                    and the administrator of the insolvent company applied for and obtained an order
                    for the auditors of the target company to produce “all books, papers, or
                    other records … relating to or having any connection” with:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_a"></a>(a)     the target company’s year-end
                        audit report immediately before the acquisition;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_b"></a>(b)     the target company’s year-end
                        audit report immediately after the acquisition; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_c"></a>(c)     the acquisition of the target company,
                        including but not limited to the working capital
                review.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The order for production was challenged on the
                    basis that it was so wide that it included the working papers of the target
                    company’s auditors besides simply the papers of the target company itself.
                    The House of Lords upheld the order on the basis that these papers could clearly
                    contain information of relevance to the administrator’s
                    investigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In a more recent Hong Kong case, <em>Re Kong Wah Holdings Ltd &amp; Anor (in liquidation)</em>
                    [2004] 2 HKC 255 (“<em>Kong Wah
                    Holdings</em>”), the liquidator relied on a statutory power in Hong
                    Kong’s company legislation that is equivalent to s285 to compel the
                    production of the auditors’ “internal review” papers in
                    addition to its audit working papers. The court stated at [53] that the fact
                    that the documents were internal documents did not necessarily mean that they
                    should be excluded from production but was merely a factor to be taken into
                    account in the balancing exercise. In that case, the auditors did not suggest
                    that the internal review documents did not contain pertinent information. The
                    judge took the view that the risk of oppression to the auditors was outweighed
                    by the reasonable requirements of the liquidator to have access to them in order
                    to carry out his duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Thus, the fact that PwC’s working papers
                    are their property cannot in itself form a basis for resisting the
                    Liquidator’s application. The papers would have to be disclosed as long as
                    they contain information of relevance to the Liquidator’s
                    investigation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Risk of civil liability and criminal sanctions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     PwC submits that granting the application
                    against it will expose it to a real risk of civil liability as well as criminal
                    sanctions under PRC law. PwC relies on the opinions of its PRC law experts, Mr
                    Zhang Zhonggang (“Mr Zhang”) and Mr Lin Lei (“Mr
                    Lin”) and, in certain respects only, on the opinion of the
                    Liquidator’s PRC law expert, Mr Gao Jun (“Mr Gao”). The PRC
                    legislation referred to by the experts are entitled “Provisions on
                    Strengthening Confidentiality and Archives Administration of Overseas Issuance
                    and Listing of Securities” (“the Provisions”) and
                    “Law of the People’s Republic of China on Protecting the State
                    Secrets” (“State Secrets Law”). It should be noted that the
                    Provisions were issued by the China Securities Regulation Commission, the State
                    Secrecy Bureau and the State Archives Administration in October 2009. The State
                    Secrets Law was promulgated on 5 September 1988 and revised on 29 April
                    2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Confidentiality</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     PwC’s first submission here is that all
                    the PRC law experts agree that PwC owes duties of confidentiality to the PRC
                    Subsidiaries (who owned any document or information PwC might have obtained from
                    them). The PRC Subsidiaries are now under the control of new owners. A breach of
                    confidentiality obligations by PwC would render it legally liable to compensate
                    the PRC Subsidiaries for losses incurred as a result.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     I do not accept that submission. I agree with
                    the Liquidator that PwC could not be in breach of any contractual
                    confidentiality obligations if it merely provides to the Liquidator historical
                    documents relating to the Company which the PRC Subsidiaries had previously
                    consented to provide and which the Company had access to when it was their
                    ultimate holding company. Any documents and information belonging to the PRC
                    Subsidiaries which are now in PwC’s possession must have been given to
                    them by the Company with the consent of the PRC Subsidiaries. The Liquidator is
                    now the Company’s administrator and as such the breach of confidentiality
                    argument cannot apply to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     PwC’s second submission is based on
                    Article 219 of the PRC Criminal Law (“Art 219”). Mr Yeo says that
                    this article prohibits the disclosure of “business secrets [which] causes
                    heavy losses to the obligee” and if Art 219 is infringed, PwC will be
                    subject to penal sanctions. However, according to Mr Gao, Art 219 is
                    predicated on a severe violation of contractual obligations or use of other
                    illegitimate means which would in turn cause losses to the PRC Subsidiaries.
                    There is no evidence that disclosure of any documents in PwC’s possession
                    would cause heavy losses or losses of any kind to the PRC Subsidiaries. The
                    information and documents are historical in nature and it is difficult to
                    envisage how in 2014 they could still be considered business secrets, the
                    disclosure of which would cause any party heavy financial losses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     I agree with the Liquidator’s
                    submissions. Mr Gao also pointed out that the PRC courts would be unlikely to
                    make a finding of criminal or civil liability for the disclosure of the
                    requested information and documents when PwC would be acting pursuant to a court
                    order which is binding on it. Whilst Mr Zhang disagree with this point, he did
                    not cite any examples of cases where the PRC courts had imposed liability,
                    whether civil or criminal, on a foreign entity which had acted in accordance
                    with an order from a foreign court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Criminal sanctions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In relation to the submission that that
                    disclosure of its audit papers would contravene the penal laws of the PRC, PwC
                    relies on a number of points. The first is Art 6 of the Provisions which,
                    according to the English translation provided, reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the process of overseas issuance and listing of securities, working
                        papers or other archives formed within the territory of China by the
                        securities companies and securities services institutions that provide
                        relevant securities services shall be stored in the territory of
                        China.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where the working papers mentioned in the preceding paragraph involve
                        state secrets, state security or vital interests, such papers shall not be
                        stored, processed or transferred in non-confidential computer information
                        system; the said papers are forbidden from carrying, transporting overseas
                        or transferring to overseas institutions or individuals via any means such
                        as information technology without approval of competent authorities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In the view of Mr Zhang and Mr Lin, Art 6 of
                    the Provisions covered all audit work done by PwC not just for the
                    Company’s listing in Singapore but also for the purposes of keeping the
                    listing on the SGX. Since PwC was engaged to audit the consolidated financial
                    statements of the Company which contained financial information of the PRC
                    Subsidiaries, PwC would be subject to the confidentiality obligations imposed by
                    Art 6. They opined that Art 6 also extends to working papers created in
                    Singapore containing information on state secrets, state security or the
                    state’s vital interests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Mr Gao’s view was different. He opined
                    that the Provisions did not apply to the Company because Art 10 refers to
                    overseas listed companies as “domestic companies limited by shares that
                    issue foreign shares listed overseas”. Since the Company was incorporated
                    in Bermuda, it was not a domestic company with an overseas listing and therefore
                    did not fall within the Provisions. Further, Mr Gao noted that the Provisions
                    are only applicable to documents “formed within the territory of
                    China”. Therefore, the expansive definition of audit working papers given
                    by Mr Zhang and Mr Lin did not have a legal basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The views of Mr Gao appear to me to be more in
                    line with the text of Art 6 of the Provisions as provided to me, than those of
                    PwC’s experts. I accept that because the Company was incorporated in
                    Bermuda it could not be covered by Art 6. Secondly, there is nothing in Art 6
                    that states that the Provisions would have extraterritorial effect in respect of
                    documents that had already been removed from the PRC and are stored outside it.
                    Article 6 prohibits the carriage of such documents that contain state secrets
                    outside the PRC. If PwC has done that, it may have already committed an offence
                    under PRC law but I consider it reasonable to assume that PwC would not
                    take any documents containing state secrets out of the PRC without the requisite
                    approval from the competent authorities and that therefore any order that I make
                    would not cause PwC to contravene the Provisions. In any case, any order made by
                    this court could only apply to documents which are already in PwC’s
                    possession in Singapore. I would not order PwC to transport documents to
                    Singapore if doing so would cause them to contravene PRC law. I note that Mr
                    Gao’s opinion is that the Provisions do not prohibit the carriage out of
                    China of documents that do not contain state secrets. Nor do they prohibit the
                    disclosure of such documents to the Liquidator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Secondly, I note that Art 6 refers to
                    documents that are produced during the process of overseas issuance and listing
                    of securities. As Mr Gao observed, there is nothing in Art 6 that refers to
                    documents that are produced to comply with post-listing
                requirements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The next objection taken by PwC is that
                    disclosure of the documents and information would offend the State Secrets Law.
                    Mr Zhang and Mr Lin stated that Art 2 of this law defines “state
                    secrets” as those which are “related to national security and
                    interests”. In Art 9 of the same law, “national security and
                    interests” is further defined to be in relation to “the politics,
                    economy, national defence, foreign affairs and etc”. They opined that as
                    the documents demanded by the Liquidator may include loans or documents issued
                    or signed by local governments in the PRC, as well as documents referring or
                    relating to certain governmental decisions and correspondence, these documents
                    “could therefore very possibly involve some state secrets, state security
                    or vital interests”. They did put in a caveat that whether the documents
                    truly contained such matters would ultimately be subject to the examination and
                    approval of the relevant competent authorities. Documents containing such
                    material cannot be shown to overseas institutions or individuals, including the
                    Liquidator, without the approval of the relevant competent authorities. In their
                    opinion, if the Liquidator wished to obtain such documents, he should seek
                    assistance from the Chinese Embassy in Singapore or communicate with the
                    relevant authorities to obtain their approval before requesting PwC to provide
                    the documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Mr Gao did not deny the applicability of Art 2
                    of the State Secrets Law if the documents contained state secrets – if
                    there were, state consent was needed before they could be disclosed. However, he
                    noted that Mr Zhang and Mr Lin had not shown that the documents contained state
                    secrets or that state approval was needed for their disclosure. Even if there
                    were allegedly state secrets in the documents, Art 20 of the State Secrets Law
                    provided a mechanism for ascertaining what should be treated as state secrets
                    and if approval was not granted for their disclosure, the parts which did not
                    contain state secrets could still be disclosed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     It is clear from the summary of their opinion
                    which I have given above, that the views of Mr Zhang and Mr Lin were based on
                    many assumptions. They provided no real evidence as to what state secrets there
                    were in the documents or how revealing them would be against PRC law. PwC could
                    have provided the documents to its experts so that they would be in a position
                    to make more informed opinions. The fact that the experts did not refer to more
                    specific details in the documents is an indication that either they did not see
                    the documents or that the documents that were shown to them did not contain
                    state secrets. PwC has not discharged the burden on it to show that the
                    documents asked for contain state secrets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Mr Gao also pointed out that the fact that PwC
                    was able to conduct its audit process must mean that the authorities had at that
                    point consented to the disclosure of the documents if they contained state
                    secrets. Alternatively, the examination of the documents by PwC meant that they
                    did not contain state secrets and no consent was needed for their disclosure. On
                    either case, there is no reason why the documents disclosed to the auditor of
                    the Company cannot be further disclosed to the liquidator of the
                Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Having considered all the evidence, I am not
                    satisfied that an order for disclosure to the Liquidator of the documents and
                    information requested would subject PwC to criminal sanctions in the
                PRC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Is the Liquidator’s request too wide?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     An objection that PwC pressed very strongly is
                    that the request applies to a wide range of documents and that it should not be
                    obliged to disclose its working papers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     As regards the working papers, Ms Hing
                    submitted that it was not unusual for a court to order that working papers be
                    disclosed. She cited four authorities and relied on two in particular: <em>Re New China Hong Kong Group Ltd</em> [2003] 3 HKC 252
                        (“<em>Re New China</em>”) and <em>Kong Wah Holdings</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In <em>Re New China</em>,
                    the liquidator had asked for the working papers to be disclosed by the auditors
                    as there had been payments made to third parties, massive write-downs, cost
                    overruns in construction and questionable transactions. Objections made were
                    based on the request being oppressive, too broad and vague, and it constituting
                    a fishing expedition. Kwan J held that whether documents should be identified
                    with specificity depended on the nature and subject of the investigation. In
                    that case, the liquidators could not practically go into further detail other
                    than what they had been supplied with and it was not the court’s job to
                    undertake fine judgments as to the precise width of the order to be made:
                        <em>Re New China</em> at [57]–[59]. The
                    liquidator was to be trusted in his assessment of what was needed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     
          <em>Kong Wah
                        Holdings</em> concerned the liquidation of two companies which had
                    collectively lost more than US$2bn in total assets. The liquidators sought to
                    obtain the books and records of the companies from the auditor because they had
                    to reconstruct the assets and liabilities of the companies. The auditor
                    eventually offered to provide access to all the documents except those for the
                    purposes of the auditor’s internal review and approval process and audit
                    planning and programming. This was rejected by the liquidator and the issue was
                    whether the internal review documents should be provided to the
                    liquidators.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The court ordered the disclosure of all the
                    documents including the internal review documents. This was because the
                    liquidations were massive; there were highly unusual and doubtful transactions
                    which had taken place not long before the winding up petition was made, there
                    were important gaps as to the liquidator’s knowledge of the
                    companies’ affairs, there were specific substantial transactions
                    identified by the liquidators as requiring investigation but for which no
                    meaningful assistance had been obtained. In the circumstances, any prejudice
                    caused to the auditor was outweighed by the public interest which required them
                    to give assistance to the liquidators: <em>Kong Wah
                        Holdings</em> at [51]. The risk that the auditor might be sued by the
                    liquidator was only one of the factors to be considered and this was outweighed
                    by other countervailing public interest considerations: <em>Kong
                        Wah Holdings</em> at [55].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Ms Hing submits that two other cases support
                    her application: <em>Joint Liquidators of Sasea Finance Ltd v
                        KPMG</em> [1998] BBC 216 (“<em>Sasea v
                        KPMG</em>”) and <em>British &amp;
                        Commonwealth</em>. In those cases, the public interest in assisting
                    liquidators outweighed any prejudice that would be caused to the
                auditor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Mr Yeo submits that the cases do not assist
                    the Liquidator because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_a"></a>(a)     In <em>Re New
                            China</em>, the facts were unusual as the partner of the audit
                        firm was also the financial advisor of the company. The facts are not the
                        same here;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <em>Kong Wah Holdings</em> at [57] recognised that
                        in normal situations specific transactions had to be identified but there
                        was no identification of any specific transaction here;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_c"></a>(c)     In <em>Sasea v
                            KPMG</em>, there was a fraud and criminal conviction while here
                        any fraud was only in relation to the CCB share pledges and had not been
                        proven.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Furthermore, while consolidated
                        accounts were done up and reviewed by PwC, it did not mean that PwC had the
                        source documents. All the correspondence with the Company had been provided
                        to the Liquidator. The rest of the documents were mainly internal
                        workings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The exact facts in the cases cited may be
                    different from those before me but these authorities show that the exercise is,
                    in essence, a balance between the public interest in providing assistance to a
                    liquidator in the execution of his duties and the prejudice that may be caused
                    to the proposed examinee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     An examination of the suspicious transactions
                    identified by the Liquidator shows that the Liquidator needs more information in
                    order to correctly assess these transactions and determine whether anything
                    wrong has been done and, if so, who should be held responsible for the same.
                    Such information is not limited to the transactions themselves. In a number of
                    cases, the transactions took place after PwC ceased to act as auditor but this
                    does not mean that the documents in its possession will not be helpful to the
                    Liquidator. There are huge gaps in the Liquidator’s knowledge, and the
                    Group’s operations having been conducted in a foreign country, big
                    obstacles in the way of the Liquidator obtaining information from the BVI
                    Subsidiaries and the PRC Subsidiaries themselves. The documents with PwC will
                    assist the Liquidator in building up the picture of the operations of the
                    Company and the Group and indicate not only the background but also how members
                    of the Group conducted themselves. Some examples may assist.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     First, in relation to the CCB loans, the share
                    pledges and the Auction, the information that the Liquidator had was that the
                    BVI Subsidiaries had disposed of the shares in the PRC Subsidiaries for
                    RMB 580m pursuant to share pledges that they had executed in favour of CCB.
                    However, the loans and the share pledges were not disclosed in the audited
                    accounts and the share pledges were not filed and registered promptly with the
                    State Administration of Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”). There was
                    no good reason for this. Next, CCB had exercised its rights under the share
                    pledges just three days after the statutory demand was issued by BNY and the
                    shares were sold in the Auction within the next ten days. The purchasers were
                    Weihai Guosheng Real Property Development Co Ltd (“WGPD”) and Rui
                    Feng Group Ltd (“RFG”). CCB had not given the Liquidator any
                    information on the Auction and said that it had no knowledge of it and had not
                    received any of the proceeds from the Auction. This was inconsistent with
                    documents obtained from SAIC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Additionally, the Liquidator’s
                    suspicions were aroused because (a) four months prior to the appointment of the
                    provisional liquidator, 2% of the shares in each PRC Subsidiary were sold to a
                    company called Weihai Zhuozhan Import &amp; Export Co Ltd (“WZIE”)
                    for a sum of RMB 10.641m; and (b) WZIE, WPGD and RFG might be related to Mr
                    Ming and the Group because the people managing these companies were also in
                    charge of the PRC Subsidiaries whilst they belonged to the Group.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Whilst the Auction took place after PwC ceased
                    to be the Company’s auditor, the loans by CCB and the share pledges were
                    apparently signed between September 2009 and March 2010. There may therefore be
                    useful information relating to CCB and the loans in the possession of PwC, in
                    particular, in relation to the need for funds on the part of the BVI and PRC
                    Subsidiaries. PwC has said that the pledges and the loans were not disclosed to
                    it. However, the documents it has may be able to clarify the operations of the
                    PRC Subsidiaries and the cash needs of the Group.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The second item, the Power Charm cash
                    payments, concerned S$17m paid to Power Charm between December 2009 and
                    September 2010. The bulk of the money was paid between 29 June 2010 and 21
                    September 2010 which fell within the six-month period prior to the appointment
                    of the provisional liquidator. The Liquidator considers that the timing of the
                    payments warrants further information. He needs to know the reason for the
                    payments, which person or entities are associated with Power Charm and why it
                    became inactive in December 2010, shortly after receiving such substantial
                    payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The Liquidator’s position is that PwC
                    can assist the Liquidator because it was the Company’s auditor during the
                    relevant period and would have test-examined the audit evidence supporting the
                    Power Charm payments and the information would enable it to reconstruct the
                    circumstances surrounding the payments. PwC’s response is that all the
                    information it had regarding the 8 December 2009 payment to Power Charm was
                    set out in Mr Tan’s affidavit and it could not furnish any more
                    information. However, other documents in its possession may be helpful in
                    assisting the Liquidator in re-constructing the position of the Group at the
                    time these payments were made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     As regards the Bio-diesel Plant, RMB 70m
                    was paid to buy expertise for this Plant on 28 December 2009 when the Company
                    was in financial difficulty and had already defaulted on the Bonds. The
                    Liquidator submitted that PwC can assist because it would have examined audit
                    evidence supporting the payment and the minutes of the 27 February 2010 Audit
                    Committee meeting stated PwC had asked management to expedite the amended
                    contract’s finalisation. The acquisition was also discussed in the 5
                    November 2009 Audit Committee meeting and since PwC had participated in the
                    Audit Committee discussions on all the relevant dates and identified the lack of
                    documentation regarding the payment, it is likely to have information useful to
                    the Liquidator. I accept the submission. The fact that the acquisition was a
                    business decision for which PwC was not responsible (as it argued) does not mean
                    that it may not have information and documents that would be of
                    assistance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The next suspicious circumstance concerned the
                    return in 2009 and 2010 of significant numbers of goods that had been sold. The
                    Liquidator pointed out that these substantial product returns had been accepted
                    for the first time by the Group in 2009 and they had substantially reduced the
                    Group’s revenue. The product returns represented about 15% of the
                    Group’s revenue in 2009 and 66% of the total revenue generated for the
                    first half of 2009. There was no plausible explanation for the returns or for
                    the Company’s acceptance of the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     PwC had knowledge of the returns. It had noted
                    in its 2009 Report that: (i) sales returns of such magnitude were the first in
                    the Group’s history; (ii) it was impossible to ensure that the
                    re-processed goods were sold at reasonable prices to maximise return; and (iii)
                    it was not possible to ascertain whether the goods were re-sold properly.
                    Further, PwC actively participated in the Audit Committee discussions on the
                    sales returns in FY 2010. I agree that there may be information in PwC’s
                    possession on the returns which would assist the Liquidator in understanding
                    what occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The Liquidator also needs documents in order
                    to assist in understanding two payments made in late 2008. First, RMB 268m
                    was paid to the Daqing New Hi-Tech City Construction Investment Development Co
                    Ltd (“NHC”) apparently in relation to loans made by NHC to the
                    Group for the construction of what was called the Soybean Zone. Second, a sum of
                    RMB 261m was paid to contractors. These payments were made without written
                    documentation and the Liquidator has not been able to determine whether any
                    services were provided by the contractors. The Liquidator cannot even ascertain
                    the identity of these contractors. The Group had borrowed RMB 291m from NHC
                    but because of the difference between the loan amount and the repayment amount,
                    the Liquidator cannot be certain that the RMB 268m paid to NHC was a
                    repayment of the loan. The Liquidator is concerned that there may be a further
                    undisclosed liability between the Group and NHC. Even the NHC loan is not
                    supported by a loan agreement and the Liquidator has been unable to verify if it
                    had been disbursed in the first place. PwC was the auditor at the relevant time
                    and may be able to assist in answering these questions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     I am satisfied that PwC would have information
                    and documents which would assist the Liquidator in discharging his statutory
                    duty even if some of the transactions took place after its appointment ended,
                    and even though it was not involved in the business decisions of the Group. It
                    had a long relationship with the Group and was involved in the Company’s
                    affairs in its role as the Company’s auditor. It cannot be that the only
                    information in PwC’s possession that would assist the Liquidator in his
                    investigation are the documents contained in the three arch-lever files that PwC
                    has given to the Liquidator. Other documents which PwC has, including but not
                    limited to, those referred to in [23] above, would be helpful to the Liquidator
                    in discharging his statutory functions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     In [17] above, I set out the matters which
                    could afford PwC with grounds to resist this application. PwC has not
                    established any of those grounds. In my judgment, in balancing the oppression to
                    PwC in compelling it to produce its working papers and the assistance the
                    Liquidator may be able to derive from the same, in this case the second
                    consideration outweighs the first.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that
                    the application must be allowed and that PwC and its relevant representatives,
                    Mr Tham Tuck Seng and Tan Boon Chok, shall produce all books, correspondence and
                    documents in their custody, power or control as may be required by the
                    Liquidator including PwC working papers and all documents and records in its
                    possession which were supplied to it by the Company and any member of the
                    Group.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     PwC has submitted that it would be unduly
                    oppressive for me to order Mr Tham Tuck Seng and Mr Tan Boon Chok to attend
                    before the judge/registrar and be orally examined by the Liquidator as to the
                    trade dealings, affairs and property of the Company. I think that to make this
                    order would be premature. After all the books and records have been supplied,
                    the Liquidator may have questions for Mr Tham Tuck Seng and Mr Tan Boon Chok and
                    these may be put and answered by letter. In the event that the Liquidator
                    considers that his questions have not been adequately answered, he may make a
                    further application to court for oral examination of these persons in relation
                    to the matters which have not been answered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The Liquidator’s costs of this
                    application shall be paid out of the assets of the Company. There shall be
                    liberty to apply.</p>
