<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case centres on the
                    duties owed by the execution creditor and the court bailiff
                    to the execution debtor under a writ of seizure and sale. As
                    such, it also bears upon the relationship between the
                    execution creditor who obtains the writ of seizure and sale
                    and the bailiff appointed to execute it. These are the two
                    interlocking underlying principles of law upon which the
                    plaintiff’s action now rests. The dispute began in
                    February 2004, when the plaintiff, who occupied three bays
                    in the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s
                    warehouse, ran into arrears in rent and later failed to
                    enter an appearance following service of the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s writ of
                    summons. Default judgment was entered and the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant obtained a writ
                    of seizure and sale (“the WSS”) to satisfy the
                    judgment debt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The parties’ versions
                    of events differ at this point. The defendants maintain that
                    only machine parts in the first two warehouse bays,
                    designated A2 and A3, were seized. The plaintiff asserts
                    that machinery in a third bay, A4, though not seized,
                    were subsequently auctioned off. One would think that this
                    is a factual detail easily verifiable by cross-checking the
                    Warehouse Service Agreement, Notice of Seizure and Inventory
                    (Form 94) and the sale records, but neither the
                        plaintiff<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> nor the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, who as bailiff
                    conducted the actual seizure, drew up a list of the items
                    stored in the warehouse. Indeed, there is a fundamental
                    dispute as to what exactly had been stored in the three bays
                    to begin with. Even the tonnage of the machinery was not
                    documented upon entry into the Warehouse Service Agreement,
                    such that a comparison between the weight of the machine
                    parts stored and what was eventually sold and delivered
                    cannot be conducted. The only common ground is that
                        <em>some</em> machine parts
                    belonging to the plaintiff had been seized, auctioned and
                    subsequently on-sold to a Malaysian sawmill. The
                    plaintiff’s Managing Director, Mr Stanley Adam
                    Zagrodnik (“Mr Zagrodnik”), has since informed
                    the court that the Malaysian sawmill is in possession of
                    some machine parts which were purportedly stored in A4 at
                    the time of the execution of the WSS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       This begs the question as to
                    why a claim in conversion for the machine parts in A4 is not
                    also before the court. Counsel for the plaintiff,
                    Mr R Govintharasah (“Mr Govin”) was
                    unable to provide me with a reason, except to say, quite
                    rightly, that he is bound by his pleadings. In any event,
                    the issue of whether a claim in conversion would have
                    succeeded on points of both law and fact is now academic
                    since the plaintiff is presently time-barred from commencing
                    such an action. As a result, the plaintiff’s only
                    remedy for recovery of its machine parts or their equivalent
                    value centres on the propriety of the defendants’
                    conduct in the enforcement of the WSS.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff is a general
                    wholesaler and metal trader involved in the import and
                    export of wood panel and woodworking equipment. It is
                    “basically operated and managed
                        personally”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> by Mr
                    Zagrodnik. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant
                    operated an open-air warehouse at 27 Jalan Buroh. On or
                    about 17 February 2003, the plaintiff entered into a
                    Warehouse Service Agreement with the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant to store
                    various machine parts in bays A2 and A3 at the premises for
                    a monthly fee of S$3,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.
                    Shortly thereafter, a second agreement was entered into on
                    or about 31 March 2003 for the use of bay A4 for the
                    same purpose, bringing the total monthly rent to
                        S$4,900<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. The
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was the court
                    bailiff who executed the WSS. The background under which the
                    court bailiff was added as the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is explained at
                        <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>
                below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       It would be apposite at this
                    point to describe these machine parts. There were two sets
                    of machine parts, one of which formed a plant for the
                    manufacture of wooden hard and soft-boards and the other for
                    the manufacture of wooden particle boards<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. Although
                    Mr Zagrodnik furnished a full list of machine parts for each
                    plant in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief
                    (“AEIC”), it appears that these machine parts
                    were not enumerated in either the Warehouse Service
                    Agreement or in the letter granting the plaintiff additional
                    space at A4.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The purported agreement and subsequent
                seizure</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 9 February 2004, the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant brought an MC
                        Suit<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>
                    against the plaintiff for the sum of S$27, 940, this being
                    the rental owed by the plaintiff for occupation of the three
                    bays. The plaintiff failed to enter appearance in the MC
                    Suit and on 5 March 2004, default judgment<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> was entered for
                    the sum claimed, at an interest of 6% per annum and costs of
                    S$1,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       I pause here to consider Mr
                    Zagrodnik’s assertion that, after default judgment had
                    been entered, he met Mr Kelvin Lim, the Managing Director of
                    the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant
                    (“Kelvin”) and informed him that the particle
                    board machinery was due to be sold for over US$350,000 to a
                    Pakistani buyer. Mr Zagrodnik claims that they reached
                    an oral agreement not to enforce the default judgment so
                    that the plaintiff would have time to complete the sale and
                    satisfy any outstanding arrears<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. It should
                    be emphasised that the breach of this purported agreement
                    has not been included in the plaintiff’s pleadings. As
                    such, the substantive resolution of this case does not turn
                    on whether the plaintiff can establish such an agreement.
                    Moreover, it is not the plaintiff’s evidence that the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had been
                    informed of this purported agreement, so that no liability
                    can be imputed to the latter even if
                    Mr Zagrodnik’s assertions are proved. However,
                    the veracity of this agreement is nevertheless relevant as
                    it may offer a possible explanation for the
                    plaintiff’s passivity between March and July 2004,
                    despite being served with the WSS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Kelvin only accepts that Mr
                    Zagrodnik had approached him and “asked for
                    indulgence”, but denies being informed of the
                    machinery’s value or having entered into an agreement
                    not to enforce the judgment debt. His version of the events
                    is that he told Mr Zagrodnik to speak to the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s
                    lawyers instead<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>. I see no
                    reason to doubt Kelvin’s account. In the context of
                    Mr Zagrodnik’s persistent failure to make payment
                    on the outstanding storage rent, it is highly improbable
                    that Kelvin would accede to a postponement without even
                    seeing proof of any agreement with the Pakistani buyer. It
                    should also be borne in mind that Kelvin had earlier agreed
                    to allow the plaintiff to pay back the arrears in
                    instalments, <em>provided</em> Mr
                    Zagrodnik signs a personal Letter of Undertaking prepared by
                    the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s
                    solicitors to pay the arrears<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. However,
                    Mr Zagrodnik failed to do so. This renders it all the more
                    unlikely that Kelvin would, having already obtained default
                    judgment in the
                    1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s
                    favour, then reverse his position and agree to a wholly
                    informal and indefinite postponement for the benefit of the
                    plaintiff. Similarly, it is incongruous that Mr Zagrodnik
                    made no effort to formalize this purported agreement despite
                    the fact that the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant
                    had every reason to exercise its rights under the WSS. In
                    addition, Mr Zagrodnik’s account fails to provide
                    basic details such as the duration of the agreed
                    postponement and the eventual terms of payment. Indeed, it
                    will be seen at <a href="#p1_62">[62]</a>
                    below that Mr Zagrodnik, under cross-examination, had
                    prevaricated as to when exactly the agreement took place.
                    These considerations all militate against the probity of
                    Mr Zagrodnik’s assertions, and I am compelled to
                    conclude that the plaintiff has failed to satisfy its burden
                    of proof in relation to the purported oral
                agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant filed the
                    Praecipe for Writ of Seizure and Sale<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> on 19 March 2004 for
                    a total sum of S$29,771.57. It was at this point that
                    certain procedural anomalies arose. In the Praecipe for Writ
                    of Seizure and Sale, the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    defendant’s solicitors listed the plaintiff’s
                    “registered office” at 47 Beach Road as well
                    as their “place of business” at 27 Jalan
                    Buroh, without specifying at which location the WSS was to
                    be executed. This is also the case with the WSS issued to
                    the bailiff<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>. However, in another
                    document filed on the same day simply titled
                    “Praecipe”, the
                    1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s
                    solicitors mention only the plaintiff’s registered
                    office at 47 Beach Road<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>. In this document,
                    they also requested the Registrar not to inform the
                    plaintiff of the execution date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 23 March 2004, the
                    bailiff’s office sent a General Notice to the
                    plaintiff’s office at 47 Beach Road, stating that the
                    WSS would be executed “at this
                        address”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. Six days later,
                    on 29 March 2004, the bailiff’s office informed
                    the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant in writing that
                    it was to accompany the bailiff “to the place of
                    execution at <b><u>47 BEACH
                        ROAD</u></b>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>. The
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant then wrote to
                    the bailiff’s office requesting the place of execution
                    to be changed to 27 Jalan Buroh instead of 47
                    Beach Road<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>. A second letter
                    was then sent to the
                        1<sup>st</sup><sup> </sup>defendant
                    specifying that it was to accompany the bailiff to
                        27 Jalan Buroh<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>. A second General
                    Notice was, however, not sent to the plaintiff prior to the
                    execution of the WSS. It would, therefore, appear that the
                    plaintiff was not specifically told that its property at 27
                    Jalan Buroh would be seized. Having said that, Mr Zagrodnik,
                    under cross-examination, admitted that he was aware of the
                    WSS which was served at the 47 Beach Road office address. It
                    should also be noted that there is no provision in the
                    Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Chapter 322, Section 80)
                    Rules of Court (“Rules of Court”) requiring
                    the bailiff’s office to issue a General Notice to the
                    execution debtor prior to the date of seizure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The WSS was executed on
                    11 May 2004. The 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    defendant was accompanied by a representative of the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant, Mr Eugene Lim
                    Chang Chye (who has since left the employment of the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant)
                    (“Eugene”). Eugene handed the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant a letter of
                        indemnity<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> and pointed out
                    the machine parts which were to be seized<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>.
                    It is the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant’s
                    evidence that he only seized the machine parts in A2 and A3.
                    Two other employees of the
                    1<sup>st</sup> defendant were also
                    present at the warehouse, a security guard simply referred
                    to as “John” and Mr Yeo Hock Heng (“Mr
                    Yeo”), who corroborates the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant’s
                        account<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>.
                    Under cross-examination, the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    defendant further particularized his description, testifying
                    that the machine parts seized occupied only a
                    “quarter”, the “extreme right
                    portion”, of the two bays. Whilst he inspected the
                    machine parts, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant
                    appraised them to be worth S$15,000. When questioned, he
                    explained that he had arrived at this figure, first, by
                    keeping in mind that items worth more than S$2,000 would
                    have to be sold by public auction and, second, by a lay
                    evaluation of the items. I would also add that this was the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant’s first
                    experience with seizure of machinery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     After being told by two
                    workers at the warehouse that the machinery in A2 and A3
                    were “mesin potong kayu” or “machines
                    for cutting timber”, the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant filled up the
                    Inventory of items seized as “all machineries and
                    parts of timber at lot A2 to A3 (inside)”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>. He testified at the
                    trial that by “machineries and parts of
                    timber” he meant “machines to cut
                    timber”, and that he pasted seals on parts of all the
                    machinery seized at A2 and A3. At the end of this process,
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant then went to
                    look for Eugene at a container office situated on the
                    premises. There, the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    defendant left the Notice of Seizure and Inventory (Form
                        94)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>, as well as a General
                    Notice addressed to the plaintiff at 27 Jalan
                        Buroh<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>, with Eugene and
                    told him that they were for the plaintiff<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The sale</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The first Notice of Sale
                    was issued on 24 May 2004<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>, setting the auction date
                    on 9 June 2004. The 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    defendant went to the warehouse and handed a copy of this
                    Notice to the security guard. He also posted a copy of the
                    Notice on the notice board at the Registry of the
                    Subordinate Courts. On 26 May 2004, Kiong Chai Woon and
                    Company Pte Ltd was appointed as the auctioneer. The
                    advertisement of the auction sale was to be published on
                    7 June 2004 but the publishers failed to do so and the
                    advertisement ran two days late, on 9 June 2004. As a
                    result, a new Notice of Sale was issued on 7 June
                        2004<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> specifying that the
                    auction would be held on 11 June 2004 at 3 pm.
                    This second Notice was also handed to the warehouse security
                    guard and posted on the Registry notice board at the
                    Subordinate Courts<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The auction was held at
                    the warehouse on 11 June 2004 and the seized machine
                    parts were sold for S$51,500 to the highest bidder, Kim Hock
                    Corporation Pte Ltd (“Kim Hock”). Kim Hock
                    arranged for the machine parts to be stored at the warehouse
                    until on or about 22 July 2004. Its Managing Director,
                    Mr Lim Kim Hock (“Mr Lim”), who has 40 years
                    of experience in the scrap metal and machinery business,
                    examined the machine parts on the day of the auction. His
                    view was that they were timber-related machinery but were
                    too old and rusty to be used. He therefore assessed the
                    scrap metal value of the machine parts as about S$50,000,
                    based on their weight<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The sold machine parts
                    were then stored temporarily at the warehouse until Kim Hock
                    arranged for their transfer to its premises on or about
                    22 July 2004<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>. It
                    should be noted that from June 2004 onwards, bay A2 had been
                    leased to another company, Vigour Technologies Ltd
                    (“Vigour”), for storage of their
                        goods<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>.
                    After the machine parts were moved out of the bays, Vigour
                    took over A2. There was some dispute as to the exact date on
                    which Vigour entered into occupation of A2. In a letter
                    dated 10 September 2004<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>, Mr Albert Yeo of
                    Vigour wrote to Mr Zagrodnik informing him that, according
                    to their records, they took possession of A2 on
                    15 April 2004 based on the commencement date of the
                    payment of the rental. Mr Yeo, however, agreed under
                    cross-examination that he does not have any personal
                    knowledge as to when Vigour actually commenced occupation of
                    bay A2. In cross-examination Kelvin clarified that
                    Vigour’s goods were stored in a temporary area until
                    Kim Hock moved the seized machinery out of bay
                A2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Shortly after, Kim Hock
                    on-sold the machine parts to a business associate, Mr Lau
                    Swee Nguong (“Mr Lau”). The machine parts are,
                    to this day, still at Mr Lau’s premises at Hua
                    Seng Sawmill Sdn Bhd (“Hua Seng”) in Sibu,
                        Sarawak<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>. They
                    remain unassembled.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Procedural history</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Around 5 July 2004,
                    Mr Zagrodnik visited the warehouse with a Pakistani business
                    associate, Mr Mushtaq (the Managing Director of Best
                    Chipboard Industries (“Best Chipboard”)), to
                    inspect the machine parts<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>.
                    His evidence is that he immediately noticed that
                    “several pieces of machinery” were missing.
                    The next day, he confronted Eugene about the missing machine
                    parts. Eugene purportedly denied any knowledge of their
                        whereabouts<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>.
                    Mr Zagrodnik claims that he was only appraised of the
                    seizure when the duty security guard handed him some
                    documents consisting of the Notice of Seizure and Inventory
                    and Notice of Sale<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>. It
                    would appear that Mr Zagrodnik did not previously receive
                    the second General Notice issued by the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The plaintiff’s
                    solicitors wrote to the
                    1<sup>st</sup> defendant on 9 July
                    2004 claiming that the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    defendant’s re-entry into the leased premises at A2 to
                    A3 was wrongful and constituted a trespass<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>. On or
                    around 21 July 2004, Mr Zagrodnik also made a
                    police report against the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    defendant, claiming that there were eight missing items from
                    the premises worth about S$97,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The plaintiff then applied
                    to set aside the Default Judgment and the WSS. This was
                    dismissed by the Deputy Registrar, whose decision was
                    affirmed on appeal by both the District Court and, on
                    3 February 2005, the High Court. More than four years
                    after the High Court’s decision and five years after
                    the execution of the WSS, the plaintiff commenced the
                    present suit on 17 April 2009 against the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant and the
                    “Bailiff, Subordinate Courts of Singapore”.
                    The plaintiff later amended its claim to replace the latter
                    with the Attorney-General, but this action was successfully
                    struck out pursuant to s 6(3) of the Government
                    Proceedings Act (Cap 121). In September 2009, the High Court
                    upheld the decision to strike out the claim against the
                    Attorney-General. The plaintiff then obtained leave to name
                    the bailiff who executed the WSS, Mr Sapuan Sanadi, as the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Claims</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Stated briefly, the
                    plaintiff’s case is that the WSS was executed
                    negligently and in breach of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant’s
                    statutory duty. Embedded within this is the proposition that
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, as court
                    bailiff, acted as the agent of the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant, such that
                    the latter is vicariously liable for the former’s
                    negligence. The particulars of this claim can be further
                    deconstructed into the following alleged breaches presented
                    in chronological order:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     Inadequate
                        Notice of Seizure as the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                        defendant left the relevant documents at the
                            1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s
                        premises and in the hands of their
                    employees.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     Failure to sufficiently particularize
                        the seized machinery.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     Excessive seizure as the
                        value of the seized machinery far exceeded the judgment
                        debt.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_d"></a>(d)     Failure to publish an adequate
                        advertisement which described the true nature of the
                        seized machinery, so as to attract the attention of

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In essence, the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant’s defence
                    is that s 68(2) of the Subordinate Courts Act confers a
                    statutory immunity upon the bailiff unless it can be shown
                    that he had <em>knowingly</em> acted in
                    excess of authority. Further, it is his position that
                        <em>actual</em>, as opposed to
                    constructive, knowledge is needed to satisfy this test to
                    deprive him of his statutory immunity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s defence
                    is that the bailiff is a public functionary who does not act
                    as the agent of the execution creditor. As such, any breach
                    on the part of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant
                    does not represent a breach by the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant. Further, the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant contends that
                    it does not owe any independent duty of care to the
                    plaintiff in respect of the acts and omissions complained
                    of. Finally, even if such a duty is found, it is contended
                    that the loss suffered by the plaintiff must be based on the
                    scrap metal value of the machinery and cannot be computed at
                    S$1,174,999.48.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the bailiff acts as an agent of the
                execution creditor</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     It is fitting to begin by
                    determining whether the liability, if any, of the two
                    co-defendants should be taken in tandem or if their conduct
                    should be discretely assessed. Unfortunately, the precise
                    nature of the relationship between an execution creditor and
                    the bailiff is not entirely clear. The available authorities
                    do not provide a readily unequivocal answer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The issue was considered
                    by Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck (as he then was) in
                        <em>Heng </em><em>Chyu </em><em>Kee v Far East
                        Square</em> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 651 (“<em>Heng </em><em>Chyu
                        </em><em>Kee</em>”), a
                    case which concerned the liability in negligence of a
                    landlord who took out a writ of distress. Choo JC opined at
                        [5] that,
                    “when the movables are being distrained, the landlord
                    must ensure that the bailiff, who is deemed to be his agent
                    in this regard, affixes the court’s seal on each of
                    the movables to be distrained.” Taken on its own, it
                    is unclear whether this agency relationship arises only
                    specifically in relation to the act of affixing the
                    court’s seal or if Choo JC intended this to stand for
                    a more general agency relationship between the bailiff and
                    the landlord in the execution of a writ of distress. It
                    should be highlighted at the outset that the bailiff was not
                    added as a defendant in <em>Heng
                        </em><em>Chyu </em><em>Kee</em>. In the context of the entire
                    decision, however, it is apparent that the court proceeded
                    on the basis that the negligence of the landlord, who was
                    the sole defendant, could be constituted by the acts of the
                    bailiff. The landlord was found to be negligent for failing
                    to: a) ensure that the value of the goods seized by the
                    bailiff did not exceed the debt; b) identify the goods
                    seized by affixing the court seal on them; c) give adequate
                    notice of the sale; d) ensure that only the seized items
                    were sold; and e) ensure that the purchaser took away only
                    the items purchased. It appears from the decision in
                        <em>Heng </em><em>Chyu </em><em>Kee</em> that
                    Choo JC <em>assumed</em> that the
                    bailiff acts as the agent of the judgment creditor under the
                    distress procedure. No authorities were cited, nor was there
                    any exposition as to the basis for this conclusion. Further,
                    there is nothing in the decision to indicate that this
                    proposition was even disputed by the landlord. Upon
                    examining the pleadings in <em>Heng
                        </em><em>Chyu </em><em>Kee</em>, I have noted that the plaintiff
                    alleged that “the Bailiff, acting in pursuant
                        [<em>sic</em>] of the authority and
                    instruction of the Defendant as aforesaid” had seized
                    her goods. In response, the defendant did not deny this in
                    its defence but instead insisted that the distress had been
                    properly executed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     There is, however, clear
                    local authority which appears to be at odds with the
                    position adopted in <em>Heng
                        </em><em>Chyu </em><em>Kee</em>. In <em>Curtis v
                        Metro-Goldwin-Meyer (Oriental) Inc</em> [1930]
                    SSLR 5 (“<em>Curtis</em>”), the Straits Settlements Supreme
                    Court held after a survey of English authorities
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I gather from these authorities that when the sheriff
                        acts under a valid writ of execution as in our case, he
                        and his officers’ and agents’ acts are the
                        acts of the Court, and <em>he is in no
                            sense the servant or agent of the execution-creditor
                            who merely sets the Court in motion.</em> If
                        the execution-creditor does not mislead the sheriff, and
                        takes into such active part in the actual execution as
                        to identify himself with any wrongful acts of the
                        sheriff or his officers or agents committed in the
                        course of the execution of the writ, then he is not
                        liable or responsible for such wrongful acts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     An examination of the
                    English authorities on this subject, however, gives cause to
                    proceed with some caution. There are cases pointing in
                    either direction. In <em>Re Caidan</em>
                    [1942] 1 Ch 90 (“<em>Re
                        Caidan</em>”), Morton J adopted the
                    following view:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my view the bailiff distrains merely in the
                        capacity of an agent for the person levying the
                        distress. This is so stated in Halsbury's Laws of
                        England, Hailsham ed., vol. x., p. 493, and I see no
                        reason to doubt that the statement is correct. Further,
                        from a practical point of view, I cannot conceive that
                        the intention of the legislature by this sub-section was
                        to treat the bailiff as being the person who has
                        distrained in every case in which a bailiff was employed
                        for the purpose. If that were the intention of the
                        section, the result in the present case would, I
                        suppose, be - as Mr. Burt submitted - that the bailiff,
                        having got goods in his hands which were subject to a
                        charge by reason of the receiving order, would be
                        personally liable for having sold the goods, received
                        the proceeds, and paid them to the respondents. I cannot
                        think that that was the intention. In my view, the
                        "landlord or other person" referred to in the
                        sub-section is the principal on whose instructions the
                        distress is levied and not the agent through whom the
                        distress is actually carried out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     This is to be contrasted
                    with the more measured approach of Walton J in <em>Re A Debtor</em> (No 2 of 1977) [1979] 1
                    WLR 956 (“<em>Re A
                    Debtor</em>”), in which Lord Cranworth
                    LC’s dicta in <em>Hooper v
                        Lane</em> (1857) 6 HL Case 443 (“<em>Hooper</em>”) was cited:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For, in truth, the sheriff in such a situation is not
                        simply an agent for the judgment creditor; he has much
                        wider responsibilities, which now include duties toward
                        the Official Receiver or trustee in bankruptcy. Compare
                        what was said by Lord Cranworth L.C. in Hooper v. Lane
                        (1857) 6 H.L.Cas. 443. 549-550: "But the answer is, that
                        the sheriff, though for some purposes an agent of the
                        party who puts the writ into his hands, is not a mere
                        agent. He is a public functionary, having indeed duties
                        to perform towards those who set him in motion
                        analogous, in many respects, to those of an agent
                        towards his principal; but he has also duties towards
                        others, and particularly towards those against whom the
                        writs in his hands are directed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     These two cases are
                    counter-balanced by the decision of Evershed MR in <em>Barclays Bank v Roberts</em> [1954] 3 All
                    ER 107 (“<em>Barclays
                    Bank</em>”), applying the longstanding
                    authority of <em>Williams v Williams &amp;
                        Nathan</em> [1937] 2 All ER 559 (“<em>Williams</em>”), wherein Greer LJ
                    held at [2]
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... I think it is clear to demonstration, from the
                        case that has been cited of Woollen v Wright<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> and
                        other cases, and from a well known rule of law, that a
                        sheriff and a sheriff’s officer, executing a
                        judgment of the court, are acting, as one may say, on
                        behalf of the court. <em>Each is doing
                            his duty as an officer of the court, and is not a
                            servant or agent of the plaintiff who has recovered
                            judgment in the action</em>. Of course, there
                        may be circumstances which show that the plaintiff by
                        intervention had made the sheriff his agent to do
                        something which was not covered by the judgment, or by
                        the writ of execution... But, in my view, there is no
                        evidence justifying any finding as to the special
                        direction given to the sheriff or the sheriff’s
                        officer which might make the sheriff or the
                        sheriff’s officer the agent of the defendant
                        Williams, the landlord.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     It appears from <em>Williams</em> that the bailiff might be
                    regarded as the agent of the judgment creditor in limited
                    circumstances when the execution creditor
                    “intervenes” to require the bailiff to do
                    something which is not covered in the writ of execution. In
                        <em>Barclays Bank v Roberts</em>,
                    Evershed MR provided the following analysis as to what
                        <em>intervention</em> is required
                    for an agency relationship to arise:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As a matter of principle, it seems to me impossible
                        that the character and quality of their actions were
                        entirely altered because they sought advice and then
                        chose to act upon that advice (as it was, no doubt,
                        expected that they would). The responsibility for acting
                        on the advice they sought and received was their
                        responsibility. They cannot, in my judgment, be
                        converted into the agents of the persons on whose behalf
                        the advisers were acting – whether that person was
                        the landlord or a stranger to the property in question
                        –
                        <em>unless at the very least it were
                            shown that the sheriff’s officers made it
                            plain that their subsequent actions were only
                            undertaken on the basis of that other person
                            assuming responsibility
                        therefor</em>...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     On this line of authority,
                    a principal-agent relationship only arises if the
                    “character and quality” of the bailiff’s
                    conduct has been altered by the execution creditor. To
                    establish this, the execution creditor must first assume
                    responsibility for the bailiff’s actions and the
                    bailiff must then act plainly on the former’s
                    instructions. In <em>Williams</em>, it
                    was held that the execution creditor must give the bailiff
                    some “special direction”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     It need only be mentioned
                    in passing that these cases were not cited in <em>Heng </em><em>Chyu
                        </em><em>Kee</em>. It leaves
                    me to consider this question afresh, given that the relevant
                    authorities have now been presented for the court’s
                    consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The case which most
                    unreservedly supports the agency proposition is <em>Re Caidan</em>, but the standing of this
                    decision must now be discounted given that Morton J was
                    content to rely heavily on what was stated in the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> edition of
                    Halsbury’s Laws of England, without more. The
                        4<sup>th</sup> edition was scrutinised
                    in the later case of <em>Re A
                        Debtor</em> and found to be inaccurate:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">What was the sum owing to the creditor on
                        May 31? Mr. Evans-Lombe put the matter very simply
                        and attractively. He said that the sheriff was the agent
                        of the creditor to accept payments made to him, citing
                            <em>Halsbury’s Laws of
                            England</em>, 4<sup>th</sup>
                        ed. (1976), vol. 17, para. 492, entitled
                        “Execution,” which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“Payment to sheriff. The sheriff has
                            authority from the judgment creditor to receive the
                            amount to be levied, and can give a discharge. If
                            payment or tender is made, he must withdraw from
                            possession, and if no payment is made, he must,
                            after seizure, proceed at once to prepare for
                            sale.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">He cited the two cases therein referred to, namely
                            <em>Rook v. Wilmot</em> (1590)
                        Cro.Eliz.209, and <em>Taylor v.
                            Baker</em> (1677) Freem. K.B. 453. However,
                        upon examination those two cases did not appear to
                        establish the precise proposition for which they were
                        cited...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The remaining authorities
                    on this subject are generally agreed that the bailiff is a
                    servant of the court and acts on behalf of the court, but
                    they set different thresholds for situations wherein he can
                    also be regarded as an agent of the execution creditor. The
                        <em>Re A Debtor</em> and <em>Hooper</em> sequence of cases is vague in
                    its analysis, going only so far as to establish that the
                    bailiff is the execution creditor’s agent “for
                    some purposes” and is “not simply an
                    agent” but has “wider
                    responsibilities”. The line of cases from <em>Woollen v Wright</em> and <em>Williams</em> through to <em>Barclays Bank</em> offers a more coherent
                    position where the bailiff will only step into the role of
                    an agent if there has been some “special
                    direction” or “assumption of
                    responsibility” by the execution creditor. The
                    specific propositions which emerge from these cases are that
                    the bailiff is not an agent where he receives payment of the
                    judgment debt from the execution debtor (<em>Re A Debtor</em>), wrongly seizes the property of
                    a non-party (<em>Woollen v
                    Wright</em>), or wrongfully evicts a tenant (<em>Williams</em>; <em>Barclays Bank</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     On the whole, the position
                    in English law is that the bailiff, being a public
                    functionary, is not <em>by default</em>
                    an agent of the execution creditor who puts the writ of
                    seizure and sale in his hands <em>unless</em> there are special instructions from
                    the latter which are subsequently accepted by the bailiff.
                    Apart from this, the bailiff is to have regard to the
                    interests and instructions of the execution creditor only
                    insofar as it is compatible with his public duty (see
                        <em>Re Cook</em> (1894) 63 LJ QB
                    756). In this regard, <em>Curtis</em>
                    remains good law and should be applied in preference over
                        <em>Heng </em><em>Chyu </em><em>Kee</em>,
                    wherein the court did not have the benefit of being referred
                    to the relevant authorities. It has been suggested by
                    counsel for both the 1<sup>st</sup> and
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendants, Mr Daniel Koh
                    and Mr Chou Sean Yu respectively, that <em>Heng </em><em>Chyu
                        </em><em>Kee</em> can be
                    distinguished as it concerned the improper execution of a
                    writ of distress as distinct from a WSS. In English law, the
                    remedy of distress is a rare self-help remedy which permits
                    the landlord to immediately seize and sell the goods of a
                    tenant in arrears. Lord Denning described it as “an
                    archaic remedy which has largely fallen into disuse”
                    in <em>Abingdon Rural District Council v
                        O’Gorman</em> [1968] 2 QB 811
                    at 819. Until this common law right was abolished by s
                    71 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, the
                    position in England was that a landlord need not seek a
                    court order before levying distress so long as the affected
                    tenancy was not protected by the Rent Acts. In this context,
                    the bailiff who executes distress on behalf of the landlord
                    can less controversially be viewed as the latter’s
                    agent. Indeed it goes some length to explain the divergence
                    between <em>Re Caidan</em> and the
                    other cited English authorities. However, this does not
                    afford a ready basis to distinguish <em>Heng
                        </em><em>Chyu </em><em>Kee</em>. The operation of distress in
                    Singapore is governed by the Distress Act (Cap 84, 1996 Rev
                    Ed) which requires a court to issue a writ of distress
                    before it can be levied. In <em>Ginsin
                        Holdings Pte Ltd v Tan Mui </em><em>Khoon (trading as Chan Eng Soon Service) and
                        another</em> [1996] 3 SLR(R) 500, Judith Prakash J
                    examined the operation of distress in Singapore against its
                    historical development in England and reached the following
                    conclusion:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14    There has been no change in the
                            legal position since <em>Chop Chye
                                </em><em>Hin
                                </em><em>Chong v Ng Yeok
                                Seng</em> was decided. Under the Act which
                            in its original form as Ordinance 28 of 1934 was the
                            successor to the Civil Procedure Code 1907 and is
                            not substantively different from that Code, distress
                            is a remedy which is obtained only after judicial
                            intervention. It is not a self-help remedy as in
                            England. Accordingly, although the Act follows the
                            Code in not providing compensation for wrongful or
                            illegal distress, an aggrieved tenant cannot fall
                            back on the common law remedy of an action for
                            damages <em>per se</em>.
                            Instead he has to bring an action for malicious
                            prosecution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The processes involved in
                    obtaining and executing a writ of distress (as in <em>Heng </em><em>Chyu
                        </em><em>Kee</em>) are
                    therefore broadly similar to those of a writ of execution
                    (as in <em>Curtis</em> and the present
                    case). Consistent with this understanding, O 46 r 16 of
                    the Rules of Court governs both writ of execution and
                    distress. Insofar as the issue is one of whether the bailiff
                    acts as an agent of the person who took out the writ, the
                    same considerations and principles are traversable whether
                    it is a writ of distress or execution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In my view, the bailiff is
                    not, by default, viewed as the agent of the execution
                    creditor and the onus is upon the party who argues otherwise
                    to establish either that special instructions were issued or
                    that there had been intervention by the execution creditor,
                    such as to render the bailiff his agent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant
                specially instruct the bailiff?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     There is no evidence that
                    the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant had issued any
                    special instructions to the bailiff, apart from the fact
                    that Eugene had directed the
                    2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to seize the
                    machine parts at A2 and A3. Further, it cannot be said that
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant acted under the
                    special instructions of the
                    1<sup>st</sup> defendant merely by
                    accepting the letter of indemnity. While agents are
                    typically indemnified, the converse statement – that
                    whomsoever indemnified is typically an agent – is not
                    necessarily true. An agent is “invested with a legal
                    power to alter his principal’s legal relations with
                    third persons”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span>, but the provision
                    of an indemnity does not, without more, also carry with it
                    such a power. The indemnity is a standard requirement that
                    the bailiff would require from any execution creditor and
                    there is nothing to indicate that the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had
                    conducted himself any differently as a result of the
                    specific indemnity provided by the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant. In other
                    words, following Megarry VC in <em>Barclays Bank</em>, it cannot be said that the
                    “character and quality of their actions were entirely
                    altered” by the provision of the indemnity. Further,
                    applying the standard set out in <em>Curtis</em>, the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    defendant did not “mislead” the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant or take such
                    “active part” in the actual execution as to
                    identify itself with any wrongful acts of the
                latter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The inexorable conclusion
                    which must be drawn is that no relationship of agency arose
                    in the present case between the two
                co-defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Statutory immunity of the bailiff</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The key defence of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant rests on s
                    68(2) of the Subordinate Courts Act that protects him from
                    any liability unless he knowingly acted in excess of
                    authority. The provision is set out here in full:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    No officer of a subordinate
                            court charged with the duty of executing any writ,

                            process of the subordinate courts shall be liable to
                            be sued for the execution of or attempting to

                            damage caused to any property in effecting or
                            attempting to effect execution, <em>unless he knowingly acted in excess of the
                                authority</em> conferred upon him by such

                            mandatory process of the court in

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     There are two issues which
                    arise from s 68(2):</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">whether actual knowledge is

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">whether s 68(2) overrides the
                            common law duty.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I proceed now to consider
                    these issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether actual knowledge is required to establish
                that the bailiff knowingly acted in excess of
                authority</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The determination of this
                    issue is a prerequisite to the assessment of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant’s
                    liability. The plaintiff’s position is that
                    constructive knowledge, “in the sense of recklessness
                    as in turning a blind eye to the risk of loss or
                        damage”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span>, would
                    suffice to remove the bailiff’s statutory immunity.
                    The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant contends that
                    the test is a subjective one, such that the plaintiff must
                    demonstrate that the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    defendant had <em>actual</em> knowledge
                    that he was acting in excess of authority. However, Mr Chou
                    accepted that there are no reported cases on the state of
                    knowledge required to engage the exception in s
                        68(2)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span>. The
                    court must therefore apply general principles of statutory
                    interpretation to determine whether only <em>actual</em> knowledge is sufficient to displace
                    the bailiff’s statutory immunity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     On the face of it, s 68(2)
                    serves the clear purpose of protecting officers of the
                    Subordinate Courts from facing onerous civil liabilities in
                    performing their tasks in the execution of court processes.
                    The subjective test would fall squarely in line with this
                    objective. Further, this gives the wording of the statute
                    its natural and ordinary meaning because the default
                    position is that the officers of the Subordinate Courts,
                    including the bailiff, are <em>not
                        liable</em> for damage in the course of performing
                    their judicial tasks. The onus is on the claimant to prove
                    that the relevant officer had knowingly acted in excess of
                    his authority in order to remove the statutory immunity. Mr
                    Govin accepts that mere negligence is not sufficient to
                    displace the statutory immunity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     On the one hand, it can be
                    said that the subjective test would be more in keeping with
                    the statutory objective to protect officers of the
                    Subordinate Courts in the performance of their duties. On
                    the other hand, it can also be persuasively argued that the
                    subjective interpretation, taken to its logical extension,
                    will grant officers an extensive immunity which might
                    protect even egregious instances of excess of authority
                    against civil action. A more objective standard might
                    perhaps signal the legislature’s intention to uphold
                    standards of professional conduct whilst still protecting
                    officers of the Subordinate Courts from legal harassment.
                    However, such a purposive interpretation strains the natural
                    meaning of “knowingly” by incepting the legal
                    concept of constructive knowledge into the
                term.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Adopting a subjective test
                    does not, however, mean that the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant will only
                    be deprived of his statutory immunity if it can be shown
                    that he actually knew he was exceeding his authority. It is
                    the common position in criminal law that a defendant who
                    wilfully shuts his eyes to the commission of an offence will
                    also satisfy the <em>mens
                        </em><em>rea</em> requirement
                    of subjective knowledge. In <em>Awtar Singh
                        s/o Margar Singh v Public
                    Prosecutor </em>[2000] 2 SLR(R) 435, Yong CJ
                    developed the following exposition of wilful blindness at
                        [50]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The upshot of these cases is that actual knowledge of
                        certain facts can be inferred from the evidence that the
                        defendant had deliberately or wilfully shut his eyes to
                        the obvious or that he had refrained from inquiry
                        because he suspected the truth but did not want to have
                        his suspicion confirmed. Where the facts obviously
                        pointed to one result, and the accused must have
                        appreciated it but shut his eyes to the truth, then
                        together with the other evidence adduced, it could have
                        formed a very compelling part of the evidence to infer
                        the requisite guilty knowledge: <em>Chiaw Wai Onn v PP</em> [[1997] 2 SLR(R)
                            233]<em>. </em><em>However, it has to be remembered that there
                            is a vast difference between a state of mind which
                            consists of deliberately shutting the eyes to the
                            obvious, the result of which a person does not care
                            to have, and a state of mind which is merely
                            neglecting to make inquiries which a reasonable and
                            prudent man would make</em>:<em> PP v Koo </em><em>Pui

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The criminal law treats
                    actual knowledge and wilful blindness as legal equivalents.
                    However, it must be emphasised that they are not
                    substantively the same – actual knowledge is a
                    subjective mental state, whereas wilful blindness is an
                    objective evidential tool for establishing such a mental
                    state (see <em>Public Prosecutor</em> v
                        <em>Lim Boon Hiong and another</em>
                    [2010] 4 SLR 696 at [55]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In the civil context, the
                    House of Lords undertook a comprehensive investigation into
                    the meaning of acting “knowingly” in excess of
                    authority in <em>Three Rivers DC v Bank of
                        England (No 3)</em> [2003] 2 AC 1. This case is of
                    particular relevance given that it also concerns the
                    culpable mental state of a public officer, albeit in the
                    context of a common law tort instead of statutory immunity.
                    More importantly, the ingredients of the tort of misfeasance
                    in public office are broadly similar to the requirements set
                    out in s 68 for the displacement of the bailiff’s
                    statutory immunity. Lord Steyn described the tort as
                    follows, at p 191:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The case law reveals two different forms of liability
                        for misfeasance in public office. First there is the
                        case of targeted malice by a public officer... The
                        second form is where a public officer acts knowing that
                        he has no power to do the act complained of and that the
                        act will probably injure the plaintiff. It involves bad
                        faith inasmuch as the public officer does not have an
                        honest belief that his act is lawful.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The House of Lords
                    concluded that “knowing” includes both
                    situations of actual knowledge as well as subjective
                    recklessness or reckless indifference. The plaintiff’s
                    argument that objective recklessness, wherein the defendant
                    recklessly failed to even think about an obvious risk,
                    should be sufficient to attract liability was rejected. It
                    was also thought that this represented the appropriate
                    balance between the competing policy considerations of
                    combating abuse of public power and preventing unmeritorious
                    claims against public officers (<em>per</em> Lord Steyn at p 196).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     On the whole, I see no
                    compelling reasons for extending the meaning of
                    “knowingly” beyond the elements of actual
                    knowledge and wilful blindness. The common thread between
                    these elements is that the bailiff must have at least
                    addressed his mind to whether he is exceeding his authority,
                    as opposed to situations where the bailiff was wholly
                    ignorant or simply failed to give the matter any thought at
                    all. Importing notions of constructive or objective
                    knowledge necessarily derogates from the mental cognisance
                    which is inherently denoted by the term
                    “knowingly”. It also detracts from the purpose
                    of s 68 by potentially opening the door to claims against
                    court officers for <em>negligent</em>
                    performance of their duties. Any introduction of objective
                    standards necessarily structures the administration of these
                    public duties by increasing the vulnerability of court
                    officers to civil litigation. As for whether the subjective
                    standard of reckless indifference will suffice to displace
                    the bailiff’s statutory immunity and whether it is any
                    different from wilful blindness, I am disinclined to make a
                    finding on this issue without the benefit of submissions
                    from counsel and, in any event, it is unnecessary for the
                    determination of the present case. I add only that the
                        <em>mens </em><em>rea</em> requirements of actual knowledge and
                    wilful blindness, whilst stringent, would still capture
                    instances where the bailiff acts egregiously outside of his
                    authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether s 68(2) overrides the common law
                duty</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     There is judicial
                    authority that bailiffs owe a common law duty of care to the
                    execution debtor, as distinct from their statutory
                    obligations under O 46 of the Rules of Court. Apart from the
                    dicta of Lord Cranworth in <em>Hooper</em> (see <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above) to this effect, there is also
                    the case of <em>S Louis Pillay v
                        AS Nadasan</em> [1922] FMSLR 100
                        (“<em>Pillay</em>”).
                    In his judgment, Woodward JC opined that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...The duties of the bailiff are in some
                        respects analogous to those of the sheriff under English
                        Law and in Bevan on Negligence, Vol. 1, p. 269, occurs
                        the following passage:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">So long as the sheriff is in possession of the
                            goods of the debtor, he is bound to exercise the
                            same degree of care in their preservation that a man
                            of ordinary discretion and judgment may reasonably
                            be expected to exercise in regard to his own
                            property. He does not insure the goods, but is in
                            the position of an ordinary bailor for the purposes
                            of custody and sale. He is very nearly in the case
                            of a del credere agent-the keeper and the
                            seller of goods with an obligation to guarantee the
                            sale, and a lien on the proceeds to secure his
                            compensation-and is consequently, subject to the
                            same rule of care and liability. That is he is not
                            liable for an accidental fire, nor yet for loss by
                            theft, robbery or other accident, without want of
                            ordinary care on his part.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">And on page 278 the same learned author
                        on the subject of public servants refers with approval
                        to the law as laid down in the American case of
                            Jenner <em>v.</em> Joliffe:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“In every case where an officer is
                            entrusted by the common law or by statute, an action
                            lies against him for a neglect of the duty of his
                            office, or as was said in Barry <em>v.</em> Arnand: The
                            defendant then is a public ministered officer, and
                            being so he is responsible for neglect of his duty
                            to any individual who sustains damage by such
                            neglect."</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">And with regard to the degree of care
                        demanded from public servants, the author writes:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“What amount of care constitutes negligence
                            in these cases? It would seem that the assumption of
                            an office implies a representation that the holder
                            possesses the qualifications for efficient
                            performance of its duties. The amount of care
                            necessary consequently varies with the greater or
                            less complexity of the duties of the office. The
                            officer must show that diligence which a
                            conscientious and capable man versed in the duties
                            of the particular office, is expected to show in the
                            performance of them.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The degree of care required by section 255 may be a
                        higher degree than this, but can hardly be a lower
                        one...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Given that the bailiff
                    owes a common law duty of care to the execution debtor, the
                    question arises whether s 68(2) operates to protect him from
                    any breach of this duty. In this regard, it appears to be
                    the general position in England and the United States that
                    liability in tort is subject to express statutory provisions
                    conferring immunity on a judicial officer. In <em>Observer Ltd v Gordon</em> [1983] 1 WLR
                    1008, the defendant sheriff was accused of wrongful seizure
                    of another’s goods pursuant to a bankruptcy petition.
                    Under s 15 of the Bankruptcy and Deeds of Arrangement Act
                    1913, the sheriff had a defence unless he had notice that
                    the goods belonged to another, or if it would have been
                    reasonable for him to make inquiries that might have
                    ascertained that the goods were so owned. There was also a
                    well-established common law doctrine, following <em>Neumann v Bakeaway Ltd</em> [1983] 1 WLR
                    1016, that the sheriff would be liable if the seized goods
                    were sold at a gross undervalue. The following passage from
                    Glidewell J’s judgment at 1016 supports the view that
                    the statutory defence takes precedence:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Is there then evidence that the goods have been sold
                        at a gross undervalue? If I had not found for the
                        sheriff on the statutory defence I would not have found
                        myself able to say that either Mr. Cranfield or Mr.
                        Parsons did not have an arguable case. In other words, I
                        would have said that on the common law defence the order
                        “no action” should not have been made
                        against them. Their evidence as to value might persuade
                        a court that the goods were sold at a gross undervalue;
                        it is not for me, of course, to decide that it would so
                        convince a court...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In addition, there are
                    several United States cases which establish the same
                    position in relation to the Illinois Local Governmental and
                    Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act (745 Ill Comp Stat
                    10) (“Tort Immunity Act”). Two cases will
                    suffice to illustrate the application of this
                    jurisprudence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Section 2-202 of the Tort
                    Immunity Act provides that “[a] public employee is
                    not liable for his act or omission in the execution or
                    enforcement of any law unless such act or omission
                    constitutes wilful and wanton conduct”. The District
                    Court in <em>Hogan v Smith</em>, SD
                    Ill, 2012, 2012 WL 1435402 held that negligence of police
                    officers in a high-speed car chase was not actionable as it
                    did not amount to wilful and wanton conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Similarly, s 5/105 of the
                    Tort Immunity Act extends immunity to any “injury
                    caused by the negligent operation of a motor vehicle or
                    firefighting or rescue equipment, when responding to an
                    emergency call, including transportation of a person to a
                    medical facility.” In <em>Carter v
                        Simpson</em>, 328 F 3d 948, a police officer was
                    driving a patrol car to respond to a call of reported death.
                    The officer was alleged to have negligently collided with
                    the plaintiff’s car. The United States Court of
                    Appeals for the 7<sup>th</sup> Circuit held
                    that the officer had “immunity for any alleged
                    negligence on his part” (at 951) except for what was
                    expressly provided in the statute, <em>ie</em>, wilful or wanton conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     It would appear from my
                    review of English and United States cases that the common
                    law duty of care is expressly subject to s 68(2) of the
                    Subordinate Courts Act, such that the bailiff’s
                    statutory immunity must be disabled before any tortious
                    liability can be engaged.</p>

                    separately examined in turn. It will be apparent that the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant did not in fact
                    act in excess of authority, let alone <em>knowingly</em> act in excess of such
                    authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Inadequate notice of seizure</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The bailiff’s duties
                    as to notification of the execution debtor are set out in O
                    46 r 16 of the 1997 edition of the Rules of Court:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    Where any movable property is seized by the Sheriff
                            under a writ of execution or distress, he must give
                            to the execution debtor a notice of seizure in Form
                            94, and a copy of the notice must be
                        filed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Where
                            the Sheriff removes from a place any movable
                            property that is seized, he must give to the
                            execution debtor at the time the property is removed
                            or immediately afterwards an inventory of the
                            property so
                            removed.</p>

                                property was seized.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The plaintiff contends
                    that Form 94, the Notice of Seizure and Inventory, should
                    not have been left at the container office at the warehouse
                    at Jalan Buroh, but should instead have been sent to the
                    plaintiff’s office at Beach Road. However, the options
                    under O 46 r 16 are couched in disjunctive terms. In this
                    regard, it is plainly within the rights of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to either leave
                    the Notice at, or post it to, the place where the seizure
                    was executed. Further, the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    defendant testified that he had every reason to believe that
                    the Jalan Buroh address was the plaintiff’s place of
                    business as this address was also stated in the WSS. No
                    doubt, it would have been <em>ideal</em> for the Notice to have been sent to
                    the plaintiff’s Beach Road office as well, but this is
                    insufficient to show that the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    defendant had knowingly acted in excess of authority. Given
                    that the Notice was properly left at the place of seizure
                    (which was one of the addresses stated in the WSS), there
                    can be no question of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    defendant having acted in excess of authority, let alone
                        <em>knowingly</em> doing so. The
                    wording of O 46 r 16(3) is unambiguously clear – the
                    bailiff has the choice of how and where he wishes to post
                    the Notice – and directly disposes of the
                    plaintiff’s claim on this point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The plaintiff has further
                    averred, though not pleaded, that the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant failed to
                    provide notice of the date and time of seizure, contrary to
                    s 82 of the Subordinate Courts Practice Directions,
                    introduced with effect from 1 August 2000 pursuant to
                    Practice Direction 2 of 2000:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Prior to the seizure and/or sale, the Bailiff will
                            notify the execution debtor, as far as practicable,

                            request that the execution debtor or his authorised
                            representative be present at the premises at the
                            appointed date and time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The difficulty here is
                    that Practice Directions are not binding law. In <em>Odex Pte Ltd v Pacific Internet Pte

                    and reiterated the relevant authorities:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29    It seemed to me that the reference to "on behalf

                            application could be made on behalf of a copyright
                            owner or exclusive licensee. The practice direction
                            did not purport to create additional rights. Even if

                            of the Supreme Court, stated that practice

                            proposition). Therefore, it is clear that a practice
                            direction does not have the force of a rule of court
                            and cannot vary the force of the latter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Whilst the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant’s
                    omission to notify the plaintiff as to the date and time of
                    the seizure might appear not to have been in compliance with
                    the Practice Directions, it cannot be said that he acted in
                    excess of his authority since the precedents are clear that
                    he is under no binding legal duty to comply with the
                    Practice Direction in the first place. Further, the Practice
                    Direction is not couched in absolute terms. Prior
                    notification may be provided to the execution debtor
                    “as far as practicable”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In any event, the evidence
                    suggests that whatever the omissions of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, Mr Zagrodnik
                    was in fact aware of the WSS and the seizure of the
                    plaintiff’s machinery. First, Mr Zagrodnik admitted in
                    cross-examination that he received and understood the
                    General Notice dated 23 March 2004. Second, in the
                    letter from the plaintiff’s solicitors to the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant dated
                    9 July 2004, the purported agreement between Kelvin and
                    Mr Zagrodnik was stated to have taken place “shortly
                    after the seizure of the items”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span>. Third,
                    Mr Zagrodnik’s own affidavit, filed on
                    12 August 2004, states that he spoke to Kelvin after
                    the plaintiff issued the WSS<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span>.
                    While these factors may not be conclusive, their collective
                    weight at least casts serious doubt on the plaintiff’s
                    claim that it was kept wholly in the dark of the seizure
                    until Mr Zagrodnik visited the premises on 5 July
                    2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Failure to particularize the seized
                machinery</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The plaintiff argues that
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant’s
                    description of the seized machinery, “all machineries
                    and parts of timber at lot A2 to A3 (inside)”, was
                    remiss and short of the minimum standards imposed by O 46
                    r 16. Emphasis is placed on Choo JC’s dicta in
                        <em>Heng </em><em>Chyu </em><em>Kee</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10    I would, in passing, observe
                            that some of the problems in this sale would not
                            have arisen had the bailiff been precise in his
                            recording of the inventory. I accept that there may
                            be occasions in which it would be expedient to
                            record certain items as "miscellaneous" items, but
                            if that should become necessary, the items must be
                            packed together in a box or container and sealed
                            with the court's seal, and the description should
                            then be "miscellaneous items in box A", for example.
                            To state merely "miscellaneous items" without any
                            means of identifying what they are, and relying
                            solely on the bailiff's memory is an unreliable, and
                            therefore, undesirable method. There is authority in
                            the case of <em>Davies v Property and
                                Reversionary Investments Corp</em> [1929]
                            2 KB 222 for the proposition that if the notice of
                            writ identifies all items in the shop as subject to
                            the seizure the notice may be regarded as
                            sufficient; but it is one thing to say that all the
                            goods in the shop are seized and another to say that
                            miscellaneous items are seized. The difference is
                            stark and obvious and requires no further
                            explanation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     As was the case with the
                    Notice of Seizure, the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    defendant could have placed himself beyond reproach had he
                    taken the further effort of particularizing the seized
                    machinery in detail. Nevertheless, it has not been
                    established that he had <em>knowingly</em> recorded an inaccurate description
                    in the Inventory since the only mistake in the Inventory,
                        <em>ie</em>, the inclusion of
                    “parts of timber” was, by the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant’s own
                    explanation, simply the product of a poor translation. If
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had made a
                    mistake, then it necessarily implies that he did not have
                    actual knowledge of the error at that time. There is
                    therefore no question of wilful blindness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     More importantly, even if
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had knowingly
                    written an erroneous or inaccurate Inventory, the plaintiff
                    has not shown how this has prejudiced its interests, let
                    alone caused its loss. First, the <em>additional</em> inclusion of “parts of
                    timber” does not prejudice the plaintiff’s
                    interest unless the description of the machinery actually
                    seized was also inaccurate. It would not be fair to reach
                    this conclusion, since the description of “all
                    machineries... at lot A2 and A3 (inside)” does not
                    misrepresent the seized machinery. Indeed, the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant’s
                    identification of the seized machinery with reference to
                    their location appears to be on all fours with Choo
                    JC’s dicta in <em>Heng
                        </em><em>Chyu </em><em>Kee</em> and the English case cited
                    therein, <em>Davies v Property and
                        Reversionary Investments Corp</em>. In the latter
                    case, Talbot J held at page 231that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... It appears to us the statute not only requires the
                        cause of taking to be mentioned, but also a notice to be
                        given ‘thereof’, that is, of the distress
                        taken, which must include everything taken.. the notice
                        ought to inform the tenant or the person whose effects
                        are taken, and also what is the amount of rent in
                        arrear. <em>The general description
                            ‘any other goods, chattels, and effects on the
                            premises, or in and about the premises’.. is
                            sufficient.</em>.. it is quite clear that they
                        decided that it was a good notice because they construed
                        the notice as meaning that all the goods were taken; and
                        if it did mean that, then, in the words of Erle J, the
                        word “all does itself give a description which
                        covers everything that is on the premises’.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     It should also be borne in
                    mind that the plaintiff had omitted to enter an inventory of
                    the machinery stored at the two bays, such that even a more
                    detailed description would not have permitted the plaintiff
                    to establish in litigation whether the Inventory was
                    accurate or otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Second, the causative link
                    between the inaccuracy in the Inventory and the
                    plaintiff’s loss is unclear. Although the same
                    description was used in the advertisement of the public
                    auction, the bidders had the opportunity to physically
                    inspect the seized machinery at the auction itself. It is
                    highly unlikely that the description used in the
                    advertisement of the public auction would have affected the
                    opinion of the bidders who were actually present at the
                    auction. Indeed, it was Mr Lim’s testimony that he had
                    not read the advertisement and had turned up only because he
                    noticed the crowd of people attending the auction close to
                    his own office.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     On the strength of the
                    above considerations, the plaintiff’s case on this
                    purported breach also fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Seizure in excess of the judgment debt</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The basis for this
                    purported breach was that the WSS only authorised the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to seize such
                    of the plaintiff’s goods as would be sufficient to
                    satisfy the judgment debt of S$29,771.57. The plaintiff
                    claims that the
                    2<sup>nd</sup> defendant exceeded his
                    authority because the seized machinery is worth
                    S$1,224,294.50. To this, there is nothing to suggest that
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant did so
                        <em>knowingly</em>. The
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant simply assessed
                    the value of the seized machinery to be S$15,000. In this
                    regard, as this was his first time seizing machinery, the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was not
                    personally knowledgeable of the market value of such
                    machinery. Moreover, it is the consistent evidence of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, the
                    auctioneer, Mr Lean Lam Bong (“Mr Lean”), and
                    Mr Lim that the seized machinery was old and rusty, which
                    further reduces the likelihood that the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant would have
                    known of their purported value.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The plaintiff contends
                    that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant should
                    properly have sought an external valuation of the seized
                    machinery in order to ensure that the seizure was not in
                    excess of the judgment debt amounting to S$29,771.57. This
                    is yet another instance of the recurrent theme that the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant could have gone
                    further in the performance of his duties. However, there is
                    simply no stipulation in the Rules of Court requiring the
                    bailiff to obtain an external valuation. It was also the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant’s
                    uncontroverted evidence that such valuations, as a matter of
                    practice in the Subordinate Courts, were only sought for
                    jewellery or diamonds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     This should be sufficient
                    to dispose of the plaintiff’s claim for excessive
                    seizure against the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    defendant. However for completeness, the evidence as regards
                    the actual value of the seized machinery will be considered
                    below at <a href="#p1_92">[92]</a> to

                            before the date of sale.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     This present version of O
                    46 r 24 was introduced by Amendment Act No 671 of 2004 which
                    came into effect on 1 December 2004. At the relevant
                    time of seizure, the required notice period was only two
                    days. As the advertisement was published on 9 June 2004
                    and the auction held on 11 June 2004, the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had complied
                    with his duties under the then applicable
                provision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The plaintiff’s main
                    submission on this purported breach is that the
                    advertisement failed to describe the actual function and
                    purpose of the seized machinery and accordingly failed to
                    attract the appropriate bidders. However, the seized
                    machinery was auctioned, purchased, and even re-sold as
                    scrap metal. By all accounts, even if they had been
                    advertised as woodworking machinery, the outcome would have
                    been no different as the machines were old and rusty.
                    According to Mr Lean, the auction was competitive and was
                    attended by 20 to 30 bidders. There is also no evidence that
                    a more detailed description of the seized machinery in the
                    advertisement would have made any difference in either
                    attracting more specialised bidders or higher prices. In
                    fact, the objective evidence before me indicates otherwise.
                    The plaintiff had difficulties selling the seized machinery
                    for years. Further, the seized machinery is still in a state
                    of disuse today (some eight years after the auction and
                    sale) despite the fact that it was ultimately purchased by
                    Hua Seng, <em>ie</em>, a purchaser with
                    specialised interest in the seized machinery.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Most importantly, the
                    advertisement was arranged by Mr Lean and not the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant. Mr Lean could
                    have inspected the seized machinery himself and drawn up his
                    own description, but he testified that this was not the
                    general practice at that time. Although the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had approved
                    the draft of the advertisement, this was entirely in line
                    with his earlier description in the Inventory<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span>. So
                    long as the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was
                    under the belief that he had recorded an accurate
                    description of the seized machinery, the case against him on
                    this point cannot be made out. Indeed, one might surmise
                    that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had
                    every reason to ensure that the auction yielded good value
                    since he estimated that the seized machinery was only worth
                    about $15,000, which fell short of the judgment debt. This
                    renders it all the more unlikely that he knowingly acted in
                    excess of authority as regards the advertisement for the
                    auction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Failure to give adequate notice of sale</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Order 46 Rule 23
                    stipulates that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Unless the Sheriff otherwise orders, all sales must be
                        by public auction between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.
                        and notice in Form 91 of the day, hour and place of any
                        intended sale must be posted on the notice board of the
                        Registry and as far as practicable at the place of
                        intended sale 7 days before the date of sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant left the first
                    Notice of Sale with the security guard at the warehouse
                        (<em>ie</em>, the place of the
                    intended sale) on 24 May 2004. Subsequently, due to
                    delays in the publication of the advertisement of the public
                    auction, a second Notice of Sale was issued on 7 June
                    2004 stating that the auction would be held on 11 June
                    2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The plaintiff alleges that
                    the required seven days between the date of Notice and date
                    of sale was not complied with. It argues that the seven day
                    requirement is not qualified by the phrase “as far as
                    practicable”, which only applies to the posting of
                    the Notice at the place of execution. I disagree with the
                    plaintiff’s interpretation of O 46 r 23. If r 23
                    intends for the seven day period to be an absolute
                    requirement, then it would read “... notice in Form
                    91 of the day, hour and place of any intended sale must be
                    posted <em>7 days before the date of
                        sale</em> on the notice board of the Registry and
                    as far as practicable at the place of intended sale
                        <del>7 days before the date of
                        sale</del>.” The requirements of both
                    location and timing of notice should therefore be read as
                    conjunctively qualified by the phrase “as far as
                    practicable”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     In any event, the
                    plaintiff was not prejudiced by the four day period as it
                    had already received notice on 24 May 2004, albeit for
                    an earlier auction date. The plaintiff seeks to rely on a
                    technical argument that a fresh period of seven days should
                    be required after the issue of the second amended Notice of
                    Sale. This might be the case if the original date
                    (9 June 2004) of the auction had elapsed before the
                    issuance of the second Notice of Sale. However, in the
                    present case, the amended Notice was sent on 7 June
                    2004, <em>prior</em> to the original
                    date of auction. As such, the second Notice, in effect,
                    represents an extended Notice for a postponed auction rather
                    than a fresh Notice of a new auction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Sale of goods which were not seized</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     This issue turns on the
                    factual determination of whether machinery stored at bay A4
                    had also been sold at the public auction. It is the
                    consistent evidence of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    defendant, Kelvin, Mr Yeo and Mr Lean that only goods stored
                    at bays A2 and A3 had been seized and auctioned. Mr
                    Zagrodnik’s unchallenged evidence is that some items
                    originally stored at A4, namely 660 sets of idler
                    rollers, were found in Hua Seng’s premises. However,
                    an inventory of what was stored at bay A4 had never been
                    kept. It is also worthwhile to note that the
                    plaintiff’s immediate response was to instruct its
                    solicitors to send a letter to the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant claiming
                    wrongful re-entry into the leased premises<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span>. In this
                    letter, the affected area was described as “the
                    portion of the premises covering an area of three thousand
                    eight hundred square feet at 27 Jalan Buroh, Singapore at
                    the monthly rent of $3,120.00”, referring
                    specifically to bays A2 and A3. The plaintiff’s
                    response, therefore, did not seem to contemplate any
                    wrongful seizure or sale of machinery stored at
                A4.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     This magnifies the
                    impression that its present claim is a “<em>res </em><em>ipsa
                        </em><em>loquitur”</em> inference based on Hua
                    Seng’s current possession of the idler rollers.
                    However, this fact, at best, only serves to establish that
                    some machinery originally stored at bay A4 is currently in
                    the possession of Hua Seng. It does not show how, when
                    and who sold the machinery originally stored at bay A4 to
                    Hua Seng. I should add that it is possible that the
                    A4 machinery might have been moved to bays A2 and A3
                    prior to the seizure. In this regard, it is pertinent to
                    note that Mr Zagrodnik agreed in his AEIC and in
                    cross-examination that when he visited the premises on or
                    about 5 July 2004, the machinery stored at bay A4 had
                    already been removed. However, the seized machinery bought
                    by Kim Hock at the public auction remained stored at bays A2
                    and A3 until it took delivery on 22 July 2004. As such,
                    the moving of the machinery originally stored at bay A4
                    prior to the seizure is entirely possible. It is equally
                    possible that the machinery stored at bay A4 might have been
                    wrongly removed by the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    defendant, Kim Hock, or even Hua Seng. In this regard,
                    however, no separate claim for conversion of the machinery
                    stored at bay A4 is before the court. The plaintiff’s
                    entire case is premised on the auction and sale of machinery
                    which had not been seized, yet the evidential gap as to
                    which party had removed the machinery stored at bay A4 has
                    not been adequately addressed. I am not convinced that the
                    plaintiff has fulfilled its burden of proof on this count;
                    its claim that goods stored at A4 which had not been seized
                    were sold is therefore dismissed. For completeness, I should
                    add that there simply cannot be any liability on the part of
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant in respect
                    of any sale of machinery stored at bay A4, even if proved,
                    since by the plaintiff’s own pleaded case, they were
                    not seized by him in the first place. His Inventory clearly
                    stated “all machineries... at lot A2 and A3
                    (inside)”. Further, the sale was conducted by the
                    auctioneer, Mr Lean, and not by the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     It only remains for me to
                    add that the plaintiff has purported to change its pleaded
                    position at the trial in relation to the machine parts
                    stored at bay A4. In the plaintiff’s amended
                    Statement of Claim, its pleaded case was that the machine
                    parts in A4 had been sold despite not being
                        seized<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span>. This was also the
                    position adopted in the plaintiff’s opening statement
                    before this court<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span>. However, the same
                    contention has not been pursued in the plaintiff’s
                    closing submissions, and indeed it now appears to be the
                    plaintiff’s case that <em>all</em> of its machinery had been seized,
                    including those stored in bay A4<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span>. Suffice
                    it to say that this is not the plaintiff’s pleaded
                    case and it appears that its pleaded position, which was in
                    any case not proved, has been abandoned.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Failure to sell for the best price</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Finally, the plaintiff
                    asserts that the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant
                    had failed to sell the goods for the best price. However,
                    the WSS only directed the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                    defendant to levy such property as would satisfy the
                    judgment debt, not to achieve the best price for the
                    execution debtor. Further, it has not been contended that
                    the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant had
                    knowledge of what the best price should be. Moreover, the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant has no control
                    over the price at which the seized machinery is eventually
                    sold. Mr Lean testified that he was not aware of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant’s
                    appraisal of the machinery and, in any case, does not as a
                    matter of practice consult the bailiff as to the
                    price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     It only remains to be
                    added that there is no duty, even at common law, to sell
                    seized goods for the best price. The highest at which one
                    can place the bailiff’s duty is to obtain a reasonable
                    price for the seized goods. This position is explained in
                    Halsbury’s Laws of England (5th Ed) Vol 12, at
                    paragraph 1336:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is the enforcement officer’s duty, within a
                        reasonable time after the seizure to sell the goods for
                        a reasonable price, and it is also his duty not so to
                        conduct the sale as to prevent them fetching such a
                        price as may have been obtained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The dicta of Justice Dean
                    of the Supreme Court of Victoria, in <em>Owen
                        v Daly</em> [1955] VLR 442, serves to reinforce
                    this:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... at common law the duty of the sheriff in selling
                        chattels, including chattels real, of a judgment debtor
                        is to act reasonably in the interests of the judgment
                        creditor and the judgment debtor in order to obtain a
                        fair price, not necessarily the market value, for it is
                        well recognised that compulsory sales under legal
                        process rarely bring full value of the property
                        sold.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Accordingly, the
                    plaintiff’s claim on this score likewise
                fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Liability of the 1<sup>st</sup>
                defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Inasmuch as the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was not acting
                    as the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s
                    agent, any alleged misconduct which was solely the
                    responsibility of the
                    2<sup>nd</sup> defendant cannot be
                    attributed in the alternative to the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant. Referring back
                    to the particulars of the plaintiff’s claim at
                        <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above, the
                    purported breaches (a), (b), (d), and (e) are all duties
                    within the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant’s
                    sole purview. My findings that the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant did not breach
                    those alleged duties, would effectively dispose of the
                    plaintiff’s case against the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant as
                    execution creditor in relation to those alleged
                    breaches.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Further, the purported
                    breaches in (g) and (h) relate to the sale of the seized
                    machinery which was, in accordance with O 46 r 24, conducted
                    by an authorised auctioneer. There is no separate pleading
                    by the plaintiff that the
                    1<sup>st</sup> defendant is liable for
                    the acts or omissions of the auctioneer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     It is therefore the
                    purported breach in (c), <em>ie</em>,
                    seizure in excess of the judgment debt, which constitutes
                    the kernel of the plaintiff’s case against the
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant. The basis of
                    this claim is that the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    defendant had negligently directed the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to seize the
                    machine parts in bays A2 and A3, the value of which far
                    exceeded the judgment debt of S$29,771.57.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The plaintiff alleges that
                    the equipment is worth S$1,224,294.50, but there are several
                    problems with this. First, the evidence of the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, the
                    auctioneer, Mr Lean, and the buyer, Kim Hock, is consistent
                    that the seized machinery looked old and rusty and was
                    therefore treated only as scrap metal. This is approximately
                    in line with the actual sale price of S$51,500. Second,
                    there is no evidence that as of the date of seizure, the
                    seized machinery allegedly comprising two separate plants
                    was actually functional. In fact, the seized machinery,
                    which was ultimately purchased by Mr Lau, is still in disuse
                    today. While Mr Zagrodnik might well have told Kelvin that
                    the machinery stored at the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    defendant’s premises was worth “a few hundred
                    thousand dollars”, that is not to say that Kelvin
                    accepted it to be true or accurate or that it was in fact
                    its value. Third, if it is true that the value of the goods
                    seized far exceeded its sale price, it is indeed odd that Mr
                    Zagrodnik did not offer to purchase the seized machinery
                    from Mr Lau given that it is still in a state of disuse
                    today. There are, therefore, compelling reasons to utilise
                    the scrap value of the seized machinery rather than their
                    purported contractual value in assessing whether there was
                    excessive seizure. Nonetheless, these will be examined in
                    turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Liability for excessive
                    seizure only attaches where the value of the seized goods
                    was clearly disproportionate to the judgment debt. The
                    English Court of Appeal in <em>Steel Linings
                        Ltd &amp; Mark Harvey v Bibby &amp; Co</em> [1993]
                    RA 27 (“<em>Steel
                        Linings</em>”), held at p 6 that “to
                    be proved excessive the value of the goods seized must be
                    clearly disproportionate to the arrears and charges”.
                    Further, “to avoid an excessive distress all that is
                    required is that the distrainor should exercise a reasonable
                    and honest discretion in estimating what the goods will
                    realise at auction; he need not consider what value the
                    ratepayer himself could have obtained for them or what they
                    would be worth to a business
                successor”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Scrap value</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Both parties in this
                    dispute have notably called expert witnesses to provide
                    evidence only as regards the scrap metal value of the seized
                    machinery at the time of seizure. The
                        1<sup>st</sup> defendant’s expert
                    witness, Mr Robert Khan, conducted a retrospective
                    analysis following a visit to Hua Seng’s premises
                    and reached the conclusion that the scrap metal value of the
                    seized machinery as at 11 June 2004 was S$70,000, and
                    their forced sale value S$55,000<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     The plaintiff’s
                    expert, Mr Edmund Wong, produced a report on the scrap steel
                    market value of the plaintiff’s machine parts as of
                    May to July 2004 based on the report issued by TEX Report
                    Ltd as well as the local purchase price obtained by Natsteel
                    Ltd, Singapore, the dominant purchaser of such scrap in
                    Singapore. Mr Wong’s calculations were made using the
                    July 2004 scrap prices, following the date that the
                    auctioned machinery was weighed. However, he conceded under
                    cross-examination that June 2004 prices should have been
                    used instead, as that was when the auction took place.
                    According to his report, the international price of scrap
                    metal as of June 2004 was S$332/ton, and the local purchase
                    price was S$260/ton<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span>. The weigh bridge
                    tickets indicate that approximately 318 tons of scrap metal
                    was purchased by Kim Hock. Assuming that this was also the
                    weight of the seized machinery in June, the value of the
                    seized machinery would have been between S$105,576
                    (international) and S$82,680 (local). Taking the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant’s
                    case at its highest, and applying a 20% discount to obtain
                    the forced sale value, the metal would have been worth
                    between S$84,460.80 and S$66,144. It might be thought that
                    the upper limits of this range are on the borderline of
                    being disproportionate to the judgment debt of S$29,771.57.
                    Taken on average, however, it would not be fair to regard
                    the forced sale scrap value of the seized machinery as
                        <em>clearly</em> disproportionate
                    to the judgment debt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Value from contracts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The plaintiff’s
                    pleaded case, however, is that the value of the seized
                    machinery should be calculated according to its contracts
                    with Ngan Linh and Best Chipboard. However, the contract
                    with Ngan Linh for the hard and soft-board plant was entered
                    into on 28 February 2001, over three years prior to the
                    date of seizure. Further, the contract was never actually
                    performed as Ngan Linh eventually purchased the machinery
                    from Poland instead<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span>. Further,
                    the contract was signed by Mr Le Tat Huan, who has since
                    passed away, on behalf of Ngan Linh. His son, Mr Le Tat
                    Linh, filed an AEIC to prove the Ngan Linh contract but
                    accepted in cross-examination that the Ngan Linh contract
                    exhibited in his AEIC was not sourced from Ngan Linh’s
                    files but was provided by the plaintiff. He testified that
                    the signature on the Ngan Linh contract was indeed his late
                    father’s. Further, he accepted that the Ngan Linh
                    contract, on its face, referred to two reference numbers,
                    namely SEE/VN-001 and 002<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span>, of which the latter was
                    not exhibited in his AEIC. Mr Le was not able to provide any
                    explanation for the missing SEE/VN-002. At best, while the
                    Ngan Linh contract may give some indication as to what a
                    purchaser might be prepared to pay for <em>some</em> machinery (I say <em>some</em> because reference number SEE/VE-002 was
                    not disclosed) used in the manufacture of hard and
                    soft-boards in 2001, it does not represent the sum that a
                    purchaser would <em>actually</em> be
                    willing to pay as at 2004. The undeniable fact also remains
                    that the Ngan Linh contract signed in 2001 was never
                    performed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Under clause 3.1 of the
                    Ngan Linh contract, a letter of credit for US$441,000 was to
                    be opened within 15 days from the date of signing, but no
                    such letter of credit has been tendered to the court as
                    evidence. Further, the plaintiff was to begin shipment of
                    the machines within 45 days, with final and full shipment
                    within 60 days of the first shipment date. There is no
                    evidence that any extension to this time-line had been
                    granted, and no explanation as to why the necessary steps
                    stipulated in the contract were not performed. Collectively,
                    these factors combine to undermine the weight which can be
                    attributed to the Ngan Linh contract as an estimate of the
                    market value of the hard and soft-board plant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     As for the purported
                    contract with Best Chipboard for the particle board plant,
                    numerous documentary inconsistencies were exposed during
                    cross-examination which collectively impugn the credibility
                    of the plaintiff’s submission on this point. Apart
                    from certain portions of the contract being cut off in the
                    reproduction, there was also the more serious problem that
                    the copy of the May 2004 Best Chipboard contract carried a
                    2010 fax date and was exhibited in Mr Muhammad
                    Mushtaq’s AEIC in 2011<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span>. This raises the
                    possibility that the contract might not have been concluded
                    in May 2004 and was only signed and faxed to the plaintiff
                    in 2010 in contemplation of litigation. Further, it was Mr
                    Zagrodnik’s evidence that the contract with
                    Best Chipboard was modified from an earlier draft
                    produced when the particle board machinery had previously
                    been offered to Ngan Linh<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span>. In the
                    earlier draft, the reference number
                    “0222/2003” appears at the bottom of each page
                        exhibited<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span>. In the Best
                    Chipboard contract, however, this reference number appears
                    on only the first three pages, but not on the final page
                    with the contracting parties’ signatures<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span>. This
                    further indicates that the contract which was exhibited in
                    Mr Mushtaq’s AEIC might have been signed after the
                    fact, and not in May 2004. In addition, when the Best
                    Chipboard contract was exhibited in Mr Zagrodnik’s
                    affidavit in aid of the plaintiff’s application to set
                    aside the default judgment, tellingly, the final page
                    containing both parties’ signature was also not
                    exhibited. Neither Mr Zagrodnik nor Mr Mushtaq was able to
                    provide any satisfactory explanation as to these
                    irregularities when questioned in cross-examination. Mr
                    Zagrodnik speculated that the discrepancies in the dates
                    could be due to the wrong programming of the year on the
                    plaintiff’s facsimile machine. No evidence was adduced
                    to support his speculative explanation. I would not go so
                    far as to conclude that the Best Chipboard contract was
                    fabricated but, given the unsatisfactory inconsistencies on
                    the face of the contract, it suffices to say that the
                    purported contract with Best Chipboard has not been
                    proved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     It is also significant
                    that the plaintiff’s valuation of the seized machinery
                    has been inconsistent over the entire course of events. In
                    the letter sent to the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    defendant by the plaintiff’s solicitors dated
                    9 July 2004, the seized machinery was valued as
                    “in excess of US$350,000.00”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span>. By
                    17 April 2009, in the plaintiff’s Statement
                    of Claim, the “[a]ctual market value of woodworking
                    machinery and panel making equipment seized” was
                    listed as S$1,251,200.00.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     It would therefore appear
                    that the plaintiff’s case on excessive seizure is not
                    borne out by the objective evidence before the court.
                    Although the scrap metal value of the seized machinery may
                    have exceeded the judgment debt, in my view, it was not so
                    clearly disproportionate as to attract liability. As for the
                    alleged contractual value of the seized machinery, the
                    plaintiff’s evidence was unsatisfactory and
                    inconclusive at best. In any event, even if Mr Zagrodnik
                    might have managed to secure a higher price from specialty
                    buyers, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant,
                    following <em>Steel Linings</em>, need
                    not consider this on top of what would realistically be
                    achievable at a public auction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    The plaintiff’s
                    case against both the 1<sup>st</sup> and
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendants is dismissed.
                    In reaching this conclusion I have taken cognizance that the
                    practice and procedure of the Subordinate Courts bailiff for
                    WSS have since been fine-tuned. This is a step in the right
                    direction. Each bailiff is now issued with a digital camera
                    to be utilised at commercial properties, where forced entry
                    is applied, and where visual aid is deemed necessary as
                    reference. Several of the evidential difficulties in the
                    present case could have been easily resolved had this
                    practice been introduced earlier. The
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant also
                    testified that the bailiff may now appoint a valuer to
                    assess seized machinery, depending on how much has been
                    seized. Further, unlike in the present case where the
                    auctioneer had simply taken the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendant’s
                    description for use in the public advertisement, the current
                    practice is for the auctioneer to first inspect the seized
                    items, and then to describe them in the advertisement for
                    the auction. The period of time required between the
                    advertisement and auction has also been increased from two
                    to 14 days.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    In his closing
                    submissions, Mr Koh sought a cost order against
                    Mr Zagrodnik on the grounds set out in <em>DB Trustees (Hong Kong) Ltd v Consult Asia Pte
                        ltd and another appeal</em> [2010] 3 SLR 542 at
                        [29] to
                        [30], and
                        [35]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">29    From <em>Dymocks</em> and
                                <em>Globe Equities</em>, as
                            well as <em>Bobby Chin</em>, it
                            is clear that the overarching rule with regard to
                            ordering costs against a non-party in court
                            proceedings is that it must, in the circumstances of
                            the case, be <em>just</em> to
                            do so. That said, it appears to us that two
                            particular factors, among the myriad of possibly
                            relevant considerations, ought to almost always be
                            present to make it just to award costs against a
                            non-party. This does not, however, mean that they
                            are indispensable prerequisites that have to be met
                            before a costs order against a non-party can be
                            made.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30    The
                            first of the two factors is that there must be a
                                <em>close connection</em>
                            between the non-party and the proceedings. The
                            following sentence from the passage in <em>Dymocks</em> that was quoted at
                            [26] above would indicate one way in which a close
                            connection may be demonstrated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Where, however, the non-party not merely funds the
                            proceedings but substantially also controls or at
                            any rate is to benefit from them, justice will
                            ordinarily require that, if the proceedings fail, he
                            will pay the successful party's costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">One clarification that we should make is that funding
                        and control need not be conjunctive, as seems to be
                        suggested in the above sentence. It is sufficient that
                        the non-party either funds or controls legal proceedings
                        with the intention of ultimately deriving a benefit from
                        them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">35    The other factor, which is related to but distinct
                            from the first, is that the non-party must have
                            caused the incurring of costs. This is a matter of
                            causation which has often been glossed over in case
                            law. Ordinarily, it would not be just to order a
                            non-party, as opposed to a litigant, to pay costs if
                            the litigant would have incurred the legal costs
                            regardless of the non-party's role. It suffices to
                            cite the Privy Council's observation on this point
                            in <em>Dymocks</em> ([26]
                                <em>supra</em> at
                            2814):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Although the position may well be different when a
                            number of non-parties act in concert, their
                            Lordships are content to assume for the purposes of
                            this application that a non-party could not
                            ordinarily be made liable for costs if those costs
                            would in any event have been incurred even without
                            such non-party's involvement in the
                            proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102_1"></a>102    Although Mr
                    Zagrodnik’s role in the present litigation may
                        <em>prima facie</em> satisfy the
                    first factor set out above, it is not clear that he has
                    personally caused the incurring of costs even given the
                    unexplained delay prior to the commencement of proceedings.
                    In any event, the proceedings were commenced within the
                    relevant limitation period. Such an order of costs against
                    him personally seems inappropriate since the plaintiff has
                    already put up a total of S$260,000 as security for the
                    defendants’ costs pursuant to an order of court. I am
                    not convinced that it would be just to make Mr Zagrodnik
                    personally liable for costs over and above the considerable
                    sum already paid into court by the plaintiff. Accordingly, I
                    shall only order the plaintiff to bear the costs of the
                        1<sup>st</sup> and
                        2<sup>nd</sup> defendants to be taxed on
                    a standard basis if not agreed.</p>
