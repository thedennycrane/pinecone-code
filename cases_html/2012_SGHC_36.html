<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, Chia Kok Kee, appealed against
                    the decision of the Assistant Registrar (“the AR”) in Summonses No
                    1111 of 2011, 1645 of 2011 and 1658 of 2011. In Summons No 1111/2011, the
                    AR dismissed the plaintiff’s application to strike out the first, second
                    and third defendant’s defences. In the latter two summonses, <em>i.e</em>, No 1645 of 2011 and No 1658 of 2011, the AR granted
                    the applications by the defendants to strike out the plaintiff’s
                    action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff was not represented by solicitors.
                    He spoke in English during the hearing before me. After hearing the
                    parties’ arguments, I dismissed the plaintiff’s
                appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff is an investor in a hydroelectric
                    power plant joint venture in Dujiangyan, Sichuan Province, People’s
                    Republic of China (the “Chinese Investment”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The first defendant is similarly an investor in
                    the Chinese Investment. A company, HX Investment Pte Ltd (“HX”),
                    was set up to be the investment vehicle through which the parties participated
                    in the Chinese Investment. The directors and shareholders of HX comprised the
                    plaintiff’s mother and the first defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The second defendant was the auditor and
                    corporate secretary of HX. He assisted with the capitalisation of HX in its
                    early years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The third defendant was the solicitor acting for
                    the first defendant in the previous related matters, namely, Suit No 558 of
                    2005, Civil Appeal No 127 of 2005 and Originating Summons No 331 of
                    2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background to the case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       As mentioned above, the plaintiff and the first
                    defendant were both investors in the Chinese Investment and both contributed
                    monies towards the venture using HX as their investment vehicle. In 1995, an
                    oral agreement was made between them as to their respective shares but the terms
                    of this agreement were greatly disputed. The plaintiff’s version was that
                    it was agreed that he would invest $300,000 and obtain a 40% shareholding
                    together with a 10% bonus for his efforts in facilitating the investment, his
                    mother would invest $100,000 and obtain a 10% shareholding, while the first
                    defendant would invest $600,000 and obtain a 50% shareholding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The plaintiff said while his mother put in the
                    $100,000 as planned, he eventually poured in $326,467 of his monies and the
                    first defendant invested $640,000 in the Chinese Investment. The plaintiff
                    alleged however that his investment of $326,467 was left unaccounted for and
                    unrecorded in HX’s books, with the first defendant recording the total
                    investment as $831,098 instead of $1,066,467.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       He further alleged that the first defendant had
                    wrongly accused him of mishandling dividend payouts from the Chinese investment
                    and had those dividend payouts stopped in 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     According to the plaintiff, this triggered him
                    to institute action against HX in Suit 558 of 2005 to affirm his share in
                    the Chinese Investment and to obtain his share of dividends.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The plaintiff failed to prove his case in Suit
                    No 558 of 2005, where he claimed a 40% share of the Chinese Investment
                    (comprising a 30% investment by the plaintiff and 10% investment by his mother),
                    facilitation fees of 10% and a further 10% as bonus for successfully securing
                    the joint venture on the basis of the prior oral contract made
                        (see [7]). The High Court judge
                    held that the shareholdings in the Chinese Investment were 40% in favour of the
                    plaintiff and his mother and 60% in favour of the first defendant. She dismissed
                    the claims for facilitation fees and the bonus.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The appeal against this decision in Civil
                    Appeal No 127 of 2007 was dismissed with costs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The
                    plaintiff’s application for a new trial in Originating Summons No 331
                    of 2010 was similarly dismissed with costs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In Suit No 97 of 2011, in which the
                    present appeals arose, the plaintiff alleged fraud against the first defendant,
                    accusing her of deliberate omission to record in HX’s books his investment
                    monies of $326,467. As for the second defendant, the plaintiff alleged that he
                    had assisted the first defendant with the fraud because he was involved in the
                    initial capitalisation of HX when the above-mentioned sum was omitted. As regard
                    the third defendant, the plaintiff alleged that in the conduct of Suit
                    No 558 of 2005, the third defendant colluded with the first defendant and
                    other witnesses to give false evidence at the trial causing an unfavourable
                    judgment to be given against him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Simply put, the plaintiff alleged that the
                    defendants worked together to perpetrate fraud against him, to conceal the
                    incorrect accounts of HX and to deliberately omit his investment contribution in
                    HX.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In response, the defendants argued in their
                    respective defences that the plaintiff was in effect re-litigating his former
                    claims in respect of the Chinese Investment and the dividend payouts, since
                    these have been dealt with and dismissed by the High Court (see [11]) and the Court of Appeal
                        (see [12]) previously. They
                    argued that his present claims are <em>res judicata</em>
                    and/or an abuse of process of court and further, that the plaintiff’s
                    allegations of fraud were not supportable on the facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Striking out applications</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The plaintiff proceeded to take out an
                    application under Summons No 1111 of 2011 to strike out the
                    defendants’ defences pursuant to Order 18 rule 19 of the Rules of Court
                    (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed). The defendants responded by applying to
                    strike out the plaintiff’s claim: Summons No 1645 of 2011 was taken
                    out by the first and second defendants while Summons No 1658 of 2011 was
                    taken out by the third defendant for this purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The AR’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The plaintiff argued before the AR that the
                    respective defences of the defendants failed to address his fraud claim and
                    reiterated that his claim for dividends and his investment monies remain
                        unaddressed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The
                    defendants’ response in brief was that that the proceedings in Suit
                    No 97 of 2011 were a re-litigation of concluded matters and the
                    plaintiff’s claims were therefore an abuse of process.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The AR dismissed the plaintiff’s
                    application to strike out the defendants’ defences. She granted the
                    defendants’ applications to strike out the plaintiff’s claims
                    pursuant to O 18 r 19(1)(a), (b) and (d) of the Rules of
                    Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Her reasons were that if the plaintiff’s
                    claims of fraud were to be proceeded with, that would amount to a re-litigation
                    of issues tried previously in Suit No 558 of 2005 and Originating Summons
                    No 331 of 2010. Additionally, she found that in the light of the procedural
                    history of this matter, no reasonable cause of action could be sustained for the
                    plaintiff’s claim for future dividends and damages for fraud.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     She ordered costs of $25,000 on an indemnity
                    basis to be paid by the plaintiff to the first and second defendants. She made
                    the same costs order between the plaintiff and the third
                defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Parties’ arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On appeal before me, the plaintiff’s
                    argument was in essence that because of the allegedly fraudulent actions of the
                    defendants in misleading the court and thus obtaining judgment against him
                    wrongfully, he ought to be allowed now to pursue the present suit so that he
                    could obtain an account of his investment monies of $326,467 and his entitlement
                    to his share of future dividends.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The plaintiff emphasized that his investment
                    monies remained unaccounted for despite having gone through proceedings in Suit
                    No 558 of 2005 and argued that the <em>res
                        judicata</em> doctrine could not be used to uphold a judgment obtained
                    by fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The first and second defendants submitted that
                    the plaintiff’s claim amounted to an abuse of process and ought to be
                    struck out as these claims concerning the Chinese Investment and future
                    dividends have already been adjudicated previously in Suit No 558 of 2005,
                    Civil Appeal No 127 of 2007 and Originating Summons 331 of 2010. They
                    argued that the plaintiff was merely launching a collateral attack against the
                    previous decisions without having adduced any fresh evidence in
                        support.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> They also highlighted that
                    presently the plaintiff still retained a 40% share in the Chinese Investment and
                    thus could not argue that he had lost his investment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The third defendant echoed the first and
                    second defendants in arguing that the plaintiff’s claim was an abuse of
                    process as it was a re-litigation of issues which had already been dealt with in
                    the previous proceedings. He also submitted that the plaintiff’s
                    allegations against him and the other defendants did not constitute fraud at
                    all. He submitted further that the plaintiff’s claim for future dividends
                    had no basis in law as it was not due and owing to the plaintiff
                yet.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision of the court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The court may strike out a pleading under any
                    one of the four grounds under O 18 r 19 which provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    The court may at
                            any stage of the proceedings order to be struck out or amended any
                            pleading or the endorsement of any writ action, or anything in any
                            pleading or in the endorsement, on the ground that –</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    it discloses no reasonable cause of action or
                                defence, as the case may be;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    it is scandalous, frivolous or
                                vexatious;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair
                                trial of the action; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the
                                Court,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">and may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be
                        entered accordingly, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    No evidence shall be admissible on an application
                            under paragraph (1)(a).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    This Rule shall, as far as applicable, apply to an
                            originating summons as if it were a pleading.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The court’s power to strike out a
                    pleading would only be exercised in “plain and obvious” cases:
                        <em>Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners v Wee Chong Jin</em>
                    [1997] 3 SLR(R) 649 (“<em>Gabriel
                        Peter</em>”) at [18];
                        <em>The Osprey</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 1099 at
                        [6]. While the court does not seek to
                    deprive a plaintiff of his day in court, it would grant applications to strike
                    out pleadings to prevent harassment of parties or to avoid putting them to
                    expense by frivolous, vexatious or hopeless litigation and also to stop an abuse
                    of process: Singapore Court Practice 2009 (Jeffrey Pinsler gen ed) (LexisNexis,
                    2006) (“Singapore Court Practice”) at paragraph
                18/19/9.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Considering the circumstances of this case,
                    ground (d), <em>i.e.</em>, abuse of process, constituted a
                    compelling basis for striking out the plaintiff’s statement of claim. I
                    will thus discuss this ground before turning to examine grounds (a) and
                    (b).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It has been observed that the ground of abuse
                    of process in striking out applications is a rather general one which overlaps
                    with the other grounds found in O 18 r 19 in so far as they touch on
                    an improper use of the court’s process: Singapore Court Practice at
                    paragraph 18/19/14.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     This ground seeks to ensure that the
                    court’s process is used only for proper and <em>bona
                        fide</em> purposes. It will be useful to set out the observations of
                    the Court of Appeal in <em>Gabriel Peter</em> at [22] on this point:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The term, ‘abuse of the process of the Court’, in O 18
                        r 19(1)(d), has been given a wide interpretation by the courts. It
                        includes considerations of public policy and the interests of justice. This
                        term signifies that the process of the court must be used bona fide and
                        properly and must not be abused. The court will prevent the improper use of
                        its machinery. It will prevent the judicial process from being used as a
                        means of vexation and oppression in the process of litigation. The
                        categories of conduct rendering a claim frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of
                        process are not closed and will depend on all the relevant circumstances of
                        the case …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In determining whether proceedings are an
                    abuse of process, the approach to be taken is that of a “broad,
                    merits-based judgment”: <em>Johnson v </em><em>Gore Wood &amp; Co (a firm)</em> [2002] 2 AC 1.
                    This approach was followed by the Court of Appeal in <em>Lai Swee
                        Lin Linda v AG</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 565. In <em>Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 453
                        (“<em>Goh Nellie</em>”) at [53],
                    Sundaresh Menon JC explained that the court ought to:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…
                        <em>(look) at all the circumstances of the case</em>,
                        including whether the later proceedings in substance is nothing more than a
                        collateral attack upon the previous decision; whether there is fresh
                        evidence that might warrant re-litigation; whether there are bona fide
                        reasons why an issue that ought to have been raised in the earlier action
                        was not; and whether there are some other special circumstances that might
                        justify allowing the case to proceed. The absence or existence of these
                        enumerated factors (which are not intended to be exhaustive) is not
                        decisive. <em>In determining whether the ambient
                            circumstances of the case give rise to an abuse of process, the court
                            should not adopt an inflexible or unyielding attitude but should remain
                            guided by the balance to be found in the tension between the demands of
                            ensuring that a litigant who has a genuine claim is allowed to press his
                            case in court and recognising that there is a point beyond which
                            repeated litigation would be unduly oppressive to the defendant.
                            …</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(emphasis added)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Considering the procedural history of this
                    litigation and the parties against whom the plaintiff is presently proceeding,
                    this is a clear instance of an abuse of process of court. In 2005, the plaintiff
                    filed Suit No 558 of 2005 against HX, where he sought to claim a 40% share
                    of the Chinese Investment (this comprised a 30% investment by the plaintiff and
                    10% investment by his mother), 10% facilitation fees and a further 10% as bonus
                    for successfully securing the investment on the basis of a prior oral contract
                    made between the plaintiff and the first defendant. The first defendant, on
                    behalf of HX, disputed the terms of the oral contract and filed a counterclaim
                    against the plaintiff for restitution of dividend payments which the plaintiff
                    had received from the Chinese Investment previously. HX then joined the
                    plaintiff’s mother for an indemnity and/or a contribution alleging that
                    she had breached her fiduciary duties as HX’s director and had unjustly
                    enriched herself by receiving dividend payments rightfully belonging to HX. The
                    plaintiff then filed a Third Party claim against the first defendant averring
                    that if HX’s counterclaim should succeed, the first defendant would be a
                    constructive trustee of monies that she received from the Chinese Investment in
                    favour of HX. Eventually, the High Court dismissed the plaintiff’s claims.
                    The judge held that an analysis of the oral agreement showed that the
                    plaintiff’s and his mother’s shareholding in the Chinese Investment
                    and also their dividend entitlement only amounted to 40%. The first
                    defendant’s shareholding was held to be 60%. The plaintiff’s claims
                    for facilitation fees and the bonus also failed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The Court of Appeal hearing the
                    plaintiff’s appeal in Civil Appeal No 127 of 2007 dismissed it with
                    costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Dissatisfied with the outcome of the appeal,
                    the plaintiff applied again to the Court of Appeal in Originating Summons
                    No 331 of 2010 for a new trial. He argued that the judge in Suit
                    No 558 of 2005 failed to fully account for his investment contribution in
                    the Chinese investment because it was misled by the first defendant at the
                    trial. The Court of Appeal found that the plaintiff’s arguments were
                    without merit and dismissed his application with costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In the above-mentioned previous proceedings,
                    the plaintiff has repeatedly alleged that his investment contribution in the
                    Chinese Investment was unaccounted for and not recorded accurately in HX’s
                    accounts. This allegation was again reiterated in the statement of claim in the
                    present suit.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>
                    Indeed, the claims made in the plaintiff’s written submissions in
                    Originating Summons No 331 of 2010<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>
                    bore substantial resemblance to his allegations here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     It would thus appear that the plaintiff was
                    simply repackaging his claim in various forms and putting them before the court
                    time and again, in the hope that he would eventually succeed in one. This was in
                    spite of his claims having already been dismissed previously by the court on
                    several occasions. His present claim took the form of fraud but, as the
                    defendants rightly pointed out, the essence of his complaint remained the same:
                    that his investment monies of $326,467 be accounted for and be recognised
                    accordingly in HX’s books. Re-litigating his claim repeatedly despite the
                    judicial determinations of its lack of merit was a clear abuse of process of
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Additionally, I agreed with the defendants
                    that no fresh evidence has been placed before the court in the present
                    proceedings. The two points that the plaintiff raised, <em>i.e.</em>, that he had received financial statements from accountants
                    showing HX was a dormant company contrary to what the first defendant had
                    allegedly testified to in Suit No 558 of 2005 and that HX’s company
                    secretary was charged by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore for aiding
                    tax evasion, did not assist him in his allegations of fraud against the
                    defendants. On his first point, this was not new evidence which could not have
                    been discovered with reasonable diligence in the previous proceedings and, on
                    his second point, the company secretary was in fact charged for aiding another
                    company evade tax and that was wholly unconnected to HX and therefore irrelevant
                    to the present proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The present proceedings amounted to a
                    collateral attack on the earlier decisions given by the High Court and the Court
                    of Appeal. By alleging in this action that the High Court judge was misled by
                    the defendants’ fraud into giving judgment when there was no apparent
                    factual justification for this serious allegation constituted a clear abuse of
                    the judicial process. Indeed, the learned authors in Spencer Bower and Handley,
                        <em>Res Judicata</em> (Lexis Nexis,
                        4<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2009) (“<em>Res
                        Judicata</em>”) at paragraph 26.16(a) recognised that these
                    were strong grounds for finding abuse, <em>i.e.</em>, where
                    a party who was unsuccessful in earlier proceedings in which he had a proper
                    opportunity of being heard now launches a collateral attack on the earlier
                    decision by instituting a new action in the absence of fresh
                evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The learned authors in <em>Res
                        Judicata</em> at paragraph 26.16(h) also observed that an abuse of
                    process may also be found where a claimant dissatisfied with the result in the
                    original proceedings seeks further relief or seeks it from a different
                    defendant. They cite the case of <em>Rippon v Chilcotin
                        </em><em>Pty Ltd</em> (2001) 53 NSWLR 198
                        (“<em>Rippon</em>”) for this proposition.
                    In that case, a purchaser sued a vendor for breach of warranties of the accounts
                    annexed to the contract and misrepresentation to the same effect. As the
                    purchaser had only relied on the warranties, he failed in his claim for
                    misrepresentation. The purchaser then sued the accountants who drew up the
                    accounts for misrepresentation seeking a different finding on reliance on the
                    misrepresentation above. While the facts of the present case do not strictly
                    mirror those of <em>Rippon</em>, the essence of the abuse
                    is the same. The plaintiff sued the accountant of HX and the counsel who
                    represented the first defendant in the previous actions, bringing them in as the
                    second and third defendants here respectively. His allegations against them
                    were, respectively, assisting with the first defendant’s fraud and
                    colluding with the witnesses, causing the plaintiff to fail in his legal action
                    and depriving him of an account of his share in the Chinese Investment. Bringing
                    in both these parties, who have little to do with the underlying dispute, to
                    answer to claims which have no factual foundation constituted an improper use of
                    the court’s adjudicatory process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     As regard the first defendant, it was clear
                    that the present proceedings against her were an abuse of process. The learned
                    authors in <em>Res Judicata</em> at paragraph 26.15 noted
                    that it was highly likely that abuse would be found where a subsequent action
                    was instituted against the original defendant. Here, the first defendant was
                    brought in as a third party in the counterclaim in Suit No 558 of 2005 and
                    was the respondent in both Civil Appeal No 127 of 2007 and Originating
                    Summons No 331 of 2010. In the present action, as in all the previous
                    actions, the allegations made against her remained the same and involved the
                    same factual matrix. She was therefore made to answer to similar allegations on
                    various occasions even though the original dispute had already been adjudicated
                    upon. This was a wholly improper use of the court’s process and it would
                    certainly be unfair to the first defendant to allow the oppression to
                    continue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The rationale of the abuse of process doctrine
                    is to prevent a party who could have litigated an issue in previous proceedings
                    but did not do so from initiating a new action to determine that issue where
                    there are no clear and justifiable reasons for allowing this: <em>Henderson v Henderson</em> [1843-1860] All ER Rep 78;
                        <em>Goh Nellie</em> from [51]. Therefore, considering all the circumstances of this case
                    as required by the broad merits-based test, the plaintiff’s present action
                    was patently an abuse of process and there could be no justification to allow
                    him to continue with his claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     While it is sufficient to establish just one
                    out of the four grounds under O 18 r 19 to successfully strike out a
                    pleading, these grounds are in reality not mutually exclusive. I now proceed to
                    discuss briefly grounds (a) and (b) of O 18 r 19 as
                    alternative bases for striking out the plaintiff’s statement of
                    claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Ground (b) of O 18 r 19
                    addresses instances where parties are not <em>bona
                        fide</em> in bringing an action but merely bring it to annoy or
                    embarrass their opponent: <em>Goh Koon Suan v Heng Gek
                        Kiau</em> [1990] SLR 1251. It has been noted that a clear
                    example of a “frivolous or vexatious” case would be one where a
                    person is unjustifiably made a party to an action: Singapore Court Practice at
                    paragraph 18/19/12. The plaintiff’s act of bringing in the second and
                    third defendants was such an instance. As mentioned above at <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a>, both these parties were drawn into the
                    present suit even though they had nothing to do with the underlying dispute and
                    this was made worse by the fact that there was no real evidence supporting the
                    plaintiff’s claim of fraud against them. As for the first defendant, by
                    instituting fresh proceedings against her without reasonable basis on the facts
                    and effectively disregarding previous court decisions, the plaintiff’s
                    conduct was clearly vexatious.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In ground (a) of O 18 r 19, a
                    ‘reasonable cause of action’ refers to one which has some chance of
                    success when only the allegations in the pleading are considered: <em>Drummond-Jackson v British Medical Association</em> [1970]
                    1 All ER 1094. If the alleged cause of action is bound to fail on
                    examining the allegations, the court ought to exercise its power to strike it
                    out: Singapore Court Practice at paragraph 18/19/1. The courts require that it
                    be “patently clear” that there is no reasonable cause of action or
                    defence: Singapore Court Practice at paragraph 18/19/9.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     It was difficult to see how the
                    plaintiff’s claim of fraud against the defendants amounted to a
                    ‘reasonable cause of action’ given the facts set out in his
                    statement of claim. An allegation of fraud is a very serious one and the gravity
                    of such allegation requires more evidence to establish it despite the standard
                    of proof in civil proceedings still being one of a balance of probabilities:
                        <em>Chua Kwee Chen and others (as Westlake Eating House) and
                        another v Koh Choon Chin</em> [2006] 3 SLR(R) 469 at
                        [22].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The plaintiff argued that the first defendant
                    deliberately omitted his investment monies from HX’s books and obscured
                    the parties’ true contributions during the trial process, thus
                    perpetrating the fraud. However, on an examination of the facts set out in
                    paragraphs [12]-[14] of his statement of claim,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> it is clear that the plaintiff has not discharged
                    the high standard of proof required to establish a claim for fraud. The
                    plaintiff simply made bare allegations against the first defendant which could
                    find no support factually, given the High Court judge’s findings in Suit
                    No 558 of 2005 regarding the parties’ agreement on their shares in
                    the Chinese Investment and the dividends. The plaintiff’s claims against
                    the second and third defendants for allegedly assisting and colluding with the
                    first defendant to perpetrate fraud were similarly without basis. In particular,
                    the third defendant had simply defended his client’s rights as counsel for
                    the first defendant in the conduct of the previous proceedings. Just because
                    witnesses there testified against the plaintiff did not constitute grounds for
                    finding collusion between them and the third defendant. These were totally
                    unjustifiable allegations by the plaintiff. There was thus no sustainable cause
                    of action in fraud against the defendants on the face of the facts
                here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Further, the plaintiff’s claim for
                    future dividends was without legal basis. As the third defendant rightly pointed
                    out, these future dividends have not accrued yet nor have they been paid out in
                    the Chinese Investment itself. As such, the obligation to pay them to the
                    plaintiff did not arise at this point in time. It follows that the
                    plaintiff’s appeals against the striking out of his claims must be
                    dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     On the other hand, an examination of the
                    defences put forth by the first, second and third defendants showed that they
                    did not fall within any of the four available grounds for striking out under
                    O 18 r 19. There were good reasons for them to plead that the
                    plaintiff was re-litigating his claims and abusing the court’s process in
                    the light of the history of the proceedings set out above. I therefore dismissed
                    the plaintiff’s appeal against the AR’s decision not to strike out
                    the defendants’ defences.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     For the reasons set out above, I dismissed all
                    three appeals from the AR’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     On the issue of costs, the third defendant
                    informed me that an offer to settle dated 18 October 2011 was served on the
                    plaintiff some weeks before the hearing. The terms of the offer to settle were
                    that each party would bear its own costs if the plaintiff withdrew the appeals
                    before the hearing of the appeals. Before me, the third defendant suggested that
                    costs be fixed at $30,000 since the AR ordered $25,000 for each set of
                    defendants below. The plaintiff submitted that this was way too high. The first
                    and second defendants left the question of costs to the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The costs orders made by the AR were in
                    respect of the dismissal of the entire action. For these appeals before me,
                    which were quite straightforward and took slightly more than one and a half
                    hours due largely to the fact that the plaintiff was not represented by
                    solicitors, I ordered costs of $1,500 to be paid by the plaintiff to the first
                    and second defendants and another $1,500 to be paid by the plaintiff to the
                    third defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The plaintiff has filed an appeal to the Court
                    of Appeal against my decision in respect of the dismissal of his appeals in the
                    defendants’ two striking out applications (see [16]).</p>
