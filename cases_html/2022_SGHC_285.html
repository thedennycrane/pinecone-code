Suit 327 was dismissed owing to the plaintiffs’ absence at trial, which was scheduled to be heard over two days, commencing 11 October 2022. Not only were the plaintiffs absent without any prior notice to the court, their counsel, Mr Mohan Singh s/o Gurdial Singh (“Mr Singh”) was absent as well. I proceeded to dismiss the claim after hearing brief submissions from the defendant’s counsel, Mr Andrew Hanam (“Mr Hanam”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Medical certificates were subsequently produced on behalf of the first plaintiff (“Mr Rajoo”) and Mr Singh purporting to explain their absence.

Only Mr Hanam and the defendant were present in court at 10.00am, the scheduled time for the trial to commence. At 10.12am, as neither the plaintiffs nor Mr Singh were present, my Court Manager took the initiative to call up Mr Singh on his handphone to inquire on his whereabouts. Mr Singh informed her that he was unwell and would not be attending court. He mentioned that he had already informed his office and arrangements would be made for someone from his office to attend court. He requested my Court Manager to call his office. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9   At 10.13am, my Court Manager called Mr Singh’s office and spoke to a male staff member. He declined to identify himself. He stated that the office would arrange for someone to attend court. The said staff member said that he would return the call to my Court Manager within ten minutes. He did not do so, and hence at 10.23am, my Court Manager called the office again. She was informed by the same male staff member that the office was making some arrangements and a representative from the office would attend court at 10.45am. She was also told that the plaintiffs would not be attending court as Mr Rajoo had just been discharged from hospital at 5.30am that morning and Mdm Devi was not well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 At 10.30am, I commenced the hearing in open court. Mr Hanam stated that he had not been previously informed by Mr Singh that neither he nor his clients would not be attending court.  In the premises, Mr Hanam submitted for the claim to be dismissed. He pointed out that he had also not received any of the trial bundles and submitted that the plaintiffs had intentionally delayed matters from the start of the proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 I stood the matter down to 10.45am in view of the indication from Mr Singh’s office that someone would be present in court by then to mention the case on his behalf. When I resumed the hearing at 10.46am, there was no sign of anyone from Mr Singh’s office in court. There was also no further communication from Mr Singh’s office. It should be emphasised that on each occasion when my Court Manager communicated with either Mr Singh or his office, this was done entirely at her initiative. No prior notice whatsoever had been given to the court of Mr Singh’s or the plaintiffs’ non-attendance at trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Mr Hanam again asked for the claim to be dismissed and I so ordered, pursuant to O 35 r 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed). After ordering costs of the action to the defendant, the hearing in open court was adjourned at 11.02am. No further communication was received by my Court Manager from Mr Singh or his office that day.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Filing of SUM 3754 – Mr Rajoo’s affidavit</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 After the claim was dismissed, SUM 3754 was filed in the eLitigation system that very evening to set aside the judgment dismissing the plaintiffs’ claim. In support of the application, Mr Rajoo affirmed an affidavit dated 11 October 2022 (“Mr Rajoo’s affidavit”) seeking, on behalf of the plaintiffs, to set aside the dismissal of the claim on “exceptional grounds mainly due to ill health” and also to “explain [their] Counsel’s non-presence on account of his ill health too [that] morning such that alternate arrangements for another Counsel was impeded due to circumstances beyond his control”.

Mr Rajoo explained that he was hospitalised for two days at KTPH after a fainting spell on 8 October 2022.

The examining physician at TTSH gave him medical leave for three days from 11 to 13 October 2022 (inclusive). Mr Rajoo said that because he was too exhausted after being discharged, he went to sleep and was thus not present in court on 11 October 2022.

</div> This was not completely accurate since the court had sought to elicit information from both Mr Singh and a staff member from his office, but had not been afforded any supporting documentation to justify their non-attendance at trial.

I noted above (at [18]) that Mr Singh filed written submissions for SUM 3754 albeit at the eleventh hour on 27 October 2022. There was no prior indication that he would not be appearing at the hearing to make his oral submissions. Only Mr Hanam had logged in prior to the scheduled hearing time of 2.30pm. By 2.36pm, Mr Singh had still not logged in for the Zoom hearing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Once again, my Court Manager had to call Mr Singh on his handphone to ascertain his whereabouts. The call went unanswered. She then called Mr Singh’s office and spoke to one Mr Roy at 2.42pm, who informed her that Mr Singh was engaged with another matter in the State Courts and another solicitor, one Mr Lawrence Tan (“Mr Tan”) would mention SUM 3754 on Mr Singh’s behalf. I pause to note that this was an unusual course to adopt, as it is settled practice that in the event of any conflict in counsel’s hearing schedules, Supreme Court hearings would take precedence over State Courts hearings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Mr Tan did not log in for the Zoom hearing until about 2.45pm. When I queried him as to why Mr Singh was not able to attend the hearing, he stated that Mr Singh was attending another State Courts hearing.

First, he submitted that the plaintiffs’ absence at trial was on account of their being elderly and sick. They had been hospitalised and were on medical leave. He pointed out that Mr Singh had also been given a medical certificate. Second, he submitted that there was no undue delay in making the application in SUM 3754 and no prejudice would be suffered by the defendant if the claim were to be reinstated since the Flat had already been sold. Third, he argued that there were triable issues and merits to the application. He did not specify what those merits were, but simply referred the court to paras 15 and 16 of Mr Rajoo’s affidavit which referenced the grant of the injunction as being conclusive of the merits of the plaintiffs’ case (see [17]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In response, Mr Hanam pointed to the Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">Su</span><span class="font-italic"> Sh-Hsyu v Wee Yue Chew</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 673 at [44] and submitted that the reason for a party’s absence is the predominant consideration for the court in determining whether a judgment entered at trial in the absence of that party ought to be set aside. Further, among other relevant factors, the court would consider whether the applicant in a setting aside application would have a real prospect of success at trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Mr Hanam submitted that the plaintiffs had not addressed anything on affidavit or in their written submissions to show that there were merits to their claim.

</div> Evidently, he was not assessed by the examining doctors to have been so unwell as to be <span class="font-italic">unable</span> to attend court. This would have sufficed to indicate that no good reasons had been shown, but I would go further to note that Mr Rajoo had obviously taken pains to highlight to the examining physician at Woodlands Polyclinic that he was “[d]ue for court hearing on 11-12 Oct 2022”, as recorded in the referral note to the TTSH Emergency Department.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The fact that the TTSH medical certificate covered a shorter duration of three days (11 to 13 October 2022) as compared to the seven-day duration in the KTPH medical certificate (8 to 14 October 2022) was significant. The three-day medical certificate issued by TTSH was telling; it served no purpose at all since the three-day duration was wholly subsumed under the existing seven-day medical certificate issued by KTPH. More importantly, despite the referring physician from Woodlands Polyclinic having scrupulously noted Mr Rajoo’s concern that he was “due for court hearing on 11-12 Oct 2022”, neither Woodlands Polyclinic nor TTSH issued him any medical certificate excusing him from court attendance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In addition, I found it rather curious that although Mr Rajoo’s residential address was stated in the polyclinic and hospital records as 645 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6, #08-4963, Singapore 560645, he chose to travel a not inconsiderable distance to Woodlands Polyclinic on 10 October 2022, reportedly over a bout of vomiting. He did not explain why there was any “compelling” reason for him to do so, when he could conceivably have returned to KTPH or sought treatment at another polyclinic or a general practitioner nearer his residence. He merely asserted that as he had vomited and was “unwell”, he was compelled to visit Woodlands Polyclinic. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 It would appear that Mr Rajoo was more intent on either getting himself hospitalised for an extended spell or seeking to obtain medical leave for a longer duration and to be specifically excused from having to attend court. As it transpired, none of these materialised. In the premises, I rejected Mr Rajoo’s explanations for his absence at trial. I placed no weight on his medical certificates. They clearly did not operate to excuse him from court attendance and were obtained under questionable circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Mdm Devi’s reasons for absence at trial</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Next, I consider the reasons for Mdm Devi’s absence.

</div> The note was addressed to “whomever it may concern”, stating that Mdm Devi had “a right knee osteoarthritis flare resulting in significant knee pain and difficulty in walking” and “seek[ing] … understanding on this matter”. It was not clear in what capacity the said “Kok Kuan TEO” had issued the note, or whether he or she was a registered medical practitioner, let alone whether Mdm Devi had even sought medical attention at the Woodlands Polyclinic on or around 10 October 2022. As such, I placed no weight on the note.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Regrettably, as noted above (at [21]), Mr Singh chose to repeat Mr Rajoo’s claim that Mdm Devi was on <span class="font-italic">medical leave</span> in his written submissions for SUM 3754.

Mr Singh did not have the basic courtesy to inform Mr Hanam and the court beforehand that he was unwell (assuming for the moment that he was indeed unwell). Instead, he was content to wait for the court to contact him to ascertain why he was not present at the scheduled hearing time. His bland response was that he had already informed his office that he was unwell and would not be attending court. His office had made no apparent effort to apprise Mr Hanam or the court of this at any point (see [8] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In any case, Mr Singh produced no basis other than his own say-so for the court to excuse him from attending the trial. Mr Singh did not deem it fit to affirm an affidavit to explain his absence and tender his own medical certificate.

</div> I placed no weight on the said medical certificate. Not unlike Mr Rajoo’s two medical certificates, Mr Singh’s medical certificate stated in no uncertain terms that it was “not valid for absence from court or other judicial proceedings”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Supreme Court Practice Directions and counsel’s professional duties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In seeking to rely on the various medical certificates to excuse himself and Mr Rajoo from attending court on 11 October 2022, Mr Singh had failed to comply with the Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021 ("Supreme Court PD”), in particular Practice Direction No 89 – “Absence from Court on medical grounds”, which requires that <span class="font-italic">original</span> medical certificates must be tendered to explain a party or counsel’s absence from court. In addition, the medical certificate(s) must contain a statement to the effect that the person in question is “unfit to attend Court”. The medical certificate must therefore expressly state that it is <span class="font-italic">valid for absence</span> from court proceedings. It must also contain a diagnosis of the person concerned (unless the diagnosis cannot or should not normally be disclosed). None of these requirements were met in the present case. Mr Singh’s complete and utter disregard of the Practice Directions meant that the medical certificates were of absolutely no assistance to him or his clients. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I have alluded to the dubious circumstances under which Mr Rajoo’s medical certificates were obtained. It is well-established that the courts will insist on a strict approach towards both the parties’ and counsel’s absence from court proceedings. In this connection, the observations by Steven Chong J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Ching Chew Weng Paul, deceased</span><span class="font-italic">, and others v Ching Pui Sim and others</span> [2011] 3 SLR 869 at [14] as cited by Mr Hanam are apposite – absence from trial due to personal reasons or difficulties would not necessarily prevent the court from finding that the absence was nonetheless deliberate.

</div> I was not persuaded that this would suffice by itself to demonstrate that the claim had a real prospect of success. In any event, the court had ordered a payment into court of a reduced portion of the disputed sum of $300,000 and this order was made at the preliminary stage of the proceedings, well before the parties’ affidavits of evidence-in-chief and any supporting documents had been filed for the purpose of the trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The Statement of Claim suggests that the claim was premised on promissory estoppel and not proprietary estoppel, contrary to what the plaintiffs asserted in their Reply and Defence to Counterclaim and Opening Statement for the trial.

</div> The plaintiffs did not put forth any objective evidence in support of their allegations that representations were made by the defendant to permit them to occupy the Flat during their lifetime. The plaintiffs also did not adduce any reliable evidence to show that the fair market value of the Flat was allegedly $650,000 in 2009 when the Flat was sold to the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The plaintiffs may have been named as permitted occupiers in the Flat but this would not necessarily demonstrate that the defendant must have made representations to the effect that they could stay in the Flat during their lifetime. Their status as permitted occupiers did not confer on them any proprietary interest as claimed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Further, there was no objective evidence of any reliance or detriment suffered by the plaintiffs. Despite their claims of having paid for renovation and maintenance expenses for the Flat,

</div>
</div> there was no evidence of any invoices or receipts for such payments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 As for the plaintiffs’ claim for $60,000 being the repayment of moneys extended to the defendant to help clear her debts prior to her purchase of the Flat in 2009, it was pleaded by the defendant in para 4(d) of the Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No 1) that the claim is time-barred under the Limitation Act 1959 (2020 Rev Ed) ("Limitation Act"). The plaintiffs did not put forth any response to this in their Reply and Defence to Counterclaim. It is manifestly clear that this claim is time-barred under s 6 of the Limitation Act after 2015.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In all the circumstances, I found that the plaintiffs did not have a good arguable case with a real prospect of success. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 3: Whether the plaintiffs had applied promptly to set aside the judgment dismissing their claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 There was no question that the plaintiffs had applied promptly to set aside the dismissal of their claim. Perhaps the plaintiffs had found themselves in a Catch-22 situation of having to file the setting aside application expeditiously in spite of their alleged ailments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 What was highly telling however was that despite their alleged poor state of health, both Mr Singh and Mr Rajoo were well enough to arrange to prepare the affidavit for the application on the very same day that the claim was dismissed, and have it affirmed and filed with supporting documents annexed. All this was done barely 12 hours after I dismissed the claim. This greatly undermined their claims that they were so ill that they could not even be present in court for the trial. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 This was a highly unusual case where the plaintiffs must have decided that they would not attend court on the scheduled trial date. Mr Singh’s absence at the trial was also questionable. No effort whatsoever was made to inform Mr Hanam or the court beforehand, or to arrange for another solicitor to mention the matter on his behalf and to explain the circumstances for his and his clients’ absence at trial. I did not accept that the circumstances were beyond the plaintiffs’ or Mr Singh’s control, or that they were in such poor health or incapacitated to a point that they could not attend the trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The only inference I could draw was that the plaintiffs, for reasons best known to themselves, did not wish to be present for the trial. They were not serious about prosecuting their claim, and must have known that the claim was unmeritorious. It was clear that they had deliberately absented themselves to cause further inconvenience to the defendant, add to the defendant’s legal costs and frustrate and protract the proceedings. This was a flagrant abuse of the court’s process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 For the reasons stated above at [42]–[43], this might have been a suitable case to consider initiating disciplinary action for Mr Singh’s possible breaches of the PCR 2015. I would however stop short of doing so. I take the opportunity instead to sound a warning that such conduct is unacceptable and unbecoming of an officer of the court. Should the court encounter future similar infractions whether from Mr Singh or other like-minded counsel, these may be met with grave consequences.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I found that no good reasons had been furnished for both Mr Singh’s and his clients’ absence. The plaintiffs had failed to show that they had an arguable case with a real prospect of success at trial. Accordingly, I saw no basis to set aside my decision to dismiss the claim in their absence. I awarded the costs of the application in SUM 3754 to the defendant fixed at $4,000, inclusive of disbursements. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">See Kee Oon<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mohan Singh s/o Gurdial Singh (S K Kumar Law Practice LLP) and Tan Wei Chieh (Chen Weijie) (Prestige Legal LLP) (instructed)</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">for the plaintiffs;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Andrew John Hanam (Andrew LLC) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
